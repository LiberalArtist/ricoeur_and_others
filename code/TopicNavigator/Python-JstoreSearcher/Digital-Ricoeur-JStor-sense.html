  Abstract: In
                  The Public and Its Problems(1927), John Dewey defended the ideal of strong publics. Challenging Walter Lippmann’s pessimistic assessment that modern states were far too complex to be managed by their citizens, Dewey offered a fluid understanding of democracy and the state that highlighted the critical role of robust “public interests.”¹ Yet, as his title suggests, Dewey’s optimism was tempered by a sense that the modern public was in trouble. In the context of expanding technology, bureaucratization, and a dehumanizing standardization of action and association, the public, he argued, was fragmenting. The problem for Dewey, as Robert Asen argues,<br>

  Abstract: In this famous passage from
                  The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith employs a powerfully evocative metaphor that bursts through his prose to escape the confines of political economy and obtain the status of a common sense. Resonating across national contexts and historical eras, the metaphor of the “invisible hand” has spoken to many people as an intuitive description of how the world works and an unparalleled prescription for ethical individual action. The invisible hand artfully captures the spirit of a market ethics by insisting that in working for oneself, an individual works for the good of others. The invisible hand<br>

  Author(s) Alison James<br>
  Abstract: The purpose of this article is to sketch the development of the concept of sacrifice in René Girard’s thinking, as it developed especially in discussion with Innsbruck systematic theologian and founder of the School of Dramatic Theology there, Raymund Schwager, to briefly reflect on this development in the light of Bernard Lonergan’s theological method (this will show that we are dealing with “religious conversion” understood in a certain sense), and to make some suggestions as to how this can ground interreligious dialogue and provide it with additional significance.<br>

  Author(s) Ell Theodore<br>
  Abstract: In everyday language, the term “paradox” is used to refer to any claim or argument that contrasts with what is usually considered obvious. In a more specific and philosophical sense, a paradox is a claim or an argument that develops from apparently true premises and leads to a seemingly absurd (self-contradictory or logically unacceptable) conclusion. The term is also sometimes used in the context of religion to refer to a form of fideism professing a religious belief even when, or precisely because, that belief defies reason (as paradigmatically expressed by Tertullian’s
                  Credo quia absurdum). And then there is at least<br>

  Book Title: Intimate Domain-Desire, Trauma, and Mimetic Theory<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Reineke Martha J.<br>
  Abstract: For René Girard, human life revolves around mimetic desire, which regularly manifests itself in acquisitive rivalry when we find ourselves wanting an object because another wants it also. Noting that mimetic desire is driven by our sense of inadequacy or insufficiency, Girard arrives at a profound insight: our desire is not fundamentally directed toward the other's object but toward the other's being. We perceive the other to possess a fullness of being we lack. Mimetic desire devolves into violence when our quest after the being of the other remains unfulfilled. So pervasive is mimetic desire that Girard describes it as an ontological illness. In
      Intimate Domain,Reineke argues that it is necessary to augment Girard's mimetic theory if we are to give a full account of the sickness he describes. Attending to familial dynamics Girard has overlooked and reclaiming aspects of his early theorizing on sensory experience, Reineke utilizes psychoanalytic theory to place Girard's mimetic theory on firmer ground. Drawing on three exemplary narratives-Proust'sIn Search of Lost Time,Sophocles'sAntigone,and Julia Kristeva'sThe Old Man and the Wolves-the author explores familial relationships. Together, these narratives demonstrate that a corporeal hermeneutics founded in psychoanalytic theory can usefully augment Girard's insights, thereby ensuring that mimetic theory remains a definitive resource for all who seek to understand humanity's ontological illness and identify a potential cure.<br>

  Abstract: The intifada dramatically influenced the Palestinian symbol system. Writing in 1989, Rashid Khalidi observed that the intifada had created a “strong sense of national unity, of loyalty to a unified set of symbols and concepts and of mutual independence which were lacking in 1967.”¹ Without question, the engine of Palestinian symbol transformation was the intifada. The intifada, in turn, helped make possible the Oslo agreement, which led to Yasir Arafat’s return to Gaza in July 1994 and the creation of the Palestinian National Authority.<br>

  Book Title: For René Girard-Essays in Friendship and in Truth<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Williams James G.<br>
  Abstract: In his explorations of the relations between the sacred and violence, René Girard has hit upon the origin of culture-the way culture began, the way it continues to organize itself. The way communities of human beings structure themselves in a manner that is different from that of other species on the planet.Like Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Émile Durkheim, Martin Buber, or others who have changed the way we think in the humanities or in the human sciences, Girard has put forth a set of ideas that have altered our perceptions of the world in which we function. We will never be able to think the same way again about mimetic desire, about the scapegoat mechanism, and about the role of Jewish and Christian scripture in explaining sacrifice, violence, and the crises from which our culture has been born.The contributions fall into roughly four areas of interpretive work: religion and religious study; literary study; the philosophy of social science; and psychological studies.The essays presented here are offered as "essays" in the older French sense of attempts (essayer) or trials of ideas, as indeed Girard has tried out ideas with us. With a conscious echo of Montaigne, then, this hommage volume is titled

Liszt’s audience consists primarily of famous composers (Paganini, Rossini) and authors (Sand, Hugo, de Musset); he also has a silent auditor in a large bust of Beethoven that sits in the window at the upper right. The bust is prominent enough to suggest that it is Beethoven’s music that Liszt is playing, a suggestion that also makes good historical sense. If so, the picture is also a puzzle.

  Abstract: While they were held in detention facilities or treatment centers, most teenagers expressed an inflated sense of agency. Relying on the cultural narrative of the “American Dream,” they believed in their ability to desist from crime, even if the odds were stacked against them. Criminologists often overlook the role agency plays in the desistance process. Structural conditions can be measured and quantified reliably. Operationalizing agency is more difficult. Direct observations of criminal acts are ethically dubious. Even if researchers were able to witness a crime in the making, it would be impossible to generalize from isolated instances.

And few things seem as unnatural as their gradual disappearance in the present, especially from the pressures exerted by globalizing English.

  Book Title: Carnal Thoughts-Embodiment and Moving Image Culture<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Sobchack Vivian<br>
  Abstract: In these innovative essays, Vivian Sobchack considers the key role our bodies play in making sense of today's image-saturated culture. Emphasizing our corporeal rather than our intellectual engagements with film and other media,
      Carnal Thoughtsshows how our experience always emerges through our senses and how our bodies are not just visible objects but also sense-making, visual subjects. Sobchack draws on both phenomenological philosophy and a broad range of popular sources to explore bodily experience in contemporary, moving-image culture. She examines how, through the conflation of cinema and surgery, we've all "had our eyes done"; why we are "moved" by the movies; and the different ways in which we inhabit photographic, cinematic, and electronic space.Carnal Thoughtsprovides a lively and engaging challenge to the mind/body split by demonstrating that the process of "making sense" requires an irreducible collaboration between our thoughts and our senses.<br>

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity. Joining the recent call to theological interpretation of Scripture, Putman provides a constructive model that forwards a descriptive and normative pattern for reading Scripture and theological tradition together.<br>

  Book Title: Writing Theologically-  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Barreto Eric D.<br>
  Abstract: Of course, by writing we refer to the kinds of reflections, essays, and exams students will have to complete in the seminary classroom. But writing also encompasses the many modes of communication and self-discovery that creative expression can unlock. Writing Theologically introduces writing not just as an academic exercise but as a way for students to communicate the good news in rapidly changing contexts, as well as to discover and craft their own sense of vocation and identity. Most important will be guiding students to how they might begin to claim and hone a distinctive theological voice that is particularly attuned to the contexts of writer and audience alike. In a collection of brief, readable essays, this volume, edited by Eric D. Barreto, emphasizes the vital skills, practices, and values involved in writing theologically. That is, how might students prepare themselves to communicate effectively and creatively, clearly and beautifully, the insights they gather during their time in seminary? Each contribution includes practical advice about best practices in writing theologically; however, the book also stresses why writing is vital in the self-understanding of the minister, as well as her or his public communication of the good news.<br>

  Abstract: Milton’s sonnets are political not because they praise and advise political figures, comment on historical events, or surreptitiously air concerns about aristocratic patronage, but because they strike at the heart of the Petrarchan tradition’s devotion to an absolutist theory of power predicated on the temporal deferral of fulfillment. They accomplish this revolt by insisting that sonnets contain events, instead of simply reporting on the already past happening of those events or advocating for or prophesying their future occurrence. In this sense, Milton’s sonnets attempt to treat events as free happenings in the present, as opposed to an impotent retrospective postulation<br>

  Book Title: To Make the Hands Impure: Art, Ethical Adventure, the Difficult and the Holy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): NEWTON ADAM ZACHARY<br>
  Abstract: How can cradling, handling, or rubbing a text be said, ethically, to have made something happen? What, as readers or interpreters, may come off in our hands in as we maculate or mark the books we read? For Adam Zachary Newton, reading is anembodied practice wherein "ethics" becomes a matter of tact in the doubled sense of touch and regard. With the image of the book lying in the hands of its readers as insistent refrain, To Make the Hands Impure cuts a provocative cross-disciplinary swath through classical Jewish texts, modern Jewish philosophy, film and performance, literature, translation, and the material text. Newton explores the ethics of reading through a range of texts, from the Talmud and Midrash to Conrad's Nostromo and Pascal's Le Memorial, from works by Henry Darger and Martin Scorsese to the National September 11 Memorial and a synagogue in Havana, Cuba. In separate chapters, he conducts masterly treatments of Emmanuel Levinas, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Stanley Cavell by emphasizing their performances as readers a trebled orientation to Talmud, novel, and theater/film. To Make the Hands Impure stages the encounter of literary experience and scriptural traditions he difficult and the holy through an ambitious, singular, and innovative approach marked in equal measure by erudition and imaginative daring.<br>

  Abstract: This is a book about how scholars make sense of what we study.¹ As a field of research whose primary focus is a fixed and finite set of data, biblical studies innovates less by discovering new objects of study than by finding fresh ways—or refining old ways—to examine its basic subject matter. Scholars investigate by designing categories of analysis and interpretation to achieve understanding. Regular assessment of the value of these categories—however recondite it may appear to a field’s outsiders—provokes scholarly self-consciousness and thereby strengthens the quality of research and advances knowledge.<br>

Even historical sources apparently created “on the spot” are the creations of memory; a general’s account, a newspaper report, and a descriptive letter are all created after the events that they recount. Memory is thus inherent in any historical study Though there is certainly a difference between a memory of five hours and a memory of fifty years, it is not always clear how this difference is manifest; the<br>

I hope to show that the double bind, the claim that no matter what one does one cannot win, not only plays a role in determining the development of schizophrenia, as Bateson maintains, but is intrinsic to the emergence of the moral life.¹ I view the double bind as a prior condition for deciding that a contemplated act is evil and for the sense of obligation that enters into the avoidance or pursuit of ends that are deemed to be<br>

  Abstract: The problem of thinking is a problem of sublimation. To have language, meaning, and thereby religion, science, culture, and art, there must be sublimation in a broad sense. This book has traced some of the intricacies of sublimation through psychoanalytic theory as it impresses upon theology. Sublimation means that meaning is not direct and unmediated but consists of a detour. At the same time, my readings of theology, continental philosophy, and psychoanalytic theory suggest that sublimation is not an elevation above a material reality. In chapter 1, I appealed to Deleuze to question the two-level model of reality that sublimation<br>

  Abstract: As it has done all along, the sensuous icon of Mary Magdalene flashes through popular culture, but with a curious difference now. The saint has found her voice. The recovery of certain ancient texts over the past century has made her speech possible. Some of these, such as the
                     Pistis Sophia,a lengthy third-century gnostic document, unfold such arcane mystical allegories that the speeches seem to lack all resonance with the familiar. But then an angry outburst disrupts the smooth psychopompic surface of the text. It brings us back to an all-too-familiar present—in some sense, to our own.<br>

Before examining some of their appropriations in the North American context in more detail, it might be worthwhile to consider this apologetic or quasi-apologetic character more fully. Are these projects apologetic ones? Do they “defend” the divine and argue on behalf of faith? Certainly their arguments for God are not arguments in the traditional (modern) sense.

  Book Title: A Scholar's Tale: Intellectual Journey of a Displaced Child of Europe-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): HARTMAN GEOFFREY<br>
  Abstract: For more than fifty years, Geoffrey Hartman has been a pivotal figure in the humanities. In his first book, in 1954, he helped establish the study of Romanticism as key to the problems of modernity. Later, his writings were crucial to the explosive developments in literary theory in the late seventies, and he was a pioneer in Jewish studies, trauma studies, and studies of the Holocaust. At Yale, he was a founder of its Judaic Studies program, as well as of the first major video archive for Holocaust testimonies.Generations of students have benefited from Hartman's generosity, his penetrating and incisive questioning, the wizardry of his close reading, and his sense that the work of a literary scholar, no less than that of an artist, is a creative act. All these qualities shine forth in this intellectual memoir, which will stand as his autobiography. Hartman describes his early education, uncanny sense of vocation, and development as a literary scholar and cultural critic. He looks back at how his career was influenced by his experience, at the age of nine, of being a refugee from Nazi Germany in the Kindertransport. He spent the next six years at school in England, where he developed his love of English literature and the English countryside, before leaving to join his mother in America.Hartman treats us to a biobibliographyof his engagements with the major trends in literary criticism. He covers the exciting period at Yale handled so controversially by the media and gives us vivid portraits, in particular, of Harold Bloom, Paul de Man, and Jacques Derrida.SEND GEOFFREY COVER COPY All this is set in the context of his gradual self-awareness of what scholarship implies and how his personal displacements strengthened his calling to mediate between European and American literary cultures. Anyone looking for a rich, intelligible account of the last half-century of combative literary studies will want to read Geoffrey Hartman's unapologetic scholar's tale.<br>

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, eac~<br>

  Book Title: God's Mirror: Renewal and Engagement in French Catholic Intellectual Culture in the Mid-Twentieth Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Garfitt Toby<br>
  Abstract: Gathering in one place a cohesive selection of articles that deepen our sense of the vitality and controversy within the Catholic renewal of the mid-twentieth century, God's Mirror offers historical analysis of French Catholic intellectuals. This volume highlights the work of writers, thinkers and creative artists who have not always drawn the attention given to such luminaries as Maritain, Mounier, and Marcel. Organized around the typologies of renewal and engagement, editors Katherine Davies and Toby Garfitt provide a revisionist and interdisciplinary reading of the narrative of twentieth-century French Catholicism. Renewal and engagement are both manifestations of how the Catholic intellectual reflects and takes position on the relationship between the Church, personal faith and the world, and on the increasingly problematic relationship between intellectuals and the Magisterium. A majority of the writings are based on extensive research into published texts, with some occasional archival references, and they give critical insights into the tensions that characterized the theological and political concerns of their subjects.<br>

  Abstract: The book provides a series of approaches to the ancient question of whether and how God is a matter of experience,or, alternately, to what extent the notion of experience can be true to itself if it does not include God. On the one hand, it seems impossible to experience God: the deity does not offer Himself to sense experience. On the other hand, there have been mystics who have claimed to have encountered God. The essays in this collection seek to explore the topic again, drawing insights from phenomenology, theology, literature, and feminism. Throughout, this stimulating collection maintains a strong connection with concrete rather than abstract approaches to God.The contributors: Michael F. Andrews, Jeffrey Bloechl, John D. Caputo, Kristine Culp, Kevin Hart, Kevin L. Hughes, Jean-Yves Lacoste, Crystal Lucky, Renee McKenzie, Kim Paffenroth, Michael Purcell, Michael J. Scanlon, O.S.A., James K. A. Smith.

  Book Title: Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): MACKENDRICK KARMEN<br>
  Abstract: Theology usually appears to us to be dogmatic, judgmental, condescending, maybe therapeutic, or perhaps downright fantastical-but seldom enticing. Divine Enticement takes as its starting point that the meanings of theological concepts are not so much logical, truth-valued propositions-affirmative or negative-as they are provocations and evocations. Thus it argues for the seductiveness of both theology and its subject-for, in fact, infinite seduction and enticement as the very sense of theological query. The divine name is one by which we are drawn toward the limits of thought, language, and flesh. The use of language in such conceptualization calls more than it designates. This is not a flaw or a result of vagueness or imprecision in theological language but rather marks the correspondence of such language to its subject: that which, outside of or at the limit of our thought, draws us as an enticement to desire, not least to intellectual desire. Central to the text is the strange semiotics of divine naming, as a call on that for which there cannot be a standard referent. The entanglement of sign and body, not least in interpretations of the Christian incarnation, both grounds and complicates the theological abstractions. A number of traditional notions in Christian theology are reconceived here as enticements, modes of drawing the desires of both body and mind: faith as "thinking with assent"; sacraments as "visible words" read in community; ethics as responsiveness to beauty; prayer as the language of address; scripture as the story of meaning-making. All of these culminate in a sense of a call to and from the purely possible, the open space into which we can be enticed, within which we can be divinely enticing.<br>

  Book Title: Thinking Through the Imagination: Aesthetics in Human Cognition-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Jones Jude<br>
  Abstract: Use your imagination! The demand is as important as it is confusing. What is the imagination? What is its value? Where does it come from? And where is it going in a time when even the obscene seems overdone and passe? This book takes up these questions and argues for the centrality of imagination in human cognition. It traces the development of the imagination in Kant's critical philosophy (particularly the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment) and claims that the insights of Kantian aesthetic theory, especially concerning the nature of creativity, common sense, and genius, influenced the development of nineteenth-century American philosophy. The book identifies the central role of the imagination in the philosophy of Peirce, a role often overlooked in analytic treatments of his thought. The final chapters pursue the observation made by Kant and Peirce that imaginative genius is a type of natural gift (ingenium) and must in some way be continuous with the creative force of nature. It makes this final turn by way of contemporary studies of metaphor, embodied cognition, and cognitive neuroscience.<br>

  Book Title: Cathedrals of Bone: The Role of the Body in Contemporary Catholic Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Waldmeir John C.<br>
  Abstract: The metaphor of the Church as a bodyhas shaped Catholic thinking since the Second Vatican Council. Its influence on theological inquiries into Catholic nature and practice is well-known; less obvious is the way it has shaped a generation of Catholic imaginative writers. Cathedrals of Bone is the first full-length study of a cohort of Catholic authors whose art takes seriously the themes of the Council: from novelists such as Mary Gordon, Ron Hansen, Louise Erdrich, and J. F. Powers, to poets such as Annie Dillard, Mary Karr, Lucia Perillo, and Anne Carson, to the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright John Patrick Shanley. Motivated by the inspirational yet thoroughly incarnational rhetoric of Vatican II, each of these writers encourages readers to think about the human body as a site-perhaps the most important site-of interaction between God and human beings. Although they represent the body in different ways, these late-twentieth-century Catholic artists share a sense of its inherent value. Moreover, they use ideas and terminology from the rich tradition of Catholic sacramentality, especially as it was articulated in the documents of Vatican II, to describe that value. In this way they challenge the Church to take its own tradition seriously and to reconsider its relationship to a relatively recent apologetics that has emphasized a narrow view of human reason and a rigid sense of orthodoxy.<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenologies of the Stranger: Between Hostility and Hospitality-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: What is strange? Or better, who is strange? When do we encounter the strange? We encounter strangers when we are not at home: when we are in a foreign land or a foreign part of our own land. From Freud to Lacan to Kristeva to Heidegger, the feeling of strangeness-das Unheimlichkeit-has marked our encounter with the other, even the other within our self. Most philosophical attempts to understand the role of the Stranger, human or transcendent, have been limited to standard epistemological problems of other minds, metaphysical substances, body/soul dualism and related issues of consciousness and cognition. This volume endeavors to take the question of hosting the stranger to the deeper level of embodied imagination and the senses (in the Greek sense of aisthesis). This volume plays host to a number of encounters with the strange. It asks such questions as: How does the embodied imagination relate to the Stranger in terms of hospitality or hostility (given the common root of hostis as both host and enemy)? How do we distinguish between projections of fear or fascination, leading to either violence or welcome? How do humans sensethe dimension of the strange and alien in different religions, arts, and cultures? How do the five physical senses relate to the spiritual senses, especially the famous sixthsense, as portals to an encounter with the Other? Is there a carnal perception of alterity, which would operate at an affective, prereflective, preconscious level? What exactly do embodied imaginariesof hospitality and hostility entail, and how do they operate in language, psychology, and social interrelations (including racism, xenophobia, and scapegoating)? And what, finally, are the topical implications of these questions for an ethics and practice of tolerance and peace?<br>

  Book Title: The Reinvention of Religious Music: Olivier Messiaen's Breakthrough Toward the Beyond-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): van Maas Sander<br>
  Abstract: Present-day music studies conspicuously evade the question of religion in contemporary music. Although many composers address the issue in their work, as yet there have been few attempts to think through the structure of religious music as we hear it. On the basis of a careful analysis of Olivier Messiaen's work, this book argues for a renewal of our thinking about religious music. Addressing his notion of a hyper-religiousmusic of sounds and colors, it aims to show that Messiaen has broken new ground. His reinvention of religious music makes us again aware of the fact that religious music, if taken in its proper radical sense, belongs to the foremost of musical adventures.The work of Olivier Messiaen is well known for its inclusion of religious themes and gestures. These alone, however, do not seem enough to account for the religious status of the work. Arguing for a breakthrough toward the beyondon the basis of the synaesthetic experience of music, Messiaen invites a confrontation with contemporary theologians and post-secular thinkers. How to account for a religious breakthrough that is produced by a work of art?Starting from an analysis of his 1960s oratorio La Transfiguration de Notre-Seigneur Jsus-Christ, this book arranges a moderated dialogue between Messiaen and the music theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar, the phenomenology of revelation of Jean-Luc Marion, the rethinking of religion and technics in Jacques Derrida and Bernard Stiegler, and the Augustinian ruminations of Sren Kierkegaard and Jean-Franois Lyotard. Ultimately, this confrontation underscores the challenging yet deeply affirmative nature of Messiaen's music.<br>

It seems as though in Messiaen’s music the vertical plane of stained-glass windows is answered by a planar experience that leaves all interiority behind. Inspired by Gilles Deleuze, Asplund notes, “Rather than delving or diving into a squalid, striated space of darkness within, Messiaen wants to ascend to a smooth, infinite space of light above, an expanding beyond oneself<br>

  Book Title: Italian Irish Filmmakers-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lourdeaux Lee<br>
  Abstract: "This penetrating study examines how these filmmakers confronted their cultural heritage and used it as a counterpoint to their depiction of mainstream America." --American Cinematographer In this unique film history, Lee Lourdeaux traces the impact of Irish and Italian cultures on four major American directors and their work. Defining the core values and tensions within each culture, and especially focusing on the influence of American Catholicism, he presents John Ford, Frank Capra, Francis Coppola, and Martin Scorsese as ethnic Americans and film artists. Lourdeaux shows each filmmaker on set with writers and actors, learning to bypass stereotypes in order to develop a shrewd reciprocal assimilation between his ethnic background and Anglo America. Beginning with D. W. Griffith's depiction of Irish and Italian immigrants, the author discusses Hollywood's stereotypical portrayals of ethnic priests, cops, politicians, and gangsters, as well as their surface acculturation in the movies of the 1920s. By the decade's end, John Ford was using all-American stories to embody the basic myths and tensions of Irish-American life. In his later westerns and foreign films, he tried to understand both Irish political strife and the key figures of Irish liturgy. Frank Capra pitted Italian family values against the Anglo success ethic, turning out social comedies about oppressed little people. Several decades later, Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola were highly critical of their religio-ethnic heritage, though they gradually discovered that to outline its weaknesses, like the blind pursuit of success, was to fashion a critical mirror of mainstream America. Lourdeaux discusses a number of recent films by Coppola and by Scorsese that have not yet been analyzed in any book. And, in the chapter on Scorsese, a personal interview with the director reveals how his ethnic childhood shaped his work in film. Examining the conflicts within American culture, Lourdeaux shows how the filmmake~<br>

  Abstract: In order to get a sense of the multifaceted nature of Karl Barth’s ethics, one thing to do is to conjure up before the inner eye images that western societies commonly associate with a long interval of the twentieth century such as the years between 1932 and 1967. This was the time it took Barth to publish his multi-volume
                  Church Dogmatics (CD),¹ which comprises both theology and ethics. Moreover, the various social, ecclesial and political contexts of his work are reflected in the fact that the critical edition of Barth’s works includes five volumes of individual smaller texts, written for<br>

  Abstract: “We are trapped in the jaws of something shaking the life out of us.” With these words from his historical novel,

It is full of frustration and fear. There is consternation and a vexed wrestling with the entrapping “jaws” that belong … well, to “something.” State terror’s theatrics are like that, unleashing forces that brutalize<br>

  Abstract: God violates the norms and expectations of those who take themselves to be wise and in that way appears foolish in the eyes of the world.¹ The cross of Christ is the most startling, scandalous, and in that sense paradigmatic instance of this. But I believe Christian theologians soon generalize from it. In all God’s activity

  Book Title: Resisting history-Religious transcendence and the invention of the unconscious<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hayward Rhodri<br>
  Abstract: How can historians make sense of visions, hauntings and demonic possession? Do miraculous events have any place in a world governed by cause and effect? In Resisting history, Rhodri Hayward examines the cumulative attempts of theologians, historians and psychologists to create a consistent and rational narrative capable of containing the inexplicable. This lucid and provocative account argues that the psychological theories we routinely use to make sense of supernatural experience were born out of struggles between popular mystics and conservative authorities. Hayward’s lively analysis of the Victorian disciplines of Christology, psychology and psychical research reveals how our modern concept of the subconscious was developed as a tool for policing religious inspiration. He concludes his argument with a vivid study of the Welsh Revival of 1904-5, in which the attempt of thousands of converts to cast off their everyday identity was diffused and defeated using the language of the new psychology. By revealing the politics inherent in such language, Hayward raises questions about its deployment in the work of today’s historians. Written in a clear and accessible style, Resisting history provides a fresh and entertaining perspective for anyone interested in questioning the concepts that underlie historical writing and psychological thought today.<br>

The anonymous narrator of Coupland’s short story, ‘In the Desert’ (1994), a wanderer lost in the scorched American wilderness, makes revealing connections between the simulated, late twentieth-century ‘electronic dream’ of shared televisual memory and the dubious coherence of his own life story.

This does not just mean that Bourdieu was right-minded and ‘ethical’ in the sense of being moral (whatever one might mean by this). It means that his work is addressed as much to issues of the self, and especially to our reflexivity and autonomy, as to just epistemic issues of positive ‘knowledge’ and denunciatory critique.

If nature can no longer be said to have a theological basis, what determines how we are to understand what nature is? Kant’s ambivalence with regard to ‘nature’ suggest why this issue creates so much controversy.

  Book Title: Britain and Africa Under Blair-In pursuit of the good state<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gallagher Julia<br>
  Abstract: Africa was a key focus of Britain’s foreign policy under Tony Blair. Military intervention in Sierra Leone, increases in aid and debt relief, and grand initiatives such as the Commission for Africa established the continent as a place in which Britain could ‘do good’. Britain and Africa under Blair: in pursuit of the good state critically explores Britain’s fascination with Africa. It argues that, under New Labour, Africa represented an area of policy that appeared to transcend politics. Gradually, it came to embody an ideal state activity around which politicians, officials and the wider public could coalesce, leaving behind more contentious domestic and international issues. Building on the story of Britain and Africa under Blair, the book draws wider conclusions about the role of ‘good’ and idealism in foreign policy. In particular, it discusses how international relationships provide opportunities to create and pursue ideals, and why they are essential for the wellbeing of political communities. It argues that state actors project the idea of ‘good’ onto idealised, distant objects, in order to restore a sense of the ‘good state’. The book makes a distinctive and original contribution to debates about the role of ethics in international relations and will be of particular interest to academics, policy-makers and students of international relations, Africa and British foreign policy, and to anyone interested in ethics in international affairs.<br>

Though many scholars still assume a single Renaissance psychology, one that privileges Aristotelian empiricism and Aristotelian structuring of faculties (often with the express goal of explaining Shakespeare’s plays), we must cast the net elsewhere to reap the allegory of

  Abstract: "When Tony Campbell, aged 75, asked the Council of Jesuit Theological College for Emeritus status and retirement from JTC, both were granted most graciously, along with a testimonial document which said in part: ‘His teaching has combined evocation and provocation in the best sense of those terms. He has mentored research students with scholarly exactitude and personal care. He has published books of the highest scholarly quality, of engaging readability, and of passionate conviction.’ When we at ATF were considering asking him for a volume of Collected Works or Selected Writings, we were well aware that ‘published books of the highest scholarly quality’ were likely to be found on the shelves of libraries and of specialised academics, but not with students and others generally interested. There may be a dozen or more of Tony’s books on the list from Amazon.com booksellers, along with another two or three that are not listed there. But most are heavy-duty specialist works, not easily accessible even to the educated public. We were equally well aware that there was a surprising number of essays and articles scattered in journals and proceedings of conferences that were, because of the scattering, often just as inaccessible. We thought that a collection of these in a single volume would be of great value to those interested. In the Introduction to this volume, Father Campbell has gone into some detail about the contents. Suffice for us to say that Job and the issues associated with suffering concern us all, that the interplay of history and narrative is a constant in the understanding of much biblical text, and that the nature of the Bible and its role in our lives is a major concern for most thinking Christians. While Father Campbell’s focus is on the Older Testament, pondering what he looks at throws light on much of the Newer Testament as well. The writings Tony Campbell has pulled together in this single volume address significant issues within the readable length ~<br>

  Author(s): Sitze Adam<br>
  Abstract: In this fascinating and rare little book, a leading Italian feminist philosopher and the Archbishop of Milan face off over the contemporary meaning of the biblical commandment not to kill. The result is a series of erudite and wide-ranging arguments that move from murder and suicide to just war and drone strikes, from bioethics and biopolitics to hermeneutics and philology, from Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer to Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault, from Torah and Scripture to art and literature, from the essence of human dignity and the paradoxes of fratricide to engagements with Levinasian ethics. Less a direct debate than a disputation in the classical sense, Thou Shalt Not Kill proves to be a searching meditation on one of the unstated moral premises shared by otherwise bitterly opposed political factions. It will stimulate the mind of the novice while also reminding more advanced readers of the necessity and desirability of thinking in the present.<br>

  Author(s) DWYER KEVIN<br>
  Abstract: I encountered Morocco when I was twenty-four years old. It was, in a sense, an accidental or at least a serendipitous encounter—but then again, it may have been fate. Before leaving New York in 1981, I was in music school studying flute performance. I was working on my second BA, begun after my graduation from the English Department at New York University (with a minor in French literature), and although I was feeling too old to be a freshman for a second time, I didn’t know what else to do. My only directive was a tired but workable cliché:<br>

  Abstract: Instead of examining a phenomenon that Marion already depicts as saturated, this chapter focuses on one he does not discuss. I will suggest that nature and various nonhuman beings can appear to us as saturated phenomena, both on Marion’s own terms and in the sense in which I have argued in respect to the first two types of phenomena examined: as displaying degrees and requiring hermeneutic context. Hence this chapter is not specifically about Marion’s discussion of the third saturated phenomenon, that of the human flesh.

  Abstract: The Sickness unto Death. Already the title indicates a deep affliction with the problem of suicide, although the book is presented as a treatise on the modern self in despair. Suicide is not mentioned until a later stage of the analysis, when Kierkegaard suddenly breaks into a short discussion of how suicide influences despair. Then he admits, albeit in brackets, that this is what theentireinvestigation is about—in a “more profound” sense. The question of suicide thus seems unavoidable for any reading ofThe Sickness unto Death,but its significance has, so far, hardly been acknowledged or properly<br>

  Abstract: Following the Augustinian tradition, original sin is something that we are responsible for and hence guilty of, yet in another sense it is a destiny that befalls us. At stake is hence a fine balance between necessity and freedom, between personal guilt and delivery to destructive structures. Accordingly, acknowledging sin takes a personal sense of the I, confessing or revealing itself as the originator of deeds and speech, while acknowledging that this I is indebted—for better and for worse—to the inheritance of and continuous participation in a form of life that bestows coherence to those deeds and utterances.<br>

  Author(s): JAFFE AARON<br>
  Abstract: They have stalked the horizons of our culture, wreaked havoc on moribund concepts of dead and not dead, threatened our sense of identity, and endangered our personal safety. Now zombies have emerged from the lurking shadows of society's fringes to wander the sacred halls of the academy, feasting on tender minds and hurling rot across our intellectual landscape. It is time to unite in common cause, to shore up defenses, firm up critical and analytical resources, and fortify crumbling lines of inquiry. Responding to this call, Brain Workers from the Zombie Research Center poke and prod the rotting corpus of zombie culture trying to make sense of cult classics and the unstoppable growth of new and even more disturbing work. They exhume "zombie theory" and decaying historical documents from America, Europe, and the Caribbean in order to unearth the zombie world and arm readers with the brain tools necessary for everyday survival. Readers will see that zombie culture today "lives" in shapes as mutable as a zombie horde-and is often just as violent.<br>

  Abstract: Throughout this book I have underlined an issue that accompanies the various discourses of liberation and decolonial thought in Latin America, namely, the issue of its aesthetic dimension. As we saw, Dussel’s philosophy of liberation is based on a pre-rational and pre-linguistic sensibility, a sense of radical exteriority, that distinguishes humans. Quijano exposes a pre-rational disposition or sensibility that sustains the coloniality of power and knowledge. Moreover, as he goes on to uncover and engage ana-chronic simultaneity in Latin American existence, Quijano turns to the writers, poets, and artists of Latin America, who articulate senses of existence beyond and otherwise<br>

  Abstract: Over the course of his distinguished interdisciplinary career, Giles Gunn has sustained his focus on the continuing threats to our collective sense of the human that seem to result from the link between the collision of fundamental values and the increase of systemic violence. He asks whether such threats can be at least mitigated, even if not removed, by understanding as opposed to force and what resources a more pragmatic cosmopolitanism might provide for doing so. How, in other words, might our sense of the human be reconstructed, not around suspicion or antipathy toward others, but around an epistemological and moral need of them?<br>

Secrecy also adds to the sense that government is distant and unresponsive. Institutions practice secrecy at their peril, yet many yield to its siren song.

  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Wertheimer Eric<br>
  Abstract: Trauma is a universal human experience. While each person responds differently to trauma, its presence in our lives nonetheless marks a continual thread through human history and prehistory. In
      Critical Trauma Studies, a diverse group of writers, activists, and scholars of sociology, anthropology, literature, and cultural studies reflects on the study of trauma and how multidisciplinary approaches lend richness and a sense of deeper understanding to this burgeoning field of inquiry. The original essays within this collection cover topics such as female suicide bombers from the Chechen Republic, singing prisoners in Iranian prison camps, sexual assault and survivor advocacy, and families facing the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. As it proceeds,Critical Trauma Studiesnever loses sight of the way those who study trauma as an academic field, and those who experience, narrate, and remediate trauma as a personal and embodied event, inform one another. Theoretically adventurous and deeply particular, this book aims to advance trauma studies as a discipline that transcends intellectual boundaries, to be mapped but also to be unmoored from conceptual and practical imperatives. Remaining embedded in lived experiences and material realities,Critical Trauma Studiesframes the field as both richly unbounded and yet clearly defined, historical, and evidence-based.<br>

People around the world have always been curious about their neighbours and more remote people. They have gossiped about them, fought them, married them and told stories about them. Some of their stories were written down. Some were later criticised as inaccurate or ethnocentric (or flatly racist). Some stories were compared with others, about other people, leading to general assumptions about ‘people elsewhere’, and what humans everywhere have in common.

  Abstract: What is the ultimate point of social anthropology? One may, obviously, use the subject to collect academic distinctions and eventually get a job in research or teaching. On the other hand, in most cases there are faster and more rewarding methods, at least in a pecuniary sense, of acquiring a livelihood. Fortunately, there are also other reasons for becoming involved in the subject.<br>

  Book Title: Community, Cosmopolitanism and the Problem of Human Commonality-  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Mitchell Jon P.<br>
  Abstract: In this follow up to their widely read earlier volume, The Trouble with Community, Vered Amit and Nigel Rapport ask: 'Do notions of community remain central to our sense of who we are, in the dislocating context of globalization, or can we see beyond community closures to a human whole?' This volume explores the variable nature of contemporary sociality. It focuses on the ethical, organizational and emotional claims and opportunities sought or fashioned for mobilizing and evading social collectivities in a world of mobile subjects. Here is an examination of the tensions and interactions between everyday forms of fluid fellowship, culturally normative claims to identity, and opportunities for realizing a universal humanity. The book offers a new perspective on human commonality through a dialogue between two eminent anthropologists who come from distinct, but complementary positions.<br>

  Abstract: The human condition, according to Georg Simmel (1971), could be truly apprehended only by taking account of a certain ‘dialectical circuitry’ which underlay experience and gave human life a sense of passage and progress. The characteristic human experience concerned ‘co-present dualisms’: public and private, rule and practice, antagonism and solidarity, freedom and constraint, rebelliousness and compliance, creativeness and structure. Here were paired phenomena one element of which presupposed the second element which yet, in turn, presupposed the first; one element influenced the second element which yet, in turn, influenced the first.

It also produced one of the earliest charters in favor of more general freedom rights in Europe, the so-called Twelve Articles of Memmingen (1525).

  Book Title: The Literatures of the French Pacific-Reconfiguring Hybridity<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): FORSDICK CHARLES<br>
  Abstract: Hybridity theory, the creative dissemination and restless to-and-fro of Homi Bhabha’s Third Space or of Stuart Hall’s politics of difference, for example, has opened up understandings of what may be produced in the spaces of cultural contact. This book argues that the particularity of the forms of mixing in the literatures of the French Pacific country of New Caledonia contest and complexify the characterisations of hybrid cultural exchange. From the accounts of European discovery by the first explorers and translations of the stories of oral tradition, to the writings of settler, déporté, convict, indentured labourer and their descendants, and contemporary indigenous (Kanak) literatures, these texts inscribe Oceanian or Pacific difference within and against colonial contexts. In a context of present strategic positioning around a unique postcolonial proposal of common destiny, however, mutual cultural transformation is not unbounded. The local cannot escape coexistence with the global, yet Oceanian literatures maintain and foreground a powerful sense of ancestral origins, of an original engendering. The spiral going forward continually remembers and cycles back distinctively to an enduring core. In their turn, the Pacific stories of unjust deportation or heroic settlement are founded on exile and loss. On the other hand, both the desire for, and fears of, cultural return reflected in such hybrid literary figures as Déwé Gorodé’s graveyard of ancestral canoes and Pierre Gope’s chefferie internally corrupted in response to the solicitations of Western commodity culture, or Claudine Jacques’ lizard of irrational violence, will need to be addressed in any working out of a common destiny for Kanaky-New Caledonia.<br>

All derive from nostalgia for a past and present home, and seek to establish roots and legitimacy by reconstituting a New Caledonian history that guarantees their community its own place, cultural specificity, and centrality. The dialectic between literature and history, between European and New Caledonian homes, refashions the sense of history in these texts: a (hi)story that is more about a distinctive (group), a political message, and an ethical vision of the future than a faithful reproduction of a past society<br>

  Book Title: Memory, Narrative and the Great War-Rifleman Patrick MacGill and the Construction of Wartime Experience<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Taylor David<br>
  Abstract: Memory, Narrative and the Great War provides a detailed examination of the varied and complex war writings of a relatively marginal figure, Patrick MacGill, within a general framework of our current pre-occupation with blood, mud and suffering. In particular, it seeks to explain how his interpretation of war shifted from the heroic wartime autobiographical trilogy, with its emphasis on 'the romance of the rifleman' to the pessimistic and guilt-ridden interpretations in his post-war novel, Fear!, and play, Suspense. Through an exploration of the way in which war-time experiences were remembered (and re-remembered) and retold in strikingly different narratives, and using insights from cognitive psychology, it is argued that there is no contradiction between these two seemingly opposing views. Instead it is argued that, given the present orientation and problem-solving nature of both memory and narrative, the different interpretations are both 'true' in the sense that they throw light on the ongoing way in which MacGill came to terms with his experiences of war. This in turn has implications for broader interpretations of the Great War, which has increasingly be seen in terms of futile suffering, not least because of the eloquent testimony of ex-Great War soldiers, reflecting on their experiences many years after the event. Without suggesting that such testimony is invalid, it is argued that this is one view but not the only view of the war. Rather wartime memory and narrative is more akin to an ever-changing kaleidoscope, in which pieces of memory take on different (but equally valid) shapes as they are shaken with the passing of time.<br>

Notwithstanding the often tumultuous events of the twentieth century, the war still enjoys a unique status as a watershed in modern British history, and interest in it shows no sign of abating. On the contrary, not least as a result of the continuing growth in family history, interest in grandfather’s war and great-grandfather’s war ensures that it lives on in contemporary society.

  Author(s): HACKETT W. CHRIS<br>
  Abstract: Quiet Powers of the Possible offers an excellent introduction to contemporary French phenomenology through a series of interviews with its most prominent figures. Guided by rigorous questions that push into the most important aspects of the latest phenomenological research, the book gives readers a comprehensive sense of each thinker's intellectual history, motivations, and philosophical commitments. The book introduces readers to debates that have not previously been accessible to the English-speaking world, such as the growing interest in the phenomenological concept of life in its affective and even vital dimensions, the emerging dialogue with the analytic philosophy of mind and language, and reassessments of the so-called theological turn. The diversity of approaches collected here has its origin in a deeper debate about the conceptual and historical foundations of phenomenology itself. In this way the book offers the most accessible and wide-ranging introduction to French phenomenology to have appeared in the English-speaking world to date.<br>

  Abstract: Throughout Latin America during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Catholics drew inspiration from political and social movements, as well as philosophical inquiries, from the rest of the Catholic world. Latin American Catholic activists sought to implement these foreign practices while, at the same time, adapting them and improvising changes that would make more sense in the local context. One of the most successful examples of this transnational interchange and adaptation occurred between Latin American Catholic activists and a little known but highly influential social movement in the Catholic Scots-Irish region of eastern Nova Scotia.<br>

  Book Title: Radical Theology-An Essay on Faith and Theology in the Twenty-First Century<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Dalferth Ingolf U.<br>
  Abstract: Ingolf U. Dalferth develops a “radical theology" that unfolds the orienting strength of faith for human life from the event of God’s presence to every present. In a concise and clear manner, Dalferth outlines the theological and philosophical approaches to hermeneutics in the modern era, in order to promote a convincing and defensible theology for the twenty-first century, critically carrying on Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Bultmann, without forgetting Karl Barth. The result of his reconstruction is a “radical theology" that neither glorifies premodern theology in an antimodern attitude nor seeks a mystical deepening of the secular, but argues for a radical change in theological perspective of the possible. In doing so, theology unfolds “limit concepts" that restrict the claims of science and philosophy critically, and develops “ideas of orientation" that illumine the ways in which human life is understood and lived in radically new ways in faith. From here, Dalferth unfolds the reality of revelation and the Christian sense of an unconditional hope that fundamentally transcends all beliefs based on mundane realities and orients the world on something beyond its own temporal horizon—its loving Creator.<br>

  Book Title: Theology in the Flesh-How Embodiment and Culture Shape the Way We Think about Truth, Morality, and God<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Sanders John<br>
  Abstract: Metaphors and other mental tools are used to reason (not just speak) about God, salvation, truth, and morality. Figurative language structures our theological and moral reasoning in powerful ways. This book uses an approach known as cognitive linguistics to explore the incredibly rich ways our conceptual tools, derived from embodied life and culture, shape the way we understand Christian teachings and practices. The cognitive revolution has generated amazing insights into how human minds make sense of the world. This book applies these insights to the ways Christians think about topics such as God, justice, sin, and salvation. It shows that Christians often share a set of very general ideas but disagree on what the Bible means or the moral stances we should take. It explains why Christians often develop a number of appropriate but sometimes incompatible ways to understand the Bible and various doctrines. It assists Christians in understanding those with whom they disagree. Hopefully, simply better understanding how and why people think the way they do will foster better dialogue and greater humility.<br>

There is not a particular area of the brain or specific pattern of brain activity associated with religious experiences. Rather, as Brown and Strawn suggest: “there are a multitude of forms of body and brain activity that can mediate and embody religious experiences and the sense of the presence of God, but any particular brain-body event is experienced as religious or not based on the person’s expectations and ways of understanding their subjective experiences.”¹ The way we understand theology<br>

  Author(s) MOELLER HANS-GEORG<br>
  Abstract: Free individuality, human capacities, and inner state of mind most directly involve the personal space of the self but also in a broader sense the distinction and interaction between the individual domain and the public sphere. As interrelated aspects of the social world, the individual domain and its connection to the public sphere also sets the concrete background for the historical process of accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things. As the actual mode of being, accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things is never separable from diverse social resources, and the acquisition, possession, and distribution of resources involves the issue of social justice.<br>

  Abstract: If we take seriously the definition of desire outlined in the previous chapter, important questions remain concerning its ultimate social application. Still, it is a useful starting point for unpacking the concepts of individuality and intersubjectivity underlying the reflection on the modern subject conducted by one of its most definitive theoreticians – namely, Hegel; Hegel’s efforts in this direction turn on a critique, buttressed by the concept of negativity, of that which some have termed the “analytics of finitude.” In this sense, a return to Hegel allows us to ask what was truly at stake in his complex, polyphonic movement towards<br>

  Abstract: Fredric Jameson’s assertion that utopia’s deepest subject is its own inconceivability—its own failure of imagination, in a sense—baldly contravenes a positivist utopian tradition characterized precisely as the full-fledged blueprint of an alternative, more perfect society. Jameson’s negative utopianism embraces this aspect of failure, but it is important to understand that this failure is not simply the commonplace fatality of a compromised individual or authorial imagination. It is, instead, what Jameson calls “the systemic, cultural, and ideological closure of which we are all in one way or another prisoners.”¹ Despite Thomas More’s inspiration for, and association with, utopianism of<br>

  Book Title: The Adventures of Jonathan Dennis-Bicultural Film Archiving Practice in Aotearoa New Zealand<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kelly Emma Jean<br>
  Abstract: Jonathan Dennis (1953-2002), was the creative and talented founding director of the New Zealand Film Archive. As a Pakeha (non-Maori/indigenous New Zealander) with a strong sense of social justice, Dennis became a conduit for tension and debate over the preservation and presentation of indigenous and non-indigenous film archival materials from the time the Archive opened in 1981. His work resulted in a film archive and curatorship practice which differed significantly from that of the North American and European archives he originally sought to emulate. He supported a philosophical shift in archival practice by engaging indigenous peoples in developing creative and innovative exhibitions from the 1980s until his death, recognizing that much of the expertise required to work with archival materials rested with the communities outside archival walls. This book presents new interviews gathered by the author, as well as an examination of existing interviews, films and broadcasts about and with Jonathan Dennis, to consider the narrative of a life and work in relation to film archiving.<br>

  Author(s) Welzer Harald<br>
  Abstract: Postmodern theory has severely undercut the notion that historians can produce objective and accurate descriptions of past episodes. Instead, it proposes that discovering the factual truth about historical events is extremely problematic because knowledge production is relative to the values and agenda of the inquirer. The question of the validity of historical knowledge has informed the general topic “Making Sense of History,” the theme of the book series of which the present volume is a part. The postmodern critique of the modernist epistemology of the humanities and social sciences has produced considerable consternation and disturbance in most of these disciplines.<br>

Most commentators have accepted his claims at face value, and in a sense they are quite right to do so. Yet the question depends on what definition of ‘political’ is used. Before 1939 Sartre joined no organisation, participated in no campaign; but he thought, read and talked about power and wealth, about oppression and about how society might be better organised.<br>

  Book Title: Religion: Beyond a Concept-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): de VRIES HENT<br>
  Abstract: What do we talk about when we talk about religion? Is it an array of empirical facts about historical human civilizations? Or is religion what is in essence unpredictable-perhaps the very emergence of the new? In what ways are the legacies of religion-its powers, words, things, and gestures-reconfiguring themselves as the elementary forms of life in the twenty-first century?Given the Latin roots of the word religion and its historical Christian uses, what sense, if any, does it make to talk about religionin other traditions? Where might we look for common elements that would enable us to do so? Has religion as an overarching concept lost all its currency, or does it ineluctably return-sometimes in unexpected ways-the moment we attempt to do without it? This book explores the difficulties and double binds that arise when we ask What is religion? Offering a marvelously rich and diverse array of perspectives, it begins the task of rethinking religionand religious studiesin a contemporary world. Opening essays on the question What is religion?are followed by clusters exploring the relationships among religion, theology, and philosophy and the links between religion, politics, and law. Pedagogy is the focus of the following section. Religion is then examined in particular contexts, from classical times to the present Pentacostal revival, leading into an especially rich set of essays on religion, materiality, and mediatization. The final section grapples with the ever-changing forms that religionis taking, such as spirituality movements and responses to the ecological crisis.Featuring the work of leading scholars from a wide array of disciplines, traditions, and cultures, Religion: Beyond a Concept will help set the agenda for religious studies for years to come. It is the first of five volumes in a collection entitled The Future of the Religious Past, the fruit of a major international research initiative funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.<br>

How might carnal hermeneutics, as it draws on multiple senses, participate in the work of refiguring traumatic wounds?

Nancy suggests that art does not merely illustrate religion. Instead, the two are involved in the same self-deconstructive movement or in a process of a mutual dis-enclosure. Whereas art provides the sensible articulation of the internal destabilization of the religious mode, the unstable core in religion—an origin in its displacement—forms an integral part of the condition of art.<br>

Attempting to use human language to describe the divine presents ontological and epistemological problems that push our speech to the breaking point. Initially, we looked at several different modes of speech, the univocal, equivocal, analogical, and metaphorical, looking at their approach to speaking of a transcendent being.

  Abstract: In chapter 1 we saw that concerns with historical and ethical difficulties might point us to a new (or renewed) way of reading Old Testament texts. The Church Fathers suggest to us that historical and ethical difficulties in a narrative might be indicators to us that we misread an Old Testament text if we read it primarily in terms of historical or ethical description via the ‘plain sense’ of the text. The Fathers mapped out a whole other way of reading the texts in a theologically faithful scheme, but a scheme that is perhaps unconvincing in a number of its<br>

The following overview is geared to the particular postmodern problematic facing contemporary discourse on sacramental presence, and in this sense is meant to be a preparation for the question of how postmodern thought is made productive for the Christian tradition by contemporary theology. In this, as we have already seen, Heidegger’s relationship to postmodernism will be accented insofar as his critique of Western thought emerges as an important catalyst for postmodern sacramental theology.

In this sense, the Eucharist is not “rooted” in its history, but rather

  Book Title: Gift and the Unity of Being-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Milbank John<br>
  Abstract: Starting from both our originary experience of being given to ourselves and Jesus Christ’s archetypal self-donation, 'Gift and the Unity of Being' elucidates the sense in which gift is the form of being’s unity, while unity itself constitutes the permanence of the gift of being. In dialogue with ancient and modern philosophers and theologians, López offers a synthetic, rather than systematic, account of the unity proper to being, the human person, God, and the relations among them. The book shows how contemplation of the triune God of love through Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit allows us to discover the eternal communion that being is and to which finite being is called. It also illustrates the sense in which God’s gratuitousness unexpectedly offers the human person the possibility to recognize and embrace his origin and destiny, and thus he is given to see and taste in God’s light the ever-fruitful, dramatic, and mysterious positivity of being.<br>

Gift is a primal, a principle, inasmuch as it is a permanent source. The positivity of concrete singular beings suggested by originary experience rests on the permanent, personal principle of originating and ordering, a Father whose face we are invited to see in his beloved, Incarnate Son. Gift is also a primal because it indicates “first-ness.” According to this second sense of “primal,” being’s primordial unity is an ever-new beginning. Each concrete singular being is created; it<br>

  Book Title: Reading Scripture to Hear God-Kevin Vanhoozer and Henri de Lubac on God's Use of Scripture in the Economy of Redemption<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Storer Kevin<br>
  Abstract: Recent theological discussions between Catholics and Evangelicals have generated a renewed appreciation for God's ongoing use of Scripture for self-mediation to the Church. Noting the significant influence of Henri de Lubac (one of the drafters of 'Dei Verbum' and proponent of a renewal of the Patristic and Medieval emphasis on a spiritual sense of Scripture), and Kevin Vanhoozer (the leading Evangelical proponent of a theological interpretation of Scripture), Kevin Storer seeks to draw Evangelical and Catholic theologians into dialogue about God's ongoing use of Scripture in the economy of redemption. Storer suggests that a number of traditional tensions between Catholics and Evangelicals, such as the literal or spiritual sense of Scripture, a sacramental or a covenantal model of God's self-mediation, and an emphasis on the authority of Scripture or the authority of the Church, can be eased by shifting greater focus upon God's ongoing use of creaturely realities for the building of the Church in union with Christ. This project seeks to enable Evangelicals to appropriate the insights of de Lubac's Catholic Ressourcement project, while also encouraging Catholic theologians to appreciate Vanhoozer's Evangelical emphasis on God's use of the literal sense of Scripture to build the Church.<br>

When unexplained, sinister, or violent things happen in the landscapes and communities we inhabit, one explanation seems to satisfy us more than many others. Whether accounting for the haunted house down the dirt lane, the spectral woods behind the subdivision, or the seemingly cursed stretch of highway up the canyon, one kind of story in particular helps us make sense of these places:

  Abstract: The question presupposes what the phrase itself implies: that “New Testament theology” is or should be in some sense “theology.” What that contention might mean depends not only on the contested phrase “New Testament theology,” but, prior to that, on how “theology” itself is understood, whether (to condense the range of non-disparaging dictionary meanings) in the strong sense of articulating and perhaps advocating a religious stance by expressing its belief and practice in a rational way, or in the secondary sense of philosophical, historical, and related scholarship describing and analyzing the commitments of others.

  Author(s) FUCHS RACHEL G.<br>
  Abstract: In William Cohen’s study of modernization in five provincial cities in nineteenth-century France, he found that city dwellers often were drawn into the intense battles between local and national interests as the urban facade yielded to unprecedented change. Citizens inevitably went along with their civic leaders’ advice for renewal and rejected counsel that was nationally based. As Cohen writes, “To be sure, cities were not insular. Their inhabitants increasingly were swept up in the national ideologies and movements. Yet municipal leaders were able to forge and maintain a sense of unity that lent the regional city significance.”¹ In this light<br>

  Abstract: It is difficult to account for the remarkable sense of depth as well as breadth we feel in reading Tolstoy. Sir Isaiah Berlin, in describing that sense, has come closer than anyone else to explaining it. Tolstoy’s heroes achieve a kind of serenity through coming to accept “the permanent relationships of things and the universal texture of human life.” Through them we become aware of an order underlying and perhaps girding the world of our experience.

  Book Title: Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging meditation on the nature and purpose of hermeneutics, Gerald L. Bruns argues that hermeneutics is not merely a contemporary theory but an extended family of questions about understanding and interpretation that have multiple and conflicting histories going back to before the beginning of writing.What does it mean to understand a riddle, an action, a concept, a law, an alien culture, or oneself? Bruns expands our sense of the horizons of hermeneutics by situating its basic questions against a background of different cultural traditions and philosophical topics. He discusses, for example, the interpretation of oracles, the silencing of the muses and the writing of history, the quarrel between philosophy and poetry, the canonization of sacred texts, the nature of allegorical exegesis, rabbinical midrash, the mystical exegesis of the Qur'an, the rise of literalism and the individual interpreter, and the nature of Romantic hermeneutics. Dealing with thinkers ranging from Socrates to Luther to Wordsworth to Ricoeur, Bruns also ponders several basic dilemmas about the nature of hermeneutical experience, the meaning of tradition, the hermeneutical function of narrative, and the conflict between truth and freedom in philosophy and literature. His eloquent book demonstrates the continuing power of hermeneutical thinking to open up questions about the world and our place in it.<br>

  Abstract: The title is meant to take us back to the quarrel between philosophy and poetry that Socrates already regarded as ancient. My sense is that every hermeneutical situation has the structure of this quarrel, which is governed by a logic that is by turns exclusionary and allegorical. Plato’s idea seems to have been that poetry embodies something (we’re not sure what) that interferes with the sort of discourse Socrates is trying to set up and that he seems to be practicing in texts like the

  Book Title: Firewalking and Religious Healing-The Anastenaria of Greece and the American Firewalking Movement<br>

  Author(s): Danforth Loring M.<br>
  Abstract: "If the Saint calls you, if you have an open road, then you don't feel the fire as if it were your enemy," says one of the participants in the Anastenaria. This compelling work evokes and contrasts two forms of firewalking and religious healing: first, the Anastenaria, a northern Greek ritual in which people who are possessed by Saint Constantine dance dramatically over red-hot coals, and, second, American firewalking, one of the more spectacular activities of New Age psychology. Loring Danforth not only analyzes these rituals in light of the most recent work in medical and symbolic anthropology but also describes in detail the lives of individual firewalkers, involving the reader personally in their experiences: he views ritual therapy as a process of transformation and empowerment through which people are metaphorically moved from a state of illness to a state of health. Danforth shows that the Anastenaria and the songs accompanying it allow people to express and resolve conflict-laden family relationships that may lead to certain kinds of illnesses. He also demonstrates how women use the ritual to gain a sense of power and control over their lives without actually challenging the ideology of male dominance that pervades Greek culture. Comparing the Anastenaria with American firewalking, Danforth includes a gripping account of his own participation in a firewalk in rural Maine. Finally he examines the place of anthropology in a postmodern world in which the boundaries between cultures are becoming increasingly blurred.<br>

  Abstract: The Anastenaria is concerned with healing in the broadest sense. It is both a religious ritual and a form of psychotherapy. Any attempt to understand the Anastenaria as a system of religious healing must therefore integrate approaches from medical anthropology with those from the anthropological study of religion. It must bring together the concerns of transcultural psychiatry and those of symbolic anthropology. Such a synthesis, which constitutes an interpretive or hermeneutic approach to the study of ritual therapy, provides the theoretical framework for this study of the Anastenaria.<br>

Also, such ongoing and successful reproduction imposes a sense of cultural legitimacy and a social definition of reality.

Whereas Djebar's early writings were largely an attempt to delineate clearly the experience of being a woman, an intellectual, and an Algerian embedded in that often violent history, she had in her more recent work evinced a growing sense that the influence of French culture on Algerian letters may make such a project impossible.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxpcqw">The Spirit of Luc Boltanski</a><br>
  Author(s) Susen Simon<br>
  Abstract: The discipline of sociology partly originated from a perception of the limitations of political philosophy. The transition to modernity demanded new ways of addressing the questions that political philosophy had typically posed, such as the nature of authority, the conditions of the good life, the definition of justice, the degrees of freedom, and the prerequisites of inclusion in a community. Classical sociological theory reflected the modern appreciation of the independence of ‘the social’ relative to ‘the political’ and the need to understand the internal dynamics of ‘the social’ in their own terms. In a stronger sense, sociological theory suggested that<br>

  Author(s) Susen Simon<br>
  Abstract: Pierre Bourdieu’s conception of habitus marks a theoretical step which no adequate understanding of social reality can ignore. By introducing habitus, Bourdieu is able both to integrate and to transcend major insights of the linguistic turn in philosophy, most prominently the idea that conscious intentional understanding necessarily relies on a host of implicit, practical, and holistic background assumptions which constitute meaning while being themselves unrepresented (Searle, 1989). The concept of habitus incorporates this idea since it shows that individual agency and its self-understanding are constituted by relying on an acquired social sense, the cognitive habitus, which defines how an agent<br>

  Abstract: In analyzing the paradigmatic nature of Pg’s story of the nation in Exod 1–Num 27*, the core trait of this material that defines it as paradigmatic, as unfolded in chapter 3, is the way in which earlier traditions are reshaped and synthesized with unique and visionary elements into a picture, or pictures, that are in a sense timeless, or transcend time, or are relevant for all time. How this hermeneutics of time or sense of timelessness is nuanced over and above this varies between components: whether through repetition of details or stereotypical patterns that suspend or mark time; or<br>

He noted that the symptoms of collective trauma coalesce into a form of syndrome that is more than the injury to each of the individuals combined.¹ He also indicated that there is a spiritual or existential component to such harm, what we might call a collective sense of “broken-spiritedness,” to borrow a term from the psychologist John Wilson, who works with refugees.² Broken-spiritedness refers to massive disruption that interferes with sources of meaning and<br>

Underlying their efforts was a sense of subordination to the West. For all three, the backwardness of the Islamic world had been caused, and exclusively so, by a fixed, inflexible understanding of Islam and the blind imitation of its forefathers. For this reason they demanded a modern interpretation of the Qur’an and of Islamic law that would be appropriate for the altered circumstances. This effort,<br>

However, the desire for a more holistic anthropology, whether of the materialist or non-reductive physicalist variety, is also motivated by a theological suspicion of split-ness itself.

  Book Title: Seamus Heaney as Aesthetic Thinker-A Study of the Prose<br>
  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): MacKillop James<br>
  Abstract: Seamus Heaney’s unexpected death in August 2013 brought to completion his body of work, and scholars are only now coming to understand the full scale and importance of this extraordinary career. The Nobel Prize–winning poet, translator, and playwright from the North of Ireland is considered the most important Irish poet after Yeats and, at the time of his death, arguably the most famous living poet. For this reason, much of the scholarship to date on Heaney has understandably focused on his poetry. O’Brien’s new work, however, focuses on Heaney’s essays, book chapters, and lectures as it seeks to understand how Heaney explored the poet’s role in the world. By examining Heaney’s prose, O’Brien teases out a clearer understanding of Heaney’s sense of the function of poetry as an act of public intellectual and ethical inquiry. In doing so, O’Brien reads Heaney as an aesthetic thinker in the European tradition, considering him alongside Heidegger, Derrida, Lacan, and Adorno. Studying Heaney within this theoretical and philosophical tradition sheds new and useful light on one of the greatest creative minds of the twentieth century.<br>

This sense of poetry as a genre wherein the necessity of “either/or” choices can be replaced with the more encompassing “both/and” alternative further rhizomatically connects Heaney’s thought with Derrida’s, and with other contemporary European thinking, where meaning and signification are viewed as relational as opposed<br>

  Book Title: Placing Aesthetics-Reflections on the Philosophic Tradition<br>
  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wood Robert E.<br>
  Abstract: Examining select high points in the speculative tradition from Plato and Aristotle through the Middle Ages and German tradition to Dewey and Heidegger,
      Placing Aestheticsseeks to locate the aesthetic concern within the larger framework of each thinker's philosophy.In Professor Robert Wood's study, aesthetics is not peripheral but rather central to the speculative tradition and to human existence as such. In Dewey's terms, aesthetics is "experience in its integrity." Its personal ground is in "the heart," which is the dispositional ground formed by genetic, cultural , and personal historical factors by which we are spontaneously moved and, in turn, are inclined to move, both practically and theoretically, in certain directions.Prepared for use by the student as well as the philosopher,Placing Aestheticsaims to recover the fullness of humanness within a sense of the fullness of encompassing Being. It attempts to overcome the splitting of thought, even in philosophy, into exclusive specializations and the fracturing of life itself into theoretical, practical, and emotive dimensions.<br>

  Abstract: In a sense, the history of living organisms may be summed up by their remarkable ability to find solutions that avoid the world's complexity by imposing on it their own rules and functions. Evolution has resolved the problem of complexity not by simplifying but by finding solutions whose processes-though they can sometimes be complex-allow us to act in the midst of complexity and of uncertainty. Nature can inspire us by making us realize that simplification is never simple and requires instead that we choose, refuse, connect, and imagine, in order to act in the best possible manner. Such solutions are already being applied in design and engineering and are significant in biology, medicine, economics, and the behavioral sciences.<br>

                  Zoharrepresent the best of the medieval commentaries that not only became classics but also illustrate different intellectual attitudes toward the Bible and epitomize the main forms of Jewish spirituality of the period. Rashi was the master of the plain sense; the renowned philosopher and astronomer Abraham ibn Ezra opened vistas for understanding the Bible in terms of new forms of knowledge<br>

  Author(s) Changeux Jean-Pierre<br>
  Abstract: Since David Hume (1711–1776), philosophy, as well as common sense, has differentiated science from morality. Science establishes facts (“what is”), whereas morality decides “what should be,” but many admit that we cannot distinguish what should be from what is. I shall consider whether it is plausible to take an opposite, although perhaps rather surprising, approach and ask whether we can favor what should be from our knowledge about what is. In fact, such a question belongs to a long philosophical tradition, including Hume, Henri de Saint-Simon (1760–1825), Auguste Comte, Charles Darwin, and contemporary ethologists. My idea is to<br>

  Abstract: In retrospect,

The film begins with rehearsal footage of the danceWalk, She Said,which gives every appearance of being a minimalist exercise devoted to the exploration of movement as such.¹ Though a rehearsal (and, therefore, by definition something that looks toward the future), this dance, oddly enough, points back to the past—to minimalism with its commitment to a modernist aesthetic of austerity. In a narrow sense, the dance rehearsal points backwards to Rainer’s own<br>

In such cases, it is my claim that the otherness of others is constitutive of his philosophy.

  Abstract: Up to this point I have examined how the metaphor of sin as a debt functioned in late biblical material and some early postbiblical texts. These texts adapted the classical Hebrew vocabulary to fit a radical new way of thinking about sin. But to get the best perspective on this metaphor, I turn to the two living languages of first-century Palestine, the era of Jesus of Nazareth and the early rabbinic sages: they are Mishnaic Hebrew and the Palestinian and Babylonian dialects of Aramaic.

There was an outcry of public horror, though why the public found this particular murder especially shocking is not entirely clear. Children, after all, are only semi-socialised creatures who can be expected to behave pretty savagely from time to time. If Freud is to be credited, they have a weaker superego or moral sense than their elders. In this sense, it is surprising that such grisly events do not occur more often.

  Book Title: The Only Mind Worth Having-Thomas Merton and the Child Mind<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Williams Rowan<br>
  Abstract: In The Only Mind Worth Having, Fiona Gardner takes Thomas Merton’s belief that the child mind is “the only mind worth having" and explores it in the context of Jesus’ challenging, paradoxical, and enigmatic command to become like small children. She demonstrates how Merton’s belief and Jesus’ command can be understood as part of contemporary spirituality and spiritual practice. To follow Christ’s command requires a great leap of the imagination. Gardner examines what it might mean to make this leap when one is an adult without it becoming sentimental and mawkish, or regressive and pathological. Using both psychological and spiritual insights, and drawing on the experiences of Thomas Merton and others, Gardner suggests that in some mysterious and paradoxical way recovering a sense of childhood spirituality is the path towards spiritual maturity. The move from childhood spirituality to adulthood and on to a spiritual maturity through the child mind is a move from innocence to experience to organised innocence, or from dependence to independence to a state of being in-dependence with God.<br>

  Book Title: In/visible War-The Culture of War in Twenty-first-Century America<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): LUCAITES JOHN LOUIS<br>
  Abstract: In/Visible Waraddresses a paradox of twenty-first century American warfare. The contemporary visual American experience of war is ubiquitous, and yet war is simultaneously invisible or absent; we lack a lived sense that "America" is at war. This paradox of in/visibility concerns the gap between the experiences of war zones and the visual, mediated experience of war in public, popular culture, which absents and renders invisible the former. Large portions of the domestic public experience war only at a distance. For these citizens, war seems abstract, or may even seem to have disappeared altogether due to a relative absence of visual images of casualties. Perhaps even more significantly, wars can be fought without sacrifice by the vast majority of Americans.Yet, the normalization of twenty-first century war also renders it highly visible. War is made visible through popular, commercial, mediated culture. The spectacle of war occupies the contemporary public sphere in the forms of celebrations at athletic events and in films, video games, and other media, coming together as MIME, the Military-Industrial-Media-Entertainment Network.<br>

  Book Title: Textual Silence-Unreadability and the Holocaust<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): LANG JESSICA<br>
  Abstract: There are thousands of books that represent the Holocaust, but can, and should, the act of reading these works convey the events of genocide to those who did not experience it? In
      Textual Silence, literary scholar Jessica Lang asserts that language itself is a barrier between the author and the reader in Holocaust texts-and that this barrier is not a lack of substance, but a defining characteristic of the genre.Holocaust texts, which encompass works as diverse as memoirs, novels, poems, and diaries, are traditionally characterized by silences the authors place throughout the text, both deliberately and unconsciously. While a reader may have the desire and will to comprehend the Holocaust, the presence of "textual silence" is a force that removes the experience of genocide from the reader's analysis and imaginative recourse. Lang defines silences as omissions that take many forms, including the use of italics and quotation marks, ellipses and blank pages in poetry, and the presence of unreliable narrators in fiction. While this limits the reader's ability to read in any conventional sense, these silences are not flaws. They are instead a critical presence that forces readers to acknowledge how words and meaning can diverge in the face of events as unimaginable as those of the Holocaust.<br>

  Book Title: Love and its Critics-From the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton’s Eden<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Movsesian Arpi<br>
  Abstract: This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin’amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur’s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself – in short, the very things it resists. The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted. It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.<br>

This fear, particularly as it is represented in the fear of ‘losing one’s mind’ or of developing Alzheimer’s, brings to the fore questions of agency, identity and personhood. When we first wrote about the fourth age, we described it as ‘ageing without agency’ (Gilleard and Higgs, 2010), treating mental decline as a decline in ‘agency’. By so doing we wanted to acknowledge how closely allied fears are of an unwanted old age with fears of losing<br>

  Abstract: More and more people share the experience of migration, in the sense of crossing nation-state borders to start a new life in a different society. Theories of globalisation and postmodernism present this experience as a typical occurrence, almost taken for granted, in the lives of growing numbers of people. Even though migration constitutes the ‘normality’ of many societies to a greater or lesser degree, the public and, not least, the sociopolitical discourses of migration, are still predominantly shaped by the view that the large-scale movement of people somehow constitutes a problem. In the first place, the ‘problem’ of migration within<br>

  Abstract: Political philosophies and practices of ‘localism’ can lead to both progressive and regressive outcomes (Davoudi and Madanipour, 2013; Madanipour and Davoudi, 2015). This chapter discusses whether neighbourhood planning has the potential to bring about more inclusive forms of public participation in, and engagement with, planning (and thus potentially more progressive and socially equitable forms of urban development), or, on the contrary, to stir up social conflict. The social and spatial imaginary that underpins parish and neighbourhood planning entails the idea of a relatively homogeneous, stable, identifiable and self-conscious ‘local community’ that possesses a sense of neighbourhood belonging and attachment and<br>

  Book Title: The Qing Formation in World-Historical Time-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Struve Lynn A.<br>
  Abstract: For many years, the Ming and Qing dynasties have been grouped as “late imperial China," a temporal framework that allows scholars to identify and evaluate indigenous patterns of social, economic, and cultural change initiated in the last century of Ming rule that imparted a particular character to state and society throughout the Qing and into the twentieth century. This paradigm asserts the autonomous character of social change in China and has allowed historians to create a “China-centered history." Recently, however, many scholars have begun emphasizing the singular qualities of the Qing. Among the eight contributors to this volume on the formation of the Qing, those who emphasize the Manchu ethos of the Qing tend to see it as part of an early modernity and stress parallel and sometimes mutually reinforcing patterns of political consolidation and cultural integration across Eurasia. Other contributors who examine the Qing formation from the perspective of those who lived through the dynastic transition see the advent of Qing rule as prompting attempts by the Chinese subjects of the new empire to make sense of what they perceived as a historical disjuncture and to rework these understandings into an accommodation to foreign rule. In contrast to the late imperial paradigm, the new ways of configuring the Qing in historical time in both groups of essays assert the singular qualities of the Qing formation.<br>

  Abstract: The doctrine of divine simplicity has a long history involving complex accounts that interweave philosophy, scripture, and theology. Without a doubt, there is no single doctrine of divine simplicity that remained perfectly unaltered throughout the Christian tradition. Perhaps this is because, as Christopher Stead argues, throughout the early church various senses of divine simplicity were used to speak about God without ever clarifying which sense was in use. In other words, “we must not think that simplicity is itself a simple notion.”¹ However, the simplistic versions of divine simplicity represented in much contemporary theology—primarily from critics—might lead others<br>

  Abstract: A record of the 2015 Building Bridges Seminar for leading Christian and Muslim scholars, this collection of essays explores the nature of divine and human agency through themes of creation's goal, humankind's dignity and task, and notions of sovereignty. Part I sets the context for the book with "Human Action within Divine Creation: A Muslim Perspective" by Mohsen Kadivar of Duke University and "On the Possibility of Holy Living: A Christian Perspective" by Lucy Gardner of Oxford University. The rest of the book includes paired essays-one from a Muslim perspective, one from a Christian perspective-that introduce scriptural material with commentary to aid readers in conducting dialogical study. In her conclusion, coeditor Lucinda Mosher digests the illuminating small-group conversations that lie at the heart of the Building Bridges initiative, conversations that convey a vivid sense of the lively, penetrating but respectful dialogue for which the project is known. This unique volume will be a valuable resource to scholars, students, and professors of Christianity and Islam.<br>

  Abstract: That god created “heaven and earth” or simply “all things” is a fundamental Christian belief, repeatedly stated in scripture and featuring in the ecumenical creeds. It entails an absolute difference between God and all that is not God—absolute in the sense that this difference is incomparable with any of the relative differences between creatures. The difference can be stated in a number of ways. For example, it means that all creatures are utterly dependent on God for their very existence as well as for being the creatures they are and for all that makes for their flourishing.

Traditionally they have also discussed questions of a more abstract, reflective kind: What problems should epistemology investigate? What are the limits of our knowledge?

  Abstract: “Here are some bad verses expressing something even worse,” Fyodor I. Tyutchev (1803–1873) wrote to his wife with reference to his poem of August 6, 1851.² The poem is in no sense a bad one; on the contrary, it is a masterpiece in miniature. Whether it expresses something on the somber or pessimistic side is a question. In any case, Tyutchev’s subjective reaction to his poem does not alter the poem’s independence or its rich poetic and philosophical texture.<br>

Semiotics is general theory of signs which intends to clarify signs and to “make our ideas clear”, while deconstruction stresses the notion of “indecidability” of meaning and intends to refutation of logocentrism. If the rational analysis is still the main method of semiotics, certainly deconstruction focuses on the limits of reason and opens avenue for irrationalism. The<br>

  Abstract: Distinguished feminist philosophers consider the future of their field and chart its political and ethical course in this forward-looking volume. Engaging with themes such as the historical trajectory of feminist phenomenology, ways of perceiving and making sense of the contemporary world, and the feminist body in health and ethics, these essays affirm the base of the discipline as well as open new theoretical spaces for work that bridges bioethics, social identity, physical ability, and the very nature and boundaries of the female body. Entanglements with thinkers such as Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Beauvoir, and Arendt are evident and reveal new directions for productive philosophical work. Grounded in the richness of the feminist philosophical tradition, this work represents a significant opening to the possible futures of feminist phenomenological research.<br>

In this paper, I take the position that representation, understood in the somewhat narrow sense of a referential means of thinking towards an end, can itself be considered as informing a historical age – one that establishes the ground for the age of simulation.<br>

  Book Title: The Axial Age and Its Consequences-  Publisher: Harvard University Press<br>
  Author(s): Joas Hans<br>
  Abstract: This book makes the bold claim that intellectual sophistication was born worldwide during the middle centuries of the first millennium bce. From Axial Age thinkers we inherited a sense of the world as a place not just to experience but to investigate, envision, and alter. A variety of utopian visions emerged and led to both reform and repression.<br>

  Author(s) BELLAH ROBERT N.<br>
  Abstract: Education in its most basic sense is coeval with humanity. In historical societies, as the author of a distinguished study of education in Western antiquity has noted, education can be seen as transmitting “the concentrated epitome of a culture and as such it is inseparable from the form of that culture and perishes with it.”¹ In another sense, however, as the conscious effort to form—and reform—human individuals and society to correspond to ideals of imagined but unrealized possibilities, education is one of the great legacies of the Axial turn. The new human possibilities envisioned by the great Axial<br>

  Abstract: In my discussion of tribal religion I chose three examples for close examination: the Kalapalo, the Australian Aborigines (the Walbiri), and the Navajo. From the thousands of tribal peoples, this choice could not be defended as “representative,” even though each was chosen from a different continent. In considering chiefdoms as the form of organization intermediate between the tribal and the archaic, I chose to look mainly at Polynesia because of the clarity of the record there in which archaeology and ethnography combine to give a sense of development over many centuries, starting with Neolithic villages and ending with an early<br>

  Abstract: The story about Rosebud and Uns al-Wujud the Darling Boy appears in many different editions of the

The protagonists often allude to a legend that gave the mountain its sad name, but their accounts make little sense. (Lane has the jinn happily giving birth to ‘hundreds of children’ – and it is their crying that passing sailors hear. But that would hardly add ‘Grief-Stricken Mother’ to the mountain’s name.)

  Abstract: In his essay “On Transience,” Freud recounts a summer walk through the countryside with a famous poet. The scenery is resplendent, but the poet is haunted by the sense that all the beauty will be destroyed by the passage of time. Everything that may be desired as beautiful bears its own destruction within itself because it is temporal and begins to pass away as soon as it comes to be. The poet’s conclusion is that such temporal finitude deprives beauty of its value. As Freud explains: “All that he would otherwise have loved and admired seemed to him shorn of<br>

This disparity gave critics and reformers their sense of purpose: to illuminate for citizens the difference between the way the world appeared and the way it actually functioned. Following the proclamation of victory in the Iraqi war, however, that sense of purpose became imperiled, along with the trust necessary for maintaining a democratic discourse.

  Book Title: Ethics in Light of Childhood-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wall John<br>
  Abstract: Childhood faces humanity with its own deepest and most perplexing questions. An ethics that truly includes the world's childhoods would transcend pre-modern traditional communities and modern rational autonomy with a postmodern aim of growing responsibility. It would understand human relations in a poetic rather than universalistic sense as openly and interdependently creative. As a consequence, it would produce new understandings of moral being, time, and otherness, as well as of religion, rights, narrative, families, obligation, and power.
      Ethics in Light of Childhoodfundamentally reimagines ethical thought and practice in light of the experiences of the third of humanity who are children. Much like humanism, feminism, womanism, and environmentalism, Wall argues, a new childism is required that transforms moral thinking, relations, and societies in fundamental ways. Wall explores childhood's varied impacts on ethical thinking throughout history, advances the emerging interdisciplinary field of childhood studies, and reexamines basic assumptions in contemporary moral theory and practice. In the process, he does not just apply ethics to childhood but applies childhood to ethics-in order to imagine a more expansive humanity.<br>

  Book Title: Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Descombes Vincent<br>
  Abstract: Offering a critical view of all the texts in which Wittgenstein mentions Freud, Bouveresse immerses us in the intellectual climate of Vienna in the early part of the twentieth century. Although we come to see why Wittgenstein did not view psychoanalysis as a science proper, we are nonetheless made to feel the philosopher's sense of wonder and respect for the cultural task Freud took on as he found new ways meaningfully to discuss human concerns. Intertwined in this story of Wittgenstein's grappling with the theory of the unconscious is the story of how he came to question the authority of science and of philosophy itself. While aiming primarily at the clarification of Wittgenstein's opinion of Freud, Bouveresse's book can be read as a challenge to the French psychoanalytic school of Lacan and as a provocative commentary on cultural authority.<br>

Unfortunately, this hope may be mistaken. Like many similar labels, the termpost-secularitypapers over disputes of interpretation that cannot be brushed aside.

Aquinas and those theorists who followed his method accomplished this rapprochement by redrawing the boundaries between the literal and the spiritual senses of Scripture and assimilating rhetorical language to the literal sense. Aquinas’s critical move has been much studied for its impact on the exegetical theory and practice of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, especially for its new emphasis on the contributions of human authors to Scriptural discourse.

  Abstract: The Middle Ages, which was itself a terminological creation of Renaissance humanism, had a strong sense of the past, as the work of Dante, torn between pagan and Christian Rome (and wanting to enjoy the best of both worlds), abundantly illustrates. Scholars in the Middle Ages also had an appreciation of classical historiography, including the rhetorical forms and values on which this rested. Yet this historical sense was selective and subordinated to deep religious commitments and inhibitions which frustrated both a discriminating perspective on the ancient world and a clear perception of the differences that separated a remote “antiquity” from<br>

  Book Title: Metaphysics in Ordinary Language-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosen Stanley<br>
  Abstract: In this rich collection of philosophical writings, Stanley Rosen addresses a wide range of topics-from eros, poetry, and freedom to problems like negation and the epistemological status of sense perception. Though diverse in subject, Rosen's essays share two unifying principles: there can be no legitimate separation of textual hermeneutics from philosophical analysis, and philosophical investigation must be oriented in terms of everyday language and experience, although it cannot simply remain within these confines. Ordinary experience provides a minimal criterion for the assessment of extraordinary discourses, Rosen argues, and without such a criterion we would have no basis for evaluating conflicting discourses: philosophy would give way to poetry.Philosophical problems are not so deeply embedded in a specific historical context that they cannot be restated in terms as valid for us today as they were for those who formulated them, the author maintains. Rosen shows that the history of philosophy-a story of conflicting interpretations of human life and the structure of intelligibility-is a story that comes to life only when it is rethought in terms of the philosophical problems of our own personal and historical situation.<br>

  Abstract: The expression “fusion of horizons” (
                  Horizontverschmelzung) is the central concept of the universal hermeneutics developed by the German philosopher H. G. Gadamer in his influential bookTruth and Method. It will be the main topic of this essay, but in order to set it into the proper context, I need to say something about Gadamer’s overall enterprise. In so doing I will try to clarify the meaning of hermeneutics and discuss the sense in which it is intended to be universal. This discussion will culminate in a fundamental criticism of Gadamer’s hermeneutics. In the second half of the essay, I<br>

  Book Title: Types of Christian Theology-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Placher William C.<br>
  Abstract: In the book Frei proposes classifying theologians according to whether they see Christian theology primarily as an academic discipline or as an internal activity of Christian communities. He describes fie different variations of these views. the first, represented by Immanuel Kant and Gordon represented, regards theology as a philosophical discipline within the academy. The second, represented by theologians as diverse as represented represented, David Tracy, and Carl Henry, correlates specifically Christian with general cultural structures of meaning. The third type, represetned by represented represented and Paul represented, occupies the middle of the spectrum. The fourth type, represetned by Karl Barth, emphasizes the internal descriptive task of theology but remains open to ad hoc correlations with concerns of the wider culture. the fifth, which includes D. Z. Phillips and other Wittgensteinian fideists, opts for pure self-description though this group defends its position with philosophical arguments that, oddly enough connect it with the other end of the spectrum. Frei argues in favor of the third and fourth options. In his view, theologians like Schleiermacher and, even more, Barth, although often seen as polar opposites, enable theology to remain most faithful to the priority of the ecumenically attested literal sense in biblical interpretation.<br>

  Abstract: It is necessary to refer again to Karl Barth at this point. He proposed that Christian hermeneutics is a procedure whose taxonomy or phenomenology may be very simply set forth in three logically distinct but in fact united elements:
                  explicatio, meditatio, applicatio. Applicatio, the last of these, is for him the transition from the sense to the use of scriptural texts. In his “rules” for using philosophical schemes or some subjective modality in reading, he was talking aboutmeditatio. The proponents of type 5 may be described as saying thatat best, understanding the Bible—and Christian language more generally<br>

  Book Title: On the Nature of Consciousness-Cognitive, Phenomenological, and Transpersonal Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): HUNT HARRY T.<br>
  Abstract: What is the relation between mystical experience and ordinary consciousness, between the principles of modern physics and the patterns of perception in all moving creatures, between our human self-consciousness and the more primary sentience of protozoa? This book pursues an inquiry into consciousness that ranges from ancient Greece to empirical neuro-psychology to the experiential traditions of introspection and meditation. Harry Hunt begins by reviewing the renewed interest in ordinary consciousness and in altered and transpersonal states of consciousness. He then presents competing views of consciousness in cognition, neurophysiology, and animal psychology, developing a view of perceptual awareness as the core of consciousness potentially shared across species. Hunt next brings together the separate strands of neo-realist approaches to perception and thought, the phenomenology of imagery and synesthesia, and cognitive theories of metaphor. He develops an original cognitive theory of mystical experience that combines Buddhist meditative descriptions of consciousness and Heidegger's sense of Being. In relating both of these to James J. Gibson's views on perception, he avoids the various "new age" supernaturalisms that so often blight the transpersonal literature. Other themes include the relation between consciousness and time; the common perceptual-metaphoric rooting of parallels between consciousness and modern physics; and the communal basis of transpersonal states as reflected in a sociology of mysticism and a reinterpretation of parapsychological research.<br>

  Abstract: The words “religious language” (henceforth RL) do not occur in the Hebrew Bible. In philosophy of religion, the concept refers to statements or claims made about divine beings. In that sense the RL of the Hebrew Bible denotes the god-talk of ancient Israelite religion. Most approaches to biblical god-talk in contemporary philosophy of religion have tended to be evaluative, either trying to make biblical god-talk seem philosophically credible or attempting to prove it nonsensical. Few philosophical inquiries are actually interested in the provisioning of a purely descriptive analysis of the RL of the Hebrew Bible for its own sake. This<br>

  Book Title: Aliens and Sojourners-Self as Other in Early Christianity<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DUNNING BENJAMIN H.<br>
  Abstract: Early Christians spoke about themselves as resident aliens, strangers, and sojourners, asserting that otherness is a fundamental part of being Christian. But why did they do so and to what ends? How did Christians' claims to foreign status situate them with respect to each other and to the larger Roman world as the new movement grew and struggled to make sense of its own boundaries?
      Aliens and Sojournersargues that the claim to alien status is not a transparent one. Instead, Benjamin Dunning contends, it shaped a rich, pervasive, variegated discourse of identity in early Christianity. Resident aliens and foreigners had long occupied a conflicted space of both repulsion and desire in ancient thinking. Dunning demonstrates how Christians and others in antiquity capitalized on this tension, refiguring the resident alien as being of a compelling doubleness, simultaneously marginal and potent. Early Christians, he argues, used this refiguration to render Christian identity legible, distinct, and even desirable among the vast range of social and religious identities and practices that proliferated in the ancient Mediterranean. Through close readings of ancient Christian texts such as Hebrews, 1 Peter, theShepherd of Hermas, and theEpistle to Diognetus, Dunning examines the markedly different ways that Christians used the language of their own marginality, articulating a range of options for what it means to be Christian in relation to the Roman social order. His conclusions have implications not only for the study of late antiquity but also for understanding the rhetorics of religious alienation more broadly, both in the ancient world and today.<br>

  Book Title: Detecting Texts-The Metaphysical Detective Story from Poe to Postmodernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Sweeney Susan Elizabeth<br>
  Abstract: Although readers of detective fiction ordinarily expect to learn the mystery's solution at the end, there is another kind of detective story-the history of which encompasses writers as diverse as Poe, Borges, Robbe-Grillet, Auster, and Stephen King-that ends with a question rather than an answer. The detective not only fails to solve the crime, but also confronts insoluble mysteries of interpretation and identity. As the contributors to
      Detecting Textscontend, such stories belong to a distinct genre, the "metaphysical detective story," in which the detective hero's inability to interpret the mystery inevitably casts doubt on the reader's similar attempt to make sense of the text and the world.Detecting Textsincludes an introduction by the editors that defines the metaphysical detective story and traces its history from Poe's classic tales to today's postmodernist experiments. In addition to the editors, contributors include Stephen Bernstein, Joel Black, John T. Irwin, Jeffrey T. Nealon, and others.<br>

Despite the metafictional character of his de-naturing of traditional narratives, his ex-posing of the ideologies concealed behind Western myths, and his interrogation of the hidden structures of thought and feeling (Logos and Eros) in which writer and reader are enmeshed, Robbe-Grillet’s detecting project can itself be generated only from within the traditional frames of language, myth, and feeling.<br>

  Book Title: Sound Souvenirs-Audio Technologies, Memory and Cultural Practices<br>
  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): van Dijck José<br>
  Abstract: In recent decades, the importance of sound for remembering the past and for creating a sense of belonging has been increasingly acknowledged. We keep "sound souvenirs" such as cassette tapes and long play albums in our attics because we want to be able to recreate the music and everyday sounds we once cherished. Artists and ordinary listeners deploy the newest digital audio technologies to recycle past sounds into present tunes. Sound and memory are inextricably intertwined, not just through the commercially exploited nostalgia on oldies radio stations, but through the exchange of valued songs by means of pristine recordings and cultural practices such as collecting, archiving and listing. This book explores several types of cultural practices involving the remembrance and restoration of past sounds. At the same time, it theorizes the cultural meaning of collecting, recycling, reciting, and remembering sound and music. This title is available in the OAPEN Library - http://www.oapen.org.<br>

  Author(s): Weststeijn Thijs<br>
  Abstract: This book is the first step towards the development of a comparative history of the humanities. Specialists in philology, musicology, art history, linguistics, literary theory, and other disciplines highlight the intertwining of the various fields and their impact on the sciences. This first volume in the series The Making of the Humanities focuses on the early modern period. Different perspectives reveal how the humanities developed from the 'liberal arts', via the curriculum of humanistic schools, to modern disciplines. The authors show in particular how discoveries in the humanities contributed to a secular world view, pointing up connections with the scientific revolution. The main themes are: the humanities versus the sciences; the visual arts as liberal arts; humanism and heresy; language and poetics; linguists and logicians; philology and philosophy; the history of history. Contributions come from a selection of internationally renowned European and American scholars, including Floris Cohen, David Cram, and Ingrid Rowland. The book offers a wealth of insights for specialists, students, and those interested in the humanities in a broad sense. This title is available in the OAPEN Library - http://www.oapen.org.<br>

Important messages were conveyed through jokes, wisecracks, and anecdotes. Humorous expressions offered insights into the concepts, concerns, and values of individuals and groups. For more than three decades now, I have heeded Bert Wilson’s admonition<br>

  Abstract: Information and communications technology (ICT) is not a profession in any significant sense, but this is not a slight on ICT. It is, of course, a profession in an insignificant sense. If a person develops software for a living as opposed to doing it as a hobby, that person is a professional software developer. Some people sing for a living and others just for fun. The former are professional singers while the latter are amateurs. In this sense any occupation is a profession insofar as those engaged in it are making a living from it, but this is not what<br>

  Abstract: Jean-Baptiste, Camus’s upstanding citizen who slowly unravels in the wake of a decisive moment of moral paralysis, laments a lost innocence whose recovery is eternally beyond him, and, from his perspective, beyond each of us. In the quoted passage Jean-Baptiste describes the avocation he has taken up, that of a judge-penitent: one who judges others as a way of deflecting introspection and self-diagnosis in service of real reform. Innocence here assumes an almost mythical sense: It pertains not just to freedom from responsibility but also to freedom from the condition of having to be responsible. In lieu of innocence, life<br>

  Author(s) Burke David G.<br>
  Abstract: Why was there such a flowering of religious lyric poetry in England in the seventeenth century, and did the publication of the King James (or Authorized) Version in 1611 have anything to do with it? I think it did, for reasons and in ways I want to explore here. Some aspects of the Reformation and its aftermath in England seem hardly conducive to the development of religious arts—insistence on the single, literal sense of Scripture, iconoclasm, suspicion in some quarters about church music, anxieties about adding to or ornamenting the Word of God in sermons or poems, and the<br>

  Abstract: In the present late liberal, Western context, family and human dignity do not exactly make an ideal pair.¹ It is not unusual to find suggestions that the family is precisely a setting in which human dignity is under threat. This idea is illustrative of current general distrust of the family. At present, the family seems to stand for things that are at odds with central late liberal values: family favors its own members; it provides people with fixed roles that hinder equality and free self-development; and it is in a sense a closed phenomenon, and may as such foster values<br>

These memorials are the products of sustained, well-funded, and organized commemorative efforts, usually supported by an infrastructure of official and/or national bodies, and present an embodiment of Famine memory explicitly intended for wider viewership. As a consequence, many bear the scars of protracted civic negotiation and politicized appropriation, of artistic vision and compromise, and of struggles between competing versions of Irish history and identity.

  Abstract: Because of its knowing exhibitionism, because of its flair, because of its mock-solemn pride in its own achievement, Rochester’s poem ‘Upon Nothing’ brushes aside the kind of readerly interrogation invited by similarly impressive metaphysical displays. If Donne’s ‘Lecture on the Shadow’ or ‘A Nocturnall upon S. Lucie’s Day’ or Marvell’s ‘Definition of Love’, provide a recent generic pedigree for ‘Upon Nothing’, Rochester’s salient improvisation on non-entity requires of its readership qualitatively less imaginative effort to succumb to its arguments and admire its paradoxes. ‘Upon Nothing’ asks, supposing it asks anything of its readers, for a take-it-or-leave-it sense of delightedly amused<br>

  Abstract: This chapter looks at world-making from the viewpoint of one of its constitutive ingredients: solidarity. Solidarity is the substance of a successful world-making, if world-making is defined as the creation of a common universe. It makes sense to think that in order for this common universe to exist, there must be something that holds it together. Here, I will argue that solidarity should not be conceptualized as the ‘something that holds the common universe together’ but rather as the ‘there must be something that holds the common universe together’.

  Abstract: This examination of the family narratives of Asian diasporic subjects gives us a sociohistorical portrait of an increasingly dynamic phenomenon. These stories explain particular histories by juxtaposing public events with private experiences, to reveal the ways families construct (or reconstruct) identity within the experience of diaspora. Giving a sense of cohesion and closure to the lives of grandparents and parents can establish a sense of authority and meaning to the writer’s own life story. Access to these stories also allows readers to understand the development of particular ethnic communities, as the narratives support the production of a history and culture<br>

  Book Title: The Melodrama of Mobility-Women, Talk, and Class in Contemporary South Korea<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): ABELMANN NANCY<br>
  Abstract: How do people make sense of their world in the face of the breakneck speed of contemporary social change? Through the lives and narratives of eight women, The Melodrama of Mobility chronicles South Korea's experience of just such dizzyingly rapid development. Abelmann captures the mood, feeling, and language of a generation and an era while providing a rare window on the personal and social struggles of South Korean modernity. Drawing also from television soap operas and films, she argues that a melodramatic sensibility speaks to South Korea's transformation because it preserves the tension and ambivalence of daily life in unsettled times. The melodramatic mode helps people to wonder: Can individuals be blamed for their social fates? How should we live? Who can say who is good or bad? By combining the ethnographic tools of anthropology, an engagement with prevailing sociological questions, and a literary approach to personal narratives, The Melodrama of Mobility offers a rich portrait of the experience of compressed modernity in the non-West.<br>

  Abstract: Environmental ethics sometimes depends upon ideas of life forms immersed in a surrounding “world.”¹ For Trevor Norris, “world” is the “dynamic relatedness that grounds our identity” (see his essay in this volume). The philosopher Martin Heidegger derives the notion of “world” from his study of Jakob von Uexküll’s biological research, which suggested that different sentient life forms have different experiences of their surroundings, and hence phenomenologically (that is, experientially) different worlds. A “world” in this sense is a zone of things that surround the sentient being, which have various kinds of significance for that being.<br>

  Abstract: Burns explores the rich narrative structure of the trial, beginning with the lawyers' opening statements, which establish opposing moral frameworks in which to interpret the evidence. In the succession of witnesses, stories compete and are held in tension. At some point during the performance, a sense of the right thing to do arises among the jurors. How this happens is at the core of Burns's investigation, which draws on careful descriptions of what trial lawyers do, the rules governing their actions, interpretations of actual trial material, social science findings, and a broad philosophical and political appreciation of the trial as a unique vehicle of American self-government.<br>

Indeed, the modernist endeavor to define personal identity begins by recognizing that the self cannot be derived, but instead, the Cartesian

  Abstract: Based on the assumption that music cannot be described without reference to its meaning, Raymond Monelle proposes that works of the Western classical tradition be analyzed in terms of temporality, subjectivity, and topic theory. Critical of the abstract analysis of musical scores, Monelle argues that the score does not reveal music's
         sense.That sense--what a piece of music says and signifies--can be understood only with reference to history, culture, and the other arts. Thus, music is meaningful in that it signifies cultural temporalities and themes, from the traditional manly heroism of the hunt to military power to postmodern "polyvocality."<br>

  Book Title: Charred Lullabies-Chapters in an Anthropography of Violence<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Daniel E. Valentine<br>
  Abstract: How does an ethnographer write about violence? How can he make sense of violent acts, for himself and for his readers, without compromising its sheer excess and its meaning-defying core? How can he remain a scholarly observer when the country of his birth is engulfed by terror? These are some of the questions that engage Valentine Daniel in this exploration of life and death in contemporary Sri Lanka. In 1983 Daniel "walked into the ashes and mortal residue" of the violence that had occurred in his homeland. His planned project--the study of women's folk songs as ethnohistory--was immediately displaced by the responsibility that he felt had been given to him, by surviving family members and friends of victims, to recount beyond Sri Lanka what he had seen and heard there. Trained to do fieldwork by staying in one place and educated to look for coherence and meaning in human behavior, what does an anthropologist do when he is forced by circumstances to keep moving, searching for reasons he never finds? How does he write an ethnography (or an anthropography, to use the author's term) without transforming it into a pornography of violence? In avoiding fattening the anthropography into prurience, how does he avoid flattening it with theory? The ways in which Daniel grapples with these questions, and their answers, instill this groundbreaking book with a rare sense of passion, purpose, and intellect.<br>

The nation-state too promises to bring forth order out of disorder, mold form from that in which form is absent. But even though this order may be posited as a future hope, something to be achieved in the making, this hope is drenched in nostalgia, the imagined glory that once was. In South Asia<br>

  Abstract: In his monumental history of India (1817), British philosopher James Mill devotes more than two-thirds of the preface to refuting the charge that a man who has never visited the subcontinent or learned its languages is unsuited to the task of writing Indian history. Mill insists that what some might regard as parochialism is in fact a virtue, for his critical faculties and judiciousness require insulation from the ʺpartial impressionsʺ and distortions characteristic of firsthand sense perception.

  Book Title: War at a Distance-Romanticism and the Making of Modern Wartime<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Favret Mary A.<br>
  Abstract: Favret examines wartime literature and art as varied as meditations on the
      Iliad, the history of meteorology, landscape painting in India, and popular poetry in newspapers and periodicals; she locates the embedded sense of war and dislocation in works ranging from Austen, Coleridge, and Wordsworth to Woolf, Stevens, and Sebald; and she contemplates how literature provides the public with methods for responding to violent calamities happening elsewhere. Bringing to light Romanticism's legacy in reflections on modern warfare, this book shows that war's absent presence affects home in deep and irrevocable ways.<br>

  Abstract: Perhaps, these lyric poems propose, the weather can serve as a forceful wartime medium, broadcasting the voices or at least the sounds of distant violence, carrying in its currents an audible, palpable sense of suffering elsewhere. This was one way war at a distance could invade—affectively and effectively—the home front. An air-borne sense of suffering, however, escaped like involuntary sighs or moans from a growing, more rationalized understanding of global weather and global war. The new meteorology aimed to regularize violent extremes into an intelligible system, less felt than observed, and predicated on a predictable and continuous nature.<br>

  Book Title: Circles Disturbed-The Interplay of Mathematics and Narrative<br>

  Author(s): MAZUR BARRY<br>
  Abstract: Circles Disturbedbrings together important thinkers in mathematics, history, and philosophy to explore the relationship between mathematics and narrative. The book's title recalls the last words of the great Greek mathematician Archimedes before he was slain by a Roman soldier--"Don't disturb my circles"--words that seem to refer to two radically different concerns: that of the practical person living in the concrete world of reality, and that of the theoretician lost in a world of abstraction. Stories and theorems are, in a sense, the natural languages of these two worlds--stories representing the way we act and interact, and theorems giving us pure thought, distilled from the hustle and bustle of reality. Yet, though the voices of stories and theorems seem totally different, they share profound connections and similarities.<br>

His arguments move between the poles of immanence and transcendence, correlative limits of thought, which, he suggests, can only be imagined by means of unreason. In a sense they move between the inward and outward extremes proposed by Edward Thomas and T.S.

  Book Title: Russian Experimental Fiction-Resisting Ideology after Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clowes Edith W.<br>
  Abstract: In the three decades following Stalin's death, major underground Russian writers have subverted Soviet ideology by using parody to draw attention to its basis in utopian thought. Referring to utopian writing as diverse as Defoe's
         Robinson Crusoe, Dostoevsky'sNotes from Underground, and Orwell'sAnimal Farm, they have tested notions of truth, reality, and representation. They have gone beyond their precursors by experimenting with the tensions between ludic and didactic art. Edith Clowes explores these "meta-utopian" narratives, which address a wide range of attitudes toward utopia, to expose the challenge that literary play poses to dogmatism and to elucidate the sense of renewal it can bring to social imagination. Using both structural analysis and reception theory, she introduces readers outside Russia to a fascinating body of literature that includes Aleksandr Zinoviev'sThe Yawning Heights, Abram Terts'sLiubimov, Vladimir Voinovich'sMoscow 2042, and Liudmila Petrushevskaia's "The New Robinsons.".<br>

  Abstract: Among the canonical markers of utopian writing is the ambiguous location of the ideal society in space and time. Thus, a good point of departure for a discussion of meta-utopian fiction will be a definition of it in terms of its treatment of spatial and temporal dimensions. Moreover, the positioning of plot events in a matrix of space and time, what Bakhtin calls “chronotope,” lays the coordinates for a sustained valuative framework.¹ Chronotopes can give a palpable sense of the ideological project central to meta-utopian fiction. This fiction is about liberation from spatial and temporal stasis. It is about the<br>

  Book Title: Poetics of Reading-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): WIMMERS INGE CROSMAN<br>
  Abstract: What happens when we read novels and how do we make sense of them? Inge Wimmers explores these questions by developing a flexible poetics of reading that generously opens up the interpretive space between reader and text, while drawing on current theories of reading and combining rhetorical, pragmatic, and phenomenological approaches. "Poetics," here, is extended beyond the study of purely textual features to structures of exchange between text and reader. In a discussion of four major French novels from the seventeenth century to the present, the author not only sets up a broad-based poetics but also makes important contributions to contemporary issues in the study of narrative. Wimmers introduces the concept of multiple, interlocking frames of reference that allows for the integration of diverse critical perspectives. Analyzing La Princesse de Cleves, Madame Bovary, A la recherche du temps perdu, and Projet pour une revolution a New York, she shows how texts provide some frames of reference, while others are produced by the reader's disposition and cultural milieu.<br>

  Abstract: In light of a renewed interest in the study of nationalism, Contemporary Majority Nationalism brings together a group of major scholars committed to making sense of this widespread phenomenon. To better illustrate the reality of majority nationalism and the way it has been expressed, authors combine analytical and comparative perspectives. In the first section, contributors highlight the paradox of majority nationalism and the ways in which collective identities become national identities. The second section offers in-depth case study analyses of France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Canada, and the United States. This book is an international project led by three members of the Research Group on Plurinational Societies based at Université du Québec à Montréal.

However, whereas Ernest Gellner said of nationalism that it is able to invent nations even where they do not exist, Anderson (1983, 6) asserts that the process of nation-creating is not so much one of false fabrication as it is one of active creation: in a sense there are no “true” communities that can be juxtaposed to “false,” or invented,<br>

  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Goodheart Eugene<br>
  Abstract: Eugene Goodheart examines the skeptic disposition that has informed advanced literary discourse over the past generation, arguing that the targets of deconstructive suspicion are fundamental humanistic values. "[This book] is a fair-minded, generous critique of the deconstructionist theories of Jacques Derrida, Paul de Man, and their followers. These writers have argued that language is so inherently slippery it can never express a speaker's intended meaning. The critic's role, in their view, is to explore the contradictions, subtexts, and metaphorical byways of works that may be most radically deceptive when they appear simple. Critics have castigated this language-centered skepticism as a form of nihilism geared to multiply numbingly similar readings of already familiar texts. Mr. Goodheart's objection is more subtle. He suggests that the philosophical orientation of deconstructive critics leads them to overemphasize the tricky propositional sense of words at the expense of the broader impact of literature--its power to wound, thrill, or transform us."--Morris Dickstein, The New York Times Book Review<br>

  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>

  Abstract: Barton Friedman demonstrates the ways in which English men of letters in the nineteenth century attempted to grasp the dynamics of history and to fashion order, however fragile, out of its apparent chaos. The authors he discusses--Blake, Scott, Hazlitt, Carlyle, Dickens, and Hardy--found in the French Revolution an event more compelling as a paradigm of history than their own "Glorious Revolution." To them the French Revolution seemed universally significant--a microcosm, in short. For these writers maintaining the distinction between "history" and "fiction" was less important than making sense of epochal historical events in symbolic terms. Their works on the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars occupy the boundary between history and fiction, and Fabricating History advances the current lively discussion of that boundary.<br>

Transdisciplinarity is a dynamic process, not a static event, and it is one which will continue to need increasingly deep, broad, and diverse contributions. Transdisciplinarity is an idea whose time has come and one whose time will remain.<br>

  Abstract: To work in the humanities, particularly in early modern studies, forces upon us a double sense of time: on the one hand, all documents and monuments from even the most distant past, at least those that have been stored, preserved, printed, discovered, reclaimed, are at our disposal in a kind of eternal present, and we feel a kinship with all these creations of human imagination; on the other, when we attempt to make them our own, we very quickly discover the immensity of distance to be bridged and that, in order to exist in history, the phenomena of the past<br>

  Abstract: I began this study by suggesting one response to the question of why so many of Canada’s acclaimed novelists begin and continue as poets. For Cohen, Ondaatje, Bowering, Marlatt, and Carson, the long poem facilitated the transition from the lyric to the novel by allowing them to develop serial forms of narrative that can convey a sense of duration without sacrificing the intensity and concision of the lyric. The authors apply these serial techniques differently in their novels and address particular regional, political, and aesthetic concerns, which has garnered them acclaim in diverse quarters.<br>

  Abstract: This paper is intended to clarify the sense in which Nietzsche may be said to engage in a rhetoric of nihilism. The topic will be explored by way of a comparison between Plato and Nietzsche. The first step in articulating the structure of the investigation is to distinguish two different senses of the expression “rhetoric of nihilism.” This distinction will lead directly to an explanation of the pertinence of the comparison just proposed.<br>

  Abstract: When, in the early 1950s, I began working on Shelley, among the models I used was Dante’s notion of four levels in his

Shelley, I knew, did not believe in a Supreme Cause. He was, as C.E. Pulos has demonstrated, sufficiently a Humean sceptic to question the very idea of causality, finding the only empirical evidence for it in the associational workings of the human mind.²<br>

Generally, critics writing about Bishop have used the question of time to buttress arguments about the “mind thinking”: the notion that Bishop’s goal is to capture the feeling of a mind in the process of working out a thought rather than a mind relating a fully formed idea.

  Book Title: The Sense of the Universe-Philosophical Explication of Theological Commitment in Modern Cosmology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Nesteruk Alexei V.<br>
  Abstract: The Sense of the Universe deals with existential and phenomenological reflection upon modern cosmology with the aim to reveal hidden theological commitments in cosmology related to the mystery of human existence. The book proposes a new approach to the dialogue between science and theology based in a thorough philosophical analysis of acting forms of subjectivity involved in the study of the world and in religious experience. The uniqueness of this book is that it uses recent advances in phenomenological philosophy and philosophical theology in order to accentuate the existential meaning of cosmology as the discourse that ultimately explicates the human condition. The objective of the book is not to make a comparative analysis of the cosmological scientific narrative and that of the Bible, or the Fathers of the Church (in what concerns the structure of the universe), but to reveal the presence of a hidden theological dimension in cosmology originating in the God-given ability of humanity to discern and disclose the sense of creation. The book contributes to the synthesis of appropriation and incorporation of modern philosophical ideas in Christian theology, in particular its Eastern Orthodox form.<br>

  Abstract: The objective of this book was to reformulate the sense of mediation between theology and cosmology, by explicating a simple truth that both, theology and cosmology, are products of one and the same human subjectivity, so that no intrinsic existential contradiction between two types of experience (that is, of God and the universe) is possible. Correspondingly, it was argued that theology and cosmology are intertwined in the sense that each of them functions in the conditions of the implicit influence of the other. Indeed, for theology to be possible at all one needs theologians, that is, embodied human persons. Hence<br>

  Book Title: Parables Unplugged-Reading the Lukan Parables in Their Rhetorical Context<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Thurén Lauri<br>
  Abstract: For far too long, Lauri Thurén argues, the parables of Jesus have been read either as allegories encoding Christian theology—including the theological message of one or another Gospel writer—or as tantalizing clues to the authentic voice of Jesus. Thurén proposes instead to read the parables “unplugged” from any assumptions beyond those given in the narrative situation in the text, on the common-sense premise that the very form of the parable works to propose a (sometimes startling) resolution to a particular problem. Thurén applies his method to the parables in Luke with some surprising results involving the Evangelist’s overall narrative purposes and the discrete purposes of individual parables in supporting the authority of Jesus, proclaiming God’s love, exhorting steadfastness, and so on. Eschatological and allegorical readings are equally unlikely, according to Thurén’s results. This study is sure to spark learned discussion among scholars, preachers, and students for years to come.<br>

  Book Title: Dark Traces of the Past-Psychoanalysis and Historical Thinking<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Rüsen Jörn<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between historical studies and psychoanalysis remains an open debate that is full of tension, in both a positive and a negative sense. In particular, the following question has not been answered satisfactorily: what distinguishes a psychoanalytically oriented study of historical realities from a historical psychoanalysis? Skepticism and fear of collaboration dominate on both sides. Initiating a productive dialogue between historical studies and psychoanalysis seems to be plagued by ignorance and, at times, a sense of helplessness. Interdisciplinary collaborations are rare. Empirical research, formulation of theory, and the development of methods are essentially carried out within the conventional disciplinary boundaries. This volume undertakes to overcome these limitations by combining psychoanalytical and historical perspectives and thus exploring the underlying "unconscious" dimensions and by informing academic and nonacademic forms of historical memory. Moreover, it puts special emphasis on transgenerational forms of remembrance, on the notion of trauma as a key concept in this field, and on case studies that point the way to further research.<br>

  Abstract: In societies that experience catastrophic events, numerous practices are aimed at endowing those events with meaning. The contingent nature of a catastrophe and the disorder it creates are inconsistent with the human sense of reason and provoke anxiety. To overcome the anxiety and limit the disorder, societies generally seek to reestablish order by explaining the catastrophe and by evaluating it, narrating it, commemorating it, and trying to prevent its repetition. All of these processes enable people to deal actively with the disorienting event and to convert disorder into order (Balandier 1988).<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdgkf">Academic Anthropology and the Museum</a><br>
  Author(s) Ames Michael M.<br>
  Abstract: One feature¹ of a museum is the performative naturalisation of ‘objective’ relations between a state² and ‘its’ culture or master narrative of descent, through changing, and sometimes deceptively diffuse and decentralised means (Duncan and Wallach 1980, Hooper Greenhill 1992).³ A museum’s task is to construct a shifting multiplicity of tableaux vivants as facets or dimensions of the state.⁴ The Israel Museum in Jerusalem is exemplary:⁵ science and evolution validate the narrative of descent and warrant the cultural-historical blue-print. The cradle of civilisation is presented through archaeology, sacred texts⁶, history, contemporary art, and prestigious travelling exhibitions.⁷ Exhibits convey a sense of<br>

  Author(s) VISSER-FUCHS Livia<br>
  Abstract: Books make great gifts. In fact, a book is always a double gift: an object, and a text. These days such a gift is a relatively straightforward affair, in the sense that there are plenty of books on offer, which is evidently not to say that giving a book is always a cheap option. Beautifully bound volumes printed on high-quality paper can cost an arm and a leg, not to mention the time and brainspace that has to be invested in selecting a book whose worth the recipient will be able to properly appreciate.<br>

  Author(s) Alen André<br>
  Abstract: In our “enlightened” times, the concept of dogma has acquired a rather negative connotation. Most people seem to believe that we should not accept dogma(ta) without constant, or at least potential critical reflection¹. Even so, dogma continues to be relied upon in certain areas of life where we strive for a form of authoritative certitude, such as religion, or law. It seems as if our quest for stability here warrants the use of a modus of a thought that builds upon a set of premises that are accepted without constant critical re-examination, as authoritative. Dogma, in that very broad sense,<br>

  Book Title: Islam & Europe-Crises are Challenges<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): SHAH Prakash<br>
  Abstract: Within the framework of the Forum A. & A Leysen, several experts from in and outside the Muslim world contributed to this book. In Islam and Europe: Crises Are Challenges they discuss how dialogues between Islam and the West, with a focus on Europe, can be achieved. The various authors (legal scholars, political theorists, social scientists, and psychologists) explore in these collected essays such interrelated questions as: How much diversity is permissible within a liberal pluralistic democratic society? How strong are the implications of citizenship? What are equitable accommodations of contested practices? They argue for an adequate understanding of how Western Muslim communities in Europe experience their minority position and what needs to be done to improve their participation in European society. The second part of this volume is a collection of papers written around the work of Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, who also makes his own contribution to the book. The Catholic University of Leuven awarded An-Na'im an honorary doctorate in 2009 on the theme of multiculturalism, intercultural relations and diversity. An-Na'im is recognized the world over as a leading expert in the area of religion and law, and as a human rights activist. Islam and Europe: Crises Are Challenges reinforces our sense that a better knowledge and awareness of the growing diversity of our society, and striving for harmonious relations between Islam and the West, are among the most important challenges of our time. With contributions by: Ahmed Aboutaleb, Durre S. Ahmed, Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, Shaheen Sardar Ali, Mohamed Benzakour, Jean-Yves Carlier, Marie-Claire Foblets, Ziba Mir-Hosseini, Fouad Laroui, Bettina Leysen, Rashida Manjoo, Bhikhu Parekh, Mathias Rohe, Cedric Ryngaert, Prakash Shah.

  Author(s) Benzakour Mohammed<br>
  Abstract: Most Muslim societies lack a well established regime of human rights, and the more religious they are, the weaker is that regime. this needs to be explained. the explanation is to be found at various levels, such as the history of these societies, their level of economic development, their inequalities and injustices, their colonial history, contemporary international context, and the critical resources of Islam. In this essay, I critically examine the simple minded but widely held view that the problem lies within Islam itself in the sense that its theology and view of human life are inherently incompatible with human<br>

  Reflections on the Moral Reception of Synthetic Biology from:

  Author(s) Evans John H.<br>
  Abstract: The developments associated with synthetic biology and other new genetic technologies raise profound questions in many different areas. Among others, they touch on issues of religion, metaphysics, and morality. Without in any way denigrating the importance of these deep and weighty issues, I am going to argue that the answers we give to these questions are largely independent of the answers we give to another set of concerns—those of public policy. Our answers to theological, to metaphysical, and in an important sense to moral questions about the technologies associated with genetic manipulation should not have any

  Abstract: Cultivation is dirty work. It entails everyday patience and impatience, care and carelessness, conversation, gesture, housecleaning, grocery shopping, taking out the trash, pulling weeds, making dinner, putting kids to bed, trying to listen to a friend when you don’t really have it in you, attending to the pain of a loved one. All in all, cultivation is a process of commitment.

  Abstract: At a conference on narrative and virtue I had an encounter with a philosopher that raises the problem with which I wish to deal. My philosophical counterpart is a Piercian who is also a committed Jew. In his paper he had argued that most of the rational paradigms accepted by contemporary philosophy cannot make sense of Judaism. We began by exchanging views about why current ethical theory seems so committed to foundationalist epistemological assumptions. We shared in general a sympathy with antifoundationalist arguments though neither of us wanted to give up any possibility of some more modest realist epistemology. We<br>

  Abstract: The word “theory” appears in Raymond Williams’s original
                  Keywords(1976). He traces its origins back to the Greektheoros, meaning “spectator,” with its root inthea, for “sight,” which also gave us “theater.” As more recent commentators put it, “[T]he literal sense of looking has then been metaphorized to that of contemplating or speculating” (Wolfreys et al. 2006). The term became increasingly opposed to “practice,” not only as something removed from the everyday, but also as something involved in attempts to explain and model the everyday.

  Book Title: 22 Ideas to Fix the World-Conversations with the World's Foremost Thinkers<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Sakwa Richard<br>
  Abstract: The aftershocks of the 2008 financial crisis still reverberate throughout the globe. Markets are down, unemployment is up, and nations from Greece to Ireland find their very infrastructure on the brink of collapse. There is also a crisis in the management of global affairs, with the institutions of global governance challenged as never before, accompanied by conflicts ranging from Syria, to Iran, to Mali. Domestically, the bases for democratic legitimacy, social sustainability, and environmental adaptability are also changing. In this unique volume from the World Public Forum Dialogue of Civilizations and the Social Science Research Council, some of the world's greatest minds - from Nobel Prize winners to long-time activists - explore what the prolonged instability of the so-called Great Recession means for our traditional understanding of how governments can and should function. Through interviews that are sure to spark lively debate,22 Ideas to Fix the Worldpresents both analysis of past geopolitical events and possible solutions and predictions for the future.The book surveys issues relevant to the U.S., Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Speaking from a variety of perspectives, including economic, social, developmental, and political, the discussions here increase our understanding of what's wrong with the world and how to get it right. Interviewees explore topics like the Arab Spring, the influence of international financial organizations, the possibilities for the growth of democracy, the acceleration of global warming, and how to develop enforceable standards for market and social regulation. These inspiring exchanges from some of our most sophisticated thinkers on world policy are honest, brief, and easily understood, presenting thought-provoking ideas in a clear and accessible manner that cuts through the academic jargon that too often obscures more than it reveals.22 Ideas to Fix the Worldis living history in the finest sense - a lasting chronicle ~<br>

This is a strategy to engage the propositions of social scientists in their efforts to come to terms with situations that bear little or no resemblance to the refined abstractions of liberalism, where the state represents the condensation of the relations of social forces, organizes the power bloc, and balances sectorial relations to construct a popular national will that displaces class struggle through the construction of a general interest and common sense.

The loss of points of reference, of the feeling of belonging, combined with an abrupt break in the continuity and evolution of a person’s life, are overwhelming and can lead to an acute sense of disorientation and chaos, especially if the person is a writer.<br>

Yet such has been the flattering reaction to my own modest contribution to the debate about whether or not Kierkegaard should be classed as a ‘narrativist’ in any interesting sense (Lippitt 2005, 2007). Both John J. Davenport (the author of the book in question) and Anthony Rudd have in recent work sought to clarify the conception of ‘narrative’ that they see as operative in Kierkegaard (Davenport 2011, 2012; Rudd 2007b, 2008a, 2012). In doing so, both have revised and qualified their positions in various respects,<br>

  Author(s) Horton Andrew<br>
  Abstract: An essential (albeit controversial) point should immediately be made clear: the work of Angelopoulos is not ‘modernist’ in the sense that Anglo-Saxon critics have given to this term to qualify, in art history, a time past, but still belonging to modernity.¹ From end to end, Angelopoulos’ work is, in fact, traversed by history. Yet modernity is defined precisely by our awareness of unsurpassable historicity. In the words of Jacques Rancière, we have entered into the ‘ age of history’. He adds that it is also the ‘age of cinema’, as this late art possesses a singular power of ‘historicity and<br>

  Abstract: A properly critical medical humanities is also a historically grounded medical humanities. Such historical grounding requires taking a long cultural perspective, going beyond traditional medical history – typically the history of disease, treatment and practice – to trace the origins and development of the ideas that underpin medicine in its broadest sense – ideas concerning the most fundamental aspects of human existence: health and illness, body and mind, gender and family, care and community.¹ Historical sources can only go so far in illuminating such topics; we must also look to other cultural texts, and in particular literary texts, which, through their imaginative worlds,<br>

  Abstract: The problem of the relationship between words and things and, within the word, the difference between word and idea, has exercised more than twenty-five centuries of thought. The problem in grasping what is at stake in these relations and the differences that animate them lies in the fact that the only way to approach them is through the inherited concepts themselves: word, thing, idea. Couplings like form and matter, form and meaning, syntax and semantics, signifier and signified all owe their senses (we must not I suppose exclude sense and reference) to this ancient framework.

  Abstract: Broadly speaking, the term ‘structure’ has functioned as a password for many human sciences and provided them with a unified program. Where does the concept ‘structuralism’ come from, that caused so much passion and opprobrium? The term initially had an architectural sense deriving from ‘structure,’ which designated the manner in which an edifice is built. (
                  Dictionaire de Trévoux, edition of 1771) During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the meaning of the term ‘structure’ was modified and enlarged by analogy with living beings: language, for Vaugelas and Bernot, is like the construction that Fontenelle attributes to a man’s body.

  Abstract: The origins of this essay derive from the attempt to make sense of a certain resistance to Jacques Rancière’s work that I have encountered at film studies conferences in the United States. As I see it, this resistance can be traced to what is seen as a tension or contradiction between Rancière as the self-proclaimed amateur advocating for universal equality on the one hand, and what are perceived as the trappings of cultural distinction that mark his writings on cinema on the other – specifically the familiar auteurist pantheon that makes up the films he focuses on and, perhaps more significantly,<br>

It involves a variety of activities that include visiting museums and heritage sites, watching history programmes on television, collecting antiques and compiling a family history. Over the past thirty years, the development of popular interest in the past, in these and many other ways, has grown up alongside the development in academic life of a sceptical questioning of the value of historical enquiry and a drastic suspicion about the very grounds on which history is represented.

As the first of the three models of Difference analysed by Laruelle, Nietzschean Difference may be considered in an important sense as the base or standard model for the analysis overall.¹ Nietzschean Difference represents, from this point of view, the more general philosophical platform upon which the other, more specialised models of Difference will be constructed.

  Abstract: Evil in contemporary politics has an important rhetorical dimension. Whenever instances of wrongdoing are contested in the public realm, the relevant actors are liable to call upon a familiar store of resources for persuading audiences to respond in particular ways. These resources can be expected to consist in recognisable rhetorical tropes and figures, a predictable range of ‘commonplaces’, and the manipulation of definitions according to recurring patterns of argument. They can be envisaged to entail, too, the arousal of a characteristic series of emotions. The actors themselves, in the relevant sense, might also be variously composed. They may be perpetrators<br>

Snow’s notion of ‘the two cultures’ is a testament, no doubt, to the evocativeness and apparent continued aptness of the phrase, but also, one suspects, to the sense of scandal that has always attended it: its acknowledgement, that is, of extensive ignorance and provincialism among the educated classes and its image of the academy as divided into two mutually suspicious or indeed warring tribes. The intellectual map has shifted in important ways since Snow’s essay was first published, and his account of the differences between natural scientists and the group he called ‘literary intellectuals’ appears increasingly<br>

  Abstract: Badiou’s work constitutes one of the rare examples in current theorizing of a post-foundational philosophical 
                  system – and there is hardly a contradiction here between a post-foundational stance and systematic philosophy. For Badiou, true philosophy is always systematic, yet it is not systematic in the sense of being centered around a keystone: ‘if by “system” you mean, first, that philosophy is conceived as an argumentative discipline with a requirement of coherence, and second, that philosophy never takes the form of a singular body of knowledge but, to use my own vocabulary, exists conditionally with respect to a complex set of truths,<br>

  Abstract: In a complex world there is often a tendency to try to make politics as simple as possible. This tendency is evident, for example, in the cases of journalists seeking to explain events and situations to uninitiated recipients, intellectuals in the social sciences trying to identify grand theories that can make sense of a multiplicity of diverse phenomena, and politicians wanting to identify solutions to problems and events so that they will harness electoral support. In all these instances it is possible to identify efforts to explain issues by reducing them to a simplified calculus which then enables the process<br>

  Book Title: The Unexpected-Narrative Temporality and the Philosophy of Surprise<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Currie Mark<br>
  Abstract: This new study asks how stories affect the way we think about time and, in particular, how they condition thinking about the future. Focusing on surprise and the unforeseeable, the book argues that stories are mechanisms that reconcile what is taking place with what will have been. This relation between the present and the future perfect offers a grammatical formula quite different from our default notions of narrative as recollection or recapitulation. It promises new understandings of the reading process within the strange logic of a future that is already complete. It also points beyond that to some of the key temporal concepts of our epoch: prediction and unpredictability, uncertainty, the event, the untimely and the messianic. The argument is worked out in new readings of Sarah Waters’ Fingersmith, Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go and Julian Barnes’ The Sense of an Ending.Key Features: An original discussion of the relation of time and narrativeAn important intervention in narratologyA striking general argument about the workings of the mindProvides an overview of the question of surprise in philosophy and literature<br>

  Abstract: ‘I cannot predict what is going to happen’, Bergson says, ‘but I foresee that I am going to have known it.’ This empty foresight offers a grammatical form, the future perfect, which links together the structure of an existential moment, the engagement with a fictional plot, and contemporary epochal self-consciousness. In 1977, Robert Champigny published a philosophical study of mystery stories titled
                  What Will Have Happened, a tense form that creates a conjunction between a prospective present and the retrospective future. Speaking of the investigative sequence of a mystery story or detective fiction, what makes aesthetic sense for Champigny ‘is<br>

  Book Title: Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clemens Justin<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis was the most important intellectual development of the twentieth century, which left no practice from psychiatry to philosophy to politics untouched. Yet it was also in many ways an untouchable project, caught between science and poetry, medicine and hermeneutics. This unsettled, unsettling status has recently induced the philosopher Alain Badiou to characterise psychoanalysis as an ‘antiphilosophy’, that is, as a practice that issues the strongest possible challenges to thought. Justin Clemens takes up the challenge of this denomination here, by re-examining a series of crucial psychoanalytic themes: addiction, fanaticism, love, slavery and torture. Drawing from the work of Freud, Lacan, Badiou, Agamben and others, 'Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy' offers a radical reconstruction of the operations and import of key psychoanalytic concepts and a renewed sense of the indispensable powers of psychoanalysis for today.<br>

  Abstract: Having established slavery as a key antiphilosophical theme – whether considered primarily as an essential possibility of the animal body or as a necessity of the political one – I turn here to one of the extant ancient practices of ‘slave-speech’, those texts commonly generically recognised as ‘Aesopic fables’. I will argue here that ‘the Aesopic’ is always intimately connected with the problem of slavery, ‘real’ slavery, slavery in a real political sense. But the Aesopic is not simply the discourse of the slave as such; it is rather a discourse that is at once the expression and evidence of<br>

  Book Title: Travellers' Tales of Wonder-Chatwin, Naipaul, Sebald<br>

  Author(s): Cooke Simon<br>
  Abstract: Exploring travellers’ tales of wonder in contemporary literature, this study challenges a sensibility of disenchantment with travel. It reassesses travel writing as an aesthetically and ethically innovative form in contemporary international literature, and demonstrates the crucial role of wonder in the travel narratives of writers such as Bruce Chatwin, V.S. Naipaul, and W.G. Sebald. Their ‘travellers’ tales of wonder’ are read as a challenge to the hubris of thinking the world too well known, and an invitation to encounter the world – including its most troubling histories – with a sense of wonder.Key FeaturesReassesses the place of travel writing in literary history to argue that the genre is important as a site of aesthetic innovation and ethical engagement in contemporary literatureDemonstrates the central role of wonder in travel accounts often regarded as narratives of disenchantmentExplores the way travellers’ tales of wonder recover and renew ancient and early modern forms in approaching modern and contemporary issuesOffers new, in-depth readings of the work of three major writers, in each case drawing on as yet unpublished results of archival research<br>

  Book Title: Material Inscriptions-Rhetorical Reading in Practice and Theory<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Warminski Andrzej<br>
  Abstract: This monograph provides readings of literary and philosophical texts that work through the rhetoric of tropes to the material inscription at the origin of these texts. The book focuses on the practice and pedagogical value of rhetorical reading. Its readings follow an itinerary from poetic texts (such as those by Wordsworth and Keats) through theoretical or philosophical texts (by Descartes and Nietzsche) to narrative fiction (by Henry James). The book also contains two essays on Paul de Man and literary theory and an interview on the topic of "Deconstruction at Yale." All three of these latter texts are explicitly about the inescapable function and importance of the rhetoric of tropes for any critical reading or literary study worthy of the name. As Andrzej Warminski demonstrates, ‘rhetorical reading’ is a species of ‘deconstructive reading’—in the full ‘de Manian’ sense—but one that, rather than harkening back to a past over and done with, would open the texts to a different future. Key Features: New readings of texts by Wordsworth, Keats, Descartes, Nietzsche, and Henry James Essays and an interview on Paul de Man and ‘Deconstruction at Yale’ Reflects on and exemplifies the pedagogical value of ‘de Manian’ rhetorical reading Attempts to open a future for 'deconstructive' or 'de Manian' reading<br>

  Book Title: Utopia in Performance-Finding Hope at the Theater<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Dolan Jill<br>
  Abstract: "Jill Dolan is the theatre's most astute critic, and this new book is perhaps her most important. Utopia in Performance argues with eloquence and insight how theatre makes a difference, and in the process demonstrates that scholarship matters, too. It is a book that readers will cherish and hold close as a personal favorite, and that scholars will cite for years to come."---David Román, University of Southern CaliforniaWhat is it about performance that draws people to sit and listen attentively in a theater, hoping to be moved and provoked, challenged and comforted? In
      Utopia in Performance, Jill Dolan traces the sense of visceral, emotional, and social connection that we experience at such times, connections that allow us to feel for a moment not what a better world might look like, but what it might feel like, and how that hopeful utopic sentiment might become motivation for social change.She traces these "utopian performatives" in a range of performances, including the solo performances of feminist artists Holly Hughes, Deb Margolin, and Peggy Shaw; multicharacter solo performances by Lily Tomlin, Danny Hoch, and Anna Deavere Smith; the slam poetry event Def Poetry Jam; The Laramie Project; Blanket, a performance by postmodern choreographer Ann Carlson; Metamorphoses by Mary Zimmerman; and Deborah Warner's production of Medea starring Fiona Shaw. While the book richly captures moments of "feeling utopia" found within specific performances, it also celebrates the broad potential that performance has to provide a forum for being human together; for feeling love, hope, and commonality in particular and historical (rather than universal and transcendent) ways.<br>

Theories offer not just explanations for complex phenomena, but also an inclusive understanding of the phenomena. They do this by defining the political concepts and thus decontesting them. This is a point worth stressing: theories do offer explanations—that being their manifest function, after all—but on a prior and deeper level, they define political concepts for

  Author(s) CAMPBELL TRISHA N.<br>
  Abstract: Ian Hodder (2014) recently pointed to a “return to things” in the humanities and social sciences—a mode of analysis that explores the relationships between people and the objects we use to construct and make sense of the world (19). In digital humanities (DH), we see this turn in Matthew Kirschenbaum’s (2007) forensic analysis of computer hard disks; platform studies that investigate the relationship between computing culture, consoles, and other hardware (Monfort and Bogost 2009); and maker cultures that explore the humanities through practical experimentation (Dieter and Lovink 2014).

  Book Title: Veer Ecology-A Companion for Environmental Thinking<br>

  Author(s): Royle Nicholas<br>
  Abstract: Some verbs are closely tied to natural processes: compost, saturate, seep, rain, shade, sediment, vegetate, environ. Many are vaguely unsettling: drown, unmoor, obsolesce, power down, haunt. Others are enigmatic or counterintuitive: curl, globalize, commodify, ape, whirl. And while several verbs pertain to human affect and action-love, represent, behold, wait, try, attune, play, remember, decorate, tend, hope-a primary goal of
         Veer Ecologyis to decenter the human. Indeed, each of the essays speaks to a heightened sense of possibility, awakening our imaginations and inviting us to think the world anew from radically different perspectives. A groundbreaking guide for the twenty-first century,Veer Ecologyforegrounds the risks and potentialities of living on-and with-an alarmingly dynamic planet.<br>

  Abstract: Despite the stress on the strangeness at the heart of encounter, there is an expectation that it will lead to familiarity. If strangers meet in Jean Genet’s sense of recognizing each other’s “solitude of being,” they form a bond of sorts. Even if a face-to-face meeting—with its rhetoric of negotiation and its expectation of breakthrough—is not the goal, a sense of accompaniment is enjoyed. Such an accompaniment is not necessarily musical. “Music,” the distinguished English poet Jeremy Prynne remarks, “is truly the / sound of our time, since it is how we most / deeply recognise the home<br>

  Abstract: In early 2012 a number of journalists and bloggers reported, with varying levels of jocularity, that pink no longer existed. The spectrum of color that appears in the sky when the sun shines onto moisture exists, but pink (these stories suggested) does not, since it could be produced only through a combination of red and violet, which are on opposite sides of the rainbow.¹ Since the natural commingling of red and violet light is a theoretical impossibility, pink in a certain sense is about as real as the famous pink elephants Dumbo sees after he accidentally imbibes absinthe.

  Author(s) Arac Jonathan<br>
  Abstract: Several abrupt turns mark the critical career of J. Hillis Miller and withhold from his works that sense of stability and continuity that a lifelong pursuit of a single critical project might otherwise provide. They do so, moreover, because they seem precipitated more by Miller’s translation and adaptation of the positions of other critics than by reversals in his own thinking. First, there was the New Critical dissertation at Harvard; then, after a one-year stay at Williams in 1952-53, the years of phenomenological criticism at Johns Hopkins from 1953 to 1972, and more recently the move to deconstruction at Yale.<br>

  Abstract: Our experience of everyday life is always an experience of time: hours, days, months, dates, schedules, but also habits, rituals, memories. What Kath Weston has called the “time claims” of our world-historical moment dictate, in part, our sense of self, and our own sense of time shapes those claims in turn.¹We act on time, and time acts on us. In Freud’s case studies, discussed in chapter 1, this temporal function takes the form of a psychic recurrence whereby childhood trauma expresses itself as delayed consciousness, requiring a period of latency before its eventual return.

Through their dictated narratives, which function as early sites of ideological struggle, these Californios not only reconstruct their past and retrospectively narrate the nation, but map a new geopolitical cartography,¹ a liminal ethnic space produced as much by their particular history as by U.S. expansionism.² Having lost their “homeland” and the political and economic power to regain their former social status, the narrators turn to representational spaces,<br>

I introduce my theme by referring to Foucault’s 1970 essay on Deleuze, “Theatrum Philosophicum.” Here Foucault writes that the most important question for philosophy now, as Deleuze shows us, is the relation between thought and non-thought, or stupidity.

I do this primarily through a close analysis of a particular text authored by a former Sri Lankan president whose political career spanned most of the twentieth century, J. R. Jayewardene. If we are the stories we tell about ourselves, Jayewardene’s fable regarding the origins and evolution of Sri Lanka is interesting for the ways in which it produces a sense of identity out of difference.

His characters live in ethically and politically oriented worlds. This does not go without saying. Since Western literatures began strongly to affirm and defend their autonomy with respect to political and religious institutions in the mid-nineteenth century, many critics and writers have campaigned to purge literature of didacticism, and some have gone further and argued that literature should be ethically and politically neutral.

  Abstract: Bathed in the bliss of eternity, the dead commune with the living. So Bernard proclaims in his five

Our common experience of suffering and of sinfulness fuels our confidence in the saints and engenders sympathy for us in them. Furthermore, desire for God is common to the living and the dead; desire transports the longing soul to heaven to share—however partially—in the experience of saved souls, which is boundless desire for<br>

  Abstract: At its classical origins, we saw in the last chapter, cosmopolitanism was first of all matter of consciousness and conviction. Even today, it belongs first and foremost to the field of ethics, especially if we take the latter in its etymological sense. As among the eighteenth-century 
                  philosophes, the most common use of the term cosmopolitan today is to describe how people live (or aspire to live)—their ethos, culture, worldview, or way of life. The rise of cosmopolitanism in this sense was seized on in the 1990s as one of the most striking facts about the contemporary world, and the<br>

  Abstract: As Ulrich Beck says, unlike other previous civilizations, we cannot attribute everything that threatens us to external causes; societies are in conflict with themselves, with the production of that which they do not desire.

To identify and understand the nature of threats in a world that belongs to everyone and to no one, we have no choice but to make a “metaphorological” effort. I am going<br>

  Abstract: Stories perform many functions for those who read them and those who write them. In this sense, we should first focus on what makes a story an important model for reflective judgment. I will argue that processes of aesthetic apprehension are created by the work of the productive imagination of some moral experiences. This makes stories important vehicles of reflective judgments. Through their written expression, moral stories have demonstrated that, in spite of many theorists’ skepticism, they capture the “ineffable” characteristics of evil actions.¹ In works of fiction as well as in historical stories about evil acts, the “ineffable” seems<br>

The concepts I have discussed in this book entailed the disclosure of a new way of thinking about politics during the eighteenth century, which transformed the way social agents saw themselves, their experiences, and their future.¹ This process allowed them to imagine concepts such as critique, emancipation, and the political role of civil society as part of negotiating the space between their expectations and their actual political experiences.

Several lucid dreamers experience what one might reasonably label dream-visions that provide insights into a transcendental reality, not based on any known religion but rather on an intuitive personal insight into such an imagined reality. In that sense they constitute another form of “secular spirituality” for those who have been disenchanted with traditional religion.<br>

  Abstract: Philosophers debate the death of philosophy as much as they debate the death of God. Kant claimed responsibility for both philosophy's beginning and end, while Heidegger argued it concluded with Nietzsche. In the twentieth century, figures as diverse as John Austin and Richard Rorty have proclaimed philosophy's end, with some even calling for the advent of "postphilosophy." In an effort to make sense of these conflicting positions-which often say as much about the philosopher as his subject-Isabelle Thomas-Fogiel undertakes the first systematic treatment of "the end of philosophy," while also recasting the history of western thought itself.<br>

  Abstract: Drawing on a vast and diverse archive in theory, testimony, and image and on such thinkers as Karl Marx, Walter Benjamin, Theodor W. Adorno, and others, the intellectual historian Enzo Traverso explores the varying nature of left melancholy as it has manifested in a feeling of guilt for not sufficiently challenging authority, in a fear of surrendering in disarray and resignation, in mourning the human costs of the past, and in a sense of failure for not realizing utopian aspirations. Yet hidden within this melancholic tradition are the resources for a renewed challenge to prevailing regimes of historicity, a passion that has the power to reignite the dialectic of revolutionary thought.<br>

  Abstract: Each chapter of

Written in eloquent and moving prose, the book takes stock of what is lost when a life form disappears from the world -- the wide-ranging ramifications that ripple out to implicate a number of human and more-than-human others. Van Dooren intimately explores what life is like for those who must live on the edge of extinction, balanced between life and oblivion, taking care of their young and grieving their dead. He bolsters his studies with real-life accounts from scientists and local communities at the forefront of these developments. No longer abstract entities with Latin names, these species become fully realized characters enmeshed in complex and precarious ways of life, sparking our sense of curiosity, concern, and accountability toward others in a rapidly changing world.<br>

  Book Title: Eating Beauty-The Eucharist and the Spiritual Arts of the Middle Ages<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): ASTELL ANN W.<br>
  Abstract: In a remarkable book that is at once learned, startlingly original, and highly personal, Ann W. Astell explores the ambiguity of the phrase "eating beauty." The phrase evokes the destruction of beauty, the devouring mouth of the grave, the mouth of hell. To eat beauty is to destroy it. Yet in the case of the Eucharist the person of faith who eats the Host is transformed into beauty itself, literally incorporated into Christ. In this sense, Astell explains, the Eucharist was "productive of an entire 'way' of life, a virtuous life-form, an artwork, with Christ himself as the principal artist." The Eucharist established for the people of the Middle Ages distinctive schools of sanctity-Cistercian, Franciscan, Dominican, and Ignatian-whose members were united by the eucharistic sacrament that they received.<br>

  Abstract: A consideration of ethics is central to the book, but ethics in a general, philosophical sense is not the primary subject here; instead, Blumenthal-Barby suggests that whatever understanding of the ethical one has is always contingent upon a particular mode of presentation (

Whatever there is to be said about ethics, it is always bound to certain forms of saying, certain ways of telling, certain modes of narration. That modes of presentation differ across genres and media goes without saying; that such differences are intimately linked with the question of the ethical emerges with heightened urgency in this book.<br>

  Abstract: A book including the word “ethics” on its cover invokes, for better or for worse, a certain professional affiliation with the field of philosophy and, more specifically, the philosophical branch of ethics. This book, however, is neither written

  Book Title: Overkill-Sex and Violence in Contemporary Russian Popular Culture<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): BORENSTEIN ELIOT<br>
  Abstract: For Borenstein, the myriad depictions of deviance in pornographic and also crime fiction, with their patently excessive and appalling details of social and moral decay, represented the popular culture industry's response to the otherwise unimaginable scale of Russia's national collapse. "The full sense of collapse," he writes, "required a panoptic view that only the media and culture industry were eager to provide, amalgamating national collapse into one master narrative that would then be readily available to most individuals as a framework for understanding their own suffering and their own fears."<br>

The most popular definition, purportedly lifted by Scholasticism from Isaac ben Salomon Israeli’s book of definitions—
                  veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus [truth is the match of thing and intellect]¹—provides leeway for modification only in the shortest of its elements, in the neutrality of the ‘et’.

  Abstract: In his memorable parable of the downfall of art since the spiritual synthesis of the Gothic cathedral, Adolf Behne captures the sense of loss that haunts modern art (see chapter 7). He charts the spirit’s descent from collective creation to the individual artwork as a progressive materialization that finally imprisons art in the picture frame, apt symbol of the framing of art as aesthetic object and valuable commodity. The frame, with its separating and isolating function, appears as the antithesis of the lost unity of the arts—the recurrent reminder that the commercialization of production and the privatization of reception<br>

  Book Title: Meaning, Truth, and Reference in Historical Representation-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Ankersmit Frank<br>
  Abstract: In this book, the noted intellectual historian Frank Ankersmit provides a systematic account of the problems of reference, truth, and meaning in historical writing. He works from the conviction that the historicist account of historical writing, associated primarily with Leopold von Ranke and Wilhelm von Humboldt, is essentially correct but that its original idealist and romanticist idiom needs to be translated into more modern terms. Rehabilitating historicism for the contemporary philosophy of history, he argues, "reveals the basic truths about the nature of the past itself, how we relate to it, and how we make sense of the past in historical writing."<br>

  Abstract: Truth, reference, and meaning have traditionally been the three central notions in philosophical semantics. In the preceding two chapters we dealt with the question of the role to be assigned to reference and truth in (historical) representation. We found that representations cannot be said to refer to the world in the way proper names and sentences do, though they can be characterized as self-referential. Similarly, the notion of truth can meaningfully be used in the context of representation, not in the sense of propositional truth but in the quasi-Heideggerian sense of truth as a revelation of a past reality.

  Abstract: This essay applies ecocriticism to the study of neomedieval texts, an approach that I term “ecomedievalism.” Ecomedievalism interlaces study of neomedievalisms through the bifurcated lens of ecocriticism and ecomaterialism.¹ Neomedieval texts continually deploy environmental descriptions and language to develop a sense of an authentic medieval setting, part of the worldbuilding process, yet little critical attention is devoted to analyzing these methods from an ecological perspective. Ecocriticism’s rapid theorization has allowed the field to move beyond the political activism that characterized its origins, and now offers an opportunity to begin academic study of the fictional environments in neomedievalisms.² Consequently, this essay<br>

  Book Title: Edinburgh German Yearbook 9-Archive and Memory in German Literature and Visual Culture<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Osborne Dora<br>
  Abstract: In recent years, the discourse of memory - and of German memory culture in particular - has become increasingly concerned with questions of the archive. An archive can refer to a physical place, the material found there, or the system that orders this material; in its broadest sense, it might refer to something public (records housed in a municipal building), or something private (photographs in a family album). The material and documentary qualities of the archive confer on it an authenticating function attributed only cautiously to memory, but theories of the archive have questioned the status of material, documentary vestiges of the past. Memory and the archive are inextricably linked, but how does this affect the mediation of the past? This volume explores the changing relationship between memory and the archive in German-language literature and culture since 1945. Contributions approach this topic from a range of perspectives (film, visual culture, urban culture, digital technology, as well as literature) and offer illuminating studies of Harun Farocki, Anselm Kiefer, Thomas Demand, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Jürgen Fuchs, Stefan Wolter, and Sasa Stanisic.

The influence of Bourdieu’s sociology, albeit updated and adapted, is traceable in the various approaches many museums adopt to overcome cultural barriers in their public perception and community engagement (Merriman 1991; Fyfe 2006; Prior 2005; Barrett 2011).

  Book Title: The Novels of Josefina Aldecoa-Women, Society and Cultural Memory in Contemporary Spain<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): KENNY NUALA<br>
  Abstract: Josefina Aldecoa, in her treatment of themes such as a woman's place in society under and after dictatorship, mother-daughter relationships, war, and memory, confirmed her unique role as a contemporary novelist concerned with women's identity in Spain and as a writer of the mid-century generation ('los niños de la guerra'). The first volume of her trilogy, Historia de una maestra, was one of the earliest narratives of historical memory to be produced in Spain. In this sense, Aldecoa's work anticipated new developments in gender studies, such as the intersection of feminist concerns and cultural memory. This book offers a comprehensive examination of Aldecoa's trajectory as a novelist, from La enredadera to Hermanas, centring on her primary preoccupations of gender and memory, arguing that Aldecoa's fiction offers a new, more complex understanding of women's identity than previously understood. The work combines the two dominating theoretical components of feminism and cultural memory with close textual analysis of Aldecoa's narratives. Her novels highlight the importance of the details of women's daily experiences and struggles throughout the twentieth century, a period of significant socio-political upheaval and change in Spain's history.

By introducing mathematical methods into philosophy, Descartes founded the rationalist tradition in epistemology (the theory of knowledge and its objects), which holds that all knowledge of reality is ultimately derived from the exercise of human reason according to foundational principles independent of the senses. The rationalist position, which in Germany was taken up by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716), Christian Wolff (1679–1754), and Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714–62), gave philosophical underpinnings to the European intellectual movement<br>

He meant short plays with people talking directly to the audience from a single location. He meant cheesy sound effects created live in the studio. The show was going to be about contemporary life from a Native perspective. And from the perspective of someone who<br>

  Abstract: The German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once said that all the clever ideas have already been had; it is only a matter of thinking them again. There is hardly any other intellectual field that would provide more evidence for Goethe’s dictum than sociology and the history of ideas associated with our discipline. In this sense, the following considerations do not claim to present something really new. Following Goethe’s invitation, they are directed toward a reconstruction. It will be a matter of calling to mind an important intellectual tradition that nevertheless became largely submerged in the collective memory—as we<br>

  Abstract: Large American manufacturing firms have widely adopted some form of decentralization or divisionalization in past decades (Chandler 1962; Vancil 1979; Haspeslagh 1983). Why? Our argument will be a crosssectional one; it explains, without depending on imitation or history, why decentralization makes sense here and now for current executives of large manufacturing firms. Our argument also is a structuralist one: For both the innovators and later adopters, divisionalization must be interpreted with special reference to the context of what the other firms in a sector of the economy were doing.<br>

  Abstract: The Orthodox experience, as the primordial factor of Serbianhood, nurtures upon doctrinal and functional precepts, distinctive cultural and institutional patterns that provide a sense of “protection” and of national be longing to its members. This sense of protection pertains to divinely sanctioned exegeses, concerned with human origins and behaviour and in particular, with the Manichean distinction between good and evil, right and wrong. Orthodoxy as a signifier of collective representation, crystallises rules, symbols, behavioural inducements and consequences for actions, whose justification is also reflected in the internal necessities and functional core of the Serbian society.

  Book Title: What Holds Europe Together?-  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Michalski Krzysztof<br>
  Abstract: The book addresses contemporary developments in European identity politics as part of a larger historical trajectory of a common European identity based on the idea of 'solidarity.' The authors explain the special sense in which Europeans perceive their obligations to their less fortunate compatriots, to the new East European members, and to the world at large. An understanding of this notion of 'solidarity' is critical to understanding the specific European commitment to social justice and equality. The specificity of this term helps to distinguish between what the Germans call "social state" from the Anglo-Saxon, and particularly American, political and social system focused on capitalism and economic liberalism. This collection is the result of the work of an extremely distinguished group of scholars and politicians, invited by the previous President of the European Union, Romano Prodi, to reflect on some of the most important subjects affecting the future of Europe.<br>

The present article sets out to review the films of the last twenty years dealing with the Soviet period. Despite the declared break with the past, characteristic of transitional societies, a closer look at the social and cultural fabric of “post-Communism” reveals that the simplistic opposition of “before” versus “after” is subverted by recurrent long-term intellectual frameworks, narrative devices, and visual imagery, employed to make sense of the world “here and now” as well as “there<br>

  Abstract: One of the main intellectual consequences of the French Revolution was to leave many Europeans with the sense that the optimistic, rationalistic and egalitarian ideology of the Enlightenment had exhausted itself and been discredited with the failure of the radical phase of the revolution. There was a sense on many sides that the Enlightenment had been “on trial” during the French Revolution and that the understanding of human nature and history offered by the Enlightenment had proved inadequate. The period that followed the French Revolution was therefore marked by an intellectual reaction leading in two directions. First, to the belief<br>

Abstract: Maria Pia Lara’s
      Moral Textures: Feminist Narratives in the Public Spherefocuses on the relationship between morality, identity, and narrative. In particular, Lara is concerned to amend Jürgen Habermas’s discourse ethics by showing the way in which normative discourse on issues of justice is intertwined with aesthetic forms of communication and discussions of good. In his account of communicative rationality, Habermas distinguishes normative claims to validity from aesthetic ones. While discourse over moral norms appeals to reason and looks to a universal consensus, aesthetic discussions are devoted to making intelligible a certain sensibility and judgment of the good life. Rather than anticipating a universal consensus, aesthetic claims to validity depend upon a commonality in value and identity within groups and cultures for which a given judgment or life project can make sense.<br>

Abstract: One danger in writing a book “for students and members of the general public who wish to know what philosophers have been saying about the controversial issue of animal liberation” is that the arguments, many of which are sophisticated, will be oversimplified. The author of this volume avoids this pitfall. He is also adept (enviably so) at presenting the arguments in an impartial manner, despite having, as he puts it, “opinions on many of the issues raised” (p. 7). This shows the philosophical novice that one can be both interested (in the sense of engaged) and disinterested (in the sense of impartial).<br>

Abstract: 1. Is paradigm the right choice, and have I used it correctly?There is always a risk in adopting a concept that comes from a different tradition. It is even riskier when we fiddle with it and stretch it to fit a set of data for which it was not designed as I have done. But I believe that the risk is warranted for two reasons. The first is that there is considerable confusion within and outside of anthropology regarding the nature of the anthropological study of language. The oscillation mentioned in the article among a number of labels, including linguistic anthropology, anthropological linguistics, sociolinguistics, and ethnolinguistics, is only the most superficial and yet telling example of the widespread lack of clarity as to what constitutes linguistic research from an anthropological perspective. Further evidence of confusion can be inferred from the typically partial and often clumsy attempts to represent the linguistic subfield (or the study of language) in sociocultural anthropology textbooks. I felt that it was time to come to terms with the fact that perhaps those of us inside the subfield had not been communicating to those outside as effectively as we thought we were. I then realized that to address this issue I needed a notion that by its very nature would force us to think in terms of broad trends rather than particular notions or hypotheses. The popular notions of paradigm and paradigm shift seemed to me the perfect candidates; they could force us to think in terms of the major features of our research projects. CookGumperz and Gumperz are right when they write that Kuhns approach gives a sense of structural containment to the flow of ideas that to those living with them appear much more fluid and overlapping. (Their proposal to adopt Holtons themata is a bit cryptic given that his model is not considered an improvement on Kuhns by most historians of science.)

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: The God‐term in Luhmann’s universe is “autopoesis,” essentially the self‐direction of the systems of society, including that of art, toward greater autonomy and complexity. Although Luhmann was a student of Talcott Parsons and his work bears the evolutionary interest of the functionalist paradigm, it is what many partisans of the older version might consider to be a mutant functionalism. As Luhmann avers, he considers “system differentiation” as “the heart of Parsons’s theory” (p. 350, n. 4) yet unlike Parsons’s optimistic sense that differentiation was undergirded by functional imperatives such as adaptive upgrading, Luhmann’s own sense is that the process of societal evolution “does not presuppose central norms, no matter how generalized” (p. 2). Essentially what this means is that society is composed of a set of systems (economy, politics, law, and art, among others) that evolve and complexify but not toward any unified state, such as Parsons’s “societal community.” Rather, each system tends toward its own independence and standards, and thus much of Luhmann’s book explores what he calls “the autonomy of art,” that is, the ability of the art system to develop its own “self‐description.”<br>

Author(s): Mialet Hélène<br>
Abstract: According to Polanyi:
         
               The computer, in the present context, has thus become an appendix of the human body owing to the acquisition of a number of skills that Hawking has mastered: the rapidity with which he touches his commutator, the manipulation of certain operations for selecting words in the construction of sentences, the choice of the right keys to activate the synthetic voice.To use language in speech, reading and writing, is to extend our bodily equipment and become intelligent human beings. We may say that when we learn to use language, or a probe, or a tool, and thus make ourselves aware of these things as we are of our body, we
            interiorizethese things andmake ourselves dwell in them.42
               43As one would say of an individual who has mastered all the subtleties of a new language, he has, as one of his students points out, “become totally ‘fluent’ with his computer.” The designer of Hawking’s software, Walter Woltosz, recalls that Hawking could be much faster with using a new software called EZ Keys at carrying on a conversation, but Hawking thinks that he is faster on Equalizer: “It is burned into his brain. He has been using it for fifteen years … fifteen hours a day and he knows it so well that he is very comfortable with it.… It really is an extension of himself now.”44As Polanyi says, “Every time we assimilate a tool to our body our identity undergoes some change; our person expands into new modes of being,”45or, as Drew Leder suggests, in the tradition of Merleau‐Ponty: “The true relation between body and instrument, phenomenological rather than crudely materialistic in character, is only revealed when we reverse the analogy. It is not that the body is like a tool, but that the tool is like a second sort of body, incorporated into and extending our corporeal powers.”46“To incorporate a tool is to redesign one’s extended body until its extremities expressly mesh with the world” (

Abstract: For a long line of Whig historians the revolution and civil war of the 1630s and 1640s was the particular responsibility of the Stuarts, who in significant ways broke with the constitutional precedents established by the Tudors. Elizabeth especially was conventionally represented as a defender of English liberties and Protestantism. Neal counters this narrative and shows that the arbitrary principles of Charles and his father followed directly from the example of Elizabeth: “She had high notions of the sovereign authority of Princes, and of her own absolute Supremacy in Church Affairs: and being of Opinion that Methods of Severity were lawful to bring her Subjects to an outward Uniformity, she countenanced all the Engines of Persecution, such as Spiritual Courts, High Commission, and Star‐Chamber, and stretched her prerogative to support them beyond the Laws, and against the Sense of the Nation.”
      30Neal detailed actions on the part of the queen that, he pointedly remarks, “cost one of her Successors his Crown and Life.”31It was Elizabeth’s active persecution of the Puritans that began the divisions that were to culminate on a scaffold outside Inigo Jones’s Banquetting House on Whitehall in 1649. As Neal put it, in an image that Hume was later to appropriate into hisHistory of England, “The breach might easily have been made up at first, but it widened by degrees; the passions of the contending parties increased, till the fire, which for some years was burning under ground, broke out into a civil war, and with unspeakable fury destroyed the Constitution both of Church and State.”32<br>

Abstract: The incomprehensibility of the human being remains. Founded and required by the incomprehensibility of the One whose image and likeness man bears, it is bound up with theology. Nevertheless it does not belong entirely, or even foremost, to theology, because man must comprehend this very incomprehensibility, by opposing it to, and preserving it in front of, every other comprehension that he gains over every other thing—things that can become objects. Let us recall here Paul Ricœur’s brilliant statement: “the claim by knowledge to constitute itself raises the most formidable obstacle to the idea of revelation. In this regard, Husserl’s transcendental idealism potentially contains the very same atheistic outcome as Feuerbach’s idealism of self‐consciousness.”
         46In this sense, which is first of all negative, or rather denegatory, man’s incomprehensibility comes under the domain of philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Teaching, above all, launched Braudel on his intellectual itinerary. It was first in North Africa where he encountered the “joy” and “spectacle” of life outside his circumscribed world of farm and family, school and books. In colonial Algeria, he began his adult life and his life’s work as a teacher trying to make sense out of the historical spectacle and its spectacular stories in order to formulate lessons for his students. The Socratic teacher never forgot his point of departure in North Africa.

Abstract: Defamiliarization presupposes a severing of the automatic conjunction between the awareness of religious difference and a defensive stance toward the religious other. The demythologization of apologetics that results from the new pluralism at the same time represents the condition for the possibility of the means, namely, defamiliarization, for countering its ill effects. Thanks to its ability to dissociate a concern for religious identity from a defensive attitude toward the religious other, comparative theology is able to modulate between definition, which establishes a sense of communal identity, and defamiliarization, which restores to a tradition the theological ambiance—the reflective space opened up with the relaxation of polemical pressure—needed for its depth and vitality.<br>

Abstract: Scholars and their students interested in the field would do well to begin with these studies, despite some unevenness in period, place, and theme. Developments in the twentieth century, for example, are not well served, especially as their globalization bursts all traditional boundaries in the discipline, making a historical perspective essential to an understanding of ongoing transformations in literate life everywhere, not just in the West. Similarly, the absence of illustrations undermines the potential value of these books as introductions to the history of reading. Much of the work here depends on the material objects that readers actually had; without images of them, the reader develops less of a sense of the field. Finally, the exclusion of the essays on correspondence from the original collection is deeply regrettable; Chartier’s summary of their implications in the introduction hardly does justice to them, especially to the important study of the 1847 postal survey by Dauphin and two other colleagues. The translations are generally accurate, but the indexes are barely adequate.<br>

Abstract: While sharing the aim of relating philosophy and theology, I do not think the project is best accomplished by thinking ontotheologically (at least, not in its Heideggerian sense). What is needed is to insist on a sharper distinction between ontotheological philosophy and religious theology so that we can better understand how they might relate. And here again, I agree with Robbins for different reasons: Ricoeur, Lévinas, and Marion are key sources in this project, for their work maintains the distinction that it calls into question.<br>

In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since h~<br>

Abstract: By extending these ideas on reading to a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur is able to argue that identity is a temporal structure that rests on narrative, as well as a project that is ongoing for individuals during their lifetime. Reading is central to this project because it is only in reading that the dynamism of configuration completes its course; in other words, the passage from prefiguration via configuration to refiguration results in transfiguration of worlds. In this relationship of worlds, it is the person as reader who takes this journey [
         21]. His thesis is that “the process of composition, of configuration, does not realize itself in the text but in the reader, and under this condition configuration makes possible refiguration of a life by way of the narrative” [44, p. 430]. As part of this, a person can be called upon to make an account of herself, and such an account, Ricoeur argues, involves a positing of a beginning, a middle with its highs and lows, and an ending [14]. Through composition, or configuration, this account is dynamic; we can weave different plots about our lives. Ricoeur reminds us that “just as it is possible to compose several plots on the subject of the same incidents … so it is always possible to weave different, even opposed, plots about our lives” [30, p. 248]. But, simultaneously, a life can have the quality of being singular and complete. In terms of a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur best captures this when he argues that “to understand oneself is to understand oneself as one confronts the text and to receive from it the conditions for a self other than that which first undertakes the reading. Neither of the two subjectivities, neither that of the author nor that of the reader, is thus primary in the sense of an originary presence of the self to itself” [44, p. 17]. For Ricoeur, it is through this task that we achieve, by dint of effort, a dynamic balancing of a sense of self, which is, on the one~<br>

Abstract: Spivak draws on the distinction Chatterjee makes between the elaborate constitution of the subject through educational and legal apparatuses in the colonial era and the lack of any such constitution or training in the age of electronic capitalism, where subjects are reentering a feudal mode of power characterized by sheer dominance (Spivak
            1989, 224). Spivak herself talks about the necessity of distinguishing between the subjects of postmodern neocolonialism and immigrants in the United States, but her argument only makes sense if we substituteraced subjectsorethnicsfor the termimmigrants. Native Americans, African Americans, and many Latinas, for instance, are not immigrants, and the argument would not hold for white immigrants.<br>

Abstract: For the distinction between
            DarstellungandVertretung, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak,A Critique of Postcolonial Reason: Toward a History of the Vanishing Present(London and Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1999), 257–64. For Spivak the pure subaltern cannot speak and represent themselves in both senses of the term, since the moment particular subalterns emerge as spokespersons for their communities—organic intellectuals in Antonio Gramsci’s sense—they cease to be subaltern (“Subaltern Talk: Interview with the Editors,” inThe Spivak Reader: Selected Works of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, ed. Donna Landry and Gerald MacLean [New York and London: Routledge, 1996], 287–92). My argument for restoring and enabling the subaltern representations of religious traditions refers to the “nonpure” subalterns who through an enormous effort have come to speak for their purely subaltern communities—such as Rigoberta Menchú for the Mayans—but whose representations, if to be heard, require a solidary political praxis of resisting the attempts to silence them and whose already silenced and forgotten testimonials call for a similar praxis of rediscovery and restoration.<br>

Abstract: Compare Marino,
            Dicerie sacre, “La pittura,” pt. 1, 119. Marino compares God to a mirror that reflects the soul’s truthful image. If God withdraws, the soul becomes unable to see itself. The image of mirrors reflecting mirrors is a topos of baroque love poetry. The innumerable sonnets written in seventeenth‐century Italy on this subject aim to create a sense of labyrinthine astonishment, an inner vertigo, the baroque “marvel.” For example, see Giovan Battista Marino,Rime amorose, ed. Ottavio Besomi and Alessandro Martini (Ferrara: Edizioni Panini, 1987), sonnets 11–13. This series of poems is entirely dedicated to the topos of the mirror. The most complex and accomplished is the third in which Marino imagines that the mirror reflecting his beloved’s image was made of the tears he had shed and that had become a lucid surface (sonnet 13, verse 2, 61). “The angelic splendor of this goddess” (i.e., his beloved) has turned the mirror into a small heaven, since it reflects the woman’s luminosity (verses 3–4). Love has allowed the metamorphosis of the poet’s tears into mirror, so that his “beautiful sun” (his woman, verse 6) can see what he hides “in the mirror of my heart” (verses 7–8) and detect her beauty in the surface of his visible sorrow. The external mirror is thus a reflection of the poet’s inner mirror in which the luminous woman reflects upon her own image.<br>

Abstract: One could ask, theoretically, whether Frei’s recovery of the narrative sense in Christian theology could proceed without his discussion and study of Midrash. Yet, it is more important to note that these two aspects of his work do go hand in hand and that the concluding passage on the “particularism” of Christianity suggests that such particularity is best maintained and understood in and through engagement with other traditions and practices of reading. Such engagement reminds us of the limitations of our reading, our tendency to privilege certain ways of reading and certain texts, and thereby continually to eclipse the biblical narrative in our own ways. Perhaps it is through the shared study to which Frei’s work points that the literal sense may more fully illuminate and transform our fragmentary, partial habits of reading.<br>

Abstract: Whether or not this reader’s reaction was warranted, he was relying on a fundamental function of the humanities footnote: it allows us a means of evaluating the level of scholarship of an essay. As Grafton points out, before the academic footnote came into existence, the authority of the author, his or her moral and intellectual stature, were inherent in what he or she said, not in his or her sources.
      6Thucydides and Joinville did not footnote; they didn’t need to. It seems our anonymous, theory‐driven author who incited one reader’s anger was writing for a different century. Today, footnotes in a scholarly essay are not uniformly marginal, minor, or digressive. They can be, but much more often they are a humanist’s lab report, our empirical data. In a general sense, footnotes are the mark of the author’s status as a professional. Because, as Grafton notes, footnotes persuade, we look to them for proof that the author has sufficiently covered the field, that enough evidence has been marshalled, that the status of the evidence has been sufficiently questioned. The profession requires not only the traditional recognition of the work of like‐minded scholars but also a consciousness of their place in the field, one’s own place in the field, and the field’s status as a field of study. The footnote is written by an individual whose own voice has been rendered into a collective voice of similarly educated authors. That is, in the footnote the individual author purposefully loses his or her writerly voice to become part of this professional collective.<br>

Abstract: In a famous article written in the aftermath of 9/11, David Brooks (
         2001) claimed that reactions to that day in both “Red” and “Blue” America attested to the cohesiveness of our national fabric. The events of 9/11 and their immediate aftermath, in his opinion, had triggered a “national Sabbath” of sorts, a time when the divisions between the two sides dissolved, when both were reminded of “what is really important.” It was, in a sense, the catalyst to remember that we all inhabit the same “cafeteria‐nation” regardless of the cliques at our metaphorical tables and actual communities. “If the September 11 attacks rallied people in both Red and Blue America, they also neutralized the political and cultural leaders who tend to exploit the differences between the two,” Brooks wrote, which helps explain the scolding Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson received for their remarks. That Sabbath lingered long enough for Brooks to pronounce that “there may be cracks [between the two Americas,] but there is no chasm.”<br>

Abstract: No, not just like that. But to regard interreligious dialogue, including its transforming orientation, as totally impossible would be going to the other extreme. Because I definitely see a modest but essential place reserved for interreligious dialogue, I shall now examine it more closely. To draw its outlines as clearly as possible I locate it in the debate on Alan Race’s trichotomy of exclusivism, inclusivism, and pluralism, from which it emerged, at least in a reconstructive sense. One could say that it arose as a solution to the dilemma posed by exclusivism and inclusivism, on the one hand, and pluralism, on the other. I shall explain this more fully to demonstrate that the dilemma is incorrectly stated: it is a false dilemma.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur, in contrast, is one of a few philosophers who offer, however briefly, a phenomenology of forgetting, although he too voices skepticism about an
         ars oblivionalison par with thears memoriae.He distinguishes between three levels or approaches to memory and forgetting. These are obstructed memory and forgetting (l'oubli et la mémoire empêchée,on the level of the psychopathological), manipulated memory and forgetting (l'oubli et la mémoire manipulée,on the practical or instrumental level), and controlled memory and forgetting (l'oubli et la mémoire commandée/obligée,on the ethical‐political level).110In the last context, forgetting and pardoning are intrinsically linked through the problematic of the past: forgetting, to memory and fidelity to the past; pardoning, to culpability and reconciliation with the past. “Indeed, a happy forgetting is the horizon of the pacified memory.”111Ricoeur further differentiates between forgetting through deletion and a more measured, reserved kind of forgetting, closely connected to the opposition between amnesia and amnesty. In considering amnesty as institutional forgetting, Ricoeur notes that it aims at reconciliation and civil peace.112In this sense one can hypothesize by analogy that persecution, punishment, and eradication, even if explicitly articulated as forgetting, may serve as institutional reminders but can also (sometimes consciously) exacerbate societal tensions.<br>

Abstract: Such an endlessly self‐creative social responsibility arguably articulates something profound in the Christian ethical message. The dependency of humanity on God should open each of us to the important ways in which human beings are radically dependent upon one another. Responsibility for children as “the least among us” shines a particularly strong light on what it means to love fellow creatures of God overall. A sense of responsibility to human vulnerability is suggested in the gospel meaning of the golden rule: “Do to others as you would have them do to you” (Luke 6:31). As Ricoeur and others have argued, this formulation implies a double substitution: you are asked to imagine yourself as a recipient of another’s actions so as to understand your own moral agency from another’s point of view.
         53The golden rule puts you in the position of the one responsible, but from the point of view of the one you may potentially victimize. It demands two moral centers at once: yourself and the other. This decentering function of the golden rule is further radicalized by its immediately following Jesus’s extreme love command: “Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you” (Luke 6:27–28). The juxtaposition of such an asymmetrical or radical love command on the golden rule protects the latter from being reduced to any easy reciprocity or exchange. It renders moral responsibility a demand for superabundance toward others in the service of realizing a common humanity.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Abstract: We can begin to suggest such a possibility for humanity’s
         imitatio Creatorisby rereading the mythology of Genesis 1 in a way more deeply educated by contemporary phenomenological hermeneutics. If humankind is created “in the image” of its Creator, Gen. 1:27 immediately names this image as multiple or plural: “male and female he created them.” Whatever kind of fruitfulness and multiplication may be commanded, it is to take place within human relations’ differences and otherness. The cosmological creation of humankind is also ethical in the sense that it mythologizes ultimate possibilities for otherwise broken or alienated human relations. To be an image of the Creator is not to retreat into isolation or individuality, to assert oneself in domination or power, or to rest within any particular historical community. It is, rather, to imitate Creation itself in its temporal dynamism, verbal power, productive tensionality, and narrative diversity.<br>

Abstract: Yet, in the process of attesting to one’s own capacities, one is communicating something to an other self. Only when the other is recognized does the whole process of communication start to make sense. Memory and attestation depend on the interplay of self‐recognition and recognition of the other. It may sound plausible for a precommunicative concept of the self to be understood as a phenomenon that appears before one’s own eyes. But, in treating intersubjective notions such as memory, attestation, and social capacities before making space for the other, Ricoeur repeats the commonplace error of situating the hermeneutical understanding of interacting selves before the communicative moment.<br>

Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: The concept of the good may apply particularly pointedly to professional codes of ethics. The codes are aimed at the positive right of free speech and also at professional responsibility. They attempt to articulate practical and normative standards of ethics. Both the ALA Code of Ethics and the American Society for Information Science and Technology Professional Guidelines speak in terms of responsibility to communities, to the profession, and to society as a whole. Public pronouncement of the codes does serve to affirm the existence of libraries as just institutions in a democracy. Related to the second scenario above, accuracy does fit with the good since it is in people’s interest to obtain accurate information that they can employ for their own well‐being. Advocacy is certainly not always and everywhere prohibited, but it is secondary to people’s right to information that is as accurate as it is possible to provide. Accuracy also embraces a commitment to truth, which recognizes a fundamental inequality of some information (the true and the false; refer again to the first scenario). It is generally taken to be responsible professionalism to check information sources against one another to corroborate information. This action, as Lynch observes, is not a substitute for truth; it is a means to truth (in the weak sense) [
         19, p. 81]. Toward the end of accuracy and truth, there are some closely related matters. For one thing, there have been some persistent challenges related to government information and its accessibility versus its effective suppression. This is an area in which advocacy and accuracy merge, with the common aim of presenting library users with the most authoritative information possible. Also, libraries’ access mechanisms, including subject headings, can benefit from advocacy directed toward language that encompasses the culture, linguistic distinctions, and other facets of the people who will search for information.<br>

Abstract: Indeed, as Hannah Arendt has pointed out, “Goodness in an absolute sense, as distinguished from the good‐for’ or the excellent’ in Greek and Roman antiquity, became known in our civilization only with the rise of Christianity” (Hannah Arendt,
            The Human Condition[Chicago, 1958], p. 73). The analysis of Goodness provided inThe Human Conditionand in which Arendt highlights the constitutive secrecy of good works, which must remain hidden even to the one who performs them—a good deed being good only on condition that it is forgotten at the moment it is done—as well as Goodness’s intrinsic hostility toward the public realm, converges in many respects with what Patočka—a reader of Arendt—says about this notion, as well as with all the implications that Derrida draws in systematic fashion from this conception inThe Gift of Death.<br>

Abstract: Moral Creativityis also a book about Paul Ricoeur. Throughout, Wall turns to Ricoeur’s philosophical and religious thought for theoretical support, using a wide range of primary and secondary literature. Wall works from a Ricoeurian idea that the self is a synthesis of activity and passivity, freedom and finitude. He finds in this ontology of selfhood a basis for conceiving of creativity as the activity of inventing free action amid the limitations of finitude. This anthropology is then tied to Ricoeur’s work on narrative identity, love, ideology, and other topics. Wall’s exegesis of Ricoeur is accurate and astute, succinctly connecting the thinker’s early and late writings on selfhood. The book faults Ricoeur for having an insufficient sense for the entrenchment of social/cultural injustice and for the radical otherness of other people. The discussion of Ricoeur and Emmanuel Levinas on otherness is one of the most interesting parts of the book but also an argument that might need expansion. Wall laments Ricoeur’s decision to separate philosophy from religious discourse, claiming this was a purely pragmatic decision whereby “Ricoeur ultimately does himself a disservice” (181). This may be so, but regardless of intent, wouldn’t we have to say that such a separation is part of the thought world projected by Ricoeur’s writings? Patching over this separation may bring Ricoeur closer to writers of the current “theological turn” of postmodernism but possibly at the price of losing one of Ricoeur’s great virtues—his usefulness in mediating between postmodernism and the modernity that insists on dividing religion and reason.<br>

Abstract: More importantly, the articulation of these ambiguous mixtures of modern and archaic, new and old, here and there, contemporary and nativist has always been present to remind us of the perseverance of a temporal refraction distinguished by noncontemporaneous contemporaneity. It is in this sense that the Southern Question has become a lasting historical trope for the coexistence of different temporal regimes and their referents. The progress vouched for by a conception of modernity (and even belatedly capitalist ideology in its offer to raise all societies to the same level) would, it was believed, overcome uneven rhythms and fill in the distance created by lag and delay. The guarantee of the future required the effacement from memory of the miseries and difference engendered in the present. But when theorization of modernity fastened onto progress and rationality, as was eventually played out in a discourse on modernization during the cold war, the outline of unevenness was blurred by scientific and technological criteria. In its classic formulation by Ernst Bloch, the configuration of the noncontemporaneous contemporary signified consequential political effects associating unevenness with fascism in the Germany of the early 1930s, where, he observed, the coexistence of different times reflected the disjuncture between the new and the traditional (city and countryside) and what he described as a subjective “muffled non‐desire for the Now, … an impoverished centre” “‘spiritually’ missed.”
         6By contrast, Reinhart Koselleck later sought to transmute the figure into a neutral category belonging to a scheme of “differential classification of historical sequences … contained in the same naturalistic chronology.”7Both believed, for different reasons, that unevenness was a temporary lull that eventually would disappear under altered historical conditions (revolutionary utopianism or Enlightenment progress), whether spurred by political modernization or economic deve~<br>

Abstract: Making room for a more poetic function at work between this reading‐and‐writing prophet and his confirming God allows that “truth,” as Ricoeur has said, “no longer means verification, but manifestation. … What shows itself is in each instance a proposed world, a world I may inhabit and wherein I can project my own most possibilities.”
         98This is the power to which Bloom credited Mormonism’s survival: not Smith’s history making but his “myth‐making imagination at work to sustain so astonishing an innovation.”99It is the power to shape reality, not merely describe it. To the extent that self‐consciousness can be ascribed to him, it is probably why Smith abjured theology for mythmaking. Regardless, scholars who would understand the relative longevity and appeal of his project, especially as it has transcended its American milieu, can ill afford to ignore the capacity of Smith’s narratives to make sense of time.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and~<br>

Abstract: It is important to clarify at this point that the historicism we espouse is strictly a methodology to preserve the historical record. As stated above, the historicism we are advocating is founded upon the works of Johann Gottfried von Herder. We see in his reflections on mankind’s intellectual development a way to avoid the question of objective truth in librarianship for the sake of historical comprehension. It is very similar to Descartes suspending the truth value of the propositions of his beliefs in order to arrive at epistemological certainty. Our suspension of truth value does not arrive at epistemological certainty about the propositions contained in the many volumes housed in a library but rather at certainty that the historical record has not been compromised by the elimination of any these volumes. In other words, librarians must suspend the truth value of singular items and artifacts in the historical record in order that the whole truth of any given period of history be accurately analyzed and understood. As Herder states: “If history in its simplest sense were nothing but a description of an occurrence, of a production, then the first requirement is that the description be
         whole, exhaust the subject, show it to use from all sides” [74].<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede-~<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

Abstract: The chapter “Nobody's Weakness” closes with Arthur ruminating gloomily (and rather opaquely) about how “it might be better to flow away monotonously, like the river, and to compound for its insensibility to happiness with its insensibility to pain” (
            LD,p. 200). Though “flow away” seems at first only a metaphor, so abstract and disembodied is the reverie that there is a kind of phantasmal grammatical alternative trickling into the melancholic drift of the prose. In this way that second infinitive of compensation or complementation may also faintly evoke a sense that Arthur indeed wishes to mix materially with the lethal waters, literally (and more idiomatically) to “compound … with” them.<br>

Abstract: In both Augustine’s and Marcel’s experience, it turns out that the loss of a dear person may entail a loss of self, a sense of personal diminution—the subtraction of a crucial element in one’s purposeful self‐instantiation in the world. In the context of a different discussion, Ricoeur remarks aptly that the death of a loved one “constitutes a genuine amputation of oneself to the extent that the relation with the one who has disappeared forms an integral part of one’s identity.” We saw that Augustine copes with such a loss of identity by way of a detour into the desire of divine love and seeks his own better self through a self‐abnegating identification with this divine love. Marcel reacts instead to such a loss of identity by way of a detour into the materiality of his own mortality and seeks his own better self through a self‐denying identification with the love that the dear one’s death has left imprinted in his organism. In both cases, death’s “radical heterogeneity in relation to … desire” is exorcised by desire itself. The relevant difference between Augustine’s and Marcel’s respective forms of mourning is that the former reflects the metaphysical transcendence intrinsic to a more ancient notion of soul, while the latter’s reflects the soft transcendence of an embodied notion of soul that, however organismic in nature, bridges the gap separating merely genetic and epigenetic responses to mourning from the autonomy of one’s self‐instantiation.

Abstract: The virtues to which I have alluded thus possess radical implications for citizens considering the morality of war and, in particular, whether to join a standing army or to agree to conscription in military service. If I am correct about the role of the virtues for just‐war morality, then individual citizens have a duty to settle matters of the
         jus ad bellumduring times of conflict or impending conflict. Citizens cannot merely rely on a connection between patriotism and political obedience but should act on the notion that patriotism informed by a sense of justice requires moral reflection about the merits of a polity’s demands on an individual’s conscience. That notion implies higher expectations of moral assessment than has typically been the case in just‐war theorizing and might require citizens to refuse participation or conscription in war. Put differently, citizens who fail to engage in such reflection and who enter into an unjust war may be judged culpably negligent for choosing to be made into soldiers. To be sure, the social, political, economic, legal, and cultural forces that bear on an individual’s decision are complex, making personal agency and moral deliberation in war an extremely complex matter.72But just‐war morality, properly understood, involves dispositions to resist sources of fear and to exercise courage and independence of mind regarding the merits of a polity’s cause.<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Hall sees that this argument as it develops across Ricoeur’s writings raises questions about the role of reciprocity in the Ricoeur texts he considers. He acknowledges that Ricoeur’s recognition that not all human relations are face‐to‐face leads him beyond a narrow call for solicitude and friendship at this level to a concern for the level of institutions as well. It is at this level of institutions that the question of justice really arises, and with it new questions regarding responsibility and possible reciprocity, particularly regarding our ability to respond to others who we may never meet face‐to‐face. As Hall says, “love often demands a dimension of self‐sacrifice, most notably in the form of renouncing a strict reciprocity” (150). His case could have been stronger here if he had incorporated Ricoeur’s discussions of the work of John Rawls and the antisacrificial notion of justice he saw there. Beyond this, Hall’s focal idea of a relation between love and justice marked by what he calls a poetic tension should also have included some discussion of what Ricoeur says in
   The Course of Recognition(Institute for Human Sciences Vienna Lecture Series, trans. David Pellauer [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005]; originally published asParcours de la reconnaissance[Paris: Éditions Stock, 2004]) about the limits of existing philosophies of recognition, which he saw as not getting any further than a notion of reciprocal recognition in just the sense Hall criticizes. Ricoeur’s own answer was to begin there to lay out the idea of mutual recognition beyond mere reciprocity, a higher form of recognition that stands closer, as Hall anticipates, to something like the reception of a gift that expects nothing in return but which may lead to a second gift given to others. Readers who wish to build on Hall’s argument will want also to look at this last major book from Ricoeur.<br>

Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: However, a revision is needed for our global times. It is not life qua life that is the norm, the good, for responsible existence. That conception would merely replace one centrism for another: biocentrism for anthropocentrism or theocentrism. It is, rather, the integration of many dimensions of life, the integrity of life, which must orient individuals and social action in our global times. This idea—the integrity of life—is a complex one. Within the work of theological ethics it enables critical reflection across an array of domains of existence and the goods proposed or entailed. It also provides orientation for responsible action. That is to say, the idea of the “integrity of life” articulates a multidimensional conception of the good but also a norm or measure for responsible actions and relations.
         39Responsible existence is a life of integrity formed, personally and socially, through an enduring dedication to the integrity of life. The integrity of life provides the norms for humanizing religion in the full sense of the idea. It moves beyond a merely humanistic or theistic conceptuality or even the deconstruction of that dyad in order to articulate a good that resonates with religious and moral depths in the remembrance of death and the love of life. Keeping our attention on humanizing religion is thus meant to save us from a reduction in a conception of the moral good, to insist on the complexity of goodness. From diverse strands of our cultural legacy—Hellenistic, biblical, modern—there arise the resources to render productive, rather than destructive, the tension between the limit of death and the love of life, a sense of responsibility and the proper object of responsible action, the integrity of life.<br>

Author(s): Eades Caroline<br>
Abstract: Attention to critical reception, box‐office performance, or censorship might help resolve the ambiguity inherent in the films' content and potential impact on collective memory, but Eades offers no such information apart from a handful of review citations scattered throughout the four hundred pages of text. The heated public debates surrounding films such as the aforementioned
      Battle of Algiers,which was banned from theaters almost immediately by French authorities on its release and not shown on French television until 2004, are ignored almost entirely. And though the author mentions in passing the importance of documentaries in contesting denial and indifference, she does not deal substantively with either that genre or with fiction films about colonialism and decolonization made outside France for French consumption. As such, the impact of widely distributed, critically acclaimed productions such as Euzhan Palcy'sLa rue cases‐nègres(1983, an ethnographic dramatization of the suffering endured by sugarcane workers in 1930s Martinique) and Bertrand Tavernier'sLa guerre sans nom(1992, a four‐hour landmark documentary about the Algerian War that openly addresses torture) goes unaddressed. With regard to periodization, Eades notes an intensification in postcolonial productions during the first half of the 1990s when the French government began formally acknowledging and memorializing the dark aspects of colonialism, but we get no sense of how the films' political stance evolved over the preceding thirty years. My own sense is that the sheer number and consistently anticolonialist stance of documentaries, especially those made in the last fifteen years about the Algerian War, have been significantly more influential than fiction films in promoting collective realization of the human rights violations committed under the aegis of France's “civilizing mission.”<br>

Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: The Oxford Handbook of Film and Media Studiesfollows with Brian Price's “The Latest Laocöon: Medium Specificity and the History of Film Theory,” whose very title intends to redraw the borders that Bolter has just erased. Price insists that in an environment of incessant flow and remediation no object will command attention in and as itself and that the aura of any given film, like that of cinema in toto, will evaporate.64He worries that the convergence of all media into an indefinitely malleable electronic stream or reservoir would seem to destabilize cinema studies if not cinema itself. Art history may sense itself in a parallel situation as objets d'art now share attention with innumerable phenomena comprising the strategically undefined zone of visual culture. Presumably most of those scholars who now identify their field as visual studies proudly rely on a disciplined background in art history that honed the skills they wield in researching and analyzing all manner of things. The same should apply to those film scholars who have left the cinema‐dominant twentieth century for the unpoliced period of nineteenth‐century audiovisual entertainments or for a twenty‐first century that holds out a future of ever‐newer media. Anyone who has learned to deal with artifacts as complex as films, whose textual systems they know how to analyze and whose place within socioeconomic systems they routinely trace, may feel confident when traveling to meet other media phenomena.<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: For Coleridge, I have argued, answering God’s claim is always a struggle. Prayer is the phenomenological concentration on being‐for‐God, “a conscious will‐effected sense of his presence” (N6155), as it is put in 1829. However, as we saw in the second section of this article (“
         Prayer and the Improper: Kant, Coleridge, and Kierkegaard”), such presence is, strictly speaking, unthinkable for the fallen “I.” As such, the thought of being‐for‐God is always cut against the grain of one’s being, will, and understanding. To respond, therefore, is to struggle with oneself, a struggle implicating one’s speech: prayer is also cut across the grain of language. As David Haney notes, there is a sense in which wordless prayer alone could be pure surrender.68Derrida is correct insofar as all the codes and words of prayer bear traces of predication, which, for Coleridge, are fatally intertwined with the understanding of an “I” separate from God. As Luther suggests, prayer “is a constant violent action of the spirit as it is lifted up to God. … We must all practice violence.”69Calling—replying—to God becomes a kind of violence practiced against oneself and one’s language, as is apparent in Coleridge’s description of God as an “Idea [that] worked in you, like the Memory of a Name which we cannot recollect and yet feel that we have, and which reveals its existence in the mind only by a restless anticipation and proves its prior actuality by the almost explosive instantaneity with which it is welcomed & recognized on its re‐emersion” (N4816).<br>

Abstract: Part 1 develops a negative theology of poetic language in conversation with the communicative ethics of Jürgen Habermas. Franke accepts the intersubjectivity of reason, but contra Habermas, he insists that poetry and theology promote radical openness to dialogue through apocalyptic discourse. Part 2 interprets the poetic language of James Joyce as the culmination of Christian epic in secular form. Joyce is illustrative of the way that modernist literature—even in its rejection of traditional religion—remains theological, albeit in a negative sense. In this, Franke draws on Thomas J. J. Altizer’s interpretation of Joyce, but he insists that modern literary apocalypse is not the death of God but radical openness to mystery. The book concludes by restating that such openness is the necessary precondition for self‐transcendence and meaningful dialogue and the means for social transformation.<br>

Abstract: The central scene in Dupré's tableau depicts the emergence of the human mind as the sole “source of meaning and value.” As with Blumenberg, Gauchet, and Taylor, the autonomy of the self is here presented as a response to theological problems originating in the medieval period. Once God had been enshrined as absolute in the “classical-Christian synthesis” of nominalist theology, transcendence posed as much of a threat as an assurance. The omnipotence of divine will, Dupré observes, “abrogated the link of intelligibility that connected the source of reality with its created effect,” so that “God no longer provided rational justification of the world.” In the aftermath of this rupture, “meaning” would now have to be “imposed by the human mind,” a task that in turn required Descartes, Locke, Kant, and their contemporaries to develop “a new sense of selfhood” (Dupré, xi-6, 19–46, quotes on xi, 2–3, 45).<br>

Article Title: Critique and Promise in Paul Tillich’s Political Theology: Engaging Giorgio Agamben on Sovereignty and Possibility<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: The decisive question remains: what is promised? What offered gift can we take as the token‐as‐promise among the wealth of signs and givens that wash through the world? Owing to his view of prophetic criticism, Tillich claimed that yesterday’s prophetic act may be in need of revision and criticism today. This means that few or no signs may be taken as offered tokens. However, it would not be the case, he thinks, that Protestantism simply would carry out a sort of semiotic iconoclasm, wringing its hands, worried that every sign in the world is always a failing. Interestingly, at the end of his essay he turns to the congregation, and there we may find some ways to construe the prophetic as sign of the cross. Tillich does not develop what he calls the protestant form of grace, a chastened form that would dissent in his view from the objectification of what he calls Catholicism. Of course, this is a severely limited judgment on Tillich’s part, since there are many vibrant accounts of the Eucharist—Catholic and Protestant—together with their practical and political significance that are deeply marked by the same engagements and imperatives that Tillich raised.
         46These senses of Eucharist still would benefit from reflection on promise, and its local form in the congregation makes better sense when it is framed by the Eucharist as site of promise, gift, exchange, and free reciprocity. Eucharist, briefly, invokes the character of promise as the offering of Jesus’s testament as well as a mutual action that is both communion as exchange between God and creation as well as in and amid creation. It would not take much to think through the Eucharist as the liturgical action and embodiment of promise, to reconsider it and its practice toward being otherwise than sovereign, as I have written here. Suffice it to note that the Eucharist is a meal of betrayal, as theVerbaalways announce: “On the night in which he was betrayed.”<br>

Abstract: A few days following the announcement of Israel's independence, Blanchot wrote to Lévinas to ask after his reaction given that Lévinas had in earlier discussions emphasized his position that Zionism did not seem to be in accordance with Judaism's destiny. Lévinas responds by explaining his current ambivalence, one that is punctuated, on the one side, by a sense of the miraculous and, on the other, by the feeling that such an event reduces Judaism to the level of the mundane, to the “thirst of ministers, ambassadors, functionaries, and military officers who will finally have their protocols” (Lévinas, “Lettre à Maurice Blanchot sur la création de l'État d'Israël,”
            La Règle du Jeu, no. 41 [Oct. 2009]: 249). See the English translation of this letter in this issue ofCritical Inquiry, p. XXX.<br>

Abstract: However, while it could be argued that these similes function allegorically to show the loss of rational faculty to instinctual drives that explains the condition of the sinners in this circle, and while the similes do indeed describe the actions of the sinners, the vehicles in the similes are not just analogies. Rather, they function as microscopic views of the natural world of creatures and as part of the natural order of Dante's created universe: existing alone, they become sign, signified, and signifying, indifferent to humans or even to their place in the order of creatures; and, like all other creatures, in their immanent presence they perform and participate in a vast cosmic dance. Again, as Agamben puts it, describing animal captivation, the animal possesses a “more spellbinding and intense openness than any kind of human knowledge,” yet “it is closed in a total opacity.”
         62Animals—in this case, ants, fish, and birds—lacking consciousness of themselves as selves are captivated within themselves and by instinct and needs. This captivation, according to Agamben, following Heidegger, makes the world opaque to the nonhuman creature, yet this “captivation” also allows the animal to be “open” to the world, as vestige or footprint of a living divine presence. In this understanding of the ontology of the animal, we recognize that the animal is not in the postlapsarian human strife-ridden condition, trapped between being and nonbeing (consciousness and finitude). Rather, the animal exists in a state of obliviousness about the cares and anxieties that plague human consciousness. With the similes functioning heuristically, we then see the lustful inPurgatorio26, who are harnessing their recalcitrant desires, to aspire to this state possessed by nonhuman creatures and epitomized by the unconscious action of ants. In one sense the condition of the blessed, like that of the ants, is fullness of being, outside consciousness.<br>

Abstract: Appearances notwithstanding, my argument is still concerned with the nature of
      confessioas it comprises time and eternity, memory and oblivion, gift and refusal. By using “comprises,” I mean in fact to raise the question of the seductive sonority ofConfessions. In order to honor that sonority, we should start out by taking literally Augustine's ways of addressing himself to his Confessee throughoutConfessions—from the “You are great, Lord, and highly to be praised” of the beginning to the “knocking on the door, thepulsare, accipereandinvenire” of the end.
            At this point, my criticism of Ricoeur for opening up an independent past and future in the face of eternity may help to specify the temporal nature of16
         confessio. Whereas we—all of us as shaped byConfessions’ afterlife—may be inclined to take the work in its historical sense and look at its author as confessing and reflecting in hindsight on the vicissitudes of his sinful life, his conversion, his subsequent failure to live up to the integrity of the conversional moment, and his meditations on memory, time, and creation,confessio’s razor forces us to be more precise. The fact that the confessor's linguistic hands are tied to the permanent focus/attentio perduratof thepraesens praesentiswould seem to wipe out the notion of hindsight and foresight—or, to put it more accurately—to confine it to the limited scope of thedistentio animi. Instead, what we observe is a confessor whose mind, distending for all it is worth, is at no time allowed to detach his memories and hopes from eternity's pressure on the here and now.<br>

Abstract: Far from an abject capitulation, then, to the spirit of narrative,

It leaves us, in the end, with the powerful, unchanging beauty of flowers and the strange, unchanging beauty of Charlie Kaufman's soul.

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: Even to consider these questions, let alone to feel stirred or moved by them, is, it seems, to begin to doubt the goodness of God.
      38And to doubt the goodness of God, even if you still believe in his existence, is to slide into what was generally understood in the period as atheism.39Perhaps that is why Prynne accused acting companies of “prophanely” playing the history of Faustus despite the fact that the play stages the orthodoxy of the unrepentant magician's damnation. Or perhaps something else was at stake in Prynne's sense that the play was profane. Insofar as Faustus is compelling as a tragic character, his play will reveal the inexorable negativity at the heart of Protestant Christianity; it will lay bare not that damnation is predestined but that salvation itself entails self-obliteration into the absolute otherness of an inscrutable God. From a humanist perspective such Christianity is fundamentally tragic because the life that it offers universalizes all sensuous particularity, all subjectivity signified or even felt in the material embodiment of persons and texts. But the ultimate effect of Marlowe's play is not simply for the audience to doubt whether they should continue to desire God and salvation; rather, it is for the audience terrifyingly to feel that God is watching them doubt and, bending down his “ireful brows,” judging their thoughts and feelings and condemning them to the damnation that they are compelled to contemplate. And in a context where magic was a theatrical show created by the devil but permitted by God so he could see whether his subjects would, as Perkins put it, cleave to him or to the devil and his wicked instruments, to cleave in compassion to Faustus was to sense yourself entering into alliance with the devil, alienated from the inscrutable source of your immortal soul.<br>

Abstract: Finally, it remains unclear how the explicit commitment that I compared to
      prohairesisrelates to the nonreflective level at which commitment still operates in any particular direction of action, even in “letting oneself go in a flight of passion” (64). As I suggested, it seems that the “commitment” necessarily found in spontaneous or unreflective action or omission is no more than the weak endorsement of some reason implicit in any intention, including those of wantons and unwilling addicts. Arguably then, authenticity in actions involving no explicit practical reflection would depend on their being guided by the deeper kind of commitment formed by explicit avowals, in which the more generic type of commitment is made “one’s own” in the deeper sense.<br>

Author(s): Regan Ethna<br>
Abstract: Not content to engage the discourses of theology and human rights by way of definition and description, Regan constructively engages both discourses, building on the work of Karl Rahner, Johann Baptist Metz, and Paul Ricoeur. The heart of the text is this constructive mode. Regan develops a theological anthropology that sees human flourishing, the aim of human being, in a “generosity of existence” (15), which is grounded in and flows from a capacity for God (76). Generosity of existence is the idea that life consists in both giving and receiving toward greater flourishing of oneself, others, and a community of being (112). The notion of generosity of existence includes a capacity for self-determination and is therefore protected by a human rights discourse that seeks to defend a zone of individual human autonomy. But this theological anthropology is not exhausted by individual autonomy. Rather, it links an individual capacity for self-determination to a responsibility for “making oneself” in response both to God and to the embeddedness of human life (82). In this sense, human rights ought to be taken seriously by any theologian who believes human beings ought to orient their lives to God, because violations of human rights severely impair this capacity and impede the possibility of responding to a divine call. She attributes the revelation of a mystical dimension to human rights activism to the insights of liberation theology, which highlights a divine element embedded in the struggle for human rights. But Regan also sees liberation theology as contributing several insights to secular liberal human rights discourse, including an awareness and acknowledgment of the systematic and structural constraints that limit the capacities of the poor of the world to flourish, and highlighting the importance of basic sociocultural rights.<br>

Abstract: The cultural and social sciences are welcome to examine and critique theology and Christian practice, and theology can profitably learn from these studies, but the studies themselves are not theology. To be theology, even in an interdisciplinary sense, the work must become constructive and speak to the
   religiousthought and practice of specific communities or faith traditions. In any given community, theology can become a displaced language in need of renewal, but theology can also uncover the displaced or implicit religion within the seemingly secular. To do this well, theology must remain in critical tension with the cultural sciences, including literature. The result may well be deconstructive, but such radical critique is necessary for any living tradition.<br>

Abstract: However, one could argue that there is a serious problem with his core theory. The problem is this: despite all the polemics and careful exegesis, finally he offers no substantive justification for adopting materialism as a position as opposed to any other position. So, whence comes his materialism? From politics and from political morality. In a critique of Deleuze’s approach he says it is “neither epistemologically fruitful nor politically strategic in contemporary society ” (164). Whether or not an approach is politically strategic in his sense, is a deeply misguided criterion for assessing a theory. Its presentist agenda renders it useless for evaluating theory as such. A theory of religion must be applicable to all forms of religion, not just the ones we encounter in our present. Ultimately, using such a criterion for choosing a theoretical framework makes such a choice subjective, even solipsistic. His criterion makes no sense for the study of ancient religions or for the study of textual traditions, both worthy pursuits. There may be good reasons to study angels and not human beings in the present.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: We gain a sense of Levinas’s commitments here by noting that he distrusts and distances himself from the word “love” that is central to Cavell’s analysis precisely because it implies reciprocity and familiarity.

Abstract: This does not exclude critique. Conflicts and contesting claims have very often served as triggers for the production of alternate narratives. History, then, would never come in the singular
         
               and tends to be contested and endangered. Like memory it has to be studied as a social and communicative enterprise.35
            
               Critically, from the start on, history—as opposed to mere memory—introduces contingency in order to question the established truths of others. To introduce competition into the legitimizing repository of the past is a powerful instrument, but risky. Thus, some epochs and some cultural realms are more open to historiography than others. Religion in particular does not seem a very likely candidate for history. To the contrary, metahistorical claims, gods outside time and immune against change, that is, traditional authority in a Weberian sense seem to be the hallmarks of religion. Frequently myths tell stories of a distant past that establish binding norms despite the fact that this past is categorically different from today, but yet binding based on this fact. Without the help of emic narratives, it seems difficult to narrate a history for a system of rituals.36
            
               Georg Wissowa’s famous handbook37
            Religion und Kultus der Römertried to build a description of Roman religion on a purely systematic reading of Varro’sAntiquitates.
               A polytheist religion, an embedded religion of a city in particular, is an unlikely example for a strategy that seems typical at best for monotheistic, prophetic religion comprising a theology of a history of salvation. Thus, identifying ancient attempts at giving a history to religion would be momentous.38<br>

Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: Hanford, whose edition I cite, clearly segregates the three intersecting voices through his use of double and single quotation marks. But do these marks adequately reflect what happens in this climactic scene? Stanley Fish describes it: “‘Tempt not the Lord thy God; he said.’ Who said? The Son, of course, since the sounds issue from his mouth, but the words are not his…except in the sense that he has identified himself with their speaker. It is not that he appropriates the words, but that they, and their source, appropriate him.”
         
               The great critical question about these two lines is whether, when Jesus says “Tempt not the Lord thy God,” he simply means the Father or whether he now understands his true identity and is essentially telling Satan, “don’t tempt me.”43
            
               Fish’s reading is helpful because it redirects the thorny theological questions of substance, essence, and consubstantiation to the simpler question of quotation. The Son is able to speak the words of the Father so selflessly that he merges with the divine source, becoming the Word of God. We might say that Jesus begins the sentence in quotation marks but that the Son concludes them in his own voice—just as Adam begins speaking the words of Satan only to discover that they are unfortunately his own. In both cases, Milton demands something beyond the powers of our everyday typographical equipment. What we need in such instances is a mark to signify diminishing quotation—the process whereby words attributed to another gradually become, in the act of enunciation, the speaker’s own. If44
            Paradise Lostillustrates how easily this may happen in the case of satanic speech,Paradise Regainedoffers the possibility that it can work in the opposite direction. When the Son speaks, the divisive quotes miraculously slip away as the human and the divine merge in the space of a single utterance. This is the nature of real union with God on the poem: you start qu~<br>

         Paul’s New Moment: Continental Philosophy and the Future of Christian Theology(Grand Rapids, MI: Brazos Press, 2010), 90–91. And second, “is not the circular relationship between the Event and the subject (the subject serves the Event in his or her fidelity, but the Event itself is visible as such only to an already engaged subject) the very circle of ideology?” (92).<br>

Article Title: Figures of Pain in Early Modern English Tragedy<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>

Abstract: Figurative language may not be a primary means of conveying painful sensation, but it is paramount in assigning significance to those sensations and affecting audience reactions to its portrayal—perhaps even coercing them into an interpretation they would otherwise reject. In the artistic and theatrical exploration of human suffering, metaphors and pain are intimately linked because it is this interpretive trope that cues audience response and assigns meaning to an otherwise horrifyingly senseless bodily experience. The figures of pain discussed here attest to the artistry of these playwrights, but also to the power of metaphor and other tropes to shape the thinking of an entire culture. As Wayne C. Booth writes of metaphor’s role in community discourse, “The metaphors we care for most are always embedded in metaphoric structures that finally both depend on and constitute selves and societies.”
   
            Early modern culture utilized numerous discourses to make sense of pain, from seeing it as a sign of devotion in the Petrarchan lover or religious martyr to construing it as evidence of guilt in systems of corporal or capital punishment. Early modern tragic theater draws on those cultural narratives, but it also serves as a space for practicing the types of interpretation needed to make sense of pain—an understanding that extended outward at the close of the play. By being attentive to the moments of spectacular suffering that define these plays, by noting the philosophical and affective purposes those spectacles serve, we can see at work the same systems of interpretation that made possible many early modern cultural discourses, from the literary to the judicial to the spiritual. Far from being irreconcilable, pain and metaphor work in conjunction in early modern tragedy to create a durable interpretive community out of a single, yet multifaceted, physical experience.51<br>

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak is concerned with the relation between philosophy and faith, more than any other topic, however. Following his phenomenology of philosophical conversation, he claims, “The encounter with God is somewhat comparable to a face-to-face relationship that stretches me when I look up to a human person who loves me. Since God is infinite, however, faith and love toward God encompass the universe of all that exists. … Faith thus mobilizes and orients the entirety of one’s existence from top to bottom” (120–21). Peperzak regards faith as a fundamental Desire that orients us in an encounter with the absolute. As such, there is no clean separation of faith and philosophy. All thinking emerges from some sort of faith, and while philosophy has a universality that can engender conversation across differences of faith orientation, its autonomy is a relative and limited one. Moreover, Peperzak associates the infinity of God encountered as Other with the Platonic Good that illuminates all thinking and being, while itself escaping thematization: “the
      phila(love) ofphilosophiareaches out toward a wisdom (sophia) that implies … a sense of the difference between this cosmos and the ultimately desired but ungiven Good. … By longing, Eros reaches further than any theory” (159).<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D.<br>
Abstract: Popkin starts by positioning himself within the current debate on narrative theory. In an interesting and informative chapter he criticizes in particular Hayden White and Paul Ricoeur for largely ignoring autobiographical writing while discussing the problem of history and fiction. He concludes that the hybrid genre of autobiography does not fit into their approach. Autobiography is, as he writes, both historical and fictional, both private and public, both truthful and imagined. The genre must therefore be distinguished from both history and fiction. Popkin, citing David Carr, stresses that autobiography is primarily making sense of experience by giving it narrative form.<br>

Author(s): Eubanks Cecil<br>
Abstract: This theme of a postliberal order is explored in
         Eric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmoderns, which attempts to understand Voegelin as a postmodern thinker in search of a philosophical foundation but without foundationalism: to see whether a society can recover a sense of transcendence without resorting to metaphysical certainty (21). In “Voegelin and Ricoeur,” Peter Petrakis opens the book with the belief that such a recovery is possible. By showing how both thinkers believed that stories and symbols can serve as a foundation for politics and ethics, Petrakis demonstrates how both Voegelin and Rioecur can recover transcendence without returning to metaphysical certainty. Both Voegelin and Ricoeur cite a “unified self” who symbolizes or creates a narrative out of his experiences that can be verified both externally and internally. Critical to this understanding is that the “unified self” is one that respects the mystery of being and therefore does not attempt to place himself outside of reality to survey all of it: The self exists within a historical or linguistic process not of his own making and must accept it. By accepting this epistemologically limited position, the “unified self” protects himself against charges of metaphysical reductionism.<br>

Abstract: The very centrality of its questions to literary studies may be the greatest handicap for
   Translating Investments.Words That Matter, especially in its recovery of grammatical theory, had more surprises page-for-page. Here the big ideas are perforce more familiar, the innovations more incremental. The reward, however, is a fine sense of metaphor as a cultural project across an especially broad range of terrain in early modern England. Anderson insists, and teaches us to insist, on the local, historical conditions of metaphor’s torpor and vitality, how writers thought about and went about killing and quickening the trope she calls “the scaffolding of human culture” (216).<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Abstract: This article seeks to understand erasures, instability, and queerness in the
         I am Bradley Manningcampaign. As social media increasingly provides digital places for people to create, convene, and participate in social movements and protest, there is a corresponding need to understand how these movements work, what they mean for individuals as an exercise of citizenship, and what they mean as movements in communities, cultures, and states. This article explores theI am Bradley Manningcampaign on Tumblr as an important object of study in understanding new forms of public protest and social movements. Many of these movements are not disruptive in the same sense of traditional forms of protest as we have understood them: protests in physical spaces and places that disrupt everyday life and living. Instead, these are protests that take place in virtual digital places, which at times provide little physical or material disruption of the everyday. This article is an attempt to begin understanding new ways we might frame or understand disruption and protest in light of digital movements.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: hsns.2012.42.issue-5<br>
Date: 11 2012<br>
Abstract: This essay brings together and builds upon histories of cold war American science and studies of objectivity, scientific personae, and the self by exploring the physicist Merle A. Tuve‘s career in the late 1940s and 1950s as a history of selfhood and the emotional dimensions of scientific identity. As director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington after World War II, Tuve followed a convoluted path through the institutions, politics, identities, and sensibilities of science in the cold war, and he struggled to preserve a sense of meaning and identity centered on the humanistic and aesthetic possibilities of scientific inquiry in an era of rapidly growing instrumentalism. His predicament highlights not just the political and institutional shifts within postwar science, but also the intricate entanglements between feeling, selfhood, and the cold war order.<br>

Abstract: Among other interpretations one should also think of this rhetoric as a means to justify the subdivision of power within architectural offices. Sociologist Judith Blau stated, in her
               Architects and Firms: A Sociological Perspective on Architectural Practice(Cambridge and London: MIT Press, 1987), 26, that in architecture similar training and shared knowledge create a bond between different echelons within the firm. Blau and Cuff (Architecture,130–37), demonstrate that this bond brings the sense of purpose to entry-level architects' every day activities—but it could also lead to subtle forms of exploitation. Clearly, the presentation of the production of working drawings as pleasurable and enjoyable was directed toward aspiring architects and the lower echelons of architects' offices, to encourage an understanding of the material qualities of a project, and this rewarding and pleasurable aspect of being an architect. See Woods,From Craft to Profession, 141–46, for her depiction of the complex mixture of camaraderie and exploitation that took place in architectural offices at the turn of the century.<br>

Author(s): Hiddleston Jane<br>
Abstract: This article examines the conflicts of 1990s Algeria and Assia Djebar's critique of these events using the flexibility and experimentation of the novel form. The entrenched government of the Front de Libération Nationale has been engaged in an ongoing conflict with a group of radical, underground Islamist terrorists, and the result has been that both parties attempt to quash any political or cultural dissent. The government clings to its policy of strict Arabization, while the Islamists fight for the invention of a thoroughly new spiritual, Islamic community, necessarily in harmony with itself. Djebar's
         Le Blanc de l'Algérie (Algerian White)challenges both the Islamists and the government by exposing the limits of their stultifying rhetoric, and by describing the author's own experiences of bereavement using an alternative language resistant to generic norms. Djebar upholds unique, creative forms of commemoration that refuse to conform to the demands of Islamist ideology or sanctioned political rhetoric, and that can mimic her deceased friends' own singular art forms. At the same time, Djebar's commemorative text seeks a language free from convention-bound formulae and able to transcend the linear progress of a narrative necessarily evolving through time. In this sense,Le Blanc de l'Algérieuses both content and form to deconstruct the layers and masks of commemorative discourse, and the political misuse of those masks. The novel engages with the difficulties of creating an appropriate discourse of mourning while stretching and opening out existing rhetorical forms.<br>

Author(s): Webster James<br>
Abstract: 3. A brief account of the crucial role of the 1790s in these developments, focusing on the complementary achievements of Haydn and Beethoven. For Beethoven, Haydn's and Mozart's music was, precisely, modern. Together, he and Haydn dominated the Viennese scene, producing ever-more-imposing masterworks in every genre except opera. This explicitly modernist orientation was fostered, if not indeed in part created, by their patrons. After 1800 Beethoven maintained and further developed this same tradition. These years "between" Enlightenment and Romanticism were no mere transition; they constituted an equally weighty phase, on the same historical-structural "level," as those that preceded and followed it. Concomitantly, Romanticism as such did not become predominant in music until 1815, in Viennese music (except for the Lied) perhaps not even until 1828/30. For both reasons, it makes sense to regard the beginning of the music-historical nineteenth century as having been "delayed," until around 1815 or 1830.<br>

Abstract: In the winter of 1905, leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (L.D.S or the "Mormons") departed Utah on two seemingly disparate missions to the east coast. One contingent went to defend their church at Senate hearings in Washington, D.C.; the other, to Vermont to dedicate a monument to church founder Joseph Smith. These forays into national politics and religious memory refashioned Latter-day Saint identity, as well as public perception of Mormonism for the remainder of the twentieth century. They also illuminate one of the quotidian mysteries of religion: how it adapts to the demands of time, yet maintains its sense of mediating the eternal.<br>

Author(s): Gross Daniel M.<br>
Abstract: Abstract: Vico's theory of metaphor is best understood as a monster in the tradition of classical rhetorical invention. It is the mutant offspring of metaphor characterized as "necessary" (an "ear" of com, for example) and metaphor characterized in terms of analogy. From the perspective of his method. Vico marries these apparently incompatible forms inherited from Aristotle and thereby identifies a third type of linguistic metaphor. I argue that the metaphor identifies a stipulatory definition taken out of context. In order to situate this claim, I outline Vico's genetic analysis and elaborate in general terms what metaphor and definition share. Most importantly. Vico insists that beings, actions, and events are linguistically identifiedin some particular diseursive context. Indeed, in many cases that context alone determines whether the expression can be called a definition or a metaphor. Like Cicero's ideal jurist, Vico's hero employs motivated words and realizes possibilities available to common sense. Henee Vico's theory of metaphor is both "constructivist"—language has the power to makes things—and "humartist"—it must do so in a form appropriate to history and culture. Vico's theory is consequently important to us because it challenges the proper/figurative distinction championed in the philosophy of language and adds a pragmatic dimension to contemporary views of metaphor at work in literary theory.<br>

Author(s): Newman Sara<br>
Abstract: In the
         Rhetoric, Aristotle identifies "bringing-before-the-eyes" as a capacity that is crucial to metaphors because it allows rhetors to actualize actions immediately before audiences, leading those audiences to insight. Because this description suggests that metaphors activate cognitive mechanisms on the part of their listeners, "bringing-before-the-eyes" has been considered a key element within Aristotle's theory and the nexus of that approach to metaphor and contemporary conceptual ones. Yet, no study has probed these claims to any degree. Accordingly, this paper examines Aristotle's references to "bringing-before-the-eyes" as well as to two associated concerns,energeia/actualization and sense perception. This examination demonstrates that "bringing-before-the-eyes" is not explicitly cognitive but instead a perceptive capacity. In this, Aristotle's theory anticipates recent approaches to language because it allows the audience to participate in the persuasive process at a level that extends its role beyond the traditional Aristotelian understanding that it is the target of emotional appeals.<br>

Abstract: The cross-cultural program of research presented here is about matters of temporal persistence-personal persistence and cultural persistence-and about solution strategies for solving the paradox of "sameness-in-change." The crux of this paradox resides in the fact that, on threat of otherwise ceasing to be recognizable as a self, all of us must satisfy at least two constitutive conditions. The first of these is that selves are obliged to keep moving or die, and, so, must continually change. The second is that selves must also somehow remain the same, lest all notions of moral responsibility and any commitment to an as yet unrealized future become nonsensical. Although long understood as a problem demanding the attention of philosophers, we argue that this same paradox arises in the ordinary course of identity development and dictates the different developmental routes taken by culturally mainstream and Aboriginal youth in coming to the identity-preserving conclusion that they and others are somehow continuous through time. Findings from a set of five studies are presented. The first and second studies document the development and refinement of a method for parsing and coding what young people say on the topic of personal persistence or self-continuity. Both studies demonstrate that it is not only possible to seriously engage children as young as age 9 or 10 years in detailed and codable discussions about personal persistence, but that their reasoning concerning such matters typically proceeds in an orderly and increasingly sophisticated manner over the course of their early identity development. Our third study underscores the high personal costs of failing to sustain a workable sense of personal persistence by showing that failures to warrant self-continuity are strongly associated with increased suicide risk in adolescence. Study four documents this same relation between continuity and suicide, this time at the macrolevel of whole cultures, and shows that efforts ~<br>

Article Title: Education as Text: The Varieties of Educational Hiddenness<br>
Publisher: John Wiley & Sons<br>
Issue: i250429<br>
Date: 12 1, 1968<br>
Author(s): Wittgenstein David<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz have been concerned with the notion of human action as text. This text, like all texts, has manifest and hidden meanings. The hidden meanings indicate a "semantic" function of social activities, in the sense that they provide members of a society with readings of their experience, by telling them about themselves, their values, beliefs, and cultures. Ricoeur's and Geertz's ideas are used to examine the notion of "education as text". Because Ricoeur and Geertz stress hidden meaning, their ideas lead us to an analysis of the "hidden curriculum". The hidden curriculum is a reading of an educational text, normally performed by students. However, as Ricoeur argues, texts can be read by anyone. The question then arises: which sort of hidden curriculum is read not only by the students, but by all members of society? What sort of reading of society's experience is provided when education is a text read by all? I propose the hypothesis that education then becomes a text about society's myths and sacred beliefs.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.<br>

Author(s): Wilson Sigrun<br>
Abstract: Narrative structures are readily available in our culture and people automatically draw on them in most meaning-making activities. The research interview is one of many such activities. Narrative structures influence how informants remember their experience and subsequently tell researchers about it in an interview. Researchers also draw upon narrative structures because they hear and understand in narratives. Informal or implicit interpretation as opposed to explicit interpretation are discussed. The "iceberg" metaphor is used to describe the two kinds of interpretation. The tip of the iceberg is explicit interpretation, which is what researchers write in their research reports. The biggest part, however, is informal interpretation. It is out of sight and usually unexamined because it is built into the strategies researchers employ to make sense of data.<br>

Article Title: Formal Fascinations and Nagging Excerpts: The Challenge of the Arts to Curriculum and Inquiry<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.<br>
Issue: i250466<br>
Date: 4 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): White Marcy Singer<br>
Abstract: This article examines challenges to discourses of curriculum research and practice by the growing fascination with alternative forms of representation. The author takes as a starting point a cluster of exchanges with students that were situated in a study of a classroom in which music and image joined word and number as essential sources for learning about a context irreducibly distant from students' own: the past. In the study, what seemed to make painting, photography, film, and poetry potent sources of understanding was their capacity to bridge the gap between a remote, textbook past, and the sensory world of the students' present; these forms expressed to students not only the outline of events, but also what the events signified and felt like. Yet, in juxtaposing students' comments against discourses of historiography, philosophical aesthetics, and history teaching and learning, one soon recognizes that the very ability of the arts to communicate a sense of immediacy and human intention is what makes them problematic as sources of historical insight: in pushing out the boundaries of "acceptable" forms beyond discursive text, one also pushes up against assumptions about the nature and purposes of knowledge and inquiry. While the starting point of this article is historical inquiry, the author argues that the difficulties of representing experiences of persons in contexts removed in time or space, and of making sense of others' representations, are relevant to other forms of inquiry; the challenge of the arts to historical inquiry is paralleled in other fields, and no less in educational research.<br>

Article Title: 'Getting out and Getting Away': Women's Narratives of Class Mobility<br>
Publisher: Taylor & Francis Group<br>
Issue: i260667<br>
Date: 10 1, 1931<br>
Author(s): Woolf Steph<br>
Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which women narrate a move from a 'working-class' position to a position marked (in however fragmentary and complex a way) as 'middle class'. While such a move might be seen in terms of a straightforward escape from a disadvantaged social position, I argue here that what has to be analysed is the pain and the sense of estrangement associated with this class movement. Drawing on the class narratives of a group of seven white British women, the article uses Bourdieu's concepts of symbolic capital and habitus to explore the cultural and symbolic configurations of class. These configurations may be inscribed into the self, so that the self, itself, is class marked. Since working-class selves are frequently marked in pathological terms, this raises particular difficulties for the idea of an 'escape' from such a position. Class in this sense is embedded in people's history and so cannot be so easily 'escaped'. The usual conventions of life-narratives - in which the self remains the same entity from birth to death and later events are a culmination of earlier ones - are also disrupted in this case. But if a working-class position is marked as pathological, so too is taking on the markers of middle-class existence. to do so is not only to risk 'getting it wrong', but it is also to risk the scorn attached to 'pretentiousness'. There is a particular jeopardy here for women, since it is women who have been especially associated with desires for artefacts associated with bourgeois existence. The article argues for a focus for classed desires and class envy, not in pathological terms, but in terms of a coherent response to political and social exclusions.<br>

Article Title: Is Zoroastrianism Dualistic or Monotheistic?<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263718<br>
Date: 12 1, 1961<br>
Author(s): Zaehner Donald A.<br>
Abstract: The question raised in the title has been much debated by past and present interpreters of Zoroastrianism. In the first two parts of this paper we present some dualistic and monotheistic interpretations of the religion. The interpretations can be labeled as follows: 1. DUALISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks Omnipotence And Omniscience (Dhalla, Henning) 2. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks A Physical Nature (Shaked, Boyce) II. MONOTHEISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The Created Spirits View (Zaehner, Fox, Gershevitch) 2. The Transformationist (Maskhiyya) View 3. The Zurvānite View 4. The View That Good And Evil Are Coeternal Only In A Logical Sense (Moulton, Bode and Nanavutty, Duchesne-Guillemin) We present each of these views and discuss it critically in light of the following criteria: (1) textual evidence; (2) the continuity of the religion throughout its history, including the present time; (3) philosophical cogency; and (4) religious satisfaction. Our conclusion is that each of the above positions, despite its elements of strength, falls seriously short of one or more of these criteria, and hence that there is need for a more adequate interpretation of Zoroastrianism than any of them can offer. Accordingly, we present another interpretation in order to provoke further discussion and, hopefully, to advance the cause of trying to gain a more precise grasp of the teachings of this remarkable religion. In brief, the interpretation we favor is that Zoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique to itself among the major religions of the world. This combination results in a religious outlook which cannot be categorized as either straightforward dualism or straightforward monotheism, meaning that the question in the title of this paper poses a false dichotomy. The dichotomy arises, we contend, from a failure to take seriously enough the central role played by time in Zoroast~<br>

Article Title: Toward a Generic Analysis of a Classic of the Social Gospel: An Essay-Review of Walter Rauschenbusch<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263714<br>
Date: 12 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Rauschenbusch Walter<br>
Abstract: Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis, viewed by many as the masterpiece of the social gospel movement, has been confined to the dusty shelves of the library. Can we catch no glimpse of what astounded its massive reading public, no glimmer of Rauschenbusch's own sense of the work as a "dangerous book" written in fear and trembling? This article suggests that a generic analysis of Christianity and the Social Crisis might lead to surprising disclosures. Any generic analysis involves the discussion of a group of texts. Consequently this study proceeds via a comparison of the structure of Christianity and the Social Crisis with those of other works of a similar type which were produced between 1890 and 1915. The genre is isolated by utilizing the techniques of Tzvetan Todorov. Certain negative traits are specified which separate the genre from its neighbors. The positive leitmotif of a dual crisis-a crisis affecting society as a whole and the ramifications of that crisis within the Christian churches-is specified as the decisive trait of the genre. To deal with this leitmotif a specific structure was generated by the works under consideration. They provided-to pirate the words of Clifford Geertz in his landmark essay on modern ideologies-"maps of problematic reality" and "matrices for the creation of collective conscience." In designing their maps of problematic reality our authors worked along two separate but related vectors. The first of these vectors was constituted by a historical analysis of the origins of the present crisis, while the second consisted of a systemic analysis of the present social order. Each of these elements of the genre is examined in turn. The mapping of problematic reality by means of a historical and a structural analysis was geared towards provoking as well as defining the crisis. Crisis, once defined, demanded decision. Nevertheless the "permanent basis for action" which Rauschenbusch and others sought could not be groun~<br>

Abstract: This essay examines, from the point of view of an existential hermeneutics, five accounts of transpersonal experience: Robert Monroe's Journeys Out of the Body, Paul's experience in the third heaven in II Corinthians 12, a description of rapture by Teresa of Avila, a disembodied vision of guardian spirits by John Lilly from The Center of the Cyclone, and the vision of the assault of the Lords of the Dead from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Through a consideration of world, embodiment, death, care and other existential categories, the discussion in each case focuses on a central ambiguity about the personal identity of the narrator. The question of authenticity, in a Heideggerian sense, is posed to these materials, and the central ambiguity is shown to strike so deeply as to undercut the assumption of autonomy as the criterion of authenticity. Being-toward-death is relativized in such experiences, but relativized by an even more radical threat to individual existence. In conclusion, some generalized principles are offered as heuristic criteria for interpreting transpersonal experience in general.<br>

a word (or phrase). In this sense, definitions are about words, and not about the things words are

them in a more restricted pathological sense" [3].

Abstract: Catherine Gallagher writes against the critical tendency to foreground
Deronda's Jewishness. As Gallagher points out, "It seems an odd twist...when the
dreadful, shameful veiled core of meaning to which so much in the novel alludes
turns out not to be a loose woman, a public or private concubine, but an artist, the
greatest lyric actress of her time. All through his life, Daniel has thought that he
stood as the sign of his mother's sexual sin...Instead of having been abandoned as
a sign of shameful sex, Daniel was literally traded for an artistic career; he is, in
this sense, the representative of his mother's career because he is the thing that
she exchanged for it" (53).

Abstract: By and large, most models of metaphor entertained in contemporary cognitive literature assume that metaphor is a relationship between two given entities whose attributes are defined prior to the relationship established between them. The metaphoric sense is produced through the selection of a subset of these attributes. In this paper I take issue with this view. My discussion is couched in the consideration of four basic cognitive assumptions: (1) the fixedness assumption, (2) the selectional assumption, (3) an assumption about the primacy of constituents over wholes, and (4) an assumption about meaning and interpretation. Against these assumptions I consider metaphors taken from literary texts, the semantics of non-metaphoric linguistic expressions, judgments of similarity, synesthesia, and patterns in both child development and the evolution of culture. An outline for an alternative view of metaphor is then presented, which is couched in the broader context of nonrepresentational psychology. In addition, the functional significance of metaphor is discussed and a pluralistic perspective on metaphor is proposed.<br>

Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
Abstract: The first part of the essay explore's three features of Wolterstorff's account of God as a performer of speech acts: (1) the claim that God literally speaks, suggesting that this claim needs something like a Thomistic theory of analogy as an alternative to univocity and mere metaphor; (2) the claim that speaking is not reducible to revealing; and (3) the political implications of these claims, especially in relation to Habermasian theory. The second part focuses on the theory of double discourse, which seeks to make sense of the notion that God speaks to us through the human voices of prophets, apostles, and especially of Scripture, and seeks to show that a fuller account of the speech act by which God deputizes or appropriates human speech is needed. The final section suggests that Ricoeur and Derrida are not the threat to his theory that Wolterstorff takes them to be and that their emphasis on the text, rather than the author, makes sense in contexts where we have only the text to consult.<br>

Author(s): Fisher William P.<br>
Abstract: Academia's mathematical metaphysics are briefly explored en route to an elaboration of the qualitatively rigorous requirements underpinning the calibration and unambiguous interpretation of quantitative instrumentation in any science. Of particular interest are Gadamer's emphases on number as the paradigm of the noetic, on the role of play in interpretation, and on Hegel's sense of method as the activity of the thing itself that thought experiences. These point toward and overlap with (1) Latour's study of the metrological social networks through which technological phenomena are brought into language as modes of being that can be understood, and (2) the way that Rasch's models for measurement comprise a potential beginning for metaphysically astute, qualitatively and quantitatively integrated, mathematical methods in the social sciences. The paper closes with observations on the general problem that is philosophy, the need to remain open to multiplicities of meaning even as clear understandings are sought and obtained.<br>

Author(s): Vinyard Dana<br>
Abstract: This paper provides a phenomenological account of the writing of a young woman diagnosed with schizophrenia. The method of interpretation is to put ourselves in the place of the author drawing upon a combination of sympathy, reason, common-sense, experience, and "an intersubjective world, common to us all" (Schutz, 1945: 536). The result is the recognition of the person as also capable of putting herself in the place of others so as to understand their behavior. This "role-taking success" identifies the limits of the current sociological understanding of insanity's significance in social interaction as an instance of "role-taking failure" (Rosenberg, 1992).<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20011187<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Topper Keith<br>
Abstract: In recent years a number of writers have defended and attacked various features of structural, or neo-realist theories of international politics. Few, however, have quarrelled with one of the most foundational features of neorealist theory: its assumptions about the nature of science and scientific theories. In this essay I assess the views of science underlying much neorelist theory, especially as they are articulated in the work of Kenneth Waltz. I argue not only that neorealist theories rest on assumptions about science and theory that have been questioned by postpositivist philosophers and historians of science, but also that the failure to consider the work of these writers yields theories of international politics that are deficient in several respects: they are "weak" theories in the sense that they cannot illuminate crucial features of international politics, they presuppose and sustain a narrow view of power and power relations, they reify practices and relations in the international arena and they offer little promise of producing the sort of "Copernican Revolution" for which Waltz called (or, more modestly, even a minimally satisfactory theory of international politics). In light of these shortcomings, I sketch an alternative approach to the study of international affairs, one that has been termed "prototype studies." I contend that such an approach provides scholars with a rigorous way of studying international politics, without being a theoretical science.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i20099867<br>
Date: 6 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Bird Robert<br>
Abstract: Aleksej Losev's definition of myth centres on the concept of detachment. In modern times detachment has most often figured in the context of philosophical aesthetics, where it is a cognitive category akin to Kant's "disinterestedness" or the Russian formalists' "estrangement." However Losev's usage also makes reference to the ontological sense of detachment as contemplative ascent (cf. Meister Eckhardt's "Abgeschiedenheit"). Thus, Losev's concept of myth combines both senses of detachment, binding perceptual attitude and being together in a double movement of resignation from the world and union with meaning; this movement literally makes sense out of reality. It therefore bears comparison to the treatment of distanciation in contemporary hermeneutics, where detachment is a key condition of understanding. By investigating Losev's connections to other Russian thinkers, the author makes a case for a distinct Russian tradition of hermeneutic philosophy (V. Ivanov, G. Shpet, A. Bakshy, A. Losev).<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i20117410<br>

Author(s): Horst Steven<br>
Abstract: It has recently been claimed (1) that mental states such as beliefs are theoretical entities and (2) that they are therefore, in principle, subject to theoretical elimination if intentional psychology were to be supplanted by a psychology not employing mentalistic notions. Debate over these two issues is seriously hampered by the fact that the key terms 'theoretical' and 'belief' are ambiguous. This article argues that there is only one sense of 'theoretical' that is of use to the eliminativist, and in this sense some kinds of "belief" (dispositional states, infra-conscious states and the Freudian unconscious) are indeed "theoretical" and hence possible candidates for elimination, while others (consciously occurring thoughts like judgements and perceptual Gestalten) are not theoretical and hence not candidates for elimination.<br>

Publisher: The Johns Hopkins University Press<br>
Issue: i20486733<br>
Date: 2 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Addis Adeno<br>
Abstract: The assertion of prescriptive and adjudicative universal jurisdictions by some countries in relation to a handful of offenses that are classified as international or universal crimes (e.g. genocide) has led to a great deal of controversy. Those who favor universal jurisdiction argue that certain acts (often crimes) affect all of us, not just the specific individual or group of victims or the country of which the victims are nationals. It is therefore legitimate, they argue, for any state to punish or suppress such acts regardless of any traditional jurisdictional connection between the alleged acts and the state asserting jurisdiction. The availability of universal jurisdiction is premised on the presumed effect of certain crimes on humanity as a whole. Those who commit these offenses are referred to as hostis humani generis--enemies of human kind. Skeptics argue that the idea of universal jurisdiction is conceptually incoherent, inconsistent with the principle of political self-determination, and has great potential to be an instrument of political mischief. While they disagree on the conceptual coherence and utility of the notion of universal jurisdiction, both proponents and opponents view its function in purely instrumental terms, to provide the condition for punishing or suppressing certain offenses that affect all of us. This article argues that universal jurisdiction also serves another, less articulated purpose. It has a constitutive function as well. It is partly a process through which the identity of the international community is imagined and enacted. It is an expression of a sense of ourselves (a community of humankind) at given moments of time. This article argues that neglect of this constitutive dimension leads to an incomplete analysis of universal jurisdiction.<br>

Article Title: Responsible Belief and Our Social Institutions<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i20533165<br>

Author(s): van Woudenberg René<br>
Abstract: The idea that we can properly be held responsible for what we believe underlies large stretches of our social and institutional life; without that idea in place, social and institutional life would be unthinkable, and more importantly, it would stumble and fall. At the same time, philosophers have argued that this idea is strange, puzzling, beyond belief, false, meaningless or at any rate defective. The first section develops the alleged problem. The burden of this paper, however, is not to discuss the merits of this idea but rather to measure the damage in case the idea turns out to be defective indeed. This is done by substantiating the claim that this idea indeed underlies large and important stretches of our social and institutional life. Section 2 substantiates that claim by presenting the results of a web search on the use of what I call "deontological epistemic expressions", i.e. expressions in which deontological and epistemological notions (both broadly construed) are combined; examples are "obligation to believe", "not permitted to forget", "right to know". The ubiquitous use of these expressions, I argue, is linguistic evidence for the claim that the contested idea indeed pervades our social life. Linguistic evidence, however, can be frail and misleading. From the fact that we say that the shade is moving we cannot conclude that shades really exist; likewise it may not be permitted to conclude from the ubiquitous use of deontological epistemic expressions that there really are doxastic obligations (and hence doxastic responsibilities). The third section, therefore, moves beyond the linguistic evidence and discusses two social institutions, viz. education and law as we find them in modern Western societies, and argues that they cannot be made sense of unless the contested idea is in place. Educational and legal systems of course vary greatly throughout the Western world. Such differences as exist, however, are irrelevant for the claim I will be making in t~<br>

Author(s): Weber Charles F.<br>
Abstract: Although the Thai-Lao peasants living in rain-fed agricultural communities in northeastern Thailand have experienced some improvements in their socioeconomic situation as a consequence of the growth of the Thai economy since the mid-1950s, these peasants still constitute the poorest sector of the population of Thailand. Moreover, the socioeconomic position of the rural northeastern Thai populace has actually declined relative to that of the urban populace and that of the rural populace living in central Thailand. The economic disadvantageous position of Thai-Lao peasants is linked with a sense of being an ethnoregional minority within a polity that has been highly centralized since reforms instituted at the end of the nineteenth century. Much of the social action of Thai-Lao peasants with reference to the political-economic constraints on their world can be understood, as long-term research in one community reveals, as having been impelled by rational calculation aimed at improving the well being of peasant families. The ways in which peasants have assessed in practice the justice of these constraints as well as the ways in which they have assessed the limits to entrepreneurship must be seen, however, as being rooted in moral premises that Thai-Lao villagers have appropriated from Theravada Buddhism as known to them in their popular culture.<br>

Abstract: Le Quincuplex psalterium... est édité en 1509, puis 1513 ; le Psalterium auctum...
en 1524 (cf. G. Bedouelle, Lefèvre d'Etaples et l'interprétation de l'Ecriture, Thèse multigr.,
Paris, 1972 ; et plus précisément une communication inédite présentée à l'Institut
d'Histoire de la Réformation : « Lefèvre d'Etaples et la « veritas hebraica » des
Psaumes »). Les S. Psalmorum libri quinque ad ebraicam veritatem... in latinum traducti;
... tum familiari explanatione elucidati, sont édités par M. Bucer, sous le pseudonyme
de Aretius Felinus, à Strasbourg, en 1529. A leur propos R. G. Hobbs, An introduction
to the Psalms Commentary of Martin Bucer, Thèse multigr., Strasbourg, 1971, peut
écrire : « If Pellican's Psalter found limited favour with Bucer despite the close personal
ties between the two men, it should not surprise that there are no traces whatever in
the S. Ps. Libri Quinqué of the Quincuplex Psalterium... Despite therefore a common
interest in the scopus of scripture, the Christ, and the rejection of the four-fold sense,
the gulf between the two methods of approach to the Psalter is too great to permit a
reconciliation... » (Vol. I, p. 218 et 220). En 1552, on relève que Jean de Gaigny utilise
le commentaire de « Felinus » (cf. Clarissima et facillima in quatuor sacra I. C. Evangelia,
Paris, 1552, fol. 11r. sur Matth. 5, 21). Indice cependant d'un oubli qui n'est pas total,
Jean Alabri (Arboreus), Primus Tomus Theosophiae..., Paris, 1540, cite en l'approuvant
l'explication de Ps. 8,6 « minuisti eum a Deo » par Lefèvre, qui s'était violemment
opposé à Erasme à ce propos (fol. 5r).<br>

Abstract: Caryl Phillips's narrative is painfully concerned with the relationship of Empire, Colony, and the In-between; Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean; slavery, rebellion, and freedom; Men, women and children; absent or useless fathers and damaged, aimless sons. It explores what hold in common while never losing sight of the painful quotidian, the specific. It is a narrative where the picaresque shakes hands with the epic and the linearity is broken, encircled, and put fast forward or in reverse by a mise-en-abîme of sorts: the tale-within-the-tale-within-the-tale even if interrupted by the tapestry of an emergent voice that finally proposes itself as both the identity and the difference of its verbal universe. "Enter your own self and discover the world," Phillips seems to be saying, "but also go out into the world and discover yourself." Once that call is answered, fiction itself becomes another way of questioning truth as we strive for it through the paradox of a lie. That lie can be called the imagination. It can also be seen as a parallel reality. For it may be observed as a critical mirror of what passes for the truth in the world of convention. It certainly sets up a second universe of being, where the narrator, say Cambridge in Cambridge, has a reality greater, though no less important, than the host of hastily met and then forgotten people we deal with on a daily basis. It is in this sense that Phillips brings into light another way of telling in that his narrative gives weight and presence to the virtues and vices—the fugitive personalities—of our daily acquaintance. This is the prerogative of his style, which I try to discuss in this essay. It has the power to render disenchantment and pleasure without resolving the contradiction between them. In fact, what holds them in tension, as equal forces straining in opposite directions, is the artist's mature subjectivity, stripped of hubris, unashamed either of its fallibility or of the modest assurance it has gained ~<br>

Abstract: Gaston Berger, le fondateur des Études philosophiques (1926), a joué un rôle décisif dans l'introduction intellectuelle, mais aussi matérielle et institutionnelle, de la phénoménologie de Husserl en France. À partir de documents inédits et d'une lecture, dès lors renouvelée, de la thèse sur Le cogito dans la philosophie de Husserl, cette étude montre l'originalité de l'interprétation que donne Berger de la phénoménologie husserlienne, ainsi que les réserves qu'il formule à l'égard de certains thèmes: le moi absolu, la tension entre l'intention et l'intuition, sans oublier la réappropriation de la réduction phénoménologique sous le mode d'un détachement. En ce sens, il apparaît, d'une part, que Berger est un représentant typique de la première génération française des « disciples » de Husserl et que, d'autre part, la réception qu'il en fait est déjà révélatrice de problématiques propres à certains phénoménologues contemporains. Gaston Berger, the founder of Études philosophiques (1926), played a decisive role in the intellectual and also material and institutional introduction of Husserl's phenomenology into France. Based on unpublished documents permitting a new reading of his thesis Le cogito dans la philosophie de Husserl, this study shows the originality of Berger's interpretation of Husserlian phenomenology, as well as the reservations he developed with regard to certain themes: the absolute ego, the tension between intention and intuition, not to mention the reappropriation of the phenomenological reduction by means of a detachment. In this sense, it appears, on the one hand, that Berger is a typical representative of the first French generation of « disciples » of Husserl and, on the other hand, that the reception he offered is itself revealing as to the problematics of certain contemporary phenomenologists.<br>

Abstract: Jusqu'à Totalité et Infini compris, la temporalité aura été essentiellement pensée par Lévinas, au seuil de l'événement qu'est l'Autre, comme ouverture d'un avenir pur, jusqu'à la rémission d'un présent, qui nous relèverait alors de notre passé. À partir de sa méditation toujours plus insistante de la « Trace de l'Autre », Lévinas est toutefois amené à repenser cette ouverture elle-même depuis un passé toujours déjà passé et dont nous aurions à jamais à répondre, échapperait-il à toute expérience dans l'entre-temps de son passage. Du Visage à la Trace — jusqu'au visage comme trace —, l'avenir ne s'ouvrirait à nous que dans la déchirure de notre réponse à ce passé immémorial d'où l'Autre nous appellerait sans cesse, déjà parti avant d'être venu. Arrachés à nous-mêmes, nous voici, dans la « honte de survivre », ordonnés à l'avenir par l'accusation d'un passé qui toujours se dérobe, sans qu'il nous soit jamais possible de nous y dérober. À partir de sa pensée de la trace de l'Autre et de sa mortalité, Lévinas inscrit sa propre méditation du temps et de l'histoire dans la trace de l'immémorial — impossible mémoire, à la mémoire de l'impossible, dont la signifiance éthique ne saurait se réduire à un improbable « devoir de mémoire ». « Une voix vient de l'autre rive. Une voix interrompt le dire du déjà dit », qui nous voue, à présent, à ce qui ne cesse de venir, selon une vocation, une dévotion, qui est le temps lui-même. Up to and including Totality and Infinity, temporality has been thought by Levinas, on the threshold of this incident which is the Other, as the opening of a pure future, up to the remission of the present, which would then recover us from our past. Nevertheless, from his more and more insistent meditation upon the « Trace of the Other », Levinas has been led to re-examine that opening itself from a past for ever past and for which we would be answerable, were it to escape our experience in the interval of its crossing. From the Face to the Trace — up to~<br>

Abstract: Experiences that do not fit squarely into known categories pose a challenge to notions of organizational learning that rely primarily on scientific or experiential approaches. Making sense of, responding to, and learning from such unusual experiences requires reflection and novel action by organizational actors. We argue that narrative development processes make this organizational learning possible. By developing narratives, organizational actors create situated understandings of unusual experiences, negotiate consensual meanings, and engage in coordinated actions. Through the accumulation of narratives about unusual experiences, an organization builds a memory with generative qualities. Specifically, through narratives, actors evoke memories of prior unusual experiences and how they were dealt with, and this generates new options for dealing with emerging unusual experiences. We outline a framework detailing how narrative development processes enable organizational learning from unusual experiences and conclude by summarizing how this approach differs from and yet builds upon scientific and experiential approaches to learning.<br>

Abstract: Josef Macek has provided a capsule summary of historical

sign and the concept, or merely between the word and the psychological endowment
of man; he inquires about the relation existing between the sense of a word and the
world itself- that is, the external facts and states of affairs. The word does not reflect
things and the universe only in a passive manner but constitutes an active element in
the reflection upon these things, as in the process of knowledge itself" ("Pour une
semantique historique," in Melanges en honneur de F. Braudel [Toulouse, 1973],

Abstract: Across cultures, narrative emerges early in communicative development and is a fundamental means of making sense of experience. Narrative and self are inseparable in that narrative is simultaneously born out of experience and gives shape to experience. Narrative activity provides tellers with an opportunity to impose order on otherwise disconnected events, and to create continuity between past, present, and imagined worlds. Narrative also interfaces self and society, constituting a crucial resource for socializing emotions, attitudes, and identities, developing interpersonal relationships, and constituting membership in a community. Through various genres and modes; through discourse, grammar, lexicon, and prosody; and through the dynamics of collaborative authorship, narratives bring multiple, partial selves to life.<br>

Abstract: The Subject of this essay, as well as the intention behind it, is to examine the problems connected with the relationship between sociology and the theme of the person. The paper's position is that this theme has a substantial (and not only formal) centrality within a sociological analysis, which is intended to be critical, in the sense used by Theodor Adorno of this term, and is, therefore, naturally, problematic. This discourse implies that the analysis cannot be limited only to codes and factual dynamics (numbering, classify, aggregating-disaggregating) which reduce the sociological discourse to mere sociography.<br>

From the earliest reviews, it was received as a musical masterpiece that drew on many styles while still managing to be `punk' in some sense. This article argues that London Calling normalized punk, allowing it to be more than an event: punk could henceforth be assimilated into traditional musical discourse and aesthetics. As a careful balancing act between punk street-cred and mainstream musical values, London Calling allowed a double reading. Punk fans could find in it what they sought: anti-establishment anger and at times a messy, disdainful approach to conventional musicianship. At the same time critics and listeners who had come since the late sixties to assimilate rock into a Romantic (or post-Romantic) system of `art' values could find in it what they sought: stylistic growth, organic coherence, originality, and even a `universal' narrative of struggle, triumph, and redemption played out across the album. It is possible to isolate not only a story, but musical connections between the songs (keys, recurrent motifs, and topoi) all laid out in a logical manner. However, unlike concept albums in the seventies' progressive rock style against which punk reacted, London Calling often calls attention away from its musical coherence, and even its textual coherence, rather than towards it—such as by the last-minute addition of a bonus track that disrupts the narrative and key schemes established earlier. The ease with which the album can be praised in established musical language should not completely obscure its potential (and the general potential of punk) to undercut and confront conventional musical discourse.<br>

Abstract: This article explores the crisis initiated by colonial modernity in Naguib Mahfouz's 1947 novel Midaq Alley. I begin by discussing the significance of anger within the narrative, arguing that this dominant structure of feeling could be read as a collective response to wider social and historical forces. In other words, rather than understanding emotion as the "subjective property" of the individual, I regard it here as a relational practice embedded within and determined by quite specific sociocultural circumstances. I then proceed to discuss the role of rumour in the novel and the significance of its pronounced melodramatic qualities. In the first case, I shall argue, the circulation of rumour provides a way of containing or quarantining the negative feelings produced by modernity, while also reinforcing the boundaries of a community facing the very real possibility of its own demise. In the second case, I would like to suggest that the narrative's tendency to privilege the melodramatic mode creates a sense of social order and moral intelligibility by channelling these feelings into a stable and predictable generic structure. This latter project is ultimately frustrated, however, when the forces of evil emerge to destroy the novel's principle representative of virtue.<br>

Author(s): Youniss James<br>
Abstract: This paper offers a discussion of contemporary theories of moral development. At present, these theories are at odds regarding the origins of morality. One camp has proposed a cognitive basis, while the other claims that morality consists in affectivity. Both these positions are discussed, and a third alternative is proposed for their resolution, based upon the model of the subject within communicative relations, whose life involves constructing reality through social procedures with others. This model is described and contrasted with the model of the self-reflecting individual which seems to underlie most current theories. In addition, a number of studies are reviewed in order to show more clearly how this third alternative provides insight into the social basis of moral judgment. Throughout the paper, two themes remain central: (a) that rationality can be considered to result from consensual validation which is obtained through communication; and (b) that sense of community, the grounds for moral action, is not incompatible with establishing or maintaining one's own individual identity.<br>

Abstract: This article explores the tensions between acknowledgment and recognition in performances by progressive South Asian American activists at the Minnesota Festival of Nations in the year 2000. Focusing on specific South Asian American folk performances that take place within the context of an "India" cultural booth, I argue performers are enjoined to enact cultural practices in ways that foreground a reified sense of "Indianness" that is at odds with the multicultural vision of their progressive grassroots school.<br>

Abstract: En Grèce classique, les premières formes d'historiographies dépendent d'une volonté mémorielle: garder en mémoire et publier les actions des hommes, dans le passé récent. Mais ces formes visent aussi à donner un sens à ces actions: ordre de la justice humaine et territoriale chez Hérodote; anthropologie de la domination chez Thucydide. Dans ce « façonnement » discursif de l'histoire, la rhétorique de la vue joue un rôle essentiel. Occasion de s'interroger sur les modes d'une « fiction » qui, au sens étymologique du terme, « fabrique » et par conséquent « fictionnalise » le factuel; occasion d'envisager le rôle du vraisemblable dans des constructions narratives partagées entre cohérence interne et référence externe. De là l'oxymore de « fiction référentielle ». In Classical Greece, the first forms of historiography sprung from a preoccupation with memory: to memorialize and publicize the actions of men in the recent past. They also aimed to make sense of those actions: order of human and territorial justice for Herodotus, anthropology of domination for Thucydides. In this discursive "shaping" of History, rhetoric played an essential role. Opportunity to muse about modalities of "fiction", which, etymologically, "makes" hence "fictionalize" facts; opportunity also to think about the importance of verisimilitude in the narrative constructions torn between internal coherence and external references. Hence the oxymoron of "referential fiction".<br>

Abstract: This essay explores the suggestion that many American narratives are supplementary, correcting narratives — alternatives to the main story on offer. The guiding thought is that of Henry James's "possible other case," and the chief example is Cormac McCarthy's "No Country for Old Men," in which one story after another fails to cope with the ongoing mystery it faces. The novel may imply, then, that narrative itself, rather than any individual report or fiction, is in crisis or has come to the end of its road. A coda to the essay proposes the option of nonnarrative understandings of the world in those extreme situations where storytelling is no longer the sense-making activity we so often take it to be.<br>

Publisher: Humboldt State University<br>
Issue: i23261550<br>

Author(s): Jacobs Anton K.<br>
Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining~<br>

Abstract: The present paper is an analysis of the functioning of memory, selective memory and oblivion (or to put it differently—the game of remembering, partial remembering and forgetting) in Poland during the period of democratic transformation which, after long years of dictatorship and the hibernation of public discourse, ensures freedom of speech and encourages expression of different beliefs as well as articulation of divergent interests. It defines two distinct layers of memory and oblivion and, consequently, two main types of hidden or repressed elements which may be dubbed "skeletons in the nation's history closet." One is linked with the pre-communist past (before 1945), while the other is connected with the communist past (1945-1989). The latter is linked to political differences—within the same ethnic group—which presently constitute a very hot issue but are less likely to be inherited over more than two generations. The former comprises mostly nationwide skeletons, related mainly to contacts between the Polish and other ethnic groups and involving the sense of collective identity, collective pride, collective guilt, and collectively suffered injustice. On the one hand, these skeletons are currently still more willingly kept in the closet because they can be detrimental to the perception and self-perception of the national group as a whole, but on the other hand the memory of these ethnic and religious conflicts is more likely to be inherited and internalized by future generations for much longer. The question of how to facilitate the process of removing the nationwide skeletons from the national memory closet seems, therefore, all the more important.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: The aim of this essay is to define the nature of the metaphor in Berdiczewski's novel Miriam (1921). For this purpopse I examine the short story included in Miriam about the scholar who was studying a book entitled The Gate of Heaven. Comparing this story with other literary texts which present a hero who stands in a mystical or philosophical sense before the gate of Heaven illuminates the historic-generative essence of the above metaphor. Using the theoretical and methodological system developed by three scholars (P. Ricuer, D. Schon and B. Indurkyia) to follow the metaphorical process, I attempt to show that Berdiczewski's metaphors are not only figures of speech; they form our essential cultural and historical cognition (tolada in Hebrew). I therefore suggest applying to Berdiczewski's metaphor the form 'historic-generative metaphor.'<br>

Abstract: No one owns the concept 'culture' Anthropology's long-standing proprietary claim on the concept rests on three sorts of contentions — none of which are convincing Anthropology's overwhelmingly interpretive approaches to cultural materials have led to a preoccupation with the details of cultural materials at the expense of formulating explanatory theories This has, among other things, rendered fieldwork experience sufficient for professional credentials However, if the details are all that matter, then comparative and cross-cultural research, as well as most of the social sciences, make no sense Contrary to this view, it is proposed here that theories reveal which details matter Cognitive accounts of the sort we advanced in Rethinking Religion (1990) offer a firm theoretical basis for cross-cultural study of religious materials Other types of research concerning non-human primates, early childhood development, and various social and cognitive impairments also offer insight into culture (without relying on fieldwork studies)<br>

Abstract: Este artigo consiste numa análise da noção zubiriana de mentalidade. Começa por descrever a razão como busca para descobrir a estrutura da realidade. Esta busca requer um método que inclua um sistema de referência, que é o seu ponto de partida no sentido de sugerir hipóteses e teorias que expliquem a realidade. O sistema de referência deriva da transformação do campo de realidade. Esta transformação, que não segue uma via única, depende da "mentalidade" dos que procuram a realidade profunda. Em Zubiri, o conceito de "mentalidade" é polissémico. Existe uma "mentalidade estrutural e intrínseca", uma "mentalidade situacional extrínseca" e um "horizonte mental". Neste artigo estudam-se as três mentalidades e a sua relevância na constituição do sistema de referência e na elaboração de hipóteses e teorias. Finalmente, o artigo analisa a relevância destas mentalidades para compreender os contributos da investigação interdisciplinar e os seus desafios. The following paper is an analysis of Zubiri's notion of mentality. It starts by describing reason as a quest to uncover the structure of reality. This quest requires a method that includes a system of reference, which is its point of departure in the sense of suggesting hypotheses and theories that explain reality. The system of reference results from a transformation of the field of reality. This transformation, which does not follow a unique path, depends on the "mentality" of those who seek to deepen reality. In Zubiri the concept "mentality" is polysemic. There is a "structural and intrinsic mentality", an "extrinsic situational mentality" and a "mental horizon". The three of them and their relevance in the constitution of the system of reference and the elaboration of hypotheses and theories are studied. Finally the paper analyzes the relevance of these mentalities to understand the contributions of interdisciplinary research and its challenges.<br>

Abstract: This article concerns itself with establishing and defining the concept of prophetic politics as a narrative-based political leadership. It focuses on the use of religious, mythical and otherwise culturally dominating narratives which are often taken for granted or as 'common sense.' By a skilful politician, these stories can be given new forms and used as tools of leadership. This article explores the differences between traditional prophesies in the religious context and political prophesies and shows how with the use of prophetic narratives the politician is able to keep politics from stagnation since every moment and every decision can be endowed with special importance in actualizing the vision that remains the fascinating but elusive goal of politics - whatever it is narrated to be. This might re-invigorate the citizens to participate more in politics. The focus of the article is on American politics since the American civil religion and the narrative tradition of the jeremiad provide ample tools for political prophets, but the concept is not restricted solely to America. I argue that well told narratives have great influence on how people think and that can be manipulated politically. This type of leadership opens new vistas for political candidates, but it also opens new vistas for researchers to use in their study of politics.<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo analiza las revistas argentinas El Peronista Lucha por la Liberación y La Causa Peronista, editadas por la organización Montoneros desde abril a septiembre de 1974, y Movimiento, ligada a la Juventud Peronista Lealtad durante el mismo periodo. Asumiendo que las tradiciones no constituyen legados cerrados sino herencias en constante invención, se explora la significación que dichas publicaciones articularon sobre el peronismo. ¿Qué sentido se otorgaba al vínculo con Juan Domingo Perón en cada revista? ¿Cómo se pensaba la relación con el resto de los actores del Movimiento Peronista? ¿Qué papel se atribuía a la violencia? Respondiendo dichos interrogantes, se examina el modo en que cada espacio configuró su identidad política. The article analyzes the Argentinean magazines El Peronista Lucha por la Liberación and La Causa Peronista, published by Montoneros organization from April to September 1974, and Movimiento para la Reconstrucción y la Liberación Nacional, tied to the Juventud Peronista Lealtad during this period. Assuming that the traditions do not constitute closed legacies but inheritances in continuous re-invention, the article explores the meaning that those publications presented on the Peronism. What sense was granted to the link by Juan Domingo Perón in every magazine? How was thought the relationship with the other actors of the Movimiento Peronista? What position was assumed around the political violence? Answering the above mentioned questions, the article examines the way in which each organization formed its political identity.<br>

Abstract: Abordaremos a autobiografia de Malcolm X (1925-1965) sob o prisma de uma hermenêutica do testemunho: ao aplicar a hermenêutica do testemunho na referida autobiografia, identificaremos as duas profundas transformações psicológicas e espirituais sofridas por Malcolm X, transformações indissociáveis de uma mudança na sua relação com a transcendência, o Islamismo e a comunidade afro-americana do seu tempo. Trata-se, em última análise, de percorrer a evolução de uma consciência humana que se cumpre e se manifesta na religiosidade (não-violência) e no testemunho. Neste estudo, o rito aparecerá como "passagem" no contexto da (re-)integração e (re)educação segundo o modelo da adoração (Mestre/discípulo), mediada pelo desejo mimético, cuja função é purgativa e fundacional porque reorientadora da existência do discípulo. O rito será visto ainda como "sinal da aceitação do testemunho". No contexto de testemunho, extrairemos ainda uma noção de coragem, integrante de noções contemporâneas. We will approach the autobiography of Malcolm X (1925-1965) from the point of view of a hermeneutics of testimony: on applying the hermeneutics of testimony in the said autobiography, we will identify the two deep psychological and spiritual transformations suffered by Malcolm X, transformations that can't be separated from a change in his relationship with the transcendence; the Islamism and the African American community of his time, being, ultimately, the go through of the evolution of human consciousness that meets and manifests itself in religion (non-violence) and witness. In this study, the rite will appear as "passage" in the context of (re-) integration and (re-)education according to the model of worship (master/disciple), taking part in the mimetic desire, whose function is purgative and functional because reorienting the existence of the disciple, the rite is still seen as "a sign of acceptance of the witness." Even in the context of testimony, we will demonstrate a sense of courag~<br>

Abstract: Although Hannah Arendt distinguishes three human activities from each other in Human Condition — labor, work and action — they are supposed not to be three different types of human activities but to be three different aspects of human activity. Assuming this to be the case, this paper demonstrates that social theory has not enough taken action in the sense of Arendt into account, even modern scholars such as Bourdieu, but it has continued to remain almost always on the level of work because of its concept of time. The second question is what consequence social theory may draw, if this aspect of human activity is recognized as essential and its concept of time changed. One answer proposed by the author is the sociology of forgiveness even though it has not been treated as a subject for modern sociology.<br>

Article Title: Inside and Outside the EU's "Area of Freedom, Security and Justice": Reflexive Identity and the Unity of Legal Space<br>
Publisher: Franz Steiner Verlag<br>
Issue: i23676298<br>
Date: 1 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Lindahl Hans<br>
Abstract: "It is essential," Hans Kelsen asserts provocatively, "that one state also have one territory, that the territory of a state form a unity." What, then, determines the territorial unity a legal community necessarily claims for itself? And why is this claim to territorial unity irreducibly problematic? These questions are particularly pressing, both theoretically and practically, with respect to the European Union's "Area of Freedom, Security and Justice," set to be consolidated in the novel Constitution for Europe. Rejecting any attempt to make sense of legal space in terms of geography, this Paper argues that the spatial unity of the European Union emerges in the reflexive process by which this legal community stakes out a territory as its own. Probing the notion of an "own" legal space, this Paper points to, and offers examples of, a strong form of exteriority that is inside what the EU calls its own territory: "another Europe" is — literally — elsewhere. This strong form of exteriority arises in the very same representational process by which the EU constitutes itself as a unitary Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. In effect, an analysis of key legal texts reveals that Europe is the place the Union claims to be originally its own, yet also the place to which it has no direct access. Finally, these considerations are brought to bear on Article 64 (1) of the EC Treaty, which holds Member States responsible for maintaining law and order and safeguarding internal security.<br>

Abstract: Although the dual perspective should be used to focus on diversity, it should be applied within the context of an anthropological—ecological framework to prevent stereotyping, to illuminate the universal goals of societal organization underlying human behavior, and to explore the early socialization of children. This view is illustrated with preliminary findings from an ongoing longitudinal study of lower socioeconomic inner-city African American children that examines the importance of a sense of time, its evolution in early socialization, and the relationship of parent-child interactions to the development of a sense of time.<br>

Abstract: We can distinguish two different kinds in the educational process, the one called «learning education» and the one leading to a possible «autonomous education» in which every-body's freedom is above everything else. The former is education for technoscientists. The later, the «autonomous education» is supported by the thesis that knowing oneself as «moriturus», forces one to provide a sense or meaning, technologies and educational sciencies not being enough. Death forces us to decide the possible, only opposed by the impossible.<br>

Abstract: O filme Diamante de Sangue [Blood Diamond] de Edward Zwick oferece a possibilidade de uma reflexão à volta de três aspetos da noção de testemunho no âmbito da Filosofia da Religião: 1) a ideia de que o testemunho (absoluto), enquanto matriz das culturas humanas, sustenta a atividade jornalística e a sociedade da informação possibilitando não apenas a sua desconstrução como também a (re-)atualização de uma dimensão testemunhal do jornalismo; 2) as condições de possibilidade da conversão da consciência, isto é, da rutura com o estado de má-fé (auto-engano) necessária à consciência testemunhal e religiosa; 3) a indissociabilidade da experiência testemunhal e da doação, correlativas da experiência religiosa entendida como "fundação mútua" do divino e da testemunha (constituinte), experiência religiosa da qual surge o testemunho. Acrescentaremos ainda a ideia de que a experiência testemunhal ganha sentido à luz da metafísica do tempo do projeto. The film Blood Diamond from Edward Zwick offers the possibility of a reflection concerning three aspects of the concept of testimony within the Philosophy of Religion: 1) the idea that the testimony (absolute), while source of human cultures, supports the journalistic activity and gives information to the society; not only in its deconstruction but also in (re-)updating the testimonial dimension of journalism, 2) the conditions of possibility of the consciousness conversion, meaning, the rupture with the state of bad faith (self-deception) will required to the testimonial and religious consciousness, 3) the inseparability of the testimonial experience and donation, correlates in the religious experience, understood as “mutual foundation” of the divine and the witness (constituent), religious experience from which comes the testimony. We add further the idea that the testimonial experience makes sense in light of the metaphysics of time of project.<br>

Abstract: Objective: Traumatic memories are characterized by not being accessible to intentional recall nor being integrated into the matrix of autobiographical memory. Based on this description, the authors discuss the process of narration as a central means of regaining a sense of self-coherence after traumatic experiences. Formally correct narratives are characterized by three functions: orientation, reference and evaluation. Through so-called "memory talk" with socio-culturally competent partners, children learn how to reconstruct memories and to represent experience by narration. It is therefore suggested that narratives are the basic ingredient of autobiographical memory. The process of re-establishing a sense of coherence after trauma relies on the capacity for coherent narration. The latter is often not possible with traumatic experiences. Method and Result: We conducted a literature search in multiple databases for linguistic analyses of trauma narratives empirically correlating narrative style and posttraumatic psychopathology. Discussion: It is recommended that research in psychopathology and psychotherapy should take issues of language into account more systematically. Fragestellung: Ein zentrales Merkmal traumatischer Erfahrungen besteht darin, dass sie nicht als episodisch strukturierte, bewusstseinsfähige und erzählbare Erinnerungen in das autobiographische Gedächtnis integriert sind. Hiervon ausgehend wird in der vorliegenden Arbeit diskutiert, inwiefern der Prozess der Narrativierung als eine integrative Funktion der Gedächtnisrepräsentation aufgefasst werden kann. Dabei wird das narrative Format als zentraler „Baustein“ des autobiographischen Gedächtnisses postuliert. Kohärente Narrative sind durch drei Funktionen gekennzeichnet: Orientierung, Referenz und Evaluation. Diese werden in der Sprachentwicklung durch „memory talk“ mit soziokulturell kompetenten Partnern erworben. Mit der Überführung autobiographischer Erfahrungen in ein kohärentes Narrativ kann Se~<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917901<br>
Date: 6 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): LeBlanc John Randolph<br>
Abstract: Albert Camus's interrogation of the ethical and spiritual vacuity of the twentieth century convinced him that authentic political existence requires a vision that embraces while transcending the human condition. He found his ethical model in art. The work of the artist can be analogous to that of the just political actor. The principal components of ethical political being are all present in Camus's aesthetics: a vision of life in human community (lucidity), a grounded sense of justice subject to the limitations of human existence (beauty), a need to redress the defects of political reality (the urge to create), and an understanding that any structural solution is of necessity temporary (the need to rearticulate the initial vision). Camus's vision requires him to reject our positive political categories in the name of creative, grounded human being.<br>

Author(s): Loughlin Gerard<br>
Abstract: This essay argues for an understanding of the literal sense of Scripture after its diremption in the modern period between the written and the historical. It introduces John Spong as exemplary of a liberal tendency to disparage the literal, and Hans Frei as showing how the sensus literalis was, and may be again, found in the 'world' of the scriptural narrative, and how it came to be dirempted. Finally I argue that the literal sense of Scripture is locatable in the mutual constitution of Church and Scripture, of text and reading-community. The literal and historical are rebound insofar as the Church performs the letter of the text.<br>

Author(s): Mei Todd S.<br>
Abstract: Is liability insurance simply a necessary evil in today's climate of litigation? Or does it have greater implications beyond its social and economic remit? In this article, I argue that when the insurance policy is viewed hermeneutically as a text, its negligence-based definition of action supplants the understanding of responsibility, therefore having theological and philosophical implications. Insurance, in this sense, comes 'in between' humanity and its relation to others and fundamental ontological questions concerning the meaning of uncertainty and suffering.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917944<br>
Date: 3 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Ward Graham<br>
Abstract: Having defined how 'secular' is to be understood in this context, this essay explores two sets of observations. The first concerns the relationship between religion and literature as cultural products of a specific cultural imaginary. Both are fundamentally associated with narrative, which, as even contemporary neuroscience demonstrates, continually attempts to make sense of the world. Both are narratives in which there is a reflection upon, and a performance of, creativity. Since the cultural imaginary has been shaped historically by the religious, then all reflections upon creating are coloured by the sacred. The second set of observations issues from the first and concerns the relationship between authorial standpoint and literary creation. The essay examines authorial intention, the nature of language and the operation of the imagination as each relates to the cultural imaginary and the act of 'making believe'. The two sets of observations and their examination demonstrate the ways in which literature continually resists secularity.<br>

Abstract: Bynum, p. 133: "Moreover, in medieval physiological theories — however confused they may
be on the subject — the female in some sense provides the matter of the foetus, the male the life or
spirit. Medieval theologians sometimes stressed that, as Eve came from the matter of Adam, so
Christ came from the matter of Mary." Si senta Lochrie, pp. 117-118: "The centrality of the first
two kinds of imitatio Christi, particularly to female spirituality, is further complicated by the
medieval medical and theological alignment of the female with flesh, and the male with the spirit.
Both Galenic and Aristotelian theories of conception consider the woman's contribution to the
fetus to be a material one, that is, the woman provides the matter of flesh to the developing human
being. This medieval conception theory carries important theological implications for the Virgin
Mary's role in the incarnation of Christ and ultimately for imitatio Christi. The Virgin's humanity is
celebrated for providing Christ with sinless flesh — the materia redeemed from the Fall — In
Hildegard of Bingen's idea of her as tunica humanitatis, the 'clothing of humanity' that Christ puts
on."<br>

Abstract: The „petite éthique“ which Ricœur develops in Soi-même comme un autre is distinctive in its way of paying attention to the individual, the other and the society all at the same time. For this very reason the problem of the distribution of social goods is fundamental. Ricœur tries to solve this problem through a synthesis of teleological and deontological considerations, and here the approach of Rawls occupies a central place. On the one hand, the attempt to solve this problem in the framework of a teleological approach draws on principles of justice which Rawls establishes through formal procedure; on the other hand, Rawls‘ position depends on a number of teleological presuppositions which are not compatible with his deontological approach. Ricœur does not only attempt to refute Rawls, but to interpret his principles of justice as the result of a rationalisation of a sense of justice which is simply presupposed.<br>

Publisher: FELIX MEINER VERLAG<br>
Issue: i24358470<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Serra Alice Mara<br>
Abstract: The concept Deckerinnerung (en. screen-memory), which appeared in Freud's work in 1899, points towards the important epistemological question about the possibility of adequation or coincidence (Deckung) between past experience and the current act that is being presentified. This can take the form of remembering as such or be conceived as fantasy. In order to clarify the differences between fantasy and memory, or rather their interconnection in the Deckerinnerung, they need to be looked at phenomenologically, and in doing so various aspects should be analysed, such as: the character of positional and neutralised acts of presentification; the interference of conscious attention and the phenomenon of inhibition in the act of presentification; the state of memories in the unconscious and the possibilities of their association between themselves or modification by other current acts. While Freud introduces the subject without further analysing it, Husserl's theories offer a valuable contribution here. In this context, there is first a need to outline the way in which Husserl's investigations into memory come close to Freud's discourse, in the sense that they lead to a "Phenomenology of the Unconscious" (Hua XI; Mat. VIII).<br>

Abstract: The present study examines Adorno's critique of Husserl and Heidegger by asking whether one can find a systematic equivalent for Adorno's notion of a ‚spiritual experience‘ in the works of the two phenomenological thinkers. This question is answered affirmatively. The first part summarizes Adorno's critique of Husserl and Heidegger; the second analyzes the notion of ‚spiritual experience‘ in Adorno's negative dialectics; the third part explains in which sense one can speak of a ‚spiritual experience‘ in Husserl's and Heidegger's phenomenology; the final part describes the main differences of a ‚spiritual experience‘ in negative dialectics and in phenomenology, i. e. on the one hand the originally epistemological approach of phenomenology and the originally practical approach of negative dialectics and on the other hand the attitude with regards towards metaphysics.<br>

Abstract: The present article explores some currently disputed issues regarding the relationship between temporality, memory, and the self. To exemplify and to concretely examine the problems under consideration, a phenomenological analysis of dementia illnesses is proposed. The first objective of this article is to develop an appropriate concept of the self, apt to describe the experience of dementia patients. To this aim, the different positions in the debate regarding the preservation of the self in dementia patients are first critically assessed. Subsequently, it is shown how the phenomenological distinction between the basic sense of self, often indicated as the minimal self, and the higher forms of narrative self-consciousness and identity can fruitfully contribute in this debate. The second objective of the article is a more concrete qualification of the minimal self. Particularly, the determination of the minimal self as un-extended in time is challenged. On the basis of the phenomenology of time and implicit body memory, and still exemplarily referring to the analysis of dementia illnesses, it will be argued that a concrete description of basic self-experience necessarily needs to take its spatio-temporal unfolding into account.<br>

Abstract: Os atentados de 11 de setembro originaram diversas manifestações artísticas buscando não apenas explicações para a tragédia, mas também tentando repensar os acontecimentos. Neste sentido, este trabalho apresenta uma investigação a respeito da maneira como um romance se apropriou desse episódio para reavaliá-lo. Com os ataques, os Estados Unidos experimentaram uma forte sensação de vulnerabilidade, desencadeando reações do governo americano, que formulou com bastante rapidez uma nova doutrina de segurança nacional, baseada no combate ao terrorismo. Este artigo analisa as estratégias narrativas utilizadas pelo autor americano Don DeLillo (2007a) no romance Falling Man, para reexaminar a tragédia. Textos teóricos e críticos sobre a relação entre Literatura e História, ficção Pós-Moderna e terrorismo fundamentam as discussões aqui apresentadas. Este estudo objetiva ampliar os questionamentos acerca dos fatos que levaram à catástrofe e suas consequências, examinando personagens e grupos ligados ao 11 de setembro, revelando múltiplas verdades, condicionadas social, ideológica e historicamente. September 11 has originated a wide range of artistic manifestations which have not only searched for plausible explanations for the tragedy, but also tried to review the events. In this sense, this paper aims at showing how a novel reevaluates this episode. The attacks made the United States experience a strong sense of vulnerability, triggering reactions from the American government, whose quick action was translated into a new national security strategy, associated with the war on terror. This paper analyzes the narrative strategies employed by the American author Don DeLillo in his novel Falling Man (2007) in order to reevaluate that tragedy. The debate of the topics is based on texts concerning the relationship between literature and history, postmodern fiction and issues on terrorism. This study contributes to enrich the discussion related to the events that led to the catastro~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>

Date: 10 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): CHRISTMAN JOHN<br>
Abstract: In this article I critically discuss a claim made by several writers in philosophy and the social sciences that for an individual to count as a person, a single personality, or the subject of a life, the experiences of the subject in question must take a narrative form. I argue that narrativity is a misleading and, in some ways of understanding it, implausible condition of what it is that adds unity to personhood and personality. I pursue this critique by considering canonical accounts of narrativity in philosophy and literary studies. I consider those connections between events that must hold for the sequence to be considered a narrative: causal, teleological, and thematic connections. I argue that for each of these, the condition that experiential sequences (for a given subject) must have this structure is empty: any life sequence that is reflected upon in an interpretive spirit can meet it. What the condition of narrativity amounts to, then, is the more basic requirement that the person must be able to look upon the factors and events of her life with a certain interpretive reflection, whether or not those factors and events have any particular narrative unity in a traditional sense.<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to explore the relationship between the thought of Richard Rorty and that of his former teacher, Charles Hartshorne. There are important similarities between the two, but ultimately the differences are more readily apparent, especially in terms of the battle between poetry (in the wide sense of the term conceived by Rorty) and (Hartshornian) metaphysics. Hartshorne is defended against Rorty.<br>

Abstract: The subject of the presented research is the analysis of relations between Post-Critical Belief and Sense of Coherence in women and men in early, middle, and late adulthood. Six hundred and thirty-six individuals participated in the research, 332 women and 304 men, at the age of 18–79 years. We applied the Post-Critical Belief scale by Hutsebaut (J Empir Theol 9:48–66, 1996) and the Sense of Coherence scale (SOC-29) by Antonovsky (Soc Sci Med 36:725–733, 1993). The results suggest that the salutogenic function of religiosity is related to age and gender—in women, it is most strongly marked in late, and in men, in middle adulthood<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>

Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Watson Stephen H.<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the ambiguity that attends Paul Klee's characterization of the daemonic element in his work. It does so by analyzing the history of this concept in classical German thought from Wincklemann to Goethe. I note transformations of the concept in writings contemporaneous to Klee in literary theory and theology. These include Lukács, for whom the modern novel articulates the daemonic as an ironic world devoid of transcendental immanence, homeland, or essence; and Otto, for whom the world remained in some sense still not devoid of the numinous. I further consider these issues in brief discussion of Klee's account of the polyphonic construction of the artwork. Finally, attention is given to proximate philosophical treatments of the topic in writers influenced by Klee's work.<br>

Abstract: Truth is attributed by hermeneutical phenomenology not only to science but also to art and literature. According to Ricoeur, its veritable bearer is the expression of experience that can take artistic and literary forms as well as scientific ones. However, truth in this sense cannot be defined as a correspondence with a ready-made reality, nor can it be reduced to any internal coherence in our knowledge of the world. What is, then, its precise meaning in this context? The two terms mentioned in the title—'redescription' and 'refiguration' of reality—indicate the two answers Ricoeur gives to this question. The similarities and the differences between these two answers are submitted to an inquiry in the following paper, which, relying upon Ricoeur, adumbrates the outlines of a phenomenological and hermeneutical approach to truth.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: My aim in this memorial paper is to recall two essential Ricoeurean themes that underlie his entire philosophical orientation and that respond well to specific challenges today from postmodern deconstruction. At question is whether Ricoeur's account of sign in language and the living present in time can adequately respond to and meet the recent challenge from postmodern deconstruction, which radically challenges the very root of his phenomenological and hermeneutic orientation: the priority of the semantic in language and the priority of the living present. Although Ricoeur and Derrida will be seen to address the same problems of decentering consciousness, their accounts, although agreeing on importnat issues, quickly become mutually exclusive and deconstruction becomes a challenge to Ricoeurean hermeneutics. I will turn first to the postmodern deconstruction of Jacques Derrida before turning to Ricoeur's response with a more viable view of language, sense, and lived time.<br>

Abstract: In Reformational philosophy the term 'structure' can be used in two different senses: It could
refer to the factual or subject-side of reality and is then used in the sense of the structure of
reality. It could also refer to the law-side of reality, i.e. the structural laws governing and
conditioning the regularities perceived in phenomena. Then it is understood in the sense of the
structure for reality. When the term 'structure mapping' is used in this article it refers primarily
to the latter sense of the term, although it is conceded that analysis of the structures for reality
are inextricably bound to the analysis of the structures of reality.<br>

Etymologically those two English terms are affinitive, as too are the German equivalents
Wohnung and Gewohnheit and, for instance, also the German terms Sitz (seat) and Sitte
(custom, morals). Thus habits seek a habitation.<br>

Abstract: Pannenberg, as we have noted, deals with the contradictions involved by making the
tension between egocentricity and exocentricity the ontic nature of humanness. Simul-
taneously exocentricity both validates and invalidates egocentricity. "But even if human
beings are in this sense sinners by nature, this does not mean that their nature as human
beings is sinful" (p. 107). The cardinal question is whether such a coincidentia oppositorum is
able to do full justice to creaturely goodness, human freedom and responsibility. See Brian
Walsh, "A Critical Review of Pannenberg's Anthropology in Theological Perspective" in Christian
Scholar's Review XV (1986), 247-259.<br>

patients are in permanent coma, and are unconscious, although they can as a rule breathe and
swallow without mechanical help. In other words, these coma patients have an intact 'reptilian
brain', but do not function in the perceptive sense.<br>

Abstract: The main aim of this article is to offer a critical reflection on the need of rethinking the teachers' professional skills and their academic pathway, given the changes and current transformations (crisis, in its etymological sense). In fact, a series of changes, transformations, are identified and affect directly the educator's comprehension. Amongst others: the transformation of work bound up with the processes of the economic globalization, and the transformation of the learning environments imbued by the TICs; the population growth, a demographic transformation with geopolitics relevance, and finally, as a result from the previous ones, the raise in the migratory flows. Under this context, this paper tries to reconceptualize teachers' training and their depiction as professionals from the view of Gustav Mahler in his statement Tradition is the spreading of fire and not the veneration of ashes. Thereupon, some categories that help in the teaching update, are proposed and explained; such as authority (as reputation or moral authority, role model and, hence, less so as bare exercise of power), the personalization of education, the importance of home community (society), and, lastly, the alternation within school-society and work-study. El objetivo de este trabajo es ofrecer una reflexión acerca de la necesidad de re-pensar la profesionalidad de los docentes y de su itinerario formativo, a la luz los cambios y transformaciones actuales (crisis, en sentido etimológico). En efecto, se identifican una serie de cambios, de transformaciones, que afectan directamente a la comprensión del docente, del enseñante. Entre otros: la transformación del trabajo vinculada a los procesos de la globalización económica y la transformación de los entornos de aprendizaje imbuidos en las TICs; el aumento de la población, la transformación demográfica con trascendencia geopolítica; y por último, y como confluencia de las dos anteriores, el aumento de los flujos migratorios.

Abstract: Auch wenn vielerorts von der Vernachlässigung der Kirchengeschichte im Religionsunterricht gesprochen und ein mangelndes Geschichtsbewusstsein beklagt wird, sind Schülerinnen und Schüler durchaus für Geschichte und auch Kirchengeschichte ansprechbar. Die Herausforderung besteht heute jedoch darin, sie dazu zu befähigen, mit dem Wissen über Geschichte umzugehen, ihr Leben mit Geschichte sinnbringend und verantwortungsvoll zu gestalten. Gerade hierfür stellt die jüdisch-christliche Tradition wertvolle Ressourcen bereit. Ausgehend von der jüdisch-christlichen Tradition und im Diskurs mit der Geschichtsphilosophie möchte ich dazu anregen, mit Schülerinnen und Schülern im Religionsunterricht eine Form des Eingedenkens in der Perspektive der Hoffung zu entwickeln. Hierbei wird eine Gedächtnishaltung intendiert, die nicht in der Idee einer reinen Fortschrittsgeschichte aufgeht, sondern zurückblickt, sich den Tiefen und Ambivalenzen vergangenen Leids stellt und die Toten in die Vision einer besseren Gesellschaft einbezieht. Dabei bleibt das Gedächtnis stets dem Leben und der Zukunft zugewandt und gibt ethische Impulse für die Gegenwart. Gerade im Religionsunterricht können Schülerinnen und Schüler befähigt werden, zu „Redenden und Handelnden“ der Geschichte zu werden, auch indem der Frage Raum gegeben wird, woraus Kraft für Erinnerungsarbeit geschöpft werden kann und welche Hoffnungsperspektiven bestehen. Even if neglect of Church History in Religious Education is widely criticised and complaints are heard about a lack of historical consciousness, pupils -female and male – are often found to be quite open to history and church history. The challenge today consists in helping them to deal with their knowledge of history, to create a relationship, or life, with history in a way that makes sense and is actually responsible. For this purpose the Jewish-Christian tradition offers valuable resources. Based on the Jewish-Christian tradition, and in discourse with the philosophy of~<br>

Abstract: L'article examine la lecture, par Hegel, de la critique kantienne de la métaphysique de l'âme et la conception hégélienne de l'âme comme « esprit-nature ». La question est de savoir ce que Hegel retient de la critique kantienne et en quoi, cependant, elle lui semble méthodologiquement inappropriée. Plus fondamentalement, il s'agit de saisir en quel sens les prédicats reconnus à l'âme dans la métaphysique dogmatique se trouvent « relevés » dans la conception hégélienne de l'esprit. The paper considers Hegel's reading of Kant's critique of the metaphysics of the soul and Hegel's conception of the soul as "natural spirit". The question is what Hegel retains from the Kantian critique and why it seems to him, nevertheless, to be methodologically inappropriate. More fundamentally, the aim of the paper is to grasp in which sense the predicates of the soul according dogmatic metaphysics are "sublated" in Hegelian conception of spirit.<br>

Abstract: En este ensayo el autor propone una narrativa para su trayectoria intelectual, que cubre medio siglo de reflexión e investigación en ciencias humanas. Lo hace desde una perspectiva interpretativa, historicista y comunitaria. Entiende el impulso inicial y la evolución ulterior como respuestas (con su mezcla de compromiso y de distancia) a una serie de retos y conversaciones en diferentes comunidades de debate, situadas en diversos marcos históricos (España, Francia, Estados Unidos). Sugiere un argumento y un rumbo, en torno a la tensión entre una teoría de la sociedad civil entendida en sentido amplio y los límites del horizonte (y la huida hacia adelante) de la modernidad avanzada. In this essay the author provides a narrative of his intellectual journey, covering half a century of reflection and research in the human sciences. He does so from an interpretive, historicist and communitarian perspective. He sees his initial intellectual interests and later evolution as responses (with their mix of committment and distace) to a series of challenges and conversations in different communities of debate and situated in different historical frameworks (primarily Spain, France and the United States). He suggests an argument and a path for addressing the tension between a theory of civil society understood in a broad sense and the limits on the horizon (and the flight forward) of advanced modernity.<br>

Abstract: The citizenship of the Hermeneutic Philosophy surpasses multicultural proposals. It detects the lack of pre-philosophic solutions: cosmopolitan, republican citizenship, communitarian and liberal. As a consequence, it assumes and fuses equalities and differences in a project. It establishes the merging of four key horizons: the sense of belonging to a community; an agreement in rights and obligations of an identifier project; the right to take part in politics (to be co-legislators), and the validation of a right according to interests. In consequence, it gives the right of opportunity over the right of possession; making the strange our own. This citizenship reaches, by hermeneutic empathy, each one to grant him the subsidiary of a categorical right. It is an invitation to treat others as you would yourself.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i342774<br>
Date: 3 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Woolfolk Craig J.<br>
Abstract: This article explores the meanings that consumption experiences hold for professional working mothers engaged in the culturally prominent lifestyle known as "juggling." A discussion is given to prior research documenting the cultural and historical processes that gave rise to this lifestyle pattern. These analyses suggest that "jugglers" of the baby boom generation have been socialized in a common system of conflicting cultural ideals, beliefs, and gender ideologies. A hermeneutic research approach is used to explicate the emic consumer meanings that arise in relation to the participants' salient life concerns and their sense of personal history. An etic framework is then derived that further analyzes these perceptions in the context of issues related to the social construction of feminine identities and cultural conceptions of motherhood. The conceptual and methodological implications of the emic and etic frameworks for consumer research are discussed.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Sternberg Nancy<br>
Abstract: Hayden White's perhaps richest and most profoundly argued book, The Content of the Form, touches many nerves in the American historical profession. The entirety of the book, from its premises through its most thoughtful exegeses of historical writing, insists that linguistic form is the primary carrier of content in historical writing, indeed, in historical knowledge. This insistence on a respectful and careful attention to the formal usages of nonfiction prose, truth-claiming language, goes well against the grain of American tastes. As de Tocqueville presciently and correctly predicted, when Americans take to literature in a serious way, they won't have much patience with precise matters of form. Hayden White's narrative theory has had uphill work to penetrate this pervasive indifference, especially among historians. He has been joined in recent decades by Paul Ricoeur, whose Time and Narrative, beginning from different premises and a slightly different question, arrives at a sympathetic and complementary analysis of historical narrative. In spite of White's published hesitations about the political/philosophical tendencies of Ricoeur's work, I am convinced that their books are mutually supporting and, in an important cultural sense, belong together. Altogether, however, I do feel that the main import and justification of this present essay must rest on my quite serious reading of Hayden White's best joke, a profound shaggy dog story about the historian monk of St. Gall.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342994<br>
Date: 10 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Mink John H.<br>
Abstract: Ankersmit's articulation of a postmodern theory of history takes seriously both the strengths of traditional historicism and the right of historians to decide what makes sense for disciplinary practice. That makes him an exemplary interlocutor. Ankersmit proposes a theory of historical "representation" which radicalizes the narrative approach to historiography along the lines of poststructuralist textualism. Against this postmodernism but invoking some of his own arguments, I defend the traditional historicist position. I formulate criticisms of the theory of reference entailed in his notion of "narrative substance," of his master analogy of historiography with modern painting, and finally of his characterization of historical hermeneutics. In each case I find him guilty of the hyperbole which he himself cautions against. While it is true that historical narratives cannot be taken to be transparent, in taking them to be opaque Ankersmit puts himself in an untenable position. Finally, Ankersmit seeks to buttress his theoretical case by an interpretation of the new cultural historical texts of authors like Davis and Ginzburg. While this is a concreteness heartily to be welcomed in philosophers of history, I cannot find his construction of this new school's work plausible.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues for theatre as a mode of becoming rather than one of vanishing. By working through the temporal constructs that have traditionally fostered a sense of transience in performance, this essay attempts to establish appearance as a category of thought. It focuses on the praxis of performance, taking as its example a 2002 production in the Philadelphia Fringe Festival entitled machines machines machines machines machines machines machines and its subsequent unfolding in the everyday. Contrary to the dominant critical model of thought that casts theatre as inevitably and unstoppably moving towards its own end, absence, and death, this essay contends that performance is a force of animate presence, continuation, and becoming.<br>

Date: 2 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Carr David<br>
Abstract: In this paper I look at narrative as a mode of explanation and at various ways in which the explanatory value of narrative has been criticized. I begin with the roots of narrative explanation in everyday action, experience, and discourse, illustrating it with the help of a simple example. I try to show how narrative explanation is transformed and complicated by circumstances that take us beyond the everyday into such realms as jurisprudence, journalism, and history. I give an account of why narrative explanation normally satisfies us, and how or in what sense it actually explains. Then I consider how narrative is challenged and rejected as a mode of explanation in many scientific and other contexts and why attempts are made to replace it with something else. I try to evaluate the nature and sources of these challenges, and I describe this controversy over narrative against the historical background of its emergence. My paper ends with a pragmatic defense of narrative explanation against these challenges.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i25478832<br>
Date: 5 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Kansteiner Wulf<br>
Abstract: This essay provides a close reading of Saul Friedländer's exceptionally successful comprehensive history of the Holocaust from the theoretical perspective of Hayden White's philosophy of history. Friedländer's The Years of Extermination has been celebrated as the first synthetic history of the "Final Solution" that acknowledges the experiences of the victims of Nazi genocide. But Friedländer has not simply added the voices of the victims to a conventional historical account of the Holocaust. Instead, by displacing linear notions of time and space and subtly deconstructing conventional concepts of causality, he has invented a new type of historical prose that performs rather than analyzes the victims' point of view. Friedländer's innovation has particularly radical consequences for the construction of historical explanations. On the one hand, Friedländer explicitly argues that anti-Semitism was the single most important cause of the Holocaust. On the other hand, his transnational, multifaceted history of the "Final Solution" provides a wealth of data that escapes the conceptual grasp of his explicit model of causation. Friedländer chooses this radically self-reflexive strategy of historical representation to impress on the reader the existential sense of disbelief with which the victims experienced Nazi persecution. To Friedländer, that sense of disbelief constitutes the most appropriate ethical response to the Holocaust. Thus the narratological analysis of The Years of Extermination reveals that the exceptional quality of the book, as well as presumably its success, is the result of an extraordinarily creative act of narrative imagination. Or, put into terms developed by White, who shares Friedländer's appreciation of modernist forms of writing, The Years of Extermination is the first modernist history of the Holocaust that captures, through literary figuration, an important and long neglected reality of the "Final Solution."<br>

Abstract: While Robert Frost's emphasis on ordinary themes has often been noted, his use of ordinary time bears further attention: his poems show how the repetitive pattern of daily living can be a creative possibility rather than an enervating necessity. His everyday verse suggests revised definitions of lyric temporality as well as new reconciliations of the dualistic oppositions structuring accounts of modernist and Americanist literature. In Frost, human repetition allows a willful independence endorsed by the natural world. The generally neglected poem "In the Home Stretch" demonstrates his most beneficent version of ordinary living, showing how retrospection and conversation are crucial elements of its practice and how marriage can promote these habits. Frost provides a contrasting, failed version of everyday practice in "Home Burial" and a comparable sense of repetitive possibility in "Never Again Would Birds' Song Be the Same."<br>

Abstract: Regido por la subjetividad, el universo contemporáneo del creer es en todas sus partes de circulación fluida, inmediatamente refractario a cualquier referencia estructurante a estabilidad alguna, excepto cuando postula esta estabilidad como puramente operatoria. El objetivo del creer contemporáneo no consiste en alcanzar una "identidad religiosa" (que se concibe como "estable"), sino demostrar que puede ser un creer dentro del movimiento. En realidad, el concepto de "religión", como también los de "secularización" y de "laicidad" que se le asocian, pasan a ser, en situación de plena legitimidad social de la individualización radical de la construcción de una relación con el sentido, conceptos cada vez más indeterminados y en consecuencia de sobra inutilizables, al menos mientras se persista en reconocerles una pertinencia que les sería propia. La "religión", por ello, no es sino el indicador de recomposiciones más amplias, en las cuales participa, por otra parte, como instrumento de gestión. Así, sólo tiene sentido como objeto de intermediación, un analizador que, contextualizado, puede por lo demás resultar muy precioso. /// Ruled by subjectivity, the contemporary universe of belief is in all its parts of fluid circulation, immediately impervious to any structuring reference to any stability, unless this stability is posited as a purely operating principle. The aim of contemporary belief is not to achieve a "religious identity" (which would be conceived as "stable"), but to show that it can be a belief within movement. In fact, the concept of "religion", as well as the related concepts of "secularization" and "laicism" that are associated to it, happen to become, in a situation of total social legitimacy of radical individualization in constructing a relation with meaning, increasingly indeterminate and consequently utterly useless concepts, at least as far as there persists the will to grant them a pertinence of their own. "Religion", for that reason, is nothing m~<br>

Abstract: This essay looks at how a number of avant-garde films that work with cinematic images of the past involve spectators in the imaginative creation of historical worlds. These films are re-enactments, not in the sense of offering re-creations of specific historical events, but in the sense of involving spectators in an experience that offers them a feeling for the past.<br>

Publisher: Association of American Geographers<br>
Issue: i323894<br>
Date: 6 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Buttimer Anne<br>
Abstract: Recent attempts by geographers to explore the human experience of space have focused on overt behavior and its cognitive foundations. The language and style of our descriptions, however, often fail to speak in categories appropriate for the elucidation of lived experience, and we need to evaluate our modes of knowing in the light of modes of being in the everyday world. Phenomenologists provide some guidelines for this task. They point to the preconsciously given aspects of behavior and perception residing in the "lifeworld"-the culturally defined spatiotemporal setting or horizon of everyday life. Scientific procedures which separate "subjects" and "objects," thought and action, people and environments are inadequate to investigate this lifeworld. The phenomenological approach ideally should allow lifeworld to reveal itself in its own terms. In practice, however, phenomenological descriptions remain opaque to the functional dynamism of spatial systems, just as geographical descriptions of space have neglected many facets of human experience. There are certain avenues for dialogue between these two disciplines in three major research areas: the sense of place, social space, and time-space rhythms. Such a dialogue could contribute to a more humanistic foundation for human geography.<br>

Article Title: Photography after the Photograph: Event, Archive, and the Non-Symbolic<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i25650854<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Roberts John<br>
Abstract: This article looks at the continuing social crisis of documentary image culture, in the light of both the political demise of a left-bloc of social forces, which historically has underwritten its critical ideals from the 1920s to the late 1980s, and the continued expansion of the 'non-symbolic' forces (Vilém Flusser) of mass culture — the de-politicization of the public sphere through the circulation of a range of narrow and circumscribed (generic) images. In this I take seriously the notion that documentary photography is subject to an increasing 'lateness' in its effects (that is, in terms of its effective representation of the social world and of access to distribution). However, this sense of documentary photography as existing after-the-event does not mean we should mourn the loss or photography's active relationship to the 'event'. This is because the documentary ideal of the 1920s and 1930s had no privileged access to 'photographic truth', just as it was in no greater position of autonomy within the political economy of photography than it is now. Rather, what distinguished documentary photography during its modernist heyday was a partisan political confidence in its ideals and aims. It is this that is missing today. Thus, once we look at the history of documentary practice as a set of subordinate practices culturally, we can than avoid all the historicist pitfalls of assuming this is the 'worst of all times' and begin to rethink the political and theoretical parameters of documentary practice. As such, this article addresses why, in this present period, we need an adequate politics of 'lateness'.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i25654803<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Passos José Luiz<br>
Abstract: It has become commonplace to describe Machado de Assis's characters and narrators as deeper than those of his contemporaries, and his novels as representations more creatively ambiguous than most literary depictions of nineteenth-century Brazil. In this essay I argue that throughout his novels psychological depth is a function of moral imagination; and a troubled moral imagination is a necessary condition for the literary representation of the modern self. Machado's protagonists are able to fashion the public presentation of their selves by imagining alternatives to their origins, desires, and social predicaments. They have in their pasts a burden they need to overcome, and while doing so they find themselves in conditions of freedom and harm. Evil then arises as a consequence of moral dynamism, in so far as it becomes a project for undoing the other. The genesis of a radical conception of free will and evil in Machado's narratives goes back to his translation of Victor Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea (1866). His concern with a more meticulous characterization of inwardness deepens between Iaiá Garcia (1878) and Dom Casmurro (1899), when adopting the structure of a confessional narrative he arrives at a balance between disguised motives (malice), double chronology (nostalgia), and human life as an unfolding, reversible, and self-aware process (metamorphosis). To frame Machado's strategy for depicting moral change, I take from Augustine's Confessions the suggestion that retrospection is the only way of restoring the identity of someone whose self is marked by his or her sense of dissimilarity with the past. Finally, from Kant and Paul Ricoeur I draw the elements for a further consideration of evil as an invitation to think differently about seeing, judging, and narrating human life.<br>

in which Nietzsche (rightly) says, 'There are no facts, only interpretations.' By interpre-
tation, I mean here a conscious act of the mind which illustrates a certain code, certain
'rules' of interpretation" (5) ["Bien sur, je ne parle pas de l'interpretation dans son sens
general, a propos duquel Nietzsche dit (tres justement), Tl n'y a pas de faits, il n'y a que des
interpretations.' Par interpretation, j'entends ici un acte conscient de l'esprit qui illustre
un certain code, certaines 'regies' d'interpretation."]). L'interpretation du recit selon la
pensee chinoise qui est proposee ici s'entend dans le sens general du terme, comme lec-

Abstract: The aim of the present article is to investigate how the passages of the Holy Text regarding natural sciences or the cosmological order of the universe can be read from a hermeneutical viewpoint, in a philosophical rather than a historical, grammatical or stylistic sense; the debated problems of literary and artistic character, and the relationship between Qur'an and science per se, are not involved here. If we assume as a working hypothesis the Gadamerian perspective that 'being, as far as we can understand it, is language', we can accept that the being of God and of the universe are disclosed in Qur'anic language and that the Qur'an becomes the framework of the aletheia (in the Heideggerian sense) of science. This paper utilises the above-mentioned epistemological and hermeneutical key in order to make a first attempt to explore the possibility of a philosophical analysis of the question of science in the Qur'an, and concludes that, although it can sound highly paradoxical, the attitudes of total agreement, partial agreement or no agreement between Qur'an and science are not mutually exclusive, but rather work in parallel at different linguistic levels. ‮الهدف من هذه الدراسة هو بحث کيف يمکن فهم الآيات القرآنية المتعلقة بالعلوم الطبيعية أو النظام الکوني من وجهة نظر منهج تفسيري من ناحية فلسفية لا تاريخية أو نحوية أو بلاغية. لن يتم هنا مناقشة قضايا أدبية أو فنية أو العلاقة بين القرآن والعلم في هذا البحث. إذا افترضنا أن وجهة نظر جادامير (remadaG)، ‮ وهي أن " الوجود، کما نفهمه، هو اللغة "، تعتبر نظرية قابلة للتطبيق، يمکن أن نقبل أن وجود الله والکون يبين من خلال اللغة القرآنية وأن القرآن يصبح إطار الوصول للحقيقة، طبقاً لفهم هيدجر (reggedieH). ‮إن هذا البحث يستخدم علم الحد والمنهج التفسيري من أجل القيام بأول محاولة لاستکشاف إمکانية تحليل فلسفي لقضية العلم في القرآن. وقد انتهى هذا البحث إلى أن التوافق بين القرآن والعلم تاما أو جزئيا أوعدم التوافق لا يعتبر أمرا قاطعا من الجهتين لکنه يعمل على درجات لغوية مختلفة متوازنة.‬<br>

Abstract: Beckett's "Three Dialogues with Georges Duthuit" poses two distinct difficulties for the reader: the revelation of artistic process or creative energy and the resistance to representation with its implication of objectification. The first may be defined in terms of a three-stage operation resulting in a depiction of sublimation or creative force. Without recourse to psychohistory, one may explore the second in terms of the paradoxical obsession with evocative memory evident throughout Beckett's work. Of this, a disturbance in object representation, understood in the psychoanalytic sense, may be the source.<br>

Abstract: This paper is the second part of a general study on the relationship between Nishida and Chinese philosophy. In the first, I explored the extent to which Nishida's philosophy was influenced, directly and indirectly, explicitly and implicitly, historically and conceptually, by materials coming from the intellectual horizon of Chinese thought. I concentrate here on Nishida's own position toward what he understood by "Chinese philosophy." Is this philosophy, so suggestive for Nishida, promoted to a central place in his work or not, and if so, in what sense might we take this idea of "centrality" as specifically Chinese? In setting forth several archetypes of Chinese thought present in Nishida's philosophy, the focus of this article falls on the methodological, logical and metaphysical contrasts we can identify between the Japanese philosopher and Chinese philosophy as his underground intellectual sources. 本稿は、筆者による西田幾多郎と中国哲学との関係を考察した研究論文の続編にあたる。前編の “Nishida Kitarō and Chinese Philosophy”は、西田哲学がどれだけの直接的もしくは間接的、明示的もしくは暗示的、歴史的もしくは概念的な影響を中国思想の知的土壊を基盤とする史料や人物から受けたかを考究したものである。続編である本稿では、西田が理解するところの中国哲学に対する西田自身の姿勢に焦点を絞る。この中国哲学なるものが西田の著作のなかで中心的な位置を占めているのかどうか、そうであるとするならば、この「中心」なる慨念を我々はどう理解すれば良いのか。本稿では、西田哲学に現れる中国思想の複数の原型を提示するとともに、西田という日本の哲学者と彼の知的背景としての中国哲学との間に認識できる、方法論的、論理的、形而上学的な対照に光を当てるものである。<br>

Date: 1 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Scheuch Erwin K.<br>
Abstract: First of all an overview is presented of the development in the social sciences that led to postmodernism. The starting point for this is the modernity that was under the influence of Parsons after the second World War. It extended to the Third World mainly in the context of development research. Since the end of the 1970s the contributions of two German scientists, Niklas Luhmann and Jürgen Habermas, have received international recognition. During this time the first critical voices concerning the modernist theories were heard. Among ideas opposing these theories the approaches should be named first, which the author calls "post industrial". To these he counts primarily the analysis of the modern socio-economic system by Daniel Bell and the studies of the "post-material personality" by Ronald Inglehart. Research on the change of values in modern societies should be named in the same context. However, "post-industrial" should not be confused with "post-modern". The origin of the latter term from the "culture scene" is explained. The language of the post-modernists can be viewed as their characteristic, as well as the attempts of deconstruction imprinted by Derrida. Ever since Lyotard the strong bond between the name and the named object within the language has been questioned. Therefore, Jean Baudrillard is correct in noting a loss in the sense of orientation of the modern human being. For example, the works of two post-modernists, Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck, are discussed in detail, after which the author concludes: "That is the most important meaning of postmodernity: as a symbol for the weakened autonomy of the sciences and arts, as a lack for the support of sciences in culture and politics". Nevertheless one can observe a return to rationality in recent years.<br>

Abstract: The issue of contingency in narratives has long been of interest to the disciplines of philosophy, theoretical history and literary sciences. More recently, the question of how societies conceptualize and try to come to grips with the occurrence of the "expected unexpected" has gained an increasing importance both in anthropology and cultural studies generally. Built around a narrative—a more or less "classic" example of a "fighting story", well known in Northern Aboriginal Australia—the article demonstrates how the oft-repeated tale reflects not only an experience of the social but also a (desired) potential for transformation. Using insights drawn from theories that emphasize the presentational (as opposed to the representational) qualities of the symbolic, the paper shows how the immanent capacity for conflict is thematized in an "olden time story". The narrative may not resolve the problems it addresses; however, through its symbolic presentations it nevertheless serves as a multi-faceted means to confront and even to make sense—if only temporarily—of the incongruities and the paradoxes of daily life.<br>

Abstract: Starting by the distinction made by Henrique Cláudio de Lima Vaz between the democratic ideal and real democracy, and to assume that we will only be able to build a true democratic community if we act within that same community as authentic persons, we defend in this article that being a person is constituted as a call to hope. We will divide the article into three parts. In the first part, we will explain in what sense the personalism is constituted as an option for hope. Then we indicate what it means to be a person for Lima Vaz. Finally, we show how we can become a person and what are the difficulties to this accomplishment. Only when we exist as authentical people we will be able to establish the right relationship between the democratic ideal and real democracy.<br>

Abstract: Sorel, Montesquieu, p. 7. Carr notices that Usbek and Rica may stand for a distant
monarch, perhaps Louis XIV, one 'who in some sense is remote from his obligations and
responsibilities'. Given the differences in character between Usbek and Rica, one
expects that it may be better simply to see Usbek as a distant authority figure, since he is
the remote ruler of his seraglio. See Carr, 'The Secret Chain of the Lettres persanes',
pp. 335-6.<br>

Abstract: According to Philip Rieff, Freud affirms the distance of the individual from the com-
munity, and in this sense psychoanalysis agrees with liberalism. The Freudian individual is
aloof from politics and learns not to seek radical changes in society, avers Rieff. That individ-
ual adapts to society in a calculated way which suits his or her needs: 'a rationally alienated
person learns how to guard against social over-investments, and how to make them when
necessary' (Philip Rieff, Freud: The Mind of a Moralist (Garden City, NY, 1961), p. 278).
Freud, then, teaches that the individual's attachment to society should be dependent on a
rational, economic exercise—on the conscious distribution of instinctual energy. Moreover,
once psychoanalytic therapy becomes a way of life, it contributes to detachment from others
by enhancing self-absorption. 'While enjoining a person to be less severe with himself,
observes Rieff, 'Freudian analysis may also develop in the patient new qualities of self-
suspicion... The therapy manufactures a new sort of conscience, one which demands a more
accurate and yet more scrupulous self-centeredness' (ibid., pp. 106-7).<br>

Author(s): Dube David<br>
Abstract: The essay challenges the strongly teleological emphasis in the construction of black South African literary history, which has elided many of the aesthetic, historical and political complexities of the literature. It argues that many of the literary texts written in the `mission' ethos are marked by forms of aesthetic hybridity and subtextual ambiguity which require serious interpretation. A common feature of this writing is its desperate struggle with a sense of accelerated time. It is suggested that written narrative was undertaken as a mode of reprisal which sought to limit and, in some instances, transform the effects of an alien modernity. This undertaking is studied in two groups of texts: those which tell the story of Christian `emergence' amongst indigenous communities, and those which re-create the traditional past. In the case of the `Christian' texts, the subtext is found to be more secular than is often assumed, with writers using the theme to develop an active relationship with the historical effects and ideological content of modernity. Similarly, narratives about traditional society (or early colonial encounters) involve attempts to relocate modern subjects in revised versions of the past, or to elicit principles around which alternative models of modernity or even civil society might develop.<br>

Abstract: The structural analysis of myth is a prime focus of anthropological interest, largely because of the efforts of Levi-Strauss. This paper uses some Levi-Straussian ideas to develop a strategy for myth analysis that I call the non-sense-in-myth strategy (NIMS). The strategy is given a trial run on a well-known and (I believe) much-misunderstood myth: Adam and Eve in Eden. The structure identified has an evolutionary character consistent with many modern understandings concerning the nature of human reality. NIMS, a mediator between Levi-Straussian intellectual leaps and a real methodology, indicates the value of cautious optimism concerning the question "Can structural analysis of myth become a scientific endeavor?"<br>

Author(s): Watson-Gegeo Karen Ann<br>
Abstract: Two traditions have been vying for supremacy in the area of cultural analysis. The first sees culture as encompassing the totality of socially learned human phenomena; the second restricts the term to shared mental-primarily cognitive-properties. David Schneider has achieved a dominant positon in the latter school. In this paper I examine critically Schneider's approach to culture, with special attention to the problems raised by his perspective with respect to intracultural consistency and contradiction. While agreeing that the ethnographer must attempt to shun prior assumptions as to the nature of symbolic and conceptual domains recognized by the people under study, that it is incumbent on the anthropologist to comprehend reality from the natives' point of view before attempting to formulate laws or generalizations, that the symbolic systems and their associated meanings plays an essential part in making sense of any human action system, I shall argue that cultures do not exhibit the degree of integration, consistency, and articulation assumed by Schneider, that in his attempt to render culture wholly integrated and consisten he strips the concept of its analytic utility, that social action and symbolic systems are empirically and epistemologically more closely intertwined than he would lead us to believe, and that the very debate over what culture "really" is constitutes an exercise in reification.<br>

Abstract: This essay reconceptualizes President Theodore Roosevelt's "anti-trust" image within a "pro-business" framework. Critics who have measured Roosevelt's success by the number of anti-trust suits he brought or won miss the essentially rhetorical purposes of his involvement with corporate America. Specifically, this essay contends that his primary emphasis involved the promotion of the proper attitude in corporate leaders and the general public regarding the role of big business in American society. This Roosevelt did in two ways. First, he argued metaphorically for the necessity of corporations and the restraint of muckraking journalists. Second, along with employing metaphors to chastise big business, Roosevelt assumed the role of moral guardian and preached to corporate leaders to adhere to an ethical standard in business. For Roosevelt, corporate America could be effectively regulated only by its leaders' sense of morality and spirit of public service.<br>

Author(s): Payen Pascal<br>
Abstract: The article proposes to analyse the fictional aspects in history writing. Indeed, history doesn't borrow from fiction its compositional techniques only; the discursive strategy which consists in narrating a story is in fact part of historical knowledge as such. A study of Cambysis's biography in Herodotus (II,l-III,66) leads us to grant a very specific function to Book II dealing with Egypt—nearly always considered as some sort of useless overgrowth—and to the "secondary remarks" concerning the Greek world (III,38, 39-60). Setting the Egyptian civilization as a foil enables Herodotus to establish a parallel between expansionist ideas and folly and he includes the Greeks in a plot itself critical of helleno-centric ideology. Our methodological approach owes as much to Ricœur's hermeneutics, as to H. R. Jauss's esthetics of reception and to the various streaks of narratology (narrative syntax and "mise en abîme"), with a view to showing that, once replaced in its "Erwarthunghorizonte", the form of the historical narrative makes full sense.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i27642730<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Renn Joachim<br>
Abstract: In his theory of communication Schutz exhibits a significant tension between two fundamental perspectives, phenomenology and pragmatism, and in the long run he fails to reconcile the contradictory implications these perspectives have with regard to his model of interaction. The main problem seems to be the notion of sense-constitution. Schutz develops two distinguishable accounts of constitution: an egological one and a model based on the phenomenon of direct interaction of empirical subjects. Two key concepts are related to these different modes of constitution: the model of appresentation with regard to language, symbols and signs, and the model of synchronisation as triangulation of streams of consciousness and outward action sequences. They are analyzed as significant for two different methods and two different theories of communication. I propose some reasons for Schutz's insistence on a phenomenological account of the ego and the constitution of sense, and offer a brief sketch of an alternative strategy that is implicit in Schutz's theory.<br>

Abstract: A presente análise do conto "Seqüência", do livro Primeiras estórias, de Guimarães Rosa, pretende demonstrar um recurso recorrente de estruturação das "estórias" do autor. Esses enredos mobilizam, de uma maneira geral, o motivo da viagem e, de uma maneira particular, o percurso do eterno retorno. Nesse trajeto estrutura-se a travessia por um rito de passagem, cujo desfecho dá-se, com uma espécie de sobrelevação lendária, numa paisagem mítica. Para perfazer esse processo, o autor parte de um motivo da cultura popular que acaba amalgamado ao universo da tradição erudita, por meio de referências à tradição da história do gênero da narrativa e de seus códigos míticos. /// This analysis of "Seqüência", a short story from the book Primeiras estórias, by Guimarães Rosa, aims at showing a recurrent device used in the author's stories. These plots have, in a general sense, the motif of travel and, in a strict sense, the journey of eternal return. In this path, the traverse is structured through a rite of passage, whose completion occurs at a mythical scenery as a sort of legendary lifting. In order to accomplish this process, the author's starting point is a motif of popular culture, which ends up by being amalgamated to the universe of the erudite tradition, through references to the narrative genre historical traditions and to its mythical codes.<br>

Publisher: BMJ Publishing Group<br>
Issue: i27718647<br>
Date: 4 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Berghmans Ron<br>
Abstract: Advance directives for psychiatric care are the subject of debate in a number of Western societies. By using psychiatric advance directives (or so-called "Ulysses contracts"), it would be possible for mentally ill persons who are competent and with their disease in remission, and who want timely intervention in case of future mental crisis, to give prior authorisation to treatment at a later time when they are incompetent, have become non-compliant, and are refusing care. Thus the devastating consequences of recurrent psychosis could be minimised. Ulysses contracts raise a number of ethical questions. In this article the central issues of concern and debate are discussed from a narrative perspective. Ulysses contracts are viewed as elements of an ongoing narrative in which patient and doctor try to make sense of and get a hold on the recurrent crisis inherent in the patient's psychiatric condition.<br>

Issue: i27749757<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Bird Frederick<br>
Abstract: Typically people make ethical judgments with reference to unchanging principles, standards, rights, and values. This essay argues that such an ahistorical approach to ethics should be supplemented by a due regard for history. Invoking precedents by authors such as Jonsen and Toulmin, McIntyre, Niebuhr, Weber, De Tocqueville, Machiavelli and others, this essay explores several important ways in which a due regard for history can and should shape the practice of business ethics. Thus a due regard for history helps us both to cultivate fitting appreciation of cultural mores and to understand how current problems and issues have developed as they have; it helps us to gauge current responsibilities with respect legacies of problems inherited from the past; it helps us to develop a lively sense of what is possible in the present, given current contingencies and past experiences; and it moves us to rethink the practice of ethical auditing: not just as a backward-looking effort to gauge compliance but as a forward-looking way of learning from actual experiences and developing fitting responses.<br>

Abstract: This essay is a reflection on the sense of trust, based on Niklas Luhman's pioneering work, and on the sense of history making, based on personal reflections as well as those from other authors, such as Nietzsche, Nadin, Ortega y Gasset, Castells and Fernández-Martorell. The central proposition is that trusting may be considered as synonymous with history making, as both acts are possible only thanks to the existence of a future, the only time really at our disposal, and both are based on past experiences. Besides, the text also examines historical periodization and the importance of the present digital revolution.<br>

This article will try to address from an analytical position the possibility of portraying the foundations supporting the moral stances of the left. In this sense, the reason why the left needs a moral discourse is analysed in the first place; once the fact that the left is necessarily moral is established, the precise foundations supporting that specific moral is investigated; and thirdly and lastly, the possibility of omitting that supportive foundation given the absence of it, is rejected.<br>

Abstract: In "The University in Ruins", Bill Readings traces shifting ideas about the university from the writings of Kant and von Humboldt to their "ruins" in a managerial newspeak that prioritizes profitable programs over humanities scholarship and teaching. The author contends that Readings narrates the dehiscence of these ideas in the form of a lament, even as he urges humanities faculty to abandon melancholic fixations on our deteriorating prestige and besieged values. This article recasts Readings's account in light of Paul Ricoeur's explication of the Augustinian lament to speculate about the ontological lineaments of a sense of lost time among human scientists. يتتبع بيل ريدنجز في عمله أطلال الجامعة المفاهيم المتغيرة عن الجامعة ﺑﺎﺩﺋﺎً بكتابات كانط وڨون هومبولت ومنتهياً بظلال تلك المفاهيم في اللغة الٳدارية الدعاﺋﻴﺔ الحالية التي تتخذ من البرامج الأكاديمية المربحة أولوية لها، على حساب البحث العلمي والتدريس في مجال الٳنسانيات. وترى الكاتبة أن ريدنجز يسرد هذه التحولات في صيغة رثاء ﻳﺆﻛﺪ تراجعها، في الوقت الذي يحث فيه أساتذة الٳنسانيات على التخلي عن هوسهم السوداوي بمثاليات عفى عليها الزمن. وتعيد هذه المقالة تقديم عمل ريدنجز في ضوء شرح پول ريكور للرثاء الأوجسطيني، متأملة السمات الأنطولوجية التي تميز شعور علماء الٳنسانيات بالزمن المفقود .<br>

Abstract: It is argued that, contrary to the received view, there is not one but at least two significant conceptions of society as a moral system in the structural functionalist tradition. They express a weak and a strong sense of `morality' respectively. This conceptual equivocation is a pregnant construction of Durkheim's sociology and is dramatically brought forth by Evans-Pritchard's notorious recommendation to turn away from orthodox functionalism to semantic analysis. As the equivocation implies that social anthropology is bound by a stultifying analytical dualism, profound change of presuppositions seems a prescribed therapy.<br>

Author(s): Messick Brinkley<br>
Abstract: Muftis are literate scholars who specialise in Muslim legal-religious interpretation. They provide an example of a higher level of systematic indigenous interpretation than the common sense, everyday constructions of reality that have been discussed in anthropological accounts. I discuss the institutional form of the muftiship, and contrast it with the judgeship, with reference to indigenous ideal-types found in several categories of written Muslim social thought. This ideal form is then compared with the identities of historical and contemporary muftis in Yemen. The interpretive method employed by muftis joins a Greek-derived concept of analogy with recitation and hermeneutics. While their method is structurally similar to scriptural interpretation, muftis are worldly interpreters who address practical life problems posed by lay questioners.<br>

Publisher: Nanzan University, Anthropological Institute<br>
Issue: i30030308<br>
Date: 1 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Kim Seong-Nae<br>
Abstract: Oral traditions can contain elements of historical evidence and convey meaning. The narrative pattern of oral epics serves not merely as "a mnemonic device" that aids in recalling significant historical events but makes meaningful connections to the cultural experience of identity politics. On Cheju Island, a volcanic island located some fifty miles below the southernmost tip of the Korean peninsula, the indigenous sense of identity and history is expressed and accentuated in the fate of the shrine deities who are portrayed as exiles in shamanic epics such as ponhyang ponp'uri. The tragic heroism in the cliché of exile and return of the shrine deities recapitulates the historical identity of Cheju people as "exiles at the frontier." After Cheju Island lost political autonomy as an independent kingdom, Tam-ra, in the early twelfth century, the Cheju people's cultural memory of isolation and redemptive desire for liberation from the mainland state's domination becomes intelligible and justifiable textually through the heroic acts of exiled deities.<br>

Article Title: Reinventing Grounded Theory: Some Questions about Theory, Ground and Discovery<br>
Publisher: Routledge<br>
Issue: i30032703<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): James David<br>
Abstract: Grounded theory's popularity persists after three decades of broad-ranging critique. In this article three problematic notions are discussed-'theory,' 'ground' and 'discovery'-which linger in the continuing use and development of grounded theory procedures. It is argued that far from providing the epistemic security promised by grounded theory, these notions-embodied in continuing reinventions of grounded theory-constrain and distort qualitative inquiry, and that what is contrived is not in fact theory in any meaningful sense, that 'ground' is a misnomer when talking about interpretation and that what ultimately materializes following grounded theory procedures is less like discovery and more akin to invention. The procedures admittedly provide signposts for qualitative inquirers, but educational researchers should be wary, for the significance of interpretation, narrative and reflection can be undermined in the procedures of grounded theory.<br>

Article Title: Does Collective Identity Presuppose an Other? On the Alleged Incoherence of Global Solidarity<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i30038913<br>
Date: 2 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Abizadeh Arash<br>
Abstract: Two arguments apparently support the thesis that collective identity presupposes an Other: the recognition argument, according to which seeing myself as a self requires recognition by an other whom I also recognize as a self (Hegel); and the dialogic argument, according to which my sense of self can only develop dialogically (Taylor). But applying these arguments to collective identity involves a compositional fallacy. Two modern ideologies mask the particularist thesis's falsehood. The ideology of indivisible state sovereignty makes sovereignty as such appear particularistic by fusing "internal" with "external" sovereignty; nationalism imagines national identity as particularistic by linking it to sovereignty. But the concatenation of internal sovereignty, external sovereignty, and nation is contingent. Schmitt's thesis that "the political" presupposes an other conflates internal and external sovereignty, while Mouffe's neo-Schmittianism conflates difference (Derrida) with alterity. A shared global identity may face many obstacles, but metaphysical impossibility and conceptual confusion are not among them.<br>

Author(s): Gordon Peter Eli<br>
Abstract: Habermas eloquently summarizes Cassirer's view: "The position of human being
in the world is defined by a form-giving power which transforms sense impressions into
meaningful structures. Human beings master the forces of nature which rush in upon them
through symbols which spring from the productive imagination. Thus they gain a distance
from the immediate pressure of nature. Of course, they pay for this emancipation with their
mental dependence on a semanticized nature, which returns in the spellbindingforce of myth-
ical images. That first act of distantiation must therefore be repeated in the course of cultural
development."<br>

Publisher: Centre national de la recherche scientifique<br>
Issue: i30116051<br>
Date: 3 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Vincent Gilbert<br>
Abstract: Reflections by scientists, philosophers and sociologists upon the role of science as the motor of modern history show that apocalyptics can be interpreted neither as irrationalism nor as rhetorical, emphatic speech. Speaking out of the imagination, apocalyptics takes the form of a discourse that is hypercritical of and the least inexact about science, whenever scientific successes have rendered the habitual distinction between reality and model untenable. The imaginary realm of apocalyptics follows upon utopia and science fiction. However it has to be separated from "catastrophism". The latter still takes science to be a messiah because its idea of scientific develop. ment conceals favorable future effects underneath presentday catastrophic consequences. By refusing to separate intentions and effects and by objectifying science as a "totalizing" power, apocalyptics, on the other hand, leads to an irreversible situation that identifies history and destiny. Not only the semantic contents of the apocalyptic discourse are examined but also its "pragmatic" value is weighed. Its paradoxical declarations assume the form of a discourse whose proclamation has a meaning-an instituting scope-that literally contradicts its content, the proclaimed "non-sense" of science.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i30154098<br>
Date: 7 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Johannsen Jochen<br>
Abstract: After some initial remarks on the ongoing historiographic debates regarding experience as an analytical category, the article first tries to show, through a concise survey of J. G. Herder's essays on Ossian and Shakespeare, that Herder cannot be claimed as a source for the notion of historical experience in the sense of an immediate access to the past, as the theorist of history F. R. Ankersmit has stated. Instead, this article argues, experience can be understood as one of the key terms of Herder's historical view of modernity, whose development he describes as involving a paradigmatic change in the character of human experience itself. For Herder, the shift from primary to secondary experience in the modern historical process results in the necessity of an aestheticization of historiography. In this respect, the article briefly concludes, Herder inspired 19thcentury historians such as G. G. Gervinus.<br>

Publisher: Transaction Periodicals Consortium<br>
Issue: i30222610<br>
Date: 4 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Forsyth Neil<br>
Abstract: Milton's Paradise Lost is an epic poem about the origin of evil, mixing classical and Christian forms and sources. This essay first explores whether "evil" is primarily a classical or Judeo-Christian concept, and shows that it is a product of the religious syncretism of the Hellenistic period. Yet among the poets, we meet this new sense of malignance chiefly in Virgil, especially in such a figure as Allecto. The essay then shows how Milton's language carefully discriminates among these origins, so that the imagery of Hell comes from Virgil, while the conception of evil remains principally Christian, both in the narrative and in philosophical reflection. But in the final section of the essay, we see that the being whose identity is the answer to the poem's initiating epic question ('Who first seduc'd them to that foul revolt?'), and whose actions drive the poem into motion and inaugurate its story-Satan-, is, like his daughter Sin, a complex and seductive blend of both-and this helps to explain some of the tension we feel in his presence. He is a much more complex answer than those required by the initiating questions in Homer or Virgil, and indeed it takes the whole poem to understand that answer.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses several problems in experimental ethnographies: the integration of first and third person texts, ethnographic authority, and incorporation of dialogue into texts. These problems can be traced to a relationship between discourse and text that focuses on reference, and results in "representing" dialogue. This obscures dialogue in the larger sense of constituting social reality. An indexical, rather than a referential approach to dialogue is developed through examination of indexing of social distance, discussed in Japanese usage of register. Implications are traced out for intersubjective, reflexive, and pluralistic approaches to social life.<br>

Abstract: Many contemporary sources, including anthropological, define politics as the vying for power that occurs in the public domain, the goverance of the body politic, or strategies for advancing particular interests as general. While not inaccurate in terms of reflecting politics in the modern state, the instrumental notion often excludes a sense of politics that involves a struggle for mutual recognition or consensus through the medium of discourse. Discourse becomes the central concept in grasping the relation between politics and secret societies among the peasantry. It is argued in this essay that politics displayed through discourse goes a long way towards defining the public in peasant societies. In terms of augmented repression, either from a centralized state or local elites, the sense of public submerges itself in the hidden discourse or code of the secret society. This theme is examined with respect to the Mau Mau of Kenya and late nineteenth and twentieth-century Chinese secret societies.<br>

Abstract: The recent turbulent events in the Middle East indicate the importance and the challenges of uniting citizens in each of these countries in some commonly known story of who they are and from whence they have come. A consciously constructed sense of collective history is one especially fertile ground from which stories of national identity can be drawn. This article interprets a set of symbols displayed in a political drama in one particular Turkish small town. Following Ricoeur's analyses of ideology, it shows how sentiments of national identity are created and maintained in seemingly small ways. The symbols and processes which affirm identity, however, concomitantly disguise and distort other expressions of the historic situation. Although distortions may be the result of benign processes of signification, they may also be manipulated to favor the needs and desires of persons and groups which seek to maintain power and influence.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues that the question of the relationship between religiosity and mental health has been miscast because both religiosity and mental health have been understood in the discipline from a distinctly modernist perspective. This modernist perspective is characterized by a metaphysic of substances and by empiricism, and it insists that all scientifically interesting relationships must be efficient causal relationships among substances. From this perspective the only legitimate questions revolve around which way the causal arrow points. The paper argues that this framing of the question and the modernist perspective which gives rise to it fail as adequate accounts of either phenomenon and, thus, of their relation. Further, in some fundamental sense the perspective fails to take either religiosity or psychopathology seriously.<br>

Abstract: Social theorists' recent interest in global capitalism is partially driven by their sense of "being behind" in a changed and changing world. It is also part of their larger efforts to critique the present. In this article, I seek to find analogues of this sense of temporal incongruity between knowledge and its objects in the Tokyo financial markets. My focus is on the anxieties and hopes animating some Japanese securities traders' life choices. I argue that these traders' differing anxieties and hopes resulted from their divergent senses of the temporal incongruity among strategies, workplaces, and Japan's national location vis-à-vis the United States. Drawing on a parallel between social theorists' and traders' efforts to generate prospective momentum in their work, I propose that anthropologists investigate the work of temporal incongruity in knowledge formation more generally.<br>

Article Title: Varying the Self: Bacon's Versions of van Gogh<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i282749<br>
Date: 1 1, 1947<br>
Author(s): Sund Brendan<br>
Abstract: In 1957, Francis Bacon rapidly painted a series of five numbered paintings after van Gogh's "Self-Portrait on the Road to Tarason," to fill an exhibition. They are exceptional in his work, both as to subject and in the way they are painted. A painter who regularly took reproduced images as his sources, he chose in this unique case the self-portrait of another artist, and used -- also uniquely -- methods evidently akin to those of 'action painting'. So selfhood and the practice of painting come into unusual conjunction in these works. Paul Ricoeur's attempt, in "Oneself as Another," to overcome the perennial self--other opposition, and his account of a constitutionally unstable self, lacking a 'core', are suggestive for discussion of the relationship between viewer and painting, specifically with reference to portraiture. He presents an alternative to the antinomial theories of the self which have long dominated criticism of visual art, theories according to which visual images mirror, and so crucially help to construct, an ego enclosed against the other; such a model is presumed in Ernst van Alphen's "Francis Bacon and the Loss of Self." Admittedly, this series of paintings is itself bound to invoke what Ricoeur terms 'hyperbolic' concepts of selfhood: van, Gogh, through his biographers, became the type of artist-as-genius; Minelli's biopic "Lust for Life," which Bacon probably saw, came out in 1956, and in the same year Jackson Pollock, prototypical 'action painter' died in a way that contributed to a comparable mythology. Against that, it is important to consider what Bacon does, and to notice the kinds of action, or interaction, tended to us as viewers. In context, the link with cinema assumes a different importance. Also crucial is Bacon's process of variation. Unlike philosophy, as Ricoeur shows, art can engage in play, freely varying all terms without a view to conclusion -- art experiments with the self. Bacon takes selfhood apart, recombines its elements; he~<br>

Author(s): Zilberfein Carol A.<br>
Abstract: Despite the abundance of psychological studies on trauma related ills of descendants of historical trauma, and the extensive scholarly work describing the memory politics of silenced traumatic pasts, there has yet to emerge a critical analysis of the constitutive practices of descendants of historical trauma. This article presents an ethnographic account of a support group for descendants of Holocaust survivors, proposing that the discursive frame of intergenerational transmission of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and support group based narrative practices allow descendants to fashion their sense of self as survivors of the distant traumatic past. The discursive frame of transmitted PTSD acts as both a mnemonic bridge to the past and a mechanism of identity making, as participants narratively reemplot their life stories as having been personally constituted by the distant past. A close ethnographic reading of on-site discursive practices points to how culture ferments to produce narratives, practices and ultimately carriers of memory to both sustain and revitalize historical grand narratives and the cultural scenarios they embed.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i370173<br>
Date: 3 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Walkerdine Valerie<br>
Abstract: In this article, I seek to make an intervention in debates between psychological and postmodern anthropology by engaging with the theme of border crossing. I argue that the theme of the border is one that fundamentally instantiates a separation between interior and exterior with respect to subjectivity, itself a fundamental transformation and a painful and difficult border. This is related to a Cartesian distinction critiqued in this article. How the distinction between interior and exterior may be transcended is discussed in relation to examples of transformation from the crossing of class borders to the production and regulation of workers in a globalized and neoliberal economy. I begin with reference to postwar transformations of class with its anxious borders and go on to think about changes in the labor market and how these demand huge transformations that tear apart communities, destroy work-places, and sunder the sense of safety and stability that those gave. Advanced liberalism or neoliberalism brings with it a speeding up of the transformations of liberalism in which subjects are constantly invoked as self-contained, with a transportable self that must be produced through the developmental processes of personality and rationality. This self must be carried like a snail carries a shell. It must be coherent yet mutable, fixed yet multiple and flexible. But this view of the subject covers over the many connections that make subjectivity possible. I conclude by asking what it would mean to rethink this issue of the production of safe spaces beyond an essentialist psychological conception of only one mother-child space, separated from the social world, as having the power to produce feelings of safety? I end the article with an argument for a relational approach to subjectivity and sociality.<br>

Date: 1 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): JonasAbstract: In twentieth-century French writing, imagination, as a concept implying subjective agency, loses ground progressively to forms of thought that are no longer morally accountable to their cultural and historical context. This shift can be liked to the transition from a neutral to a critical sense of ideology. The best fiction exploits the tension between responsible subjectivity and its ideological impairment. Much theoretical writing, in contrast, retreats into a disempowering view of human agency as collectively or unconsciously determined. The opposition at work here between symbolic and abstract thought, or mythic and historical consciousness, points to the ethical urgency of rethinking Western concepts of reason.<br>

Author(s): Cahill Lisa Sowle<br>
Abstract: Roman Catholic social ethics traditionally has affirmed moral objectivity, universal moral goods, and progressive social reform - premises that guide just war theory. In recent decades these guiding values have been challenged by contemporary critical philosophies, confessional or communitarian religious ethics, and the fact of cultural pluralism. I A the middle of this century, thinkers like John Courtney Murray gave Catholic ethics a more historical turn, while retaining an essentially realist and meliorist approach to morality and politics. Now this confidence and optimism are questioned anew by ethnopolitical violence, the ambiguities of humanitar- ian intervention, and uncertain attempts at reconciliation and restoration. Such developments show that the central quandary of Christian and po- litical ethics is not the achievement of agreement on basic human goods; it is the expansion of the circle of solidarity in which basic goods are shared in practice. I will suggest that Christian symbols can help evoke the sense of human solidarity that is necessary to sustain peace, and that transformative efforts toward peace in violence-torn societies can be successful.<br>

Abstract: The essay sets forth a historical style in ethics. At the center is the explication of meanings forming the life worlds of representative actors in concrete situations. The sense of life world is sketched in terms of intentionality, intersubjectivity, temporality and embodiment. The essay then delineates the kinds of interpretative activity relevant for understanding life situations: the application of received conventions; suspicion of those conventions as distortions of underlying personal/social dynamics; and a dialectical interplay between a retrieval of one's own traditions, and hospitality to understandings of others differently oriented to the situations in question. The goal is the achievement of common ground which enables us to determine "fitting" action, or at least to keep open the wholeness it promises.<br>

Abstract: This article explores the hunting aesthetics of initiated Jula hunters of Côte d'Ivoire who call themselves dozos. It explains how their hunting aesthetic structures their relationship to Islam and the Ivoirian state. Although many Africans approach Islam in the context of tensions between local ritual traditions and modernizing Muslim reform, dozos approach Islam the way they approach the forests where they hunt, assimilating to both in order to tame them. They organize their hunting activities around an aesthetic centred on notions of sweetness and fullness; their contraries, difficulty and emptiness; and the process of mimetic transformation (shape-shifting) that mediates between these extremes. With these categories dozos assimilate themselves to and appropriate power from the forest to kill game. They also link themselves to pre-Qur'anic Muslim figures to legitimize themselves as Muslims. More recently, they tried to assimilate to the Ivoirian state to become a parallel police force. Stories of their tutelary spirit, Manimory, and the texts of their hunting songs, incantations, and epics encode diverse ways for dozos to relate to Islam, leaving room for dozos to eschew it as well. Their texts reveal a dynamic sense of history that defies classification in terms of tradition, modernity or postmodernity. /// Cet article examine l'esthétique de la chasse chez les chasseurs initiés julas de Côte d'Ivoire, qui se donnent le nom de dozos. Il explique comme leur esthétique de chasse structure leur rapport à l'islam et à l'État ivoirien.

Abstract: El objetivo del artículo es describir rasgos estructurales de la comprensión de metáforas mediante una comparación con la comprensión de otras culturas, tal como ésta ha sido comentada por Wittgenstein y Geertz. El fenómeno de estudio es la comprensión enfática (no básica) de metáforas fuertes (no de metáforas convencionales y muertas). La comparación entre ambos tipos de comprensión sirve para plantear y dar respuesta a tres preguntas desatendidas en la profusa literatura sobre la metáfora: 1) ¿En qué sentido nos sorprenden las metáforas fuertes? 2) ¿En qué sentido pueden ser profundas? 3) ¿En qué sentido hablamos de la riqueza de este fenómeno lingüístico? /// This paper sets out to describe the structural features of metaphor comprehension through a comparison with the process of understanding other cultures construed along the lines proposed by Wittgenstein and Geertz. The phenomenon under analysis is the emphatic (not basic) understanding of strong (not conventional or dead) metaphors. The comparison between understanding metaphors and cultures serves to raise and answer three questions that have been neglected in the vast literature on metaphors: 1) In which sense do strong metaphors surprise us? 2) In which sense can a metaphor be profound? 3) In which sense do we speak of the richness of this linguistic phenomenon?<br>

Abstract: From the moment it began to engage with time in a considered way, human geography has employed a variety of analytical and conceptual approaches to it. Recent work especially has greatly extended the range of these different approaches by stressing the innate variability of time, leading some to talk of 'multiple temporalities' and to pronounce time as 'uneven' even within the same society. Fractured by such differences over how time may be used and interpreted, the possibility of an overarching concept of time in human geography has long gone. However, this does not prevent us from asking whether it is still possible to produce a coherent review of the differences involved. This paper offers such a review, arguing that setting these differences down within a structured framework can provide a clearer sense of how diverse the debate among human geographers has become and the trends of thought that have underpinned this growing diversity. Among the trends identified, it places particular stress on the shift from objectified interpretations to those dealing with relational forms of lived and experiential time and on how the separation of early discussions of space from those on time, their dimensional stand-off from each other, has slowly given way to a view in which space and time are treated as sticky concepts that are difficult to separate from each other.<br>

Abstract: Among the Sui people of rural southwestern China, descent- group loyalties are closely tied to linguistic features. In every village, long-term dialect contact occurs between local villagers and in-marrying women from different clans, yet most speakers maintain their original dialect features to a high degree. The present study conducts ethnographic interviews to more deeply understand why such behavior occurs. Most current, practice-based models of identity tend to emphasize dynamic, flexible, individualistic choices-an approach that suits variation on many levels in many societies. However, to understand the descent-group loyalties particular to indigenous, non-Western, clan-based cultures like Sui, a more tempered, culturally sensitive model is necessary. Speakers show a deep sense of stability, permanence, and collective loyalty to communities of descent, (re) produced through stable linguistic expressions: acts of loyalty. The study also highlights the use of indigenous minorities' own categories (place, toponyms, lineage) rather than non- indigenous categories.<br>

Abstract: By focusing on children involved in the ritual practices in Ambonwari village, East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea, this essay compares two types of ritual: that of healing and that of male initiation. Like other life crisis rituals both deal with two dimensions of the Ambonwari life-world, that is with the living and the dead and, in a broader sense, with people and spirits. Though both are based upon the same cosmology there are fundamental differences between them. First, healers in healing ceremonies treat uninitiated children as 'non-beings'. From the perspective of Ambonwari 'selves' or 'beings', children belong to this domain. They exist as extensions of their parents or carers, from whom they cannot be separated conceptually. Second, by examining the Ambonwari concepts of negation I show that healers do not approach the domain of cosmological non-existence: they are not concerned with the cosmogony of the Ambonwari life-world. The male initiation rituals do just the opposite, however. It is only in the male initiation ritual, seen as a cosmogonic event, that young boys are cut off from their parents and 'thrown' abruptly into a state of becoming. Unlike the healing rites, these rituals treat young boys as both Ambonwari beginnings and Ambonwari beings. I argue that Ambonwari initiation rituals are not concerned with symbolic death followed by rebirth, but with states of being. Initiation means that death becomes possible for a child. The initiated boy will now be able to die as an Ambonwari being.<br>

Abstract: Este texto procura encontrar um princípio hermenêutico que dê acesso a uma leitura de unidade da obra de Ricoeur. Nesse contexto, experimenta a tese de que a filosofia ricoeuriana se deixa interpretar como um caso no interior do pensamento crítico de herança kantiana, como uma filosofia dos limites da razão, não no sentido originário, de investigação sobre as condições de possibilidade do conhecimento objectivo, mas por poder ser lida como uma pesquisa sistematica para encontrar as condições em que é possível ao pensar, à discursividade, dizer, num saber constituído, a existência. Assim, tratar-se-á do significado "crítico" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire que, sendo a primeira obra do projecto da Filosofia da Vontade. lhe determina as condição de possibilidade, ao propor os princípios teóricos fundantes da constituição de um discurso unitário sobre o humano enquanto expressão de uma existência histórica e livre. /// Ce texte veut trouver un principe herméneutique qui donne accès à une lecture unitaire de l'oeuvre de Ricoeur. C'est dans ce contexte que l'on avance la thèse selon laquelle la philosophie ricoeurienne doit être interprétée comme un cas à l'intérieur de la pensée critique d'héritage kantien, comme une philosophie des limites de la raison, non pas dans le sens d'investigation des conditions de possibilité de la connaissance objective, mais parce que cette philosophie peut être lue comme une recherche systématique en vue de trouver les conditions dans lesquelles le penser, le discours, peut, en un savoir constitué, dire l'existence. On s'occupera donc du sens "critique" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire qui, comme première oeuvre du projet de la Philosophie de la l'olonté, assigne à celle-ci ses conditions de possibilité en proposant les principes théoriques qui fondent la constitution d'un discours unitaire à propos de l'humain en tant qu'expression d'une existence historique et libre. /// This text seeks to find a hermeneutical principle which permit~<br>

Abstract: Partindo de alguns pressupostos que explicitam a questão nuclear da "instância do sujeito" na obra de Ricoeur (anteriores ou contemporâneos ao debate com o estruturalismo), e que tipificam a via filosófica ricoeuriana, e partindo também da articulação axial do pensamento de Lévi-Strauss (relacionada com esse debate), são depois propostos os tópicos dessa controvérsia. Tais tópicos, que se desenvolvem em torno dos elementos já considerados, gravitam à volta da inteligibilidade do sentido e do sentido da inteligibilidade, da complementaridade dos métodos, e dos níveis semiológico e semântico, este último estabelecido mediante a pregnância da frase na linguagem, e da palavra (mot) como operador entre a estrutura e o acontecimento. /// La présente analyse commence par mettre en relief quelques présupposés qui explicitent la question nucléaire de "l'instance du sajet" dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur (présupposés antérieurs ou contemporains du débat avec le structuralisme) et qui caractérisent le chemin philosophique de celui-ci; on prend également pour point de départ l'articulation centrale de la pensée de Lévi-Strauss relative à ce débat, afin de proposer ensuite les lignes mai-tresses de cette controverse.

Abstract: Este artigo apresenta o pensamento mais recente de P. Ricoeur sob a perspectiva de uma lógica da produção de sentido, discutindo criticamente as possibilidades e os limites do círculo hermenêutico. Tomando como ponto de partida os pressupostos fenomenológicos e ontológicos da sua filosofia, são sucessivamente abordadas as questões relativas à interpretação textual, imaginação e criatividade, acção, tempo e narrativa, ideologia e utopia. Reconhecido um certo logocentrismo - uma mistura de Logos e de suposto real - implicado na solução destas questões que nos é proposta pelo autor, procura-se repensar a ligação entre o sentido e o consensus, a coerência e a própria questão da violéncia. Estabelece-se para isso, na última secção, um confronto entre as posições defendidas por Ricoeur e a hipótese de R. Girard sobre o desejo mimético e a violência. /// Cet article présente la pensée la plus récente de P.

Abstract: Partindo do principio de que o surgimento da ciência, vinculada desde a sua origem à filosofia, constitui um dos signos especificos do "espirito europeu", no que Gadamer se aproxima de Husserl, o artigo procura dilucidar em que medida ospressupostos da hermeneutica gadameriana – cujas categorias axiais analisa – esclarecem o pluralismo linguistico que caracteriza a Europa, o qual, por sua vez, funda, pela consciência de alteridade que implica, um expressivo e activo pluralismo cultural. Mostra ainda como "todos nós somos outros e todos nós somos nós mesmos", na medida em que viver a diferença e avaliar a resistência do que é o outro equivale a viver uma nova experiência da própria identidade. Finalmente, dado que a aspiração para a universalidade não se obtém contra o particular e o especifico, mas através destes, o artigo analisa até que ponto o "ideal europeu" de Gadamer converge para uma união, ou seja, para um estado de coisas em que o universal é justamente potenciado pelas diferenças que existem entre as culturas dos povos europeus. /// On the principle that the emergence of science constitutes one of the distinguishing signs of the "European Spirit", this article endeavors to investigate how the presuppositions of Gadamer's hermeneutics sheds light on the linguistic pluralism that characterizes Europe and her consequent sensitivity towards otherness. The article also demonstrates how we at once are ourselves and others to the degree that we experience differences, increasing thus our own sense of identity. Finally, universality is not opposed to the particular and the specific. This is shown in the fact that Gadamer's "European Ideal" points towards a universality nourished by the cultural differences that exist among the peoples of Europe.<br>

Abstract: Par Undo do princípio de que a crítica feita em Wahrheit und Methode à Aufklärung tern sobretudo a ver com a hostilidade do iluminismo nos seus confrontos com o preconceito religioso enquanto fundado na revelação cristã, o presente artigo pretende demonstrar de que modo Gadamer, por exemplo já num ensaio de 1941 acerca da critica kantiana da religião, alcançou a partir da sua familiaridade de longa data com os Gregos e os seus deuses uma concepção do religioso que, ao fundar--se sobre a experiência "humanística" do Divino, aspira a manter uma solidariedade intima com a "Religion nach der Aufklärung" ("Religiao segundo a Auflärung"), cujo Deus, apcsar de ser o Deus dos filósofos, nem por isso é menos versado em revelaqçõs e em formas extra-potentes de realidade ". O artigo mostra ainda como no contexto de uma concepção como esta o Divino acabapor assumir sobretudo a figura da "amizade" e da "transcendencia do belo." /// It can be said that Gadamer's critique of the Aufklärung in Wahrheit und Methode has to do with the hostility of the Enlightenment towards religious prejudice derived from Christian revelation. This article aims to demonstrate that, already in an essay dating from 1941 about the Kantian critique of religion, Gadamer possessed a conception of God, largely due to his familiarity with the Greek notions of divinity, that sought nevertheless to maintain close ties with "Religion nach der Aufklärung". Whilst this God is the God of philosophers, it is a God inclined towards revelations and extra-ordinary expressions of power. In addition, the article shows that in this philosophical context the Divine acquires a figure suggesting "friendship" and a transcendent sense of the beautiful.<br>

Abstract: O artigo parte de uma constatação fundamental: a cultura secular mudou radicalmente o problema do mal, libertando-o do imediatismo religioso, exigindo uma resposta nova para um problema novo. Procede segundo dois momentos fundamentais. Primeiro, a ponerología, prévia a toda a adscrição religiosa ou ateia, mostra como a finitude torna o mal algo inevitável: omnis determinatio est negatio (Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel); mostra também até que ponto a ideia de um mundo-finito-sem-mal é algo contraditório, um verdadeiro "círculo-qua-drado". Quebra-se assim o "dilema de Epicuro", pois a alternativa já não é: mundo bom / mundo mau, mas sim: mundo / mundo finito-com-mal (não mundo mau); e instaura-se uma "lógica do apesar de", sem contaminação teleológica. A pisteodicea - o segundo passo - estuda as respostas ("fés" em sentido filosófico ou teológico, crente ou ateu). A teodiceia clássica converte-se, desta forma, em "pisteodiceia cristã", filosoficamente coerente (graças à ponerologia, Deus aparece, apesar do mal, como omnipotente e bom) e teologicamente responsável: a cruz, inevitável, preserva a bondade divina; a ressurreição, transcendente, preserva a omnipotência, respeitando a legalidade mundana. Filosofia e teologia mantêm assim a união na diferença. /// At the outset of this paper is the fundamental realization that the secular culture has radically changed the problem of evil, exempting it from the religious elementariness but rather demanding a new answer to a new problem. It sets two steps. First, the ponerology, previous to any religious or atheistic addition, shows that finitude makes evil inevitable: omnis determinatio est negatio (Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel); a finite-world-without-evil is contradictory, a "square-circle". It breaks, thus, the "Epicurean dilemma", since the alternative is not: good world vs. evil world, but rather world vs. finite-world-with-evil (not evil world): and it establishes a "logic of the in spite of, without the teleological contamination.~<br>

Abstract: O enigma do mal, o escândalo do mal em todas as suasformas, não cessa de inquietar a consciência humana, revelando-se hoje como obstáculo principal à crença em Deus e assunindo proporções tais que as teodiceias do passado, por vezes heróicas, deixaram mesmo de ser possíveis. O presente artigo não as pretende justiflcar, nem sequer desculpar Deus. O seu ponto de partida está antes na consciência de que não se pode separar o mal e os maus, a maldade e o sofrimento, o qual é muitas vezes o reverso do crime. Para o autor, a síntese e o nó górdio da questão do mal está na infelicidade (malheurj no sentido que lhe dá Simone Weil (ódio, opróbrio e sofrimento indissoluvelmente ligados) e a figura do Servo Sofredor. O mal puro, o "mal radical", constitui um desafio à metafísica, desafio este que ela deve ter a coragem de aliviar, de questionar sem cessar, mesmo sabendo que não há solução para o problema do mal, pois que quanto mais lidamos com ele tanto mais se nos obscurece e transforma em mistério. /// The riddle of evil, the scandal of evil in all its forms, does not stop disturbing the human conscience, revealing itself today as the main obstacle to the belief in God and assuming such proportions that even the theodicies of the past, sometimes heroic, stopped being possible. This article does not wish to justify them nor even excuse God. Its starting point is rather in the conscience that evil and the evil ones, wickedness and suffering cannot be separated, which is many times the reverse of crime. According to the author, the synthesis and the Gordian knot concerning evil is in the unhappiness (malheur) according to Simone Weil's sense (hate, opprobrium and suffering indissolubly connected) and the Suffering Servant figure. Pure evil, or "radical evil", is a challenge to metaphysics, challenge that metaphysics should have the courage to mitigate, question unceasingly, even knowing that there is not a solution for the problem of evil as the more we deal with it, the more~<br>

Abstract: A obra principal de Bernard Lonergan Inteligência: Um ensaio sobre o conhecimento humano, é um tratado que leva a cabo uma integração segundo o método transcendental dos conhecimentos heterogéneos da ciência, da filosofia, do senso comum e da teologia. A obra visa a auto-apropriação da nossa auto-consciência intelectual e racional com base na experiência consciente dos actos de intelecção. Começa como teoria cognitiva, expande-se para uma metafísica e uma ética, e avança para uma concepção e uma afirmação de Deus, para ser finalmente confrontada com o problema do mal que exige a transformação da inteligência auto-confiante no intellectus quaerens fidem. Ao cumprir estes objectivos, Inteligência tornou-se uma das mais importantes obras de filosofia do século XX, aqui sucintamente elucidada em cinco das suas principais vertentes: a relação entre conhecimento e realidade, conhecimento científico e cosmologia, a acção humana e a ética, as questões de interpretação, a relação entre natureza de Deus e filosofia. O artigo conclui com uma avaliação da cosmopolis lonerganiana, ou seja, o poder da comunidade de espírito na sociedade. /// Bernard Lonergan s opus magnum, Insight: A Study of human understanding, handles the heterogeneous fields of knowledge as given in science, philosophy, common sense and theology according to a transcendental method. The work aims at the self-appropriation of human intellectual and rational self-conscience as based in the conscious experience of insight. Lonergan s work starts as a cognitive theory, and advances, through metaphysics and ethics, to a conception and affirmation of God, one that is confronted with the problem of evil and therefore requires a transformation of self-confident intelligence into the intellectus quaerens fidem. Handling these goals, Insight became one of the most important works of philosophy in the 20 th century. The present article deals with five of the main issues in Lonergan s work: the relation between knowledge~<br>

Article Title: The Narrative Ethics of Leopold's Sand County Almanac<br>
Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i40014552<br>
Date: 10 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Liszka James Jakób<br>
Abstract: Although philosophers often focus on the essays of Leopold's Sand County Almanac, especially "The Land Ethic," there is also a normative argument present in the stories that comprise most of the book. In fact the shack stories may be more persuasive, with a subtlety and complexity not available in his prose piece. This paper develops a narrative ethics methodology gleaned from rhetoric theory, and current interest in narrative ethics among literary theorists, in order to discern the normative underpinnings of the stories in Part 1. The narrative ethics approach sidesteps the need to ground the land ethic in ethical theory—which has been a reconstructive and problematic task for the philosophical interpreters of Leopold—and suggests, instead, that it emerges in Leopold's very effort to narrate his, professional, personal, and practical experience with nature. The involves examining the stories in terms of their emotional, logical and performative aspects. The result is an analysis that shows not only how these stories express normative claims, but also justify them. One conclusion of the analyses is that, in the narratives, there is less emphasis on the problematic notion of an over-arching "community" than in the prose pieces, and more emphasis on the metaphor of other living things as "fellow travelers" in the "odyssey of evolution." Second, the narratives take on an ironic attitude toward the ecological order, less discernable in the prose essays. The order itself may not be ethically admirable, but should be preserved since it makes possible any ethical relations within it. Thus, the narrative reading suggests some temperance to the usual holistic interpretation of his land ethic and its concomitant criticisms especially the charge of ecofacism. We should not take the land ethic imperative at its face value, in the sense that the good of the order itself is an intrinsic good. In the narratives, individuals are shown not merely to be means to the ecological whole,~<br>

Article Title: Reader and Text in the Horizon of Understanding Methodology: Gadamer and Methodological Hermeneutics<br>
Publisher: Higher Education Press and Springer<br>
Issue: i40014889<br>
Date: 9 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Lin Zhang<br>
Abstract: Judging Gadamer's theoretical stance is a complicated matter, and his ontological hermeneutics is usually regarded as a text-centered theory of understanding. Through an analysis of the phenomenological premises from which his theories take off, however, we can clearly see his reader-centric stance. On the basis of this stance some cease to seek for the original intention of the author or the original meaning of the text, which ineluctably leads to the ignorance of an understanding methodology. As far as people's intentional understanding is concerned, however, the important as well as essential task is still that of striving for a certain kind of understanding that is relatively correct, with universally effective methodology as its necessary prerequisite. What is more, herein lies the significance of the epistemology of hermeneutics. This article aims to re-insert a sense of methodology after hermeneutics went through a period of ontological reflection, and hence clarify that it is of necessity that hermeneutics resumes its text-centric methodological stance. /// 判定加达默尔的理论立场是一个复杂的问题。他的本体论诠释学一般被视为 一种文本中心论的理解理论，然而通过对他所从出发的现象学前提之分析，可以清 楚地看出他的读者中心论的立场.正是基于这一立场，放弃了对作者原意或文本原 义之诉求，必然导致对理解方法论的漠视。但是，就人们有意识的理解活动而言， 首要的以及根本的任务仍然是努力获得某种相对正确的理解，而普遍有效的方法论 就是其必要的前提，诠释学的认识论意义便在于此.在诠释学经历了本体论的反思 后，应重新注入一种方法论的意识，回到以文本为中心的方法论立场.<br>

Article Title: Organizing Visions for Information Technology and the Information Systems Executive Response<br>
Publisher: M. E. Sharpe<br>
Issue: i40018320<br>
Date: 7 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Swanson E. Burton<br>
Abstract: Making sense of new information technology (IT) and the many buzzwords associated with it is by no means an easy task for executives. Yet doing so is crucial to making good innovation decisions. This paper examines how information systems (IS) executives respond to what has been termed organizing visions for IT, grand ideas for applying IT, the presence of which is typically announced by much "buzz" and hyperbole. Developed and promulgated in the wider interorganizational community, organizing visions play a central role in driving the innovation adoption and diffusion process. Familiar and recent examples include electronic commerce, data warehousing, and enterprise systems. A key aspect of an organizing vision is that it has a career. That is, even as it helps shape how IS managers think about the future of application and practice in their field, the organizing vision undertakes its own struggle to achieve ascendancy in the community. The present research explores this struggle, specifically probing how IS executives respond to visions that are in different career stages. Employing field interviews and a survey, the study identifies four dimensions of executive response focusing on a vision's interpretability, plausibility, importance, and discontinuity. Taking a comparative approach, the study offers several grounded conjectures con-cerning the career dynamics of organizing visions. For the IS executive, the findings help point the way to a more proactive, systematic, and critical stance toward innovations that can place the executive in a better position to make informed adoption decisions.<br>

Author(s): Jorge Maria Manuel Araújo<br>
Abstract: O presente artigo pretende dar conta de alguns dos aspectos mais salientes da questão relativa à pertinência da Filosofia (especialmente na qualidade de Filosofia da Ciência) para a prática científica dos cientistas. Nesse sentido, a autora recorre sobretudo a exemplos vigentes nos finais do século xx, dando especial relevância a manifestações de "impaciência" por parte de alguns investigadores em relação a algumas críticas epistemológicas e éticas dos filósofos, sobretudo no que se refere à famosa controvérsia da "guerra das ciências" e a toda uma ofensiva cultural relativa a uma terceira cultura que apresenta os cientistas como sendo os novos humanistas e em que os "filósofos empíricos" estariam a perder peso. Como resposta, a autora propõe que, embora possam ser dispensáveis no laboratório, aos filósofos deve ser reconhecida a capacidade de disponibilizar às ciências uma linguagem que seja capaz de facilitar o diálogo cultural alargado, uma linguagem, portanto, de que as próprias ciências não se poderão dispensar se realmente quiserem sobreviver no âmbito da cultura do século XXI. /// The present article intends to give an account of some of the more relevant aspects pertaining to the question about the importance of Philosophy, and in particular Philosophy of Science, for the scientific work of scientists. The author of the article gives special attention to examples taken from the scientific landscape at the end of the xx Century, whereby special consideration is given to the impatience shown by some scientists in relation to some epistemological and ethical criticisms coming from the side of Philosophy. Particular attention is given to the famous "war of sciences" and the cultural offensive related to the introduction of a third culture in which the scientists are presented as the new humanists and in which even the "empirical philosophers" were losing weight. In that sense, the author suggests that, even though they might be of not much use in the laboratory,~<br>

Issue: i40019126<br>
Date: 4 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Margulis Mario<br>
Abstract: En este artículo se rescata la tradición crítica del concepto "Ideologia". Se le intenta definir tratando de superar los problemas que emanan de su polisemia y de su utilización desde el sentido común. Para definirlo, el autor inicia su análisis a partir del apartado sobre fetichismo de la mercancía en el primer volumen de El Capital de Marx. Partiendo de los efectos del fetichismo sobre los procesos de pensamiento y los códigos de la cultura en un sistema productor de mercancías, se exponen los efectos sociales de la reificación (Lukács y Goldmann) y los rasgos principales de los contenidos ideológicos presentes en los discursos. El autor considera que las luchas sociales por el poder y la dominación son paralelos con las pugnas por la construcción social del sentido. En esa línea, llega a definir ideologia como "las huellas dejadas por las luchas por la hegemonía en los códigos de la cultura". /// The critical tradition attending the concept of'ideology' is recovered by defining this term in a way to avoid the traps set by its many meanings and its common sense usage. The author grounds his analysis on the arguments about the fetishism of commodities in the first volume of Marx's Capital. Taking as his starting point the effects of fetishism on the processes of thought and cultural codes in a commodity-producing system, he explains the social effects of reification (Lukacs and Goldmann), and the main characteristics of ideological contents in discourses. The author considers that social struggles over power and domination run parallel to competing social constructions of meaning. He defines ideology as "the tracks left by the fights over hegemony in the codes of culture".<br>

Author(s): Hoeppe Götz<br>
Abstract: It is argued that to understand the Manus' construction of their environment their view of the night sky has to be taken into account. In Manus thought, celestial bodies and constellations were believed to reside at the edge of a saucer-shaped world, being able to permeate sea and sky and interact with the peoples' immediate environment. While only a small number of constellations had been named, these were sufficient to function as a calendar, a visualization of the seasonal cycle and a metaphorical explanation of the seasons. As such, they made the Manus world autonomous in the sense that the causes supposed to bring about seasonal change were situated within this world or at its edge.<br>

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i40020159<br>
Date: 7 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Mathuray Mark<br>
Abstract: This paper departs from and problematizes the almost exclusive focus in criticism of Ngugi's early works on Christianity and the effects of the colonial intrusion. Following Ngugi's exhortation to resume the broken dialogue with the gods of his people, Ngugi's early novels are read in relation to precolonial East African discourses and practices of prophecy, Gikuyu religion, and Gikuyu nationalist strategies that drew on different and opposing prophetic traditions, and, in a broader sense, discourses of religion in Africa. By locating his early work within the nexus of these discourses, a far more nuanced view of Ngugi's relation to religious and nationalist discourses emerges. This paper also attempts to uncover a symbolic geometry in Ngugi's novels determined by Gikuyu religious and cultural concepts. A focus on The River Between reveals certain authorial deployments of historical inaccuracies and dislocations in the interests of a schematization of the conflicts in the novel.<br>

Abstract: En este texto, el autor intenta esclarecer determinados aspectos del imaginario en relación con el Estado, la política, pero también en relación con la violencia y el mal, en un contexto en el que la dialéctica de la identidad y de la alteridad sigue siendo una de las estructuras del imaginario. El imaginario, más allá del ámbito exclusivo de las representaciones, actúa sobre el mundo y sobre la evolución de la historia. Pero el mundo también actúa sobre el imaginario y son los períodos de crisis los que amplían sus manifestaciones, destinadas a "a servir de pantalla contra los temores". En este sentido, la violencia, frente a la cual cabe adoptar actitudes diferentes, se convierte en un elemento simbólico para interpretar nuestras fuerzas. ¿Hasta qué punto estamos presenciando un nuevo modo de funcionamiento de los imaginarios políticos y religiosos? Para responder a esta pregunta, el autor habla de esperanza intercultural "en un mundo donde las voluntades de poder de lo trágico interfieren en los impulsos de lo comunicacional". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles? To answer this question, the author discusses intercultural hope "in a world in which the will of the power of the tragic interferes with communicational impulses."<br>

L'imaginaire, débordant le champ exclusif des représentations, agit sur le monde et sur le mouvement de l'histoire. Mais le monde agit aussi sur l'imaginaire et ce sont les périodes de crise qui amplifient ses manifestations, appelées à "faire écran contre les peurs". C'est dans ce sens que la violence, face à laquelle différentes attitudes sont possibles, devient un élément symbolique pour interpréter nos forces. Jusqu'à quel point est-on en train d'assister à un nouveau mode de fonctionnement des imaginaires politiques et religieux ? Pour répondre à cette question l'auteur parle d'espérance interculturelle "dans un monde où les volontés de puissance du tragique brouillent les élans du communicationnel". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles.

Abstract: Au moyen d'une analyse sémiotique de 14 entretiens réalisés auprès d'adolescentes à propos de la mode nous mettons en évidence les « bricolages » qui leur permettent d'élaborer des panoplies vestimentaires et de construire leur apparence et leur identité. Cette description permet de montrer que la consommation peut être considérée comme un processus de co-construction. Nous montrons les implications de ce travail vis-à-vis : de la construction de l'identité au travers de la consommation, la signification des objets de mode, des méthodes de recherche utilisées, des travaux sur l'expérience vécue des consommateurs, et des praticiens. Semiotics provides a useful base for interpreting 14 interviews with adolescents about fashion. Our analysis show the «bricolages» used by each participants to produce various looks and to develop a sense of personal identity. We suggest that our description is an example of consumption viewed as a co-construction process. Implications for previous works on personal identity and the meaning of fashion objects, research method, experiential aspects of consumption, and marketers are provided.<br>

Abstract: Les apports de Jean-Marie Floch au marketing sont nombreux. Cet article ne prétend nullement en rendre compte de façon exhaustive mais tâche plutôt de montrer combien les voies et pistes de recherche qu 'il a initiées ont été fructueuses pour l'ensemble de la communauté marketing et sont d'un recours très fréquent pour aborder les questions de signification. Comprendre le parcours generatif du sens, permettre l'analyse des récits de marque, inscrire dans le lieu de vente ou l'objet les attentes génériques des consommateurs, voici quelques unes des très précieuses idées développées par ce sémillant sémioticien. The contributions of Jean-Marie Floch to marketing are numerous. This paper does not pretend to cover exhaustively this domain but tries to show how the research avenues developed are fruitful for the entire marketing community and are frequently used in order to deal with questions that have to do with signification. Facilitating the understanding of the process of sense generation, allowing the analysis of brand stories, marketing through sales area designs or products the generic requirements of customers, those are some of the precious ideas developed by Floch.<br>

Publisher: Oral History Society<br>
Issue: i40028140<br>
Date: 4 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Gildea Robert<br>
Abstract: This paper is the text of an inaugural lecture given as Professor of Modern History in the University of Oxford on 7 November 2008. It arises from a research project entitled Around 1968: Activism, Networks, Trajectories', which involves a team of historians examining samples of activist networks in fourteen European countries, in order to understand ways of becoming an activist, being an activist and making sense of activism. The key terms of this project are transnationalism – tracing resonances and interactions between activists and activist networks across frontiers – and subjectivity – using oral testimony to understand the phenomenon of activism. The framing and presentation of the project incited a rethink of the methods of oral history, not least because the project originated in Oxford, where scepticism persists about the credibility of oral history as a discipline. To persuade this audience of the power of oral history, the approach was taken to locate it at the confluence of three recent developments which have impacted on the study of history as a whole: the linguistic turn, memory studies, and interest in subjectivity, intersubjectivity and the unconscious. These reflections are then used to illuminate evidence drawn from French activists interviewed in the course of 2007 and 2008.<br>

Abstract: L'article examine les conceptions de Foucault concernant l'histoire de la vérité, ainsi que les rapports entre la volonté de savoir, la volonté de vérité et les formes du pouvoir. Il rappelle comment les notions nietzschéennes de volonté de vérité et de volonté de puissance font place dans son oeuvre à la volonté de savoir comme instrument des rapports de domination. On examine ensuite comment la notion d'autorité, entendue à la fois au sens institutionnel et au sens discursif, peut permettre une sociologisation des approches traditionnelles de la vérité, élaborées par les philosophes. Comment la visée de vérité du discours s'est-elle combinée historiquement avec la volonté de savoir des institutions ? Y a-t-il différents régimes de vérité, liés à des modalités de discours différentes, mais aussi à des formes d'autorité institutionnelle ? Est-il possible de construire une généalogie des figures de l'autorité discursive ? The paper examines Foucaultian views about the history of truth, as well as the relationships between the will to truth and the different forms of power. It reminds how Nietzsche's conceptions about the will to truth and the will to power are replaced in Foucault's work by the will to truth as a means of power relationships. The paper looks furthermore at the possibility of using the notion of authority, understood both in the institutional and in the discursive sense, as a tool for a sociologization of traditional approaches to truth, constructed by philosophers. How did the pursuit of truth historically combine with the will to knowledge belonging to the institutions ? Are there different regimes of truth, tied to different discursive modalities, as well as to institutional forms of authority ? Is it possible to construct a genealogy of figures of discursive authority ?<br>

Abstract: Lately, the concept of experience, which postmodernist theoreticians declared dead, has seen renaissance. The immediacy of experience seems to offer the possibility of reaching beyond linguistic discourses. In their attempt to overcome the "linguistic turn," scholars such as Ankersmit, Gumbrecht, and Runia pit experience against narrative. This paper takes up the recent interest in experience, but argues against the opposition to narrative into which experience tends to be cast. The relation between experience and narrative is more complex than is widely assumed. Besides representing and giving shape to experience, narratives are received in the form of a (reception) experience. Through their temporal structure, narratives are crucial to letting us re-experience the past as well as to representing the experiences of historical agents. This potential of narrative is nicely illustrated by Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War in which "side-shadowing" devices restore history's experientiality. Through "side-shadowing," narrative can challenge the tendency toward teleologies inherent in merely retrospective histories and can re-create the openness intrinsic to the past when it still was a present. However, the "side-shadowing" devices used by Thucydides are fictional. To conceptualize the price and gain of "side-shadowing" in historiography, the paper advances the concept of a "narrative reference" (a concept analogous to Ricoeur's "metaphorical reference"). Introspection, speeches, and other "side-shadowing" devices sacrifice truth in a positivist sense, but permit a second-level reference, namely to history's experientiality. In a final step, the paper turns toward modern historians—most of whom are reluctant to use the means of fiction—to briefly survey their attempts at restoring the openness of the past.<br>

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: Several representatives of structuralism relate the concept of structure to the langue of Ferdinand de Saussure. And so a linguistic approximation to structuralism seems possible. Such an approximation makes sense for another reason : because of the growing importance of transformational linguistics and the criticism of structuralism expressed by Noam Chomsky. In this article the main ideas of de Saussure and Chomsky are analysed, resulting in the confrontation of langue (de Saussure) and competence (Chomsky). Chomsky's criticism of langue as "a store of concepts" seems to be correct. The relevance of this criticism for the central structuralist topic that individual man, his freedom and his history are of minor importance, is pointed out.<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutical philosophy as developed by Heidegger and Gadamer is not compatible with the classical phenomenological programme elaborated by Husserl. The hermeneutical stress on historicity as a necessary condition for understanding is unfamiliar to Husserl's strictly theoretical approach. However, this does not mean that a hermeneutical philosophy as such cannot be conceived in a phenomenological sense. Whether or not hermeneutical philosophy is phenomenological depends on the paradigm chosen for hermeneutical explanation. A hermeneutics referring to the interpretation of texts may elucidate constitutional elements of phenomenology, e.g. phenomenological reduction and reflection. In this way it even can initiate a modification of phenomenology which, instead of being caught up in its subjective foundation, now appears as elucidating the openness of the correlation between intentional attitudes and their 'objects'. For this correlation the interpretation is a paradigm, whereas the openness of the correlation can be explained in respect of freedom, language, and time.<br>

Abstract: Ever since Plato the identity of philosophy has been at issue in the quarrel between philosophy and poetry. Can changing times alter the identity of philosophy, and simultaneously the identity of poetry? In the Republic poetry is a third rate illusion compared with contemplation of "the things that truly are". We can trace the background of this disqualification when we distinguish three levels in the relation of language to reality. 1. We can distinguish assertion, melody and rhythm. The first is the same in poetry and prose, the last is superfluous. 2. Speech is superior to writing in virtue of the speaker's inner mastery over himself. 3. The interiorizing move culminates in the soundless conversation of the soul with itself, contemplating the eternal identical "without the stain of speech or sign" (Boutens). For Plato, then, we move from poetry to prose, from prose to speech, from speech to silence. Is there room for aesthetics in this view? In the second part of my lecture I reconstruct Symbolism, a current in literature that in every respect is the opposite of Platonism. Although the goal is the same — the search for true reality — the difference is that the route is now reversed. I restrict myself to the French branch. 4. Baudelaire formulated the basic principle of Symbolism: the ineffable does not exist. "The ultimate goal of the universe is to be expressed" (Valéry). The same worldview is expressed later by Gadamer: an ontology "guided by language". 5. The second principle is that the primary language is script, "Book" (Mallarmé). 6. Poetry proves to be the true language. The music (rhyme, rhytm, tune) reveals the things "exactly as they are" (Wallace Stevens). In poetry the linguistic sign becomes a symbol because the sound, the physical aspect of the linguistic sign, plays a role in the production of meaning. A poem is a "sustained hesitation between sense and sound" (Valéry). Is sound not however a disturbing factor in revealing the things 'as they are'?~<br>

Abstract: Le rapport entre « conscience » et « identité » forme l'un des deux versants de la conception lockienne du sujet (l'autre étant constitué par la « propriété de soi-même »). La théorie lockienne repose sur la distinction du « mental » et du « verbal », et l'isolement du premier comme élément de la vérité. Elle suppose une reformulation du principe d'identité sous la forme d'une double négation inhérente à l'esprit (Mind) : il est impossible que l'homme ne sache pas qu'il pense, ou pense sans penser. Enfin elle caractérise comme « intériorité » la différentielle de perception et de réflexion qui opère tout au long de l'expérience. Dès lors le temps intérieur peut être intellectuellement et moralement ressaisi dans l'unité de la « conscience de soi ». Consciousness and Personal Identity form together one half of Locke's theory of the Subject (the other half being « self-ownership »). First of all, « mental » and « verbal » propositions (viz. truths) must be clearly distinguished. The principle of identity has to be reformulated in logico-psychological terms, as a double negation: it is impossible for the Mind to think, without knowing that it thinks. Finally the difference of perception and reflexion, which operates throughout « experience », is called an « internal sense » or interiority. As a consequence, Locke was able to call « self-consciousness » the typical unity of morality and understanding which forms the internal « duration » of the Mind.<br>

Abstract: In When Species Meet (2008) Donna Haraway proposes that creatures' identities and affinities emerge through their encounters, their relationships. Following Haraway's lead, I attend to how different species sense and apprehend one another, leaving impressions—concrescences of perceptual data, or texture. This essay reports on fieldwork alongside marine biologists and with a population of cup corals (B. elegans) housed at the Long Marine Laboratory, Santa Cruz, California. While I assisted researchers who were studying metabolic rates and reproductive strategies in coral communities, these cup corals simultaneously taught me that being and sensing are inextricably enfolded. We were variously situated—corals generating generations, me interpretations. We met through a material-semiotic apparatus I call "fingeryeyes." As an act of sensuous manifesting, fingeryeyes offers a queer reading of how making sense and sensual meaning are produced through determinable and permeable species boundaries.<br>

Abstract: Début 1936, X., haut dirigeant de l'État-Parti, pressentant peut-être une disgrâce prochaine qui le conduira à la mort en 1937, s'exile en écriture. Pour autant, l'analyse proposée de son journal ne s'attache pas à décrire cette lente descente aux enfers qu'ont connue d'innombrables citoyens soviétiques au cours de cette histoire désorbitée. Elle tente de discerner divers « noeuds », lestés de paradoxes et sans doute constitutifs de la période : comment l'(il) logique de la Terreur peut être l'objet d'une appropriation par sa future victime ; comment cette même Terreur, via une déstructuration temporelle imposée à l'individu, lui dicte des formes narratives de soi ; et comment, ce faisant, l'individu en question est susceptible de reconquérir un « je ». In early 1936, probably sensing the eventual disgrace which caused his demise in 1937, an anonymous top party leader retreated into writing. The present analysis of this man's journal does not address the slow descent into hell experienced by so many Soviet citizens in those times gone mad. Rather it aims at discerning various predicaments laden with paradoxes and undoubtedly constituent of the period: how a future victim internalizes the (il) logic of Terror; how Terror dictates narrative forms of the self by causing a disruption of the individual's awareness of time; and how, in the process, the individual in question is likely to recover his sense of self.<br>

Author(s): Barber Michael<br>
Abstract: Dorion Cairns correctly interprets the preconstituted stratum of Edmund Husserl's Fifth Cartesian Meditation to be the primordial ego and not the social world, as was thought by Alfred Schutz, who considered Husserl to be insufficiently attentive to the social world's hold upon us. Following Cairns's interpretation, which involves recovering and reconstructing strata that may never exist independently, one better understands how the transfer of sense "animate organism" involves automatic association, or somatic apprehension. This sense-transfer extends to any animate organism, not just humans, and draws on extensive unreflected-upon similarities despite the distinctive fact that the other's body is never given to oneself as is one's own. Following Cairns's interpretation, one can also understand the second epoché as an imaginative, reconstructive abstraction rather than as an example of failed ascesis. Consequently, Husserl appears as less intellectualized in his approach to empathy than often thought to be and more confident in the phenomenologist's capacity to imagine and attend selectively to experience.<br>

Author(s): Lenclud Gérard<br>
Abstract: Les auteurs rappellent quelques-unes des difficultés soulevées par la notion de blasphème, ballotté entre un fonctionnement de régime juridique et comminatoire dans la tradition chrétienne et une acception de sens commun liée au précédent. Les remarques qu'ils posent n'entendent pas porter directement sur le « blasphème » (ce qu'il faudrait entendre, savoir ou penser sous ce terme), mais plutôt sur les moyens d'en parler, sur les opérations conceptuelles mises en oeuvre pour qui se propose de l'aborder du point de vue des sciences humaines et sociales. The authors underline some of the difficulties raised by blasphemy, a notion hesitating between its function in a judicial and comminatory sense, in the Christian tradition, and a common sense acceptation, linked to this. The author's remarks do not bear directly on « blasphemy » , on what is to be understood by the term, what we can know or think about it, but rather on the ways of talking about it, on the conceptual operations to be implemented by those who propose to deal with blasphemy from the point of view of the human and social sciences.<br>

Les résultats obtenus sont cumulables avec deux conceptualisations différentes : servir d'étalon pour mesurer la « réalité sociale » (l'émission et/ou la réception) ; ou attribuer au « sens » la valeur de condition de possibilité de la réalité sociale. The challenge take up by the LUCIOLE group is to demonstrate the heuristic interest of the observation of the materiality of symbolic forms. The posters of the French presidential election campaign of 1988 provided us with our study corpus. We have described these posters as mixed materials of a complex and heterogeneous nature. We describe the cognitive, symbolic, interactive and inter textual operations which allow for the construction and co-construction of the significations materialised in the posters. The results obtained may be added to those of two different conceptualisations. They may serve as benchmarks to measure « social reality » (its emission and/or reception) or, alternatively, give the « sense » of the poster a value as a condition for a possible social reality.<br>

Abstract: In the last one hundred and fifty years, in human and social sciences and especially in geography, there was a dialectic parallelism between the positivist and humanist paradigms. The formers putted its accent in the objectivity and the quantitative methodology and the humanistic in the subjectivity and hermeneutics, with significant influence of Marxist philosophy. Nowadays, emergences of epistemological anarchism attack heavily the search of scientific truth. In consequence, is shaping up a new dichotomy of geography: we ought to pursue social ethics or we ought to pursue scientific ethic. In Latin America, where geographical science can contribute actively to reach the so desired sustainable development, to take position in the sense of the objectivity and the scientific truth, should be the way to a leading role for the geographers in matter of territorial arrangement. En los últimos 150 años, en las ciencias humanas y sociales y especialmente en la geografía, hubo un paralelismo dialéctico entre los paradigmas positivistas y los humanistas. Los primeros pusieron su acento en la objetividad y los métodos cuantitativos, y los humanistas en la subjetividad y la hermenéutica, con significativa influencía de la filosofía marxista. Actualmente, el surgimiento del anarquismo epistemológico ataca fuertemente la búsqueda de la verdad científica. En consecuencia, está tomando forma una nueva dicotomía de la geografía: debemos perseguir una ética social o debemos perseguir una ética científica. En América Latina, donde la ciencia geográfica puede contribuir activamente a alcanzar el tan deseado desarrollo sustentable, tomar posición en el sentido de la objetividad y de la verdad científica debería ser el camino hacia un rol protagónico para los geógrafos en materia de ordenamiento territorial.<br>

Abstract: Traditional sources of sociohistorical data capture only a narrow sense of past lifeworlds. Ethnographic accounts often preserve greater details of social practice but have less clear guidelines for use as data. We evaluate the use of hermeneutical theory as providing guidelines for a method by which ethnographies may be used as sociohistorical data. Hermeneutical analysis of ethnographic "texts" is used to reconstruct patterns of daily life in early-twentieth-century rural Appalachia. This method involves: (1) concept-critique to separate observations from the theoretical framework of the ethnographic account, and (2) validation through a logic of internal consistency and comparison. Through hermeneutical analysis, ethnographics can be made to yield observations of social relations not otherwise available. Our analysis suggests benefits and drawbacks of hermeneutical analysis of ethnographic texts.<br>

Abstract: Penser la nature du procédé de genèse du sens au moyen de l'analogie devient possible lorsque cette notion est envisagée dans la perspective critique modelée par la philosophie kantienne. Saisir comment s'effectue le passage de l'aspect formel à celui, événementiel, du sens, sur le mode du comme si, permet plus précisément d'envisager les enjeux du problème posé par les conditions d'élaboration, mais aussi de mise en œuvre d'un sens commun qui renvoie jusqu'aux perspectives propres au domaine de l'esthétique et du politique. Thinking the nature of the process of genesis of meaning through analogy becomes liable when the latter notion is understood within the critical perspective shapened through Kantian philosophy. Grasping how the passage from the formal to the eventful aspect of meaning on the as if mode enables one to understand more precisely the stakes of the problem set by the conditions of elaboration but also the erection of a common sense referring all the way to the specific perspectives of the aesthetic and political field.<br>

Abstract: This paper looks at how "official" memories are produced in state-sponsored public spaces and how a multi-ethnic, multicultural north-east India responded to it. Official memory sites like museums, monuments and memorials not only reflected but also shaped ethnic relations to a great extent. The emerging states in the region have assiduously favoured the historical imagination of a politically dominant community, which is masculine, and remains persistently insensitive to the marginal "others" in the state. This, on the one hand, encouraged the dominant community to assimilate and thereby produced ethnonationalism around that notion of shared pasts. On the other, it generated a sense of neglect in the minorities who responded with vernacular memorials to embody their historical imagination and likewise developed their own ethnic nationalism around it. This parallel rise to prominence of often competing ethnonationalisms within the region, or sometime within the state, has thereby produced violent forms of contestation often dangerously imbued with fissiparous tendencies.<br>

Abstract: Que ce soit à l'IUFM ou à l'Université en Sciences de l'Éducation, les enseignants sont de plus en plus confrontés à la diversité des expériences des parcours de formation des étudiants à qui ils s'adressent. Cette pluralité n'impose-t-elle pas un changement des pratiques de formation et notamment le développement, dans les groupes de travail, d'une communication favorisant la symbiose des divers apports culturels de ces étudiants ? L'utilisation des biographies ou des histoires de vie en formation ne peut-elle pas permettre d'instrumenter ce travail et notamment faciliter la prise en compte des itinéraires individuels de formation ? The students are more specifically invited to meditate on the development of their curriculum. The building of their formative biography creates the mental space that is needed to question the ideas and notions which will allow them to use biography as an instrument to identify the mental representations as well as the events and situations of their life from which the individual, collective, social and cultural dimensions of their activities emerged. In this sense, this research and training shows that formative life history can allow us to distance ourselves from a priori assumptions, as well as introduce students to different methods of research.<br>

Abstract: L'alternance entre les trois pôles de la formation (auto-hétéro-oïko) présente dans les pratiques de formation alternée (variété des situations d'apprentissage et des acteurs) renvoie à la différenciation des trois personnes pronominales (je-tu-il) du langage courant et s'inscrit dans l'épistémologie ternaire de la sémiotique initiée par Peirce. L'intelligence pratique et rusée (la métis des Grecs), repérée chez des artisans grâce à l'expression régionale « le biais du gars », met en scène une logique ouverte où transduction et abduction s'articulent à déduction et induction. Une « raison expérientielle » , dialogique, écologique, à visée éthique, est ainsi forgée. C'est une rationalité pratique cherchant à actualiser le potentiel de la situation. Elle est empreinte de sagesse et de « prudence » en action, au sens d'Aristote (phronésis). L'éc(h)oformation qui émerge de cette raison expérientielle, de ce regard interactionnel, est indissociable de la boucle étrange entre deux autres raisons : la raison sensible et la raison formelle, entre spontanéité et habitude. The tripolar concept of training (auto-hetero-oïko), foundation of alternating courses practice (with multiple learning situations and actors), draws us back to the differenciation between the three main persons singular (I, You, He) expressed in common language as the compound epistemology of semiotics put forward by Peirce... Practical intelligence (close to the "metis" of the Greeks) can be noticed among craftsmen when they refer to the "biais du gars" bespeaking an open logic where transduction and abduction are linked to deduction and induction. A constructive reasoning, interactive ans ecological, with ethical objectives, is created. It's a practical rationality aiming at actualizing the potentiality of the situation and marked by sagaciy and prudence in action in the Aristotelian sense (phronesis). The "ec(h)otraining" emerging from the wisdom of experience, this interactive vision of things is neces~<br>

Author(s): Zerubavel Pablo<br>
Abstract: On the U.S.-Mexican border, the label "Mexican" refers simultaneously to both nationality and ethnicity. Playing with the multiple meanings of the word, border actors construct narratives about themselves and Others to deal with a local hegemonic discourse that states that "poverty is Mexican." Thus, while border identities are constructed within a culturally specific system of classification, people also develop a sense of themselves as subjects by imagining themselves as protagonists in stories. To know border narratives is important because people generally act according to how they understand their place in any number of social relations whose meaning is narratively constructed.<br>

Author(s): Wiley Douglas<br>
Abstract: This article argues for a synthesis of George Herbert Mead's conception of the temporal and intersubjective nature of the self with Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory of narrative identity. Combining the insights of Ricoeur's philosophical analysis with Mead's social-psychological orientation provides a subtle, sophisticated, and potent explanation of self-identity. A narrative conception of identity implies that subjectivity is neither a philosophical illusion nor an impermeable substance. Rather, a narrative identity provides a subjective sense of self-continuity as it symbolically integrates the events of lived experience in the plot of the story a person tells about his or her life. The utility of this conception of identity is illustrated through a rereading of Erving Goffman's study of the experience of mental patients. This example underlines the social sources of the self-concept and the role of power and politics in the construction of narrative identities.<br>

Abstract: O artigo tem por objectivo mostrar até que ponto o princípio de subjectividade presente na Escola Austríaca de Economia se revela fundamentado na tradição fenomenològica de Edmund Husserl e no seu pensamento acerca da constituição intersubjectiva do mundo da vida. Nesse sentido, o autor propõe uma hermenêutica realista, e não relativista, posicionando-se em função de um projecto mais global de fundamentar na hermenêutica algumas das principais posições da Escola Austríaca de Economia, pelo que o artigo propõe significativas pistas para uma releitura não só da praxeologia de Ludwig von Mises e da ordem espontânea de que fala Friedrich von Hayek, mas também da noção de middle ground proposta por Israel Kirzner e, não menos, de toda a temática relacionada com a empresarialidade. Por outro lado, posicionando-se numa perspectiva de superação da dialéctica entre teoria e história, entre "a priori" e "a posteriori", o artigo representa também uma chamada de atenção para a importância que deveria ter o estudo do pensamento de Edmund Husserl no âmbito das Ciências Sociais. This article aims in the first place at demonstrating how Edmund Husserl's idea of the intersubjective constitution of the life-world represents an appropriate explanation of the principle of subjectivity inherent to the theorizing of the Austrian School of Economics. In order to do this, the author proposes a realistic and non-relativistic view of hermeneutics, whereby his goal is precisely to demonstrate how much the Austrian School of Economics is grounded in hermeneutics. In this sense, the article suggests a new reading of Ludwig von Mises's praxeology, of Friedrich von Hayek's theory of the spontaneous order and a reinterpretation of Israel Kirzner's middle ground position and the corresponding theory of alertness. Positioning itself beyond the discussion between theory and history, or the debate if the prevalence should belong to the "a priori" or to the "a posteriori", the article suggests that Hus~<br>

Abstract: Richard Rorty uses Nietzsche to show that people need to create themselves because there is no foundationalist language which they can establish as an anchor. Although this perspective is Nietzschean, it is not Jamesian, and so Rorty misappropriates James when he conflates James and Nietzsche as like-minded progenitors of the mythologizing of a privileged vocabulary. This essay evaluates Rorty's reading of James by considering whether truth in Rorty's textualist sense can abide by the stream of thought. Although James does mythologize privileged vocabularies, he believes that words need to reflect the world more accurately (something Rorty would never say) by abiding by the flux of experience. As such, James recognizes the value that old words have as tools. Whereas Rorty shows disdain for old words, James shows us the cash value those words have in helping us to do anything from paying our bills to constructing more practical and effective theories.<br>

Abstract: Theodore Abel belonged before Talcott Parsons to the pioneers of "Weberians"' kind in America. In his Systematic Sociology in Germany the first systematic exposure of Max Weber's ideas in English appeared. Abel was the first to use Verstehen and Verstehende Soziologie in English literature. Abel also pioneered the research on the Nazi phenomenon. The manifestations of nazism and communist totalitarianism in the 20th century put the sociological theory and methodology to a critical test. Examining Abel's work as a case study, it is possible to see more clearly the ethical and methodological problems of the humanistic sociology—the "understanding" or interpretative one. The sense and implications of understanding in sociology still require greater clarity in order to better understand the understanding. Abel's diary sheds light on the methodological problems of his understanding research of nazism. The source of danger and ethical dilemmas of that discipline lies in the tradition of understanding sociology and Weber's method of ideal types connected with the principle of freedom from valuation. Also in that very tradition there are beginnings for development of its rightful cause and vocation. Provided, just like in Znaniecki's concept of humanistic coefficient, not only meanings but also valuations and social sentiments given in people's experience are taken into account. Full understanding cannot imply complete tolerance if meanings and values of individuals and groups are coupled with hate and other hostile feelings. Social feelings—hate and love (altruism)— constitute a sociologist's axiological system of negative and positive reference.<br>

Abstract: The themes of connectedness and continuity, which are also mathematical properties, have run like a red thread through the last fifty years of History and Theory, notably in the theory of the narration of action in history. In this essay I review various answers to the question of the driving force that motivates action and that propels a sequence, continuous or discontinuous. These answers underpin narrative strategies intended to solve the problem of human agency and thereby to provide the basis for historical narratives. I argue that both continuous and discontinuous conceptions of history have to do with the restrictive concept of trajectory. Most of our familiar concepts such as trajectory, equilibrium, optimum, probability, and sensitivity to initial conditions are taken from mathematics and physics, but how well adapted are they to dealing with the time of actors, whose actions are intermingled with uncertainty? I shall present alternative concepts of dynamics, ones that no longer lead toward just one particular future or that reflect a single past. On this basis I suggest reorganizing our view of historical time along the principles of maintenance, acquisition, and victory. Historical sources trace back not to one story or one process that is plausible or that appeals to common sense, but to a whole family of processes. From the past, we can obtain sets of constraints that circumscribe sets of stories rather than a single scenario. I shall then propose a topology of the time of action based on my alternative conception of dynamics, a topology made of what I call viability kernels, capture basins, and victory domains.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i388289<br>
Date: 9 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Wilson Neil<br>
Abstract: This essay challenges those strains of contemporary social theory that regard romantic/sexual intimacy as a premier site of detraditionalization in the late modern era. Striking changes have occurred in intimacy and family life over the last half-century, but the notion of detraditionalization as currently formulated does not capture them very well. With the goal of achieving a more refined understanding, the article proposes a distinction between "regulative" and "meaning-constitutive" traditions. The former involve threats of exclusion from various moral communities; the latter involve linguistic and cultural frameworks within which sense is made of the world. Focusing on the U.S. case and marshaling various kinds of empirical evidence, the article argues that while the regulative tradition of what it terms lifelong, internally stratified marriage has declined in strength in recent years, the image of the form of couplehood inscribed in this regulative tradition continues to function as a hegemonic ideal in many American intimate relationships. Intimacy in the United States also remains beholden to the tradition of romantic love. That these meaning-constitutive traditions continue to play a central role in structuring contemporary intimacy suggests that detraditionalization involves the relative decline only of certain regulative traditions, a point that calls into question some of the normative assessments that often accompany the detraditionalization thesis.<br>

Author(s): Cadiot Pierre<br>
Abstract: Predicative Metaphor (e.g. Max is a lion) is commonly construed as a problem of conceptual rupture in a cognitive framework, even if many philosophers and semanticists have already criticized this view. This text aims at showing that, for explaining why such predications are usual, grammatical and, in some sense, coherent, we need a internally much more flexible conception both of lexical and grammatical (the predication) meanings. They should not be confused with an unique (categorial) dimension, but should integrate an open "motif" stratum, anticipating and mixing up all possible "thematic" instantiations of the meaning. This is both a linguistic and philosophical matter.<br>

Abstract: The tradition of linguistics has reduced rhetoric to tropes. Until now, it has defined figurative sense as a deviation from proper or literal sense, thus highlighting ontological concerns typical of western metaphysics. For descriptive semantics, the trope problem becomes the problem of interpretative paths, ruled by perceptive and hermeneutical constraints. These paths allow the building of semantic shapes and backgrounds.<br>

Author(s): Longhi Julien<br>
Abstract: We analyse the French noun livre « book » according to an argumentative conception of language. A summary is presented of the theories of Anscombre (Theory of stereotypes) and of Carel and Ducrot (Theory of semantic blocks), which are used to reveal the argumentative dimensions of livre. Argumentation is argued to derive from a common sense system (Sarfati) leading to the ascription of doxa in language governed by a topohbased device, which corresponds to discursive object. Semiotisation is supported by phenomenological processes: the Indexicality of meaning (Lebas 1999, Cadiot and Visetti 2001) is concerned at the Linguistic level with the construction of semantic forms along three dimensions of meaning, known in the Theory of semantic forms as motifs, profiles, and themes. The contributions of the discursive levels to the constitution of a semantic form are raised in view of the phenomenon of lexical anticipation. What we call "inserted motifs" reveals the genericity of Discursive Formations. In the course of "profiling", these motifs constitute a pre-syntactic zone of stabilisation. The "doxic profiles" allows the construction of topoï by thematisation.<br>

Author(s): Simonett Helena<br>
Abstract: Although today much of the Mayo-Yoreme sacred myths and their inherent symbolism is rather esoteric knowledge, known to a few only, the community's performance of the responso (ritual of honoring the dead) is important for the re-establishment of relationships between humans and the supernatural beings and between living persons and the ancestors. The communal experience of the responso and the sense of beingenjoined are characteristic of the spiritual experience and fundamental to the musical experience as well Since life/death of any individual is an experience tied to other individuals, I argue that a philosophical inquiry of selfhood—of both the individual and the community—may help us reason about and make possible an understanding of the responso.<br>

Abstract: Critics have pointed out that in many contemporary cities wasteful modes of consumption, encouraged and facilitated by fantastic developments in technology, have significantly eroded the values of the traditional urban environment. Contemporary cities very often lack the sense of placeness, vibrant public life, and harmonious relationship between man and nature characteristic of the traditional urban environment. This article studies how the configuration of the physical boundary may be used as an important tool to reconstitute these values in contemporary cities. It suggests that the boundary is more than an abstract pattern of lines. Rather, it is integral to life within the city, and should possess greater significance in the design of the built environment.<br>

Abstract: No encadeamento de oito temas analisam-se tensões e aporias (no sentido mais platónico que aristotélico) inerentes à compreensão filosófica da obra de arte. (1) Quem compreende melhor a essência da arte, o filósofo ou o artista? Noutros termos, qual o papel da razão na compreensão da arte? (2) A arte permanece na procura do belo ou rege-se hoje apenas pela busca de expressão do artista? (3) Mas então será o artista um ser de exceção? (4) Por sua vez, esta questão leva à distinção entre a forma e o conteúdo da obra de arte. (5) O "conteúdo" da obra remete para o problema da "finalidade" da obra. (6) Na linha da finalidade surge a função central da arte, isto é, a fruição pela "trans-figuração" do mundo. Na esteira desta função abrem-se tres problemas, brevemente evocados: (7) a dimensão social e política da arte; (8) os êxitos facéis e os fracassos da arte, assim como (9) o eventual esgotamento da arte na atitude estética. In lacing together eight themes, the article analyzes tensions and aporias (more in the Platonic sense than the Aristotelian) inherent in the philosophical understanding of a work of art. (1) Who best understands the essence of art, the philosopher or the artist? Otherwise said, what is the role of reason in the understanding of art? (2) Does art reside in the search of the beautiful, or does it orient itself today by the artists expression? (3) What makes an artist an exceptional human being? (4) This leads us to the distinction between form and content in a work of art. (5) The "content" of a work refers to its finality. (6) In the line of finality, the central function of art appears, i.e., the fruition through the "trans-figuration" of the world. In the wake of this function, three problems are briefly presented: (7) the social and political dimension of art; (8) the easy successes and failures of art, as well as (9) the eventual emptying of art in aesthetic attitude.<br>

Abstract: La « petite éthique » que déploie Ricœur dans Soi-même comme un autre se distingue par le fait qu'elle rend justice à l'individu, à l'autre et à la communauté tout à la fois. C'est ainsi que le problème de la distribution des biens sociaux se révèle fondamental. Ricœur essaie de le résoudre à partir d'une synthèse de considérations téléologiques et déontologiques dans laquelle l'approche de Rawls occupe une position centrale. D'un côté, la tentative de résoudre le problème dans le cadre d'une approche téléologique appelle le recours aux principes de justice qu'établit Rawls à l'aide d'une procédure formelle, de l'autre, la position rawlsienne dépend d'un nombre de présuppositions téléologiques qui ne sont pas compatibles avec son approche déontologique. Ricœur ne poursuit pas simplement le but de réfuter Rawls, il propose plutôt d'interpréter ses principes de justice comme résultat d'une rationalisation d'un sens de justice préalable. The « minor ethics » which Ricœur develops in Soi-même comme un autre is distinctive in its way of applying justice to the individual, the other and the community all at the same time. For this reason the problem of distribution of social goods is fundamental. Ricœur attempts to resolve this problem through a synthesis of teleological and deontological considerations, and here the approach of Rawls occupies a central place. On one hand, the attempt to solve this problem in the framework of a teleological approach draws on principles of justice which Rawls establishes through formal procedure ; on the other hand, Rawls' position depends on a number of teleological presuppositions which are not compatible with his deontological approach. Ricœur does not only attempt to refute Rawls, but to interpret his principles of justice as the result of a rationalisation of a sense of justice which is simply presupposed.<br>

Abstract: Cette réflexion s'inscrit dans l'héritage de Paul Ricœur, à la recherche d'une philosophie de la traduction. Langage, langues, traduction entrant dans le jeu du processus de la constitution du sens, la traduction devient le moment privilégié d'une reconstruction de l'unité plurielle du discours humain et ouvre la voie à une éthique de l'hospitalité langagière et de la convivialité. Le don de la langue et des langues introduit un élément de gratuité qui corrige l'obsession contemporaine pour la marchandisation généralisée des mondes vitaux et laisse entrevoir un possible fondement non violent du lien social dans une perspective de solidarité et de sollicitude pour les personnes concrètes. Je propose d'établir une relation entre le don des langues en tant qu'élément constitutif de la communauté des parlants et la dette de l'hospitalité langagière impliquant une forme de responsabilité envers les autres à la fois spécifique et exemplaire. Au don gratuit de la langue et des langues qui nous permet d'accéder au monde et de nous rencontrer avec autrui, en réalisant entièrement nous-mêmes, correspond la dette d'exercer et de développer notre humanité dans le langage et à travers le langage. This study reflects on the philosophy of translation in light of the heritage of Paul Ricœur. Language, languages and translation all belong to the process of constitution of sense and here translation is of particular importance for the reconstitution of the plurality of human discourse in its unity and opens the way to an ethics of linguistic hospitality and sociability. The gift of language and of languages introduces an element of gratuity to correct the contemporary obsession with the general commercialization of the life world and suggests a possible non-violent foundation for the social bond in the perspective of solidarity and sollicitude for concrete persons. I propose to establish a relation between the gift of languages as a constitutive element of the community of speakers a~<br>

Abstract: Needs Theory (NT) has been a corner stone for conflict resolution scholarship (CRS) as it was conceived by John Burton and other pioneers of the field. Intuitively, NT makes sense. There are fundamental needs that all human beings have that if violated may cause conflict. Indeed only those conflicts that are due to the violation of such needs can truly be deep-rooted (versus disputes). However, the structural foundations for NT are still not firmly established for a variety of reasons. Psychoanalysis and critical theory help us to understand and establish the various factors that go into constituting needs, in part by critiquing the positivistic framework that has heretofore been primarily utilized in NT scholarship<br>

Abstract: This article suggests that by analyzing vernacular narratives of a community through a qualitative rhetoric approach, we can attempt to understand the social construction of community in unique ways. Vernacular narratives often operate independent of, and even in opposition to, formal definitions put forward in official rhetorics about a particular community. I analyze a collection of vernacular narratives about a Rocky Mountain resort community to explore how a particular group of "locals" make sense of their highly transient community. By discussing how narratives of personal experience can translate into both collective conceptions of community and individual processes of identification, I seek to reveal how both vernacular and formal narratives of community formation can expose and reveal the taken-for-granted ways in which a particular "community" may (in)advertently be open (or closed) to changing as its members change.<br>

Author(s): Wilson Henrik<br>
Abstract: A theory of the embodiment of action is proposed. Reflections on relations between human intentions, the human body and the notion of agency lead us to argue that phenomenological analysis is not sufficient for such a theory. Our consideration, that the most fundamental level of embodied agency is that of life itself, brings us to the philosophy of biology and the theory of the organism: briefly, certain parts of the natural environment are intrinsic to the constitution of organisms and, in their more sophisticated configuration, as agents. Action is embodied in the sense that certain physiological processes are internal in relation to it and play a constitutive role in its performance. The way in which environment, context and consciousness affect and constitute the nature of agency at personal and sub-personal levels is elaborated. We see that human agents perceive and act upon their world through a complex shifting between those levels. A summary of the ways in which the social sciences can be enriched by this more comprehensive view of human agency provides the basis of justification for claiming Actor-Network Theory (ANT), originally developed by sociologists studying science and technology, as a promising framework for the continuation of this reasoning.<br>

Abstract: The study ’The meaning of action, the action of meaning’ raises the theoretical question of the relationship between the intent and meaning, the self-referentiality and referentiality of the literary text. It sets out from the hypothesis that a literary text has not only a self-referential, but also a referential character. Unlike non-literary texts whose function is their intent, the referentiality of a literary text is open. The ambiguity and polysemy of the text then results from the non-obviousness of reality itself. The concept that captures this difference between literary texts and texts with other functions is that of meaning. The study uses the concrete example of the thematicisation of the metamorphosis of a puppet, a monster or an animal into a man in Kleist, Collodi and Grass to illustrate the difference between mechanical intent founded upon efficiency and living meaning, founded on ambiguity and non-functional complexity. An analysis of Pavel Vilikovský’s novel Kôn na poschodí, slepec vo Vrábroch (’Horse Upstairs, Blind Man in Vráble’) shows how, in its thematic, ostentatiously self-referential action, meaning is born as an expression of the polysemic re fe re n tia lity of the text. The analy sis shows that behind this self-referentiality the text is also created in the referential action of meaning to such an extent that it is precisely the open action of meaning which becomes the r » on-obvious sense of the action of the text.<br>

Abstract: This study represents a Chapter from a section devoted to the composition of a literary work and is part of a larger project called ‘The Poetics of a Work of Literature in the Twentieth Century’, which is being undertaken by the Theory Department of the Institute of Czech Literature. The fragment and fragmentariness in a twentieth-century literary work are a manifestation of a marked tendency towards discontinuity or in some cases towards continuity of a certain kind. There exist works of art that for various reasons remain fragments without, however, being preceived as such (the novels of Kafka and Ladislav Klíma’s Velký román, are cases in point); on the other hand, the fragment, that is to say an intentional fragment (such as a sketch or a synopsis), becomes an independent genre whose roots go back to Romanticism (for instance Novalis’s fragment). The fragment and fragmentarieness that manifests itself in the text in the widest possible number of ways (intentional incompleteness and sporadicity, ‘blank spots’ in the Story, the mixing of heterogeneous elements, the alternating of various genres within one work, and so on), we understand as a reaction to the idea about the work as a complete, inlernally unified and accomplished whole with a clear and single Sense, an idea that Classicism molleyeoddled, which was then to a large exient done by Realism and with it all so-called decadent literature (including tendencious, Socialist-Realist literature). The fragment and fragmentariness (with which is linked the idea of a sense that continuously defies being pinned down to any one definition, which follows from its quality of not being fully told, from suggestion, hints, silence, gaps and ‘ holes’) are, in the literature of the twentieth century, perceived as both a genre and also as approaches that can express the open nature of being and of the world better than the whole work can. Because fragmentary works often represent a work in a nascent state or in a state of tr~<br>

Abstract: The article traces distinet approaches to the concepts of 'meaning', 'reference' and 'sense' in twentieth-century literary theory and general semioties. It offers an account of different concepts of 'mimesis', 'reference', and 'representation' from the point of view of fictional world making as well as from the point of reading a narrative. The article focuses on the tension between mimesis and diegesis, as coined by Plato and Aristotle, and it interprets concepts developed in recent times by scholars such as Jakobson, Quine, Ricoeur, Eco and de Man. Distinet sections of the article focus on the following: the referential function of proper names and the two contrasting approaches of Kripke and Linsky; the contrast between mimesis and diegesis as a functional reference to the world of experience in Ricoeur; the correspondence and truth conditions in Strawson and Davidson; the emphasis on coherence as a way of eliminating mimesis and reference in Eco’s semiotics; the radical elimination of both the reference and the signified in deconstruction; the issue of textual re-presentation. The article attempts to illustrate the thesis that by accepting intentional, inside-of-the-text produced concepts of meaning the reader and the critic would eventually loos not only ali the ties to the actual world but also the impulses for reading and interpreting.<br>

Abstract: In the late twentieth century two conceptions of text in a literary work followed from the original distinction between Sinn (smysl, sense) and Bedeutung (význam, reference), which was made by Gottlob Frege in 1892 - namely, those of Wolfgang Iser and Paul Ricoeur. For us, they are interesting for their direct or indirect affinity to Czech Structuralism. The article presents a detailed comparison of the two conceptions: Iser's 'act of reading', culminating in the 'play of the text', and Ricoeur's proposal of 'productive reference', which heads towards the references (Bedeutungen) of a world that is irmagined, without actually being, and announces itself through the creative power of language. The article concludes by returning to the question of the game and reference in the work of Iser and Eugene Fink. Play and art guard the vitality of sense.<br>

Abstract: The article is concerned with the foundation of figurative sense (FS) by metaphorization, as well as on the operation of FS. The author emphasizes the directive function of domains, which substitutes metaphorical seeing for „seeing" and determines an aspect proper to FS. The essential component of FS is not grasping, but is the aesthetic experience of the distance between ordinary vision and the new vision. Distance is surmounted by a stream of images that implement FS. By displaying this stream, FS merges with daydreaming, but much more with the play of accidental connections. In addition to metaphorization, FS is sometimes based on placing statements out of logical space. The author argues against a unilateral interpretation of correlations between the metaphorical statement and its context. He provides examples to demonstrate the diversification of this correlation and its impact on the foundation of FS.<br>

Abstract: S'il déclame contre les deux principes qui sont ceux de Descartes, Sartre se réclame pourtant de lui. Sans doute n'est-il pas à un paradoxe près. Reste qu'il nous faudra ne pas l'être moins pour expliquer le sien. Car certes, le sens du texte qu'il intitule « La liberté cartésienne » et qui articule ce volume de morceaux choisis qu'est Descartes 1596-1650 confère quelque cohérence à cet apparent non-sens. Mais une fois présenté de cette oeuvre le paratexte, il nous faudra affirmer non seulement que celle-ci se lit avant L'être et le néant quoiqu'elle ait été publiée après, mais, plus encore, qu'elle est un ensemble d'écrits de Descartes sur Sartre quoiqu'elle soit un écrit de Sartre sur Descartes. C'est qu'outre l'analyse sartrienne des analyses cartésiennes de la Méditation quatrième, on y trouve une psychanalyse existentielle par l'auteur de son devancier, à l'occasion de laquelle a lieu non pas un transfert, mais un contre-transfert. Although Sartre denounces Descartes' two principles, he nevertheless draws inspiration from him. No doubt this is close to being paradoxical; we shall have to be no less paradoxical in our explanation. For although the text entitled "Cartesian Freedom," which introduces a volume of selections from Descartes, Descartes 1596Ί650, confers some coherence on this apparent non-sense, once the texts surrounding this work have been taken into account, we have to conclude not only that this text predates Beinjj and Nothingness, even though it was published afterwards, but that it is a collection of Descartes' writings on Sartre, even though it is a writing by Sartre on Descartes. For beyond the Sartrean analysis of the Cartesian analyses of the Fourth Meditation, we find Sartre's existential psychoanalysis of his predecessor, in which takes place not a transference, but a counter-transference.<br>

Author(s): Ezzy Douglas<br>
Abstract: Two central unresolved problems in labour process theory are the disjuncture between structure and agency and the problem of what constitutes 'good' work. This paper argues that a hermeneutic conception of the self as constructed through narrative provides a resolution to these two issues. Hermeneutics conceptualises the self as neither a solitary entity impervious to the influence of others, nor as a mere reflection of objective structures or 'discourses of power'. Rather, in the process of self-interpretation a person uses socially learnt cultural discourses to construct and reconstruct a coherent sense of narrative-identity. Substantive illustrations are drawn from labour process theory, recent developments in management theory, and some more general studies of the meaning of working.<br>

Author(s): Gordon Paul<br>
Abstract: Largely due to Benveniste's dismissal ("Language in Freudian Theory," 1951), Freud's review essay of the philologist Karl Abel's "Über den Gegensinn der Urworte" ("On the Antithetical Sense of Primary Words") has been ignored or slighted by most critics of Freud's thought, even those influenced by Lacan's linguistic emphasis. Nonetheless, the essay on "primary antithetical meaning" (Ur-worte) should be of great importance for psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic approaches to art, for it explicitly addresses Freud's persistent identification of the unconscious with antithetical modes of thought. Benveniste's positivist dismissal is relevant to psychoanalysis in general (Freud's theories of bisexuality, Lutschen, and castration fear) and psychoanalytic studies of art in particular (Freud's essays on the "uncanny" in E. T. A. Hoffmann, Friedrich Hebbel's "Judith und Holofernes," Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, and so on.).<br>

Author(s): Christoff Daniel<br>
Abstract: La signe comme expression (Husserl) consiste selon F. de Saussure dans le rapport immotivé signifíant-signifíé, sa valeur signifiante étant déterminée par la place du signifiant dans le système réel de la langue tandis que le signifié-concept (de Saussure) est noème, irréel (Husserl). Inerte tant qu'aucun acte d'expression ou de compréhension ne l'anime (ré-anime), il porte, exprime et induit l'intentionnalité de ces actes; il est conscience hors de soi, intentionnalité sans sujet, visée du signifié différenciée par son signifiant (objet d'une science de faits, la linguistique). Aussi les problèmes du «sujet», de l' «origine», de la «suffisance» du signe adéquat, de l'«insuffisance» du signe qui, en son ouverture, exprime au-delà de lui-même, exigent-ils l'élucidation du champ de signification, notamment des figures métonymiques ou métaphoriques qui y apparaissent. According to F. de Saussure a sign or an expression (Husserl) is constituted by the unmotivated relation between the signifier and the signified, the value of the signifier is determined by the position it occupies in the real system of language, while the signified concept (de Saussure) is a noema, i.e. unreal (Husserl). Inactive, as long as there is no act of expression or understanding to (re) activate it, the concept carries the intentionality of these acts, conveys it and leads us to it. It constitutes a consciousness outside of the self, an intentionality without a subject, a target of the signified, as differentiated by the signifier (the object of a science, the linguistics). In this sense the solution to the problems concerning the «subject», the «origin», the «sufficiency» of an adequate sign, the «insufficiency» of a sign, when it signifies things other than itself, requires the clarification of the idea of a field of meaning, especially the meaning of occurring metonymies and metaphors. Das Zeichen als Ausdruck (Husserl) besteht nach F. de Saussure in der unmotivierten Beziehung Bezeichnendes-~<br>

Abstract: Voulant résoudre l'énigme de la connaissance, Husserl est aux prises, dans Expérience et Jugement, avec la genèse transcendantale des formes predicatives. Celles-ci renvoient à la structure de l'expérience sensible dans sa double dimension : passive et active. C'est activement que le sujet percevant saisit et « détaille » un objet perçu en ses moments déterminants (ex.« une boule sphérique et rouge »). Au cours de l'expérience sensible se constituent des « types » qui rendent possible la reconnaissance d'un objet sous telle ou telle catégorie. Sur ce trajet, non exempt de seuils à franchir, qui va du « sens » perçu à la signification langagière, nous essayons de montrer quelle place pourrait être assignée à la nomination dans une perspective husserlienne. In his attempt to resolve the enigma of knowledge, in Experience and Judgement Husserl undertakes the task of describing the transcendantal genesis of the predicative forms. These forms refer back to the structures of receptivity with its two dimensions, passive and active. The perceiver actively grasps and « details » the perceived object in its determining moments (parts or qualities : « spherical », « red » ...). Throughout sensible experience « types » and « typical structures » are constituted, which make possible the recognition of an objet under this or that category. On the way, not without crossing certain thresholds, going from the perceived « sense » to the linguistically expressed meaning, we try to show which place may be assigned to naming within the framework of an Husserlian phenomenology.<br>

Abstract: L'ontologie heideggérienne de l'être-pour-la-mort a souvent servi de référence négative à Paul Ricoeur. Il lui a très tôt opposé trois thèses qu'il n'aurait peut-être pas formulées s'il n'avait pas croisé la philosophie de Jaspers: a) « La naissance signifie plus que la mort » ; b) « la rencontre décisive avec la mort est la mort de l'être aimé » ; c) « la mortalité elle-même doit être pensée sub specie vitae et non sub specie mortis ». La première thèse conditionne les deux suivantes. Elle introduit une phénoménologie de l' « être-envie » qui en appelle de la vie reçue à la vie transmise. On objectera peut-être que la phénoménologie de l'être-en-vie suppose l'ontologie de l'être-pour-la-mort. Mais, même si c'était le cas, elle n'en transformerait pas moins profondément la signification. La compréhension de l'existence est affectée elle-même par les phénomènes de la vie reçue et transmise. C'est ce que veut dire cette expression: « exister vivant ». L'angoisse de la fin n'annule pas la joie des commencements. Peut-être même reçoit-elle de celle-ci son sens. Paul Ricoeur has often referred to Heidegger's ontology of being-towards-death to oppose it. He early set against it three thesis that he might have formulated differently had he not studied Jasper's philosophy : a) « birth means more than death » ; b) « the decisive encounter with death is the death of the loved one » ; c) « mortality itself must be thought sub specie vitae, not sub specie mortis ». From the first thesis, can be inferred the two others. It brings in a phenomenology of being-alive. One may raise the objection that the phenomenology of being-alive presupposes the ontology of being-towards-death. But even so it would be necessarily transform its meaning. The understanding of existence is itself affected by the phenomena of life as given and received. Such is the meaning of the phrase: « existing alive ». The distress of the end never cancels the joy of the beginnings. It may even get its sense from~<br>

Abstract: The problem being dealt with in this paper is whether a text has only one legitimate meaning, or no meaning at all. The question becomes even more acute when the contexts of sender and receiver are different. Polysemy and ambiguity are well-known obstacles to communication on the level of the word. The necessity of a general semiotic theory is stressed, and explains the difference between denotation and connotation. The functionality of metaphor in biblical language points to the interpretive value of polyvalency. The impression of unlimited indeterminacy created by the recent emphasis on the active role of the reader, is in a sense misleading since author and reader function as a textual strategy. On the other hand, the actualization of the textual expression as the content of the text by applying the various codes and subcodes, implies a continuous interaction between intensional and extensional approaches. In this respect topics, thematics, ideological and world structures are operative. Since interpretation and application are not to be separated in a pragmatic context, as is the case with the text of the Bible, there inevitably remains the possibility of multiple interpretations due to the interpreting and applying of the text of the Bible in a concrete situation. Yet this interpretation and appropriation should always be done as comprehension of the text and in continuity with the tradition.<br>

Abstract: The author of the article in question reports on a study analysing how 15 year-old French lycée pupils interpret school texts about the representation of the Norman kings of Sicily in the 12th century, the latter of whom allowed themselves to be portrayed both as Byzantine emperors and as Muslim caliphs. Ever since Moscovic's theory of social representation, we know that people make sense of specialized knowledge (in this case, historical knowledge) by converting it into "naïve", everyday knowledge. As pupils generally cannot explain the political intentions of the kings of Sicily, the lycée pupils were asked – as part of the study – to deal with the assertions of a paper (written by another pupil) that compared the Norman kingdom of Sicily and the situation of Maghrebine immigrants in presentday France. The study takes a closer look at how the learners, in the course of the "spiral-shaped" learning process, first acquired a "naïve" picture of the kings of Sicily, only later to distance themselves from their original thoughts in order to be able to make sense of their school texts. Der Autor des vorliegenden Artikels berichtet über eine Untersuchung, die analysiert, wie 15-jährige französische Gymnasiasten Schulmaterialen über die Repräsentationen der normannischen Könige von Sizilien im 12. Jahrhundert interpretieren. Letztere ließen sich sowohl als byzantinische Kaiser wie auch als muslimische Kalifen darstellen. Seit Moscovicis Theorie der sozialen Repräsentationen wissen wir, dass Menschen Fachwissen (hier historischem Wissen) einen Sinn geben, indem sie es in ein „naives" Alltagswissen verwandeln. Da Schüler im Allgemeinen die politischen Intentionen der Könige von Sizilien nicht erklären können, wurden im Rahmen dieser Untersuchung Gymnasiasten aufgefordert, sich mit einer schriftlichen Schülerarbeit zu befassen, die das normannische Königreich von Sizilien und die Situation maghrebinischer Einwanderer im heutigen Frankreich vergleicht.

Abstract: Since the Kantian revolution, metaphysical knowledge has been articulated by influential theologians in the language of analogy. In accordance with this tradition, the metaphor found in Luke-Acts, that God does live in houses, but not houses built by men, is explored by studying it as a root metaphor. A root metaphor in the theological sense can be defined as the most basic assumption we can make about man's existence and experience. In this article John H Elliott's proposal that 'temple' and 'household' in Luke-Acts articulate a contrast in social institutions is debated. I wish to argue that this 'contrast' does not really articulate a shift in social institutions, but rather a broadening of an existing social institution as the result of a changed symbolic universe. This shift in symbolic universe is studied against the backdrop of a tendency to broaden the temple as a theological symbol which had already started and which intensified during the Second temple period. It is shown that the temple, its sacrificial offerings and purifying rituals, were closely associated with the household, its meals and purifying ceremonies. Jesus also advocated the broadening of the concept temple/household. His view is reportedly conveyed by Stephen, Peter, James, and Paul.<br>

Abstract: The present methodological debate about the need for a particular theological perspective when researching on the subject of contemporary church history raises central issues about the question of the validity of theology as a subject for scientific investigations. On the one hand, we should seek to avoid any dualtrack approach which would question the whole notion claimed by theologians to be advancing the cause of truth in a scientific manner. On the other hand, theology is a "thorn in the flesh" for the world of scholarship, since it seeks to guarantee openness as a central maxim in scholarly research, and to oppose any reductionist tendency which would pervert the secular methods of scholarly work by advancing the monopolistic claim of a systematic, ideological atheism. The right of theologians to propose their own special approach to theological questions should not be based on abstract principle, but is better defended-drawing on the researches of Itopper, Ricoeur and Marrou-as being in accordance with man's sinful nature and pragmatically meaningful. Drawing a distinction between the discovery of knowledge and assessment of its meaning can lead to a positive evaluation of experiences and their various connections. Any examination of experience, from a theological or ecclesiastical point of view, should not therefore be dismissed as illegitimate. Rather, it can add a valuable dimension in producing new horizons and perspectives. Of course, any such theological endeavour will still be subject to the rigorous disciplines of interdisciplinary discourse. Church history, as well as contemporary church history, is therefore in some ways competing with other historical disciplines. They are all attempting to make sense out of the welter of events by means of a theoretical ordering of experience. As such they provide a desirable, but by no means an exclusive, method of guiding men and women in their on-going search for insights into the nature of the world, man and Go~<br>

Abstract: Giuseppe Capograssi (1889-1956) was an important legal philosopher and had a lively influence on the development of legal studies. The centre of his reflections lay in his many investigations into the concept of experience, which aimed to supersede the prevalent orientation in Italy, focussed on vertexes, emphasizing instead the importance of practices, both on the theoretical level and in the analysis of legal activity and political reality. Capograssi therefore paid great attention to the relationship between state and society viewed in a dynamic and pluralist perspective. No less illuminating are Capograssi's investigations into the value of the constitution and the principle of legality. During the Fascist period, Capograssi upheld the values of individual liberty and democratic principles, seeing as indispensable the continual involvement of citizens in the development of political action. This perspective played a further, particularly important role in the "ideas of Capograssi", after the war and the advent of the republican legal order. According to Capograssi, more space needed to be given to social life and to the spiritual links on which political community is based. In this sense, Capograssi found the teachings of Catholicism fundamental. His Catholicism placed great emphasis on freedom and solidarity and contained a lively, underlying sense of the cultural and spiritual, inspired by the ideal of "charity".<br>

Abstract: L'article identifie une tension dans la représentation hayékienne des règles de droit. Alors qu'elles jouent une fonction essentielle dans la coordination au sein de l'ordre spontané en définissant les attentes légitimes des agents, Hayek ne développe pas réellement les mécanismes par lesquels émerge une interprétation partagée des règles. D'abord, les fonctions des règles de droit au sein de l'ordre spontané sont présentées. Puis nous montrons que les règles sont constituées par les attentes que les agents forment à leur propos. Enfin, nous montrons qu'aucun des deux mécanismes proposés par Hayek -le sens de la justice et le juge -n'est capable de garantir la résolution des conflits d'interprétation entre les individus. De tels conflits mettent en question l'efficacité et la justice de l'ordre spontané. The article focuses on a tension in the Hayekian representation of legal rules. While rules perform an essential function of coordination by providing common interpretation about the legitimate expectations, Hayek does not really develop the mechanisms by which common interpretations may emerge. Firstly, the functions of coordination of rules are presented. We show then that rules are constituted by individual meanings. Finally we show none of the two mechanisms producing shared interpretations, the sense of justice and the judge, is able to guarantee the resolution of conflicts of interpretation between individuals. Such a conflict questions therefore spontaneous order's efficiency and justice.<br>

Abstract: Le sentiment identitaire est souvent considéré comme l'un des critères essentiels permettant d'apprécier les liens que les jeunes issus de l'immigration entretiennent avec la France et le pays de leurs parents. À partir de résultats d'études quantitatives et d'une enquête de terrain auprès de jeunes étrangers nés en France, cet article se propose de montrer que les déclarations en matière de sentiment identitaire constituent un indicateur inadéquat pour appréhender ce lien. Cet indicateur est en effet non seulement réducteur, les liens tissés avec un pays ne pouvant être cernés par quelques questions simples sur le sentiment d'identité, mais aussi inconsistant. Le sentiment identitaire est en effet faiblement investi et variable suivant les situations. Dès lors, les réponses obtenues n'ont pas grande signification. A sense of identity is often considered one of the defining aspects of immigrant children's ties to France and to their parents' native country. Based on the results of quantitative studies and a field survey of immigrant children born in France, this article endeavours to show that declarations of a sense of ethnic identity are in fact an inadequate indicator of their national ties. Indeed, not only is this indicator reductionist, as their affective attachment to a country cannot be assessed by means of a few simple questions about their feelings of identity, but it also proves inconsistent. The sense of identity turns out to be tenuous and variable according to the respondent's situation. Consequently, the responses to such questions are of no great significance.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo procura alcançar uma reflexão conceptual na qual, a Filosofia Hermenêutica pode ser instituída como fundamento da Filosofía do Direito e do fenómeno jurídico e, consequentemente, como uma base para futuros desenvolvimentos da actual Filosofia Hermenêutica do Direito, de forma a poder ser alternativa ao Direito Natural e ao Positivismo Legal. Por conseguinte, um conceito chave a ser abordado é o de "ser com", visto que a situação do Mundo promove o surgimento do Direito no seu encontro com outro "ser com". Assim, a relação jurídica ficaria sustentada pela hermenêutica, a partir do conceito central de significado, enquanto profundidade e plenitude do ser jurídico, no qual a sua possibilidade de valorização é estabelecida como sentido de justiça. Assim, a Filosofia Hermenêutica do Direito providenciaria um retorno à ética, à luz do que juridicamente lhe diz respeito, de significados abertos à renovação, permitindo uma maneira de mudar a ideia estática de Filosofia do Direito, porque a justificação não assenta nos conteúdos morais, mas no sentido do ser. This article seeks to achieve a conceptual reflection in which Hermeneutical Philosophy can be established as a foundation for Philosophy of Law and the legal phenomenon, and, thus, as a ground for future developments in the current Hermeneutics Philosophy of Law that can be alternative to Natural Law and Legal Positivism, giving answers to common problems. Consequently, a key concept to be addressed in this article is "be with", since the situation in the world fosters the emergence of Law in its encounter with another "be with". Thus, the legal relationship would be sustained by hermeneutics, from the central concept of meaning as deepness and fullness of juridical being, in which m the possibility of its valuation is established as a sense of justice. So, the Hermeneutics Philosophy of Law would provide a return to ethics, in view of what juridically concerns it, with meanings opened to renovation, allowi~<br>

Abstract: In Arendt's interrogations of political modernity, the concepts of history and politics have an ambiguous relation. On the one hand, she insisted that the performative character of politics as action was bound to its narrative aspect as remembrance. She was also a fervent proponent of integrating the historical sense into political understanding. On the other hand, Arendt characterized the modern historical sensibility from the point of view of politics as a "ghastly absurdity," and asserted that the political thought of our times needed to free itself both "from history" and "from thinking in historical terms." This paper explores the different meanings that Arendt granted to "history" as a (anti) political force and to historical sensibility as the basis for political understanding. It argues that not only were Arendt's rejection of the modern concept of history and its politics of history central for her critique, but that it was one of the key concerns that shaped the articulation of her own theory of action. The paper also examines the problem against the background of the intellectual tradition of Arendt's youth and in particular its uncompromising antihistoricism.<br>

Abstract: The ability of Christian discourse to give people a sense of their identity sustains the concrete church. The cultural revolt of the 1960s which suddenly weakened the power of discursive Christianity in Britain may be partially explained in terms of the deterritorializing power of capitalism. In the context of this deterritorialization the formation of self-identity becomes more difficult and strong religious identities have a new appeal. Post liberal theologians have endorsed the identity-forming power of the church. But Christian identity must still be worked out in relation to what lies beyond the borders of the church. Christians rediscover their own foundational story in the acts and deeds of others. Theological formation should involve not only an immersion in the Christian tradition but also the search for what recognisably shares in the same project that the gospel defines. The history of personalism suggests what this search might look like in practice.<br>

Abstract: The renewal of a dialog between landscape design and garden history demands a renewal of the questions and methods of garden history. This essay studies how garden reception and garden creation interact. It considers three main issues: first, it explores the domain of cultural expectations framing the engagement with a garden shared by users and creators at a given time—the poetical texture of gardens; second, the role of garden creation in exploiting, expanding or subverting this shared frame of expectations; and third, it proposes an approach—garden pragmatic—to study the broader interactions between garden creation and reception on the one hand, and social and cultural change on the other. The question of intersubjectivity—how do we share our sense and experiences of the world with others, and how do we transform them—is at the root of all the little stories—the fragments of a poetic of gardens—that propose new directions for garden history. Many of these stories have been presented during the last 15 years at symposia at Dumbarton Oaks where the author is presently the director of Garden and Landscape Studies. The general philosophy however had never been presented until the Fall 2004 when he published his "Essais de Poétique des Jardins." They were never made explicit at Dumbarton Oaks where each story only played its part in the theme of the symposium. Yet the whole course of ideas presented here results from these many exchanges with other scholars. This is why many footnotes make explicit references to their works. So, following the lead offered by this text or choosing a personal route, each reader may access many different voices that make garden history at present into a lively resource for pondering about the role of landscape creation in a multicultural world. These fragments of history are written to stimulate the designer's imagination, not to outline the course landscape design should follow.<br>

Abstract: The article of Elzbieta Wolicka is consecrated to the consideration of the phenomenon of time taken in the contexts of individual human experience, contemporary cultural situation and Christian faith. The starting point of the 1st part of the article is the fragment of Confessiones (ch. XI) of St. Augustine and the short parable of Franz Kafka entitled HE. The author of the article brings to the light the dialogical basis of the human perception of time and raises up the quaestion of "a hidden sabotage of trust" which is characteristic to the social relations of our times. This is also the one among many other factors of the so called "crisis of culture" (mal du siècle). The crisis consists of a feeling of a threat, a burden of the past and a fear of the future. The 2nd part of the article is concerned with the analysis of the eschatological meaning of some words of Christ in the Gospel of St. John (4, 23; 5, 25-29; 12, 13; 12, 27, 31). They reveal the Christian sense of the human temporal condition in the light of "the economy of salvation" and the dialogue between a believer and God. A catastrophic thrill, a feeling of existential paradox, a blockage of communication - the symptoms of the crisis of cultural conscience - could be described as "the edipse of God" (M. Buber) or "the abandonment of God" (J. Ellul) in the contemporary world. The Gospel points out that in the heart of human temporal experience there is still existing conversatio sacra and the presence of God in our history is actual.<br>

Abstract: A religião é uma enorme projeção de significações humanas. Estas projeções convertem-se, para os seus produtores, na forma de uma realidade de ordem transcendente. De acordo com Peter L. Berger a alienaçāo religiosa é antropologicamente necessária. A partir da fenomenologia da religiāo, cosmos sacralizado em que se constitui toda e qualquer concepçāo do mundo, faz da religiāo um âmbito de estudo para elucidar os mecanismos complexos de sentido e significado da vida humana. Rudolf Otto e Mircea Eliade sāo os fenomenólogos que mais influenciaram o pensamento de Peter L. Berger. Religion is largely a projection of human meanings. These projections are converted in the form of a reality of transcendent order back to their very authors. According to Peter L. Berger religious alienation is anthropologically necessary. From the Phenomenology of Religion, the sacralized cosmos in which any conception of the world is formed makes religion a field study to elucidate the complex mechanisms of sense and meaning of the human life. Rudolf Otto and Mircea Eliade are the phenomenologists that most influenced the thought of Peter L. Berger.<br>

Abstract: A célebre afirmaçāo de Nietzsche acerca da morte de Deus corre, hoje em dia, o risco de se tornar num lugar comum incapaz de alcançar o seu profundo significado. No entanto, o evento anunciado pelo filósofo alemāo - de um mundo e de urna cultura sem Deus - começa a ser uma realidade nas sociedades ocidentais, ditas pós-modernas. De facto, como assinala Joseph Ratzinger, as sociedades hodiernas parecem organizar-se cada vez mais corno se Deus não existisse. Neste contexto, procurarei mostrar como o evento de um mundo sem Deus constituí urna oportunidade para o cristianismo ressurgir de um modo mais autêntico. Em primeiro lugar, irei analisar a afirmação nietzschiana Gott ist to" na complexidade da sua obra. De seguida, irei comparar a morte de Deus em Nietzsche com os conceitos de ateísmo crìstão e de crìstianismo num mundo adulto em Bonhoeffer, detectando semelhanças e contrastes entre ambos. Por firn, tentarei mostrar como a proposta bonhoefferiana se torna mais inteligível quando se procura realizar o moderno ideal de autenticidade, adoptando alguns argumentos de Charles Taylor. The well-known Nietzsche's statement about the death of God risks, nowadays, to become a common place whose deeply sense is difficult to grasp. Nevertheless, the event the German philosopher proclaimed - that is, a world and a culture without God - starts to have place in the contemporary Western societies, called post-modern. As Joseph Ratzinger argues, the contemporary societies seem to be organized more and more as if God did not exist. In this context, I will show how this event could be an opportunity for Christianity be lived in a more authentic way. First, I will analyse Nietzsche's affirmation Gott ist tot in the complexity of his work. Then, I will compare Nietzsche's death of God with Bonhoeffer s concepts of a Christian atheism and a Christianity in an adult world, highlighting similarities and differences between them. At the end, I will try to argue that the bonhoefferian prop~<br>

Author(s): THURN DAVID H.<br>
Abstract: Tamburlaine's insistence on making his audience see his sovereign power is a means by which he can organize and control alterity by fixing himself in specular relation to his objects. As the palpable reflections of his identity, Tamburlaine's sights of power produce effects of dramatic literalization by which he can maintain his unified and stable position as sole emperor: the play orders its field of vision by constructing an imaginary subject in fixed relation to its objects. The play, to the extent that it posits stable links between a subject and its images, and between signifiers and signifieds generally, creates a delusional space in which absolute sovereignty becomes possible. The effects of sovereignty, however, continue to define not only the theatrical space of the play, but the space of interpretation as well: critics have tried to account for the contest between aspiration and limitation in Tamburlaine by invoking concepts of theme, genre, character, and author in order to make sense of and therefore stabilize the play's conflicting gestures. Like Tamburlaine, the critic constructs an imaginary space by creating objects in relation to which he can confirm his own unity and power. Tamburlaine thus becomes a figure for the claims of sovereignty that mark all acts of interpretation.<br>

Article Title: Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Dual Economy of Recognition<br>
Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138215<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Voelz Johannes<br>
Abstract: Combining a historical with a theoretical perspective, this essay begins by reconstructing Ralph Waldo Emerson's evolving theory of recognition and the central role it played for his concept of 'self-reliance.' Initially having adopted the theorizations of recognition developed by Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, Emerson came to articulate the idea of self-reliance by way of developing an alternative approach to recognition, in which the source allocating recognition is neither society nor an inborn moral sense, but rather the transcendentally conceptualized self. Emerson's shift towards self-recognition poses questions seldom asked in the contemporary debate on recognition. Moving beyond a reconstructive aim, one such question is considered in the article's second part: What role does recognition come to play in the act of reading? Taking Emerson's own essays as a case in point, the author argues that the aesthetic experience afforded by non-fictional texts can be understood as a facilitator of self-recognition—as a continuous process of imaginarily experiencing the enlargement of the self. This process intersects with dynamics of social recognition, producing a 'dual economy of recognition.' The article concludes by challenging the assumption found in currently dominant paradigms of recognition which assumes that recognition can come to successful completion. Conceived as a dual economy, the article argues, recognition is to the contrary constitutively open-ended.<br>

Abstract: Ethnomethodology captures ordinary events in ways that retain their dynamic and collaborative character. Ethnomethodologists identify people's methods for developing a practical objectivity that can render their local affairs meaningful and orderly, and they closely scrutinize the local details of mundane affairs in order to describe how a local cohort of cooperating parties concert themselves in providing an intelligibility for their social interaction, local work that is naturally occurring and depends upon the reflexive character of any emerging sense.<br>

Abstract: A metafísica aristotélica não considera o ser enquanto ser em si mesmo, mas enquanto símbolo daquilo que é simultaneamente o mais universal e o mais singular para o espírito. Platão antecipou a concepção propondo uma dialéctica ascendente, completada por uma dialéctica descendente, cuja dinâmica fora objecto de pesquisa nas suas últimas obras. A metafísica encontra-se na intersecção destas duas dialécticas, no eixo em que a primeira passa na outra. Este eixo começa a fazer sentido a partir do saber que o pensamento tem de si mesmo. A mentalidade representativa, desatenta à especificidade deste eixo, não consegue aceder à dimensão dos caminhos da razão. O eixo no coração das dialécticas clássicas é assumido pela metafísica contemporânea em termos de tempo associado com o espírito vivo em detrimento do ser conceptual. Aristotelian metaphysics does not consider being qua being in itself, but rather as a symbol of what is, for the spirit, at once the most universal and the most particular. Plato had anticipated the conception, the dynamic of which had been the object of investigation in his last works. Metaphysics finds itself at the intersection of these two dialectics, at the axis around which the first passes into the other. The axis takes its sense from the knowledge that thought has of itself. The mentality, based on representation, inattentive to the specificity of this axis, does not have access to the amplitude of the paths that reason can take. The axis at the heart of classic dialectics is taken up by contemporary metaphysics in terms of time associated with the living spirit rather than as conceptual being.<br>

Abstract: The idea/metaphor of the world as a text, essential to the so called linguistic turn of human and social sciences, has a long intellectual history which originates, from the very beginning of Christianity, in Saint Paul's assertion of the presence of a double sense (literal and spiritual) in the Old Testament. Starting from this point, the present paper sets out to describe the development and consolidation of the tradition of Biblical exegesis and hermeneutics which in the 20th century gave rise to a variety of schools and trends that in one way or another maintain the fundamental thesis that reality is a text that is to be deciphered. The article also highlights that the original Christian sources did generate two other lines of intellectual tradition: a more temperate exegetical tradition prevailing in the Catholic world, and furthermore the current Western cultural belief that world is like a book (a belief which kept the terms of the comparison separated and did not confuse them).<br>

Abstract: Drawing upon recent developments in epistemology, this work attempts to advance the argument against the use of the medical model in psychology and psychotherapy. This model constitutes a culturally hegemonic interpretation that is epistemologically inadequate and that is an obstacle to the process of psychological change, both outside and within the context of the therapeutic relationship. Phenomena currently interpreted as "psychiatric disorders" can more adequately and constructively be made sense of with the use of categories derived from the cultural understanding of the processes of growth and education. It is proposed that widespread problems of life are not symptoms of an epidemic of mental illness but signs that humanity is involved in a process of evolution.<br>

Publisher: Dalloz<br>
Issue: i40158547<br>
Date: 10 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Ythier Jean Mercier<br>
Abstract: Benevolence is the humanist virtue par excellence. Influential veil-of-ignorance theories of justice, issuing from the main streams of the humanist ethics of the Enlightenment, exclude benevolence from the short list of individual motives from which they derive their norms of justice. These norms of justice are built from hypothetical preferences of individuals, while the institutions of distributive justice in real-life democracies express, rely on, or are derived from individuals' actual preferences. Democratically implementable norms of justice should be derived from individuals' actual preferences and from suitable norms of deliberation and communication in and through collective action. They are norms of benevolent justice, in the sense that they rely significantly on the altruistic motives of individuals. Contemporary welfare states are interpreted as practical achievements of such a norm of benevolent justice within the distributive liberal social contract. La bienveillance est la vertu humaniste par excellence. D'importantes théories de la justice « sous le voile d'ignorance », issues des principaux courants de l'éthique humaniste des Lumières, excluent la bienveillance de la liste des raisons et motifs individuels sur lesquels elles fondent leurs normes de justice. Ces normes de justice sont construites sur la base de préférences hypothétiques des individus, alors que les institutions de justice distributive des démocraties reposent, dans la réalité pratique de ces systèmes politiques, sur les préférences effectives des individus. Nous défendons l'idée que les normes de justice, pour être applicables en démocratie, doivent reposer sur les préférences effectives des citoyens, s'exprimant dans le cadre d'un fonctionnement politique obéissant à des normes adéquates de délibération et de communication dans l'action collective et par celle-ci. Ce sont des normes de justice bienveillante, au sens où elles reposent de manière significative sur les raisons et motif~<br>

Author(s): Medina Rafael Alarcón<br>
Abstract: Using postwar El Salvador as a case study, I argue against the dominant paradigm that situates the repressive role of the state as both the central object of memorialization and the main subject of history. Instead, I focus on the ways in which the memory of insurgent collective action is constructed among young members of the popular classes in postwar El Salvador. Drawing on extensive ethnographic research in the communities of northern Morazán, I understand memory as the suspended time of praxis. Media—such as Internet, Facebook, and TV play a key role in this process, impinging on the ways youth relate with the revolutionary past of their relatives making sense of their present living conditions. I argue that memory must be understood as a particular form of praxis, one that is embedded in historic concrete forms of class constitution in which the role of media has become a constitutive element in the labors of memory, particularly among young people.<br>

Abstract: Narrative theology, as exemplified in the works of Hans W. Frei, is a promising interpretative approach which helps to construct post-modern theology based on biblical narratives. It seems, however, that Frei's approach raises serious objections to historical criticism. Do we have to enjoy the benefits of narrative theology at the expense of historical-critical approaches to biblical texts? Are there any points in common between both of them? This article will offer tentative answers to the above two questions in the context of Gen 12:3. It will show that the concept of plain sense may provide an opportunity for a rapprochement between traditional and historical hermeneutics. La théologie narrative, comme il apparaît dans les travaux de Hans W. Frei, est une démarche interprétative prometteuse, qui favorise la théologie postmoderne appuyée sur la narrativité biblique. Il semble toutefois que les travaux de Frei soulèvent de sérieuses objections pour la critique historique. Doit-on bénéficier de la théologie narrative aux dépens des approches histórico critiques des textes? N'y a-t-il pas des points communs aux deux? Cet article propose des réponses à ces deux questions dans le contexte de Gen 12,3. Il montrera que la notion de «sens plénier» pourrait fournir l'occasion d'un rapprochement entre les herméneutiques traditionnelles et historiques.<br>

Abstract: Lire Certeau dans une intention philosophique n'est légitime qu'à partir de la configuration propre et de la réception historiographique dominante de son œuvre, donc en considérant le contemporain comme contexte et paradigme déterminants. Cela peut consister à prolonger certaines de ses ouvertures «poétiques et politiques», étayées sur «le sens commun», «l'homme ordinaire», et le langage courant. Sa libre exploration formelle et épistémologique du «quotidien» invite à une reconsidération du lien poétique moderne entre l'espace public (l'institution) et l'espace privé (l'étrangeté banale). On y rencontre quelques thématisations radicales pouvant nourrir une réarticulation fondamentale du politique et de la subjectivité, au registre spécifique de la civilité. To read Certeau with philosophical intention is only legitimate on the basis of the unique configuration and the dominant historiographie reception of his work, considering the present-day, that is, as the decisive context and paradigm. That may mean prolonging some of his "poetic and political" overtures, backed up by "common sense", "the ordinary man" and common language. His freely formal and epistemológica! exploration of "the day to day" invites us to reconsider the modern poetic link between public space (the institution) and private space (commonplace oddness). That brings us to some radical thematics capable of nurturing a fundamental reformulation of the political and the subjective, in the specific domain of civility.<br>

Abstract: L'herméneutique du soi proposée par Paul Ricoeur dans les années quatre vingt-dix fait une large place au récit autobiographique. Elle place ainsi au cœur de la constitution de l'identité personnelle la capacité défaire retour sur soi en termes narratifs. Abordée sous l'angle non seulement de la permanence d'un noyau substantiel – la mêmeté – mais également de celle impliquée dans l'acte de tenir parole – l'ipséité – l'identité est ici conçue comme étant narrative. Seul un sujet capable de se raconter serait ainsi capable du maintien de soi dans la parole donnée. Or, confrontée à l'hypothèse de l'inconscient, cette conception narrative de l'identité fait problème: que ce soit au niveau anthropologique et métapsychologique d'une part, ou au niveau de la méthode et de la clinique psychanalytique d'autre part, le récit autobiographique ne saurait rendre compte de la dimension inconsciente de l'expérience. Elle ne peut en ce sens constituer un concept directeur dans le champ théorico-clinique ouvert par Freud. The hermeneutics of the self proposed by Paul Ricoeur in the 1990's gives a large place to autobiographical narrative. At the heart of what constitutes personal identity, then, is the capacity to reflect on oneself in narrative terms. Seen not only from the angle of the permanence of a substantial core – selfsameness – but also from that implied in the act of discourse – ipseity – identity is conceived of as being narrative. Only a subject capable of telling about itself can maintain the self in what is told. However, when confronted with the hypothesis of the subconscious, this narrative conception of identity is problematic: whether at an anthropological or a meta-psychological level on the one hand, or on the level of method and of clinical psychoanalysis on the other, autobiographical narrative cannot render an account of the unconscious dimension of experience. It cannot in this sense be a directive concept in the clinical theory field opened by Freud.<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de P. Ricœur laisse envisager une articulation spécifique entre la structure métaphysique de l'existence, caractérisée comme réflexion décentrée, et le mode propre selon lequel le religieux fait sens. En son principe, le religieux est coextensif au mouvement même de la réflexion, dont l'herméneutique constitue à la fois la vérité et la méthode: tension temporelle du soi entre son acte propre et les signes qu'il produit (Nabert), au sein du sens qui le précède. Sans jamais combler spéculativement la faille entre le soi et l'absolu, le religieux présente à l'imagination (au sens kantien) le scheme de l'accomplissement de l'existence. The work of P. Ricœur allows one to envisage the possibility of a specific link between the metaphysical nature of existence, depicted as eccentric reflection, and the standart view which gives religion its direction. In its principle, the 'religious' factor is co-extensive with the flow of reflection, whose hermeneutic constitutes not only the truth, but also the method: a temporal tension in the Self as between one's own actions and the effects they produce (J. Nabert), in the context of the intention which precedes them. While never spcculativcly overloading the fissure between the Self and the Absolute, religiosity affords to the imagination (in the sense used by Kant) a pattern for the fulfilment of existence.<br>

Abstract: Le symbole opère en signifiant et signifie en opérant. Pour fonder plus tard ce propos philosophique, il convient de revenir sur trois débats qui ont contribué à résoudre le sens du symbole dans l'éthique : la scission du symbole d'avec le signe, sa reprise dans le langage, son expulsion du sacré. Si l'on est conduit à redéfinir les droits, mais aussi les conditions et les modes d'une ontologie du symbole, on ne saurait négliger ce qui rend celui-ci possible : la culture. Identifiée à la structure signifiante et opérante du symbole, la culture s'entremet entre les capacités de symbolisation du vécu sensible et l'actualisation cognitive et pratique des symboles effectifs. The symbol operates by signifying and signifies by operating. In order to justify this philosophical affirmation, it is convenient to look back at three debates which have contributed to determining the sense of the symbol in ethics: the distinction between the symbol and the sign, the symbol's reintegration in language, and its expulsion from the domain of the sacred. If one is led to redefine not only the rights, but also the conditions and modes of an ontology of the symbol, then one may not neglect the thing which makes this possible: culture. Identified with the significant and operative structure of the symbol, culture places itself between the capacities for symbolisation of sensitive living, and the cognitive and practical actualisation of existing symbols.<br>

Abstract: L'étude se propose de montrer le bien-fondé et la fécondité de l'herméneutique du témoignage en philosophie en interrogeant l'un des problèmes fondamentaux que pose cette pratique, celui du rapport entre singularité et universalité, et ce dans trois champs relevant de la littérature : la littérature au sens large, les mythes littéraires et la Bible. L'étude de la notion de témoignage et de ses déplacements sémantiques dans le témoignage littéraire est inspirée de la philosophie de Paul Ricœur. Les exemples analysés sont ceux du mythe de Faust et de la figure de Job. This study endeavours to show that the hermeneutics of witness in philosophy are indeed well grounded and fecund, by inquiring into one of the essential problems of this practice : that of the relation of the singular to the universal. Three areas relating to literature are broached : literature in a wide sense, myth literature, and the Bible. This study of the idea of witness and its semantic fluctuations in witness literature is inspired by Paul Ricceur's philosophy. The examples analysed here are the Faust myth and the character Job.<br>

Abstract: En partant de l'histoire intellectuelle dont nous provenons, puis en retraçant en elle les tensions majeures de l'expérience et du sens, on soutient d'abord ici que le christianisme peut et doit être pour nous un lieu décisif de réflexion philosophique. Cette conviction se confirme à travers le parcours de trois pensées phénoménologiques d'importance – celles de M. Henry, de J. L. Marion et de P. Ricœur – qui abordent selon leur style propre la question du rapport à la « révélation » biblique et évangélique. On débouche ainsi finalement sur un espace à la fois commun et hétérogène : celui de notre monde, soulerrainemenl et diversement travaillé par l'inscription en lui d'une « kénose » d'origine chrétienne qui n'interroge pas moins les constructions philosophiques que théologiques. Beginning with the intellectual history from which we come, then in retracing in it the major tensions of experience and sense, this paper first maintains that Christianity can and must he for us a decisive place for philosophical reflection. This conviction is confirmed through the overview of three important phenomenological lines of thought, those of M. Henry, J. L. Marion and P. Ricœur – who take up, each according to his own style, the question of biblical and evangelical « revelation ». One is thus finally led into a space at once common and heterogeneous: that of our world, clandestinely and variously crafted by the inscription into it of a « kenosis » of Christian origin that questions philosophical constructions no less than theological ones.<br>

Abstract: Textures of Time is a rich and challenging book that raises a host of important and hard questions about historical narrative, form, and style; the sociology of texts; and the core problem of ascertaining historical truth. Two that pertain to the book's main claims are of special interest to nonspecialist readers: Is register or style - "texture" - necessarily and everywhere diagnostic of "history"? Does a new kind of "historical consciousness" emerge in south India beginning in the sixteenth century, indeed as a sign of an Indian early modernity? Textures is not the first book to argue that historical discourse is constitutively marked by a peculiar style, but the claim is beset by difficulties that scholars since Barthes have detailed. Rather than textures of time - accounts of what really happened in history-what these works offer us may be only pretextures of time, textualized forms of a human experience that make claims about its degrees and types of truth through representations of various states of temporality. Instead of assessing, then, whether these works are history or something else like "myth," we might ask whether they invite us to transcend this very dichotomy, to try, that is, to make sense of historical forms of consciousness rather than to identify forms of historical consciousness. As for modernity, nothing in south Indian historiography from 1500-1800 remotely compares to the conceptual revolution of Europe. But why should we expect the newness of the early modern world to have been experienced the same way everywhere? Modernity across Asia may have shown simultaneity without symmetry. Should this asymmetry turn out to reveal continuity and not rupture, however, no need to lament the fact. There is no shame in premodernity.<br>

Abstract: This paper challenges the common assumption that the attention which modern literary theory pays to the textual aspects of literature is achieved at the expense of humanistic and moral concerns. It starts by outlining how modern literary theory differs epistemologically from the traditional critical approaches to literature. Traditional critical theory was developed in the defense of poetry against Plato's accusations, real or imagined, and this informed both its critical practice and its concept of man. It established its epistemology on an aesthetic, moral, social, philosophical or scientific basis in a manner that encumbered literature with the concepts of man inherent in them. In contrast, modern literary theory started from a different premise: instead of seeking to justify literature and its moral relevance, it strove to identify its literariness and the dynamics of its structure by using the disciplines of semiotics and linguistics. It posited the text as an autonomous entity and a complete structure aware of its existence in a society of texts with which it conducts a profoundly intertextual dialogue. As an autonomous structure, the literary work is independent of other social or philosophical constructs and thus capable of conducting a meaningful dialogue with them. The paper elaborates the various conceptual frameworks of Russian formalism, intertextuality, structuralism and deconstruction in order to examine their implicit assumptions about man. It shows how the autonomous and dialogical nature of the literary work in its Bakhtinian sense are relevant to the concept of man inherent in modern literary theory. In its elaboration of this concept, the paper shows how it was developed in conflict with the hierarchical nature of traditional, ethical and philosophical values. It illustrates also the relevance of autonomy, self-regulation, free-play and fair representation inherent in many concepts of modern literary theory to the question of human rights. The qu~<br>

Abstract: «At the basis of the literary act is a consciousness of language. Whether or not the writer is given to abstract reflexion, there is in literature itself a metaliterary dimension.» In his article on the Evolution of Literary Theory, Tzvetan Todorov examines the relation between the «discourse on Literature» and the object of that discourse: literature. Whereas exegesis concerns itself with the Elucidation and explanation of an historically given object, theory itself constitutes its object. Theory then is in turn seen to be historically informed. From the Poetics of Aristotle, through the medieval hermeneuts, the Renaissance concern with genres, Todorov traces the development of the theoretical discourse which proposes literature as its object. Only in the romantic period is a theory of literature, in the strict sense, elaborated. In the 20th century this theory is further influenced by other emergent disciplines :Marxism, psychoanalysis etc. The final pages of Todorov's paper consider in detail the impact of structuralism, particularly in France, on the literary theoretical discourse. He concludes with reference to the changes taking place currently. According to Todorov, it is in the «idea of genre» that the «transformation will take place.»<br>

Abstract: This article develops parallels between how individuals make sense of both lived experience and narrative performance in order to suggest how the process of following a narrative can give rise to affectively engaging states of mind or flows of thought that I term experiential meanings. Although potentiated through the artistry of performance, these meanings result from listeners' own interpretational processes and therefore become experiential resources available for use in their lives.<br>

Author(s): Wisan Jean K.<br>
Abstract: A properly sociological definition of the concept of discourse does not exist because the notion has never been detached from the linguistic sphere. Not only linguists and semiologists, but also sociologists, use the word primarily as a linguistic category. This article attempts to define the concept of discourse sociologically. It is argued that a sociologically defined notion should be dissociated from the linguistic realm. As a linguistic category, 'discourse' is either used as a synonym for language or text, or is closely associated with one of these notions. 'Discourse' in a sociological sense should refer to a class of texts. This definition confers upon the concept of discourse an intertextual dimension. Defined in this way, the category can not only become an operative sociological concept, but it also becomes autonomous and is no longer reducible to linguistic or paralinguistic conceptual entities, such as text or language. No longer confined to the linguistic realm, the concept can designate a particular entity which possesses its own existence. Discourse can become a thing in itself. The argument is presented in three parts. The first is a critique of the current definitions of the concept 'discourse'. The second proposes, as an alternative, a sociological definition of discourse. Finally the third part applies this new definition in a sociological analysis of journalism.<br>

Author(s): Turner Mary<br>
Abstract: This article explores a paradox - the simultaneous cultivation and suppression of "healing dramas" by pediatric rehabilitation therapists. Dramatic moments are defined as ones in which the routine exercises and treatment activities of therapeutic practice are transformed into narrative plots. These improvisational plots involve multiple characters, risks, suspense, and above all, a heightened sense that something is at stake. Experience itself becomes the focus of attention for the patient. Based upon ethnographic research in Chicago and Los Angeles, this article offers an anatomy of two such moments, investigating not only how healing dramas are constructed between patients and healers but how and why institutional discourses and practices invite their abandonment.<br>

Author(s): Wikan Janice<br>
Abstract: Examination of cultural and social factors surrounding zar spirit possession diagnoses in Northern Sudan suggests that a major issue addressed by the cult is the cultural overdetermination of women's selfhood. Circumcision and infibulation operate to establish in women a sense of self congruent with the cultural image of woman as reproducer. When experiences and expectations fail to mesh, some women fall ill and are ultimately diagnosed as possessed. Through acceptance of the possession diagnosis and participation in curing rites involving trance, a patient is given scope to expand and regenerate her sense of self and recontextualize her experiences.

Abstract: This study describes the symbolic process by which individuals attempted to realize, in organizational form, their variant interpretations of an extended metaphor - community mental health. Their metaphoric construals were embedded in everyday discourse and were initially unrecognized by participants at a community mental health center. The metaphoric process, that is, the movement involving the emergence, interpretation, and realization of these metaphors, was mediated by the self-images of the participants. They had embarked upon an innovative project to realize, in part, an ideal sense of self. The latter was a key factor in the development of new construals of community mental health and the implementation of these construals.<br>

Abstract: This is partly an allusion to Wittgenstein on language games but I am emphasising the sense of play to add to what he says of games, life and travel. On language games, see more in
         Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-religion/ (accessed 18 February 2010): Some properties of language-games can be noticed in Wittgenstein’s several examples and comments. They are, first, a part of a broader context termed by Wittgenstein a form of life (see below). Secondly, the concept of language-games points at the rule-governed character of language. This does not entail strict and definite systems of rules for each and every language-game, but points to the conventional nature of this sort of human activity. Finally, Wittgenstein’s choice of ‘game’ is based on the over-all analogy between language and game, assuming that we have a clearer perception of what games are. Still, just as we cannot give a final, essential definition of ‘game’, so we cannot find ‘what is common to all these activities and what makes them into language or parts of language.’<br>

Abstract: This article focuses on the last two novels by Adolfo Couve, La comedia del arte (1996) and Cuando pienso en mi falta de cabeza (La segunda comedia), posthumously published in 2000. The article proposes an allegorical reading of the transformation of the painter Camondo into a wax statue, the protagonist of both novels who later loses his mind. The article argues that the loss of the mind allegorizes a quotidian time, in tune with Couve's world, which spins and repeats itself, closed, without a horizon, a “beheaded” time (lacking future). This allows the possibility to build a coherent sense of a series of narrative forms (which include language, space, time, characters) and that, taken as a whole, show the particular way in which Couve's narrative is built and developed.<br>

Abstract: Evaluative terms are a crucial part of the environmental discourse. These terms, and the evaluative frameworks in which they are imbedded, serve as important guides to action. “Natural,” a term commonly used as a positive evaluation, is problematic because it can both justify unfair social relations and obscure the connections between humans and the rest of nature. “Sustainable,” another popular term, is extremely malleable, and is too often elaborated in frameworks that are neither socially nor ecologically responsible. The term “sustainable” is sometimes used in the framework of ecosystem health, but even this approach can fail to highlight the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. The framework of ecosocial flourishing, introduced in this article, is better suited for highlighting the interconnected nature of the world and for drawing attention to questions of environmental justice. Evaluative terms (like “natural”) and frameworks (like “ecosocial flourishing”) are part of larger narratives that help people make sense of their interactions with, and emotional responses to, the non-human world.<br>

Abstract: This paper scrutinizes the fundamental assumption governing Gunther Teubner's theory of societal constitutionalism, namely that societal constitutions are ultimately about the regulation of inclusion and exclusion in global function systems. While endorsing the central role of inclusion/exclusion in constitutions, societal or otherwise, I argue that inclusion and exclusion are primordial categories of collective action, rather than functional categories. As a result, the self-closure which gives rise to a legal collective is spatial as much as it is temporal, and subjective no less than material. Inasmuch as legal orders must establish who ought to do what, where, and when, this entails, or so I argue, that any legal order we could imagine—including a global legal order such as cyberlaw—is necessarily bounded in space, time, content, and membership. This impinges directly on the inclusion/exclusion difference: that there can be no inclusion without exclusion entails, most fundamentally, that there can be no (il)legality without alegality, i.e. comportment that contests, sometimes radically, how a legal order draws the distinction between legality and illegality. In this fundamental sense, all legal orders have an outside—literally. Building on this insight, I suggest that the functional cosmopolitanism advocated by a theory of societal constitutionalism retains a residue of the logic of totalization it seeks to overcome. I conclude by exploring how a first-person plural theory of law both supports and transforms the insight that constitutions regulate the inclusion/exclusion difference by putting into place constitutive and limitative rules.<br>

Abstract: The academic study of Kabbalah has largely been limited to myth and symbol as the two viable forms of kabbalistic discourse. In this essay, I resist those limitations and explore two other possible literary forms: history and fiction. I do not mean history in any positivistic sense but closer to Steven Greenblatt's description of new historicism as cultural poetics. This suggests that literature not only reflects a historical setting but also creates that setting, constructing reality in its own image and directing it toward its desired ends. In looking at Lurianic Kabbalah as fiction, I raise the issue of the “real” and the “true” as it relates to fictive narratives more generally. This essay does not claim that the kabbalists in question did or did not intend to write cultural poetics or fiction. Rather, I use cultural poetics and fiction as possible lenses through which a nontraditional interested reader (i.e., one not invested in the literature as authoritative) can read these texts in a way that can speak to the contemporary world in which we live and think.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: But despite its humor, de la Torre's piece frames a serious response to the complex legacy of Argentina's dirty war and the dispersions of many sorts that it caused. The whole Listserv dialogue is initiated because of Mercedes Correche's search for her mother, Mónica de la Torre, who was most likely “disappeared” by the Argentine dictatorship in 1977 “after being accused of subversive activities.” The Argentine dictatorship specialized in rhetorically camouflaging its actions against citizens with layers of euphemism, such that the regime itself was referred to as a “special process,” and its method of kidnapping, torturing, and killing its enemies was called “disappearing” them. The dictatorship was marked by “censorship of texts and the persecution of people, when even the appearance of thinking was suspicious.”
         
               The national sense of language changed between 1976 and 1983: “Uncertainty, suspicion, oblique broaching of discourse, masking, fracturing, displacement of the great issues to one's own subjectivity, the search for a center located outside the immediate social milieu: such are the recurrent terms that critics use to identify these years of transition which, now, with the mediation of time, serve well to reflect the spirit of Argentine society during the years of dictatorship.”108
            
               Crucially, de la Torre's narrator rewrites herself as a collectivity. The text offers a parable of multiple subjectivity and generic mixing, in which poems are born among layers of misdirection, and translation is always imperfect. A very real need to locate origins in a place where origins have been violently erased come together in the poetics of “Doubles,” which both acknowledges and resists origins. The literal search for origins, or lineage, coexists with the poet's resistance to the concept of authenticity. By retelling this encounter, de la Torre foregrounds the problem that Roberto Schwarz had pointedly articulated in109~<br>

Abstract: Apter's disengagement from most of the work now being done in World Literature and in translation studies suggests that her real focus lies elsewhere. Though she presents her book as intended “to ford the divisions between World Literature and Theory that have led to unproductive rifts” (5), over the course of the book it increasingly appears that her primary concern is with rifts within the field of Theory itself. And not necessarily to heal them: running through her chapters is a pattern of dismissal or outright occlusion of theoretical perspectives that she finds uncongenial. Thus she details Derrida's mocking critique of the Sinologist and comparatist René Etiemble (236–37), but Etiemble himself can't get a word in edgewise. For a proponent of “planetarity,” it might have been useful to take a serious look at the author of
      Ouverture(s) sur un comparatisme planétaire. Apter does directly discuss Franco Moretti on World Literature and the global spread of the novel, but ends by assessing his work as “precritical in the sense that it shakes off the influence of decades of metatheory, hermeneutics and deconstruction” (55). Surely there are few more critically acute scholars active today than Moretti, whose work is deeply informed by world-systems analysis, grounded in Marxist and also evolutionary theory, and bolstered by engagement with such non-Western theorists as Roberto Schwarz and Masao Miyoshi. Yet by a rhetorical sleight of hand, Moretti'spost-deconstructive work here becomes “precritical.” Moretti and a variety of other scholars sidelined by Apter are theorizing the world in a global perspective, but from sociological and economic standpoints rather than a base in Continental philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Fitzgerald's particular structural and stylistic approach to nostalgia in
         Gatsby, dividing the narrative into two distinct parts and thus creating both a textual nostalgia and evoking a phenomenological nostalgic experience in the reader, are masterly and consciously accomplished, but they are not unique. Modernist writers used a palette of nostalgic strategies in order to stage their experience of the modern world. Although nostalgia can be considered conservative or reactionary as an idea, the influence it had on modernist literary style is, on the contrary, quite radical. “The melancholic sense of loss,” writes Svetlana Boym, “turned into a style” (16). The sense of transcendental homelessness in combination with nihilism and universal grief that was accentuated by the war and contemporary ideas necessitated a literary style that both confronted the whole project of progress as well as provided a space for emotions that were not considered desirable in a world moving distinctly forward. The nostalgic aesthetic is heavily based on strategies that are formed out of the basic nostalgic and modern dichotomy between future and past, now and then, here and there, which included such varied techniques as temporal re-ordering of events, the nostalgic use of both flashbacks and flash-forwards, the dichotomy between inner time and clock time. Furthermore, the modernists favored inner or outer landscapes of utopian and idealized spaces. Such landscapes could be either simply another past, or more intricately, a phenomenological experience of childhood.<br>

Abstract: The body invents some immaterial entities or gestures to take the place of the material loss; they include consolation, hope, and love, sometimes even hallucinations and fantasies. The memory of the departed keeps alive the grief of their loss and so confers the present with meaning. For Jabbeh Wesley, therefore, to write poetry is to make sense of the dysfunctional world of Liberia. The grief in her works comes with memory, sauntering like ghosts. Indeed, the persistence of ghosts is a metaphor for the persistence of the memory of the dead and for the attendant grief. This is particularly true in the poem “Ghosts Don't Go Away Just Like That,” from
         Where the Road Turns.<br>

Abstract: Over the course of an academic career that involved many ups and downs, and many dislocations, SPEP has remained a constant, a place of refuge almost, where I could be recognized and accepted. Many friendships were formed and continued there, and after a time the possibility of seeing friends became a major reason for attending. It's strange that SPEP can seem like a fixed place to which one returns again and again, even though it is a movable feast held each year in a different place. In a certain sense arriving at SPEP each year is “getting back into place,” to plagiarize a well-known phenomenologist, even though we may be in Philadelphia, Chicago, New York, or even (if we can find it) Penn State. Its heart and soul, of course, remains the exchange of ideas built around a common tradition: ideas, texts, philosophers. As important in the history of SPEP has been the appearance among us of some of the most important European philosophers of these last fifty years: We were too late to lure Heidegger, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty to our shores, but we heard Gadamer, Arendt, Ricoeur, Habermas, Derrida, and many more.<br>

Abstract: Questions like this have shaped much of my own work. Being surrounded by so many enthusiastic but incompatibly articulate spokespersons for neglected lifeworld concerns, I concluded that criticism of tradition is most powerful when offered by those who are already in the midst of trying to be better phenomenologists—not, of course, in the sense that they are trying to be better members of a philosophical school but in the sense that they are motivated by the urge to find better ways to articulate something that tradition distorts or neglects. Why
      shouldaccounts of what matters most in life first be measured against the standards of “clear and distinct” propositional speech? Does anyone reallylive though life, thinking of it as a process going on inside our bodies? Do we reallyexperiencefreedom as an unconceptualizable combination of limitlessness and limit? And why throw the metaphorical wet blanket of a rigorously trained consciousness and its “correlates” over thepretheoretical practices of everyday life? Negative genuflections to philosophy's traditional priorities, privileging the subjective instead of the objective, inner instead of outer, lived body instead of house-for-the-mind—all of these inversions ultimately foster the continuing and undeserved hegemony of a traditionally objectivist understanding of what is Really Real. Kockelmans once told me that Merleau-Ponty eventually decidedPhenomenology of Perception“was not yet a philosophical book.” To be sure, its content and much of its treatment of that content is phenomenological, but its structure is still Cartesian. To start with specificallybodilyperception, however generously reconceived, still implies that other dimensions of presence to the world—linguistic, social, cultural, political, historical—can be added on at a later time, perhaps along with discussions of abstractly identified and timeless “topics” like freedom, the self, and so on.<br>

What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: And from the conclusion: “The book promises to play a central role in the future debate on the role of law, not merely because of its theoretical contribution, which is monumental, but because its author has generated a new framework, a new architectonic, from which the phenomenon of law in a democratic society can be perceived. In that sense, this book which was written in the shadow of the great German discourses on law authored by Hegel and Weber will cast its own light.”

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Article Title: Ethics and Religion in Continental Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: In my own opinion the most interesting expression of the religious turn in Continental philosophy is found in Derrida because Derrida is by anyone's standards a secular thinker and even, by the standards of the local pastor or rabbi, an atheist. So it came as a shock to read about Derrida's “religion” in his famous “Circumfession” (1989), which is a deconstructive riff on Augustine's
            Confessionsin which Derrida restages the scene of theConfessions. We come upon a scene in which the speaker (Augustine/Jackie), an emigrant from North Africa to the Big Apple (Rome/Paris), has his back to us and is praying to someone (te, God/tu), while his mother (Monica/Georgette) lies dying on the northern shore of the Mediterranean (Ostia/Nice). Derrida tells us that he has been praying all his life and that no one, not even his mother, has understood this, which has led to a misunderstanding of his work.
                  But to whom is Derrida praying, and how could he be praying at all? Does he not “rightly pass for an atheist”?20
               
                  There is a more obscure sense of religion “without religion” in Derrida, and a prayer to a God not only unknown but nonexistent that nonetheless constitutes a genuine prayer. If, as Jean-Louis Chrétien says, himself one of the new religious phenomenologists,21
               prayeris a “wounded word,” what word is more wounded than a word from one who does not know to whom he is praying (a lost letter, destination unknown), or if anyone is there to hear his prayers, or if he is praying at all, who has to pray to be able to pray at all, for something, he knows not what, something “coming,” the coming or incoming (invention) of something unforeseeable?
                  Derrida's atheism is crucially important to his religion because it allows him to isolate the very structure of prayer, and hence of the religious posture, with or without what we in the great monotheisms call “God,” thereby putting into questi~<br>

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Quintilian is quite equivocal in his stance toward hyperbole. He is hesitant to fully embrace it, but he acknowledges the propensity for excess and deceit within everyday thought and language. He further suggests that hyperbole may often be the most appropriate expression of the tension between truth and falsehood. He states that when one must express the inexpressible and speak of something that “transcends the normal limits of nature,” it is better to go too far than not far enough since “no one is satisfied with the truth” (2001, 8.6.76). Additionally, he defines hyperbole by pointing out that hyperbole is “a liar, but does not lie to deceive” (8.6.74). On its face, this claim is a complete non sequitur because a lie is by definition always intended to deceive, to keep hidden. However, what his stance on hyperbole reveals is that hyperbole is inexorably tied to epistemological questions concerning language and the expression of meaning, for example, representation, method, invention, or even motive. His position also suggests that a hyperbolic lie is different from a lie in its general sense of the term. It is not intended to deceive but to reveal. Hyperbole speaks a double language of transcendence at the limits of figuration, a language that offers a different way of perceiving and thinking about convention and normative frameworks of knowledge. It is duplicitous—a double cross for the purpose of transition.<br>

Abstract: According to Ricoeur, this activity of appropriation occurs in a phenomenological, prepublic realm. To link this realm with the public world, I turn briefly to the vocabulary of constitutive rhetoric. In “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the
         Peuple Québécois,” Maurice Charland explains how certain public texts, in addressing individuals as a group before that group actually exists in the extratextual world, can constitute a collective based on identity and oriented toward action. Charland uses the work of Kenneth Burke in order to shift the focus of rhetorical scholars away from “persuasion” and toward “identification” (1987, 133). Charland argues that public texts constitute subjects that didn't previously exist. In this sense, such texts do notpersuadealready existing individuals; they invite individuals to think of themselves in a manner thatentailscertain actions (1987, 134). This conceptualization extends Ricoeur's insights about appropriation and refiguration into the public world of action. Within this formulation, readers or listeners not only imagine themselves in new ways.
               They14
            actas the world of the text invites them to do and in so doing close the gap between mimesis3and mimesis1, between reading and acting. This is the space that needs to be crossed in order to give the straight line between mimesis1and mimesis3its arc and so enable it to form a spiral. A child reading Patterson's book, for instance, might simply dismiss it as a stuffy story about a famous person long dead. Or, the reader may actively engage the narrator's subtle closing exhortation to “make Dr. King's dream his own” (96). Because of “Dr. King's dream,” the reader may speak up when she hears someone employ racial slurs or stereotypes or intervene when a classmate is unjustly punished or bullied. The reader thus acts her way into Dr. King's proposed world and becomes the kind of agent whose actions may in turn inspire others. Her actions may be so ~<br>

Abstract: Finally, around the turn of the seventeenth century, the meaning of the word “health” expanded to include the sense of a toast imbibed in someone's honor. In that spirit, rather unusually, the issue ends with a late veteran Shavian, Sidney Albert, speaking to us from the great beyond, correcting some previous misconceptions regarding the Shaw/Salvation Army relationship. The indefatigable Albert provides us with original insight into the decidedly musical origins of

Abstract: Second, like Ricoeur, Shaw posits the poetic imagination, as it reveals itself in religious and other kinds of narrative texts, as the capability best suited for mending the ailing soul and resurrecting the frangible will. The human heart may be deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, as the prophet laments, but for Shaw (and Ricoeur) it is corrigible. Things can and do change; this is the first law of Shavian evolution. And, in Shaw's judgment, there is no more effective catalyst for provoking restorative transformation, for ridding the world of the ignorance that fuels evil, than the making of imaginative art that is aesthetically pleasing. Why is this the case? Because storytelling can break the infernal spell that enthralls the will. Telling stories, Shaw maintains, can deliver the imbecilic will from slavery, thereby restoring enlightened individual autonomy and the untrammeled capacity to act in accordance with higher rather than lower passions.
      
               “Fine art,” he muses, as exemplified for example in his own dramatic works, by implication, “is the only teacher except torture.”50
            
               In this regard, Shaw is very much like the “artist” and “Bohemian” Jesus he commemorates: the sage and commiserative guide who, “when reproached for resorting to the art of fiction when teaching in parables,” justified “himself on the ground that art is the only way in which the people can be taught.”51
            
               Consider the biblical Testaments, once more. Shaw believes they are unreliable historical documents yet nonetheless finds “in their readable parts”—that is, in their tales, fables, and legends—a treasure trove of tropes vital to the species' wellness (the same is true for Ricoeur).52
            
               However, and this is critical, he cautions that “you cannot read the Bible if you have no sense of literary art.”53

Abstract: The recent pragmatic-contextual theory of fiction entails the possibility of changes between fact and fiction over the course of time. It is also perhaps commonplace to state that this process can be reversed—that fictional texts may cease to be fictional. The question of generic fiction-to-fact transition, however, is rarely confronted in the theory of fiction. This essay investigates the generic expectations attached to texts that make a full-scale transition from fiction to nonfiction difficult, both culturally and psychologically. “Fiction” is understood here in a limited, pragmatic sense of a work of fiction, a text known and categorized as fiction. The discussion is structured around five interrelated reasons that contribute to the difficulty: (1) the commonness of as-if structures in everyday life; (2) the generic combinations among literature, fiction, factual representation, and narrative; (3) the relative stability of the communal values and ways of checking facts that determine the categories of fiction and fact (the fact convention); (4) the popularity, in fiction, of metalepsis and the theme of transworld travel between different ontological spheres; (5) and the fictionalization of literature in the historical perspective.<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Leopold Bloom, in
         Ulysses, expansively describes the Utopian as affording “no known method from the known to the unknown.”
               Utopia is a place that is impossible to arrive at by any known route, in that it is not really a place at all. It is therefore essential that, in order to reach Utopia, one takes an unknown and unknowable route, a path determined by its indeterminacy, a passage that deconstructs its own rationalistic epistemological foundations. It is only in its paradoxical nature that such a route, beyond sense (which forbids entry into the unreal), might discover the reality of that unreality. For, in the end, despite its fantastical absurdities—its self-conscious nowhereness—Joyce's Dublin, like Butler's Erewhon, is the opposite of nowhere: it is somewhere. It is by inscribing the material (the somewhere) within the dream (the nowhere) that the dream might be sustained; and it is also by inscribing the dream within the real that material existence can continue.166<br>

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>

Issue: sciefictstud.38.issue-1<br>
Date: 3 1, 2011<br>
Abstract: Characterizing the slipstream genre, Bruce Sterling locates it between mainstream and science fiction; it “sets its face against consensus reality” and makes us feel “very strange.” A strong slipstream candidate is Steven Hall’s
         The Raw Shark Texts(2007). Manifesting as a distributed literary system, the text has as its core a print novel, but other internet and real world sites also contain fragments or “negatives.” One of the text’s two villains, Mycroft Ward, has transformed into an online database; a posthuman subjectivity, he appropriates “node bodies” that upload their information and download new instructions. This separation of content (online database) from form (node body) is, according to Alan Liu, one of the primary characteristics of postindustrial knowledge work. To this extent, Hall positions his narrative not only against databases but also against knowledge that is, in Liu’s terms, autonomously mobile, transformable, and automated, having lost its material instantiation and been pulverized into atomized bits of information. The text’s second villain—a “conceptual shark,” the Ludovician—represents the complete fusion of form and content; the typographical symbols used to describe the shark also comprise its flesh in verbal and graphic representations. The text thus positions its protagonist, Eric Sanderson, as caught between twenty-first-century forms of knowledge and the implosion of signifier into signified. In this sense, the novel functions as a parable for the contemporary human condition, looking toward a posthuman future but incarnated within an ancient biological heritage.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines the role of agency and metatextuality in Élisabeth Vonarburg's B
         ridgeCycle, comprised mainly of a group of short stories originally published between 1977 and 2002 and then revised in their definitive French versions for the collectionLe Jeu des coquilles de nautilus(2003). The cycle's main storyline involves the uncertain journey between parallel worlds by a series of recurring characters. Three intimately linked narrative components—each closely related to certain protocols of reading fiction and of particular interest to science fiction—form the theoretical and analytical bases of this study: the three recurring topoï of the protagonist-Voyager's travels; character agency that in part drives the sense of these realms and their occupation; and the dénouement which gives a certain meaning and closure to the spaces in their diverse manifestations and to the characters who pursue their quests in these spaces. Vonarburg's narratives place their protagonists in a situation precisely similar to that of the reader as she must negotiate the trans-world context, come to grips with her own relative lack of agency, and at the same time seek some level of control through knowledge. Suchmise en abymeallows the author, through the choice of dénouement, to comment on the manner in which this universe and the real one are imagined, represented, and decoded, and on how meaning is conveyed.<br>
