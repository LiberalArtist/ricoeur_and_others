  Author(s) MARTINEZ RUBÉN O.<br>
  Abstract: Hispanos in northern New Mexico commemorate the death of a loved one with a written narrative referred to as a recuerdo (a remembrance). These narratives (or ballads) share many characteristics of the corrido and its forerunner, the Spanish romance. The romance, a popular form of epic poetry, and the corrido depict events in the lives of heroic, historical, and common folk. Both reflect historical events, describe injustices, depict social values, and present moral teachings elicited from catastrophic social events, for example, a tragic murder, a sentence of death, or imprisonment for a heinous act.

  Author(s) Stahlberg Lesleigh Cushing<br>
  Abstract: In his treatise the
                  Monarchy, Dante argues against those who maintained that the foundation of faith consists in the traditions of the church. He distinguishes three stages in the history of Scripture: before the church (i.e. the Old and the New Testament), with the church (the early fathers), and after the church (thedecretales). In defining the first stage, the stageante Ecclesiam, Dante states that “this is what the Church says speaking to her bridegroom: ‘Draw me after thee.’ ”¹ The standard footnote tells us that this sentence—“Trahe me post te” in the Vulgate’s Latin—is a quotation<br>

  Abstract: I think I know the fellow who knocked at Kevin Hart’s door: every Sunday, he sits just a few pews in front of me at Del Aire Assembly of God, an inner-city church in Los Angeles. And every once in a while, he comes to pester me in my adult education class. Lacking that handy remote which could stop him mid-sentence (I’ve put one on my Christmas list!), I don’t have the luxury of turning off his testimony regarding his experience of God. And so I often hear him recount similar experiences: “Jamie, I met God in such a powerful<br>

  Abstract: Several well-known contemporary philosophers have been struck in recent years by the apostle Paul and, in at least one case, by the theme of “universalism.”¹ But Paul is, of course, not only the author of the famous sentence of Gal. 3:28: “There is no such thing as Jew and Greek, slave and freeman, male and female; for you all are one person in Christ Jesus” (neb).

  Abstract: In an interview in 1996 with Hélène Cixous, Kathleen O’Grady broke something of a critical silence regarding the subject of Cixous’ relationship to religion. To the question of her personal relation to God, Cixous describes herself as ‘religiously atheistic’ (O’Grady, 1996–97). The statements that frame this disclosure, however, provide a context in which to read just what it is that she is implicitly distancing herself from and, more importantly, what it might be within religious discourses with which in practice she aligns herself.

  Abstract: “The entire Torah, in its minute descriptions, is concentrated in the ‘Thou Shalt not kill’ that the face of the other signifies,”¹ writes the Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas. Aside from finding a confirmation in Jewish doctrine, this sentence sums up Lévinas’s thought as a whole—a radical ethic of nonviolence that, reached through the author’s anomalous reading of the sixth commandment, can serve as an introduction to our theme here. We begin with Lévinas because we believe in the rhetorical efficacy of contrasts. And, in this case, the contrast is considerable. Against almost all tradition, Lévinas reads the commandment as<br>

  Abstract: Putting

Nietzsche’s writing style along with his rejection of theSpirit of Gravity¹ would seem to oppose the very goal of the phenomenological project as well as its foundational and scientific ambition. To Nietzsche scholars, his philosophy would be irreducible to any kind of philosophical school or movement and would need to be treated on its own if one wants to respect the claim for singularity conveyed by his philosophy.

  Abstract: In Act 1 Scene 3 of
                  Richard II, Mowbray describes his sorrow at being banished from England, calling his sentence a ‘speechless death’ that will prevent his tongue from ‘breathing native breath’ (1.3.172–3). Yet Mowbray’s eloquent lament fails to influence the monarch who has banished him; as King Richard says, ‘It boots thee not to be compassionate. / After our sentence, plaining comes too late’ (1.3.174–5). Richard suggests that Mowbray’s speech is a deliberate attempt to move him to mercy and compassion, but that the complaint is belated and ineffective.¹ At this point in the play, then, Richard<br>

  Abstract: God is whoever raised Jesus from the dead, having before raised Israel from Egypt. This trademark sentence of Jenson’s is, as Stanley Hauerwas observes, both “elegantly simple” and “dauntingly deep.”³ At the heart of this dense slogan is the principle that Christian discourse about God intends and is made possible by a specific reality. “God,” as we have seen Jenson argue, is intrinsically specifiable, because God is known by and with a history. The God Jesus addressed as Father and who raised him from the dead was not a previously unknown deity. Rather, as Jenson states, “It is the God<br>

The year 1959 was the thirteenth year of Speer’s twenty-year prison sentence—how did he get to Peking during this period? Quite simply, by walking. And not just to Peking, but to Istanbul, to Vladivostok, to Karachi, and to other exotic regions and cities.

  Abstract: The peculiar status of irony within the literary and philosophical tradition is perhaps best illustrated by the vexing questions that always hover over its founder and chief exemplar, Socrates. Was Socrates a model pedagogue or a seducer and corrupter of innocent youth? Was his method of rigorous ignorance a path leading to negative knowledge or an abyssal spiraling of rhetorical tricks? Was his stubborn insistence on interpersonal questioning and dialogue a form of urbanity or the egotistical undermining of any genuinely sociopolitical form of community?

  Abstract: “Metaphysics begins with the ancient Greeks as a philosophical doctrine of the one God.”¹ This sentence—assigning metaphysics and theology—is far from self-evident. The sentence, on the one hand, states that metaphysics and theology are neighborly disciplines and that theology necessarily needs metaphysics; on the other hand, the existence of metaphysics implies theology has been a valid enterprise for as long a time.
                  Postmodern thinking, however, is handling this compilation with caution. Dealing with metaphysics after the Enlightenment and the linguistic turn is a difficult affair. In this regard, one perspective for understanding metaphysics is to consider metaphysical structures<br>

  Author(s) Rambo Shelly<br>
  Abstract: In my understanding of theology, the meaning of religious convictions always depends on a particular language game, i.e. on a certain theological context.¹ Because, for example, the sentence “God is love” can point to different meanings depending on to whom and in what context it is said, one can understand it adequately only if one perceives it as embedded in a particular dialogue or language game. Therefore, comparative theology can never result in a universal theory about religions and truth.² Because the meanings of basic religious beliefs within particular traditions are diverse, comparative theology focuses on select details within particular<br>

The co-authors proceeded to quote from Karl Marx and Max Weber to suggest that there was an epistemological principle articulated in the Saussurean statement that unified social science practice in spite of ideological differences, one that involves seeing science as ‘an instrument for breaking with naive realism’ ([1968], 1991, 33).

  Abstract: To speak, in contemporary society, of art and beauty in the same sentence, much less as realities integrally involved with one another, is to risk becoming the object of smiling condescension. The great philosophers of beauty in the eighteenth century, including Burke, Hume, and Kant, treated beauty as a matter of sensation or taste, as either a physiological experience or a spiritual one, but always a subjective one. The arts of the beautiful were thought “to gentrify” the soul, softening it, making it more sympathetic in itself and sociable as part of a culture.¹ They succeeded in providing to the<br>

  Author(s): Myers Jacob D.<br>
  Abstract: The real question for homiletics in our increasingly postmodern, post-Christian contexts is not how are we going to prevent preaching from dying, but how are we going to help it die a good death. Preaching was not made to live. At most, preaching is a witness, a sign, a crimson X marking a demolition site. The church has developed sophisticated technologies in modernity to give preaching the semblance of life, belying the truth: preaching was born under a death sentence. It was born to die. Only when preaching embraces its own death is it able to truly live.<br>

He left unfinished the revision of hisArcadia, a prose romance which concludes, in its original version, with a dramatic scene of trial.

Truthfully, this is no easy demand to fulfill, especially if one considers that—regarded from outside—at first something entirely arbitrary belongs to every beginning. And if it is adequate to satisfy the Faulknerian precept, it thus remains that such a beginning in every case possesses something compelling or seductive, though not compulsory in the strict<br>

As Herskovitz notes, senility is characterized as “monstrosity” by the lay media with “clichéd metaphors and representations in which Alzheimer’s is characteristically drawn in colourfully dramatic terms that paint vividly disturbing images” (1995, 152–153).

Beauvoir’s comprehensive and still controversial text also initiated existential feminism, as she developed her themes within the emergence of existentialist philosophy—an open-ended, anti-essentialist, and nonsystematic philosophy that studies life as an undecided project-in-the-making.

  Abstract: Samuel Delany’s memoir begins with this laconic sentence: “My father had been sick almost a year.”¹ His journey of remembering sets out from and is oriented toward the emotional landmark of his father’s illness and death. That landmark, however, is no signpost, stone marker, or architectural structure heavily anchored to a place and drawn on a map. It is more like a scratch in a record that makes the needle stutter and skip. “For most of my life,” Delany recalls, “if it came up, I would tell you: ‘My father died of lung cancer in 1958 when I was seventeen.’”²<br>

The past ceased to appear as an immense reservoir of experiences from which human beings could draw moral and political lessons. Since the French Revolution, the future had to be invented rather than extracted from bygone events.

Abstract: One of the most contentious issues that Neal had to deal with in volume 3 concerned the role of the Puritans in the trial and execution of Charles I. He insists that neither Puritanism itself nor the tenets of any group among the Puritans were responsible for the death of Charles I. The seizure of the king by the army and the subsequent purging of parliament, Neal says, “blew up the whole constitution, and buried king, parliament, and presbytery in its ruins.” Episcopal divines, “in order to throw off the king’s misfortunes from themselves, who by their obstinate behaviour had in reality reduced him to the last extremity,” diverted all blame onto the Puritan clergy—as their successors have continued to do to this day, he adds.
      35Neal has no difficulty in presenting detailed evidence of public statements, petitions, and letters from Puritan ministers in London and throughout the country protesting against the trial of the king and subsequently against his sentence and his execution. Neal says that he knows of only two ministers—Hugh Peters and John Goodwin—who did support the trial and execution of the king. “King Charles therefore died by the Hands of Violence, or by the military Sword, assumed and managed in an arbitrary manner by a few desperate Officers of the Army and their Dependants, of sundry Denominations as to Religion, without any regard to the ancient Constitution of their Country, or the fundamental Laws of Society.”36Neal is adamant that “the king’s death was not owing to the distinguishing tenets of any sect or party of Christians,”37and he provides further corroboration from contemporaries to reinforce this challenge to the received wisdom of churchmen past and present. The strongest evidence is the act of attainder of the king’s judges drawn up at the time of the restoration of Charles II.38This judgment makes clear that no specific religious party can be held responsible for the execution of Charles I. Nor does it ascribe responsibility to the~<br>

Abstract: Second, readers of Braudel’s
         Mediterranean,no matter how much of the book they actually have read, continue to be struck by the energy, engagement, and dedication of a fervent lover and committed convert. “I have passionately loved the Mediterranean, no doubt because I am a northerner like so many others in whose footsteps I have followed.”74This famous opening sentence in the preface to the first edition, dated May 1946, one year after VE Day and Braudel’s release from a German prisoner‐of‐war camp, resonates in Braudel’s remarks during a 1981 interview thirty‐five years later on his initial excitement at seeing the Mediterranean for the first time in October 1923 at the age of twenty‐one:
               North Africa freed Braudel, like so many earlier enchanted and enthralled romantic travelers, from his provincial complaisance. One can almost hear him chanting Goethe’s 1787 credo on finding one’s true self in the liberating southern sun: “I hardly recognize myself. I feel like a completely different person. Yesterday I thought: ‘Either you used to be mad, or you are now.’”It was for me such a surprise! I did not know the sea, I saw the Mediterranean, avowing that it is a present of the gods! Imagine someone like me who went down the Rhone Valley for the first time, who stopped at Marseille, who embarked on a boat and learned with pleasure that he had sea legs—it was just like that—and abruptly saw the arrival of Algiers on the horizon.… Algiers was the most beautiful city in France, after Paris, and a city itself very different, with, I would say, the beauty of its streets, the extraordinary beauty of its women.… It was hot, there was wine, fish, everything that one wants. For me, I began to live.

Abstract: Richard Lanham,
               Revising Business Prose(1979; New York, 1992), p. 3. In fact, most revision for Lanham aims at cutting words. See also Lanham,Revising Prose(1982; Boston, 2000). The importance of concision as a norm of writing would be easy to demonstrate in the vast majority of writing manuals between Spencer and Lanham. Typical of these is McDonald,English and Science,pp. 107–13. McDonald offers conciseness as “the cardinal secret of style,” and is even more radical in his feats of pruning than Lanham, reducing a paragraph of one hundred words to fourteen. This tradition had already reached a reductio ad absurdum by the 1940s in the work of Rudolph Flesch, who devised the famous “readability index,” a simple correlation between words per sentence, syllables per word, and “ease” or “readabilty.” See Rudolph Flesch,The Art of Readable Writing(New York, 1949). In the readability index one can see the ancestor of the various computer software programs since devised to catch writing in the act, as it were, of transgressing the norm of concision. It will be evident from my discussion below that the readability index and its software programs confuse concision with clarity or reduce the latter to an effect of the former.<br>

Abstract: Working from the above, it is clear that meaning is created at the level of a word; that is, an interpretation finds expression as a form of language, one level of which is the word. At the level of a sentence, more meaning is created, for a sentence is more than just an aggregate of words. At the level of two or more sentences, brought together, the beginnings of a narrative emerge, and again we have new meaning created. That is, a narrative is more meaningful than an aggregation of the meanings in individual sentences.<br>

Abstract: Ibid., 65. According to Tesauro, Augustine interprets the biblical passage as “parebit triumphale vexillum.” This sentence is not in Augustine. The closest quotation is in Augustine’s
            De symbolo(PL, 40, sermo 4, caput 5, 664): “Crux illa fidelibus non est opprobium, sedtriumphus. Crux illavexillumnostrum est contra adversarium nostrum diabolum” (my emphasis).<br>

Abstract: A major factor at work in this growth of footnotes is the proliferation of poststructuralist theoretical approaches.
      Critical Inquirywas founded in 1974 by a group of neo‐Aristotelian literary critics, whose motto may have been the sentence that appeared on the journal’s table of contents page for its first volume: “A voice of reasoned inquiry into significant creations of the human spirit.” But it was founded in a contentious time when terms likevoice, reasoned, inquiry, significant,andhumanwere all up for debate. J. Hillis Miller first identified the Yale school inThe New Republicin 1975, and, equally significantly, he defined an oppositional camp as well, citing Helen Vendler and James Kincaid as New Critics. In theGeorgia Review(1976) he talked at greater length about the Yale school, prompting a response from Murray Krieger in theNew Republic, who then critiqued Derrida’s work inNew Literary Historyin the same year. Thus, by its fourth volume,CIpublished an overview by Wallace Martin of the theory battles thus far, prompting a critical rejoinder from the Yale school critic Geoffrey Hartman.14Very early on, then, what the editors of the journal thought should be read, analyzed, and footnoted (“significant creations of the human spirit”) gave ground to what was happening in the larger intellectual arena.<br>

Abstract: The equality clause has implications not only for interaction within religions but also for dealings between religions. Let us take the example of the Vatican document
            Dominus Jesus, a declaration of the Catholic Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith from 2000, which, we know, testifies to undiminished exclusivism and endeavors to prevent syncretic tendencies.33Does this also imply a prohibition of interreligious dialogue? Not explicitly, but in spirit it does. This document says that dialogue with other religions should be conducted according to the principles of freedom and equality (no. 22). With regard to freedom, it refers to the aforementioned, halfhearted statement of Vatican II about freedom of religion, and when it comes to equality one also needs to be watchful. The document defines equality as follows: “Equality, which is a presupposition of inter‐religious dialogue, refers to the equal personal dignity of the parties in dialogue, not to doctrinal content, nor even less to the position of Jesus Christ—who is God himself made man—in relation to the founders of the other religions” (no. 22). Although this document mentions human dignity, it does so in a way that is entirely indifferent to the beliefs of adherents of other religions and the rites in which these beliefs are expressed. The same sentence reveals the crux of the problem: the position of Jesus Christ “who is God himself made man,” as the document puts it in terms of a “christology from above.” The next phrase is no less noteworthy. It does not state: “Jesus Christ … in relation to the other founders of religions,” but “in relation to the founders of the other religions.” Jesus is elevated above the founders of other religions in a unique and absolute manner as qualitatively superior.<br>

Abstract: Based on this analysis of the cremation of Dimitrov, the author concluded: “Thus, we witness in Sofia a more archaic form of dealing with the symbols and monuments of the old regime. The enemy is burnt in effigy, and there is a dance of celebratory oblivion around the fire.”
         54This latter sentence must be an allusion to the so‐called dances of thenestinari,walking barefooted and in a trance on burning coal, which have been convincingly interpreted as an ancient Thracian and Greek ritual. These dances had been preserved into this century in some outlying areas of the Strandzha Mountains in southwestern Bulgaria, and in the last few communist decades they were revived exclusively as part of a commercial enterprise: they were favored stage shows in cabarets and restaurants catering to foreign tourists, one of the few sources of a steady flow of hard currency for the major Bulgarian tourist agency, Balkanturist.<br>

Author(s): Scimeca Ross<br>
Abstract: What value does the correspondence theory of truth have for librarianship? There is no question that this theory is accepted by most people, be they scientists, social workers, or factory workers. Although the correspondence theory is essentially the common‐sense view of truth, there are three major problems that are of concern to librarianship. The first problem arises with regard to the notion of states of affairs. Since this notion pertains to the ontological verifiability in the actual world, what then of fictions? Consider the following sentence: “Hamlet was poisoned by Claudius.” This statement is true given that we have Shakespeare’s play describing such an event, but this is not a real state of affairs. It did not happen in history and cannot be verified in any historical chronicle. One way a correspondence theorist can eliminate this problem about fictions is through the notion of possible worlds. Within this framework, every literary work constitutes a determined possible world where both true and false statements can be made. This is metaphysically cumbersome. It would also cause a further problem. One would have no justification for making statements comparing two or more works of fiction. The practice of literary criticism would become very restrictive.<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Article Title: Dickens and the Narratography of Closure<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 589491<br>
2008<br>
Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: In conjuring up the conceptual field of such effects, we might turn to set theory and picture a Venn diagram by which narratography is defined as exactly the zone of overlap between narratology and stylistics. Narratography would be shaded in there by the very shadings and incremental gradations of prose in the thick and thin of its own action as linguistic incident. Here emerges, in sum, the heuristic value of a so-called
         Story Left Behindin staging by exaggeration the everyday wake of narrativity in verbal process. Any narrative sentence may have its dramatic prehistory. It need not necessarily be distended or suddenly truncated, not by definition brutal or suppressed or moving or any one thing in particular, and not necessarily longer than the plotted tension of the preceding paragraph or even sentence. But narrative prehistory is manifest as a forward pressure nonetheless. That's why this essay's approach is in fact “narratival” rather than strictly stylistic (whatever that might mean)—and often dialectical as such. And why its instinct for intensive reading comes into sync with the impetus of plotted structure rather than just local representation. And why, further, even in imagining an entire shadow plot, the inflated exception developed in the fictional phase of this essay can still prove the rule of the minuscule. Whole lives, of course, don't usually lie battered, absented, and returned by deformation under the tread of suchfrictionin prose. Broad swaths of plot aside, it is rather in the immediate pace of reading that some aspect or facet of an advancing story is often bent noticeably out of shape. Narratography becomes, in this sense, the tracking of syntax and of the words it marshals for the impinging microplots, one after the other, of their own proximate backstories.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Balsamo Gian<br>
Abstract: Neuroscience explains in sum individual volition, a mental function or faculty that was traditionally attributed to the transcendental soul, by reduction, that is, in terms of neuronal structures of genetic or epigenetic derivation. Yet, the neuroactivity of these structures is not propositional; that is, it is not lived through affectively in the first person, nor does it display itself in narrative terms; it can only be mapped propositionally from a third‐person perspective. As an example of this sort of descriptive mapping—applied to the simpler process of perception, though, not to volition—Gerald Edelman formulates propositionally a cat’s perceptual map with the following sentence: “Cerebellum and basal ganglia active in pattern [q], premotor and motor regions active in pattern [r], and subcorticalities in visual maps active in patterns x, y, and z.” The specific terminology adopted in this paratactic, third‐person description is irrelevant to our discussion, of course. (But for the sake of correct representation, it is important to emphasize the inclusiveness of the term “pattern,” repeated several times: it is a recent discovery of neuroscience that an external stimulus may pattern the same perceptual output in an individual brain [and
         a maggior ragionein distinct brains] even when it triggers the interaction of different neurons and neuronal groups. In this regard, Edelman defines the termdegeneracyas “the ability of structurally different elements of [the brain] to perform the same function or yield the same output.”)7Relevant to our discussion is the idea that the propositional mapping of a human being’s decision making would have to recur to an analogous, third‐person parataxis and catalogue of patterns, as those adopted in the cat example (admittedly enriched to a degree of inclusiveness—of neuronal clusters pertinent to perception, memory, attention, intention, prediction, mood, etc.—far beyond the threshold of current neurological knowledge).<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673750<br>
Date: 08 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: Hanford, whose edition I cite, clearly segregates the three intersecting voices through his use of double and single quotation marks. But do these marks adequately reflect what happens in this climactic scene? Stanley Fish describes it: “‘Tempt not the Lord thy God; he said.’ Who said? The Son, of course, since the sounds issue from his mouth, but the words are not his…except in the sense that he has identified himself with their speaker. It is not that he appropriates the words, but that they, and their source, appropriate him.”
         
               The great critical question about these two lines is whether, when Jesus says “Tempt not the Lord thy God,” he simply means the Father or whether he now understands his true identity and is essentially telling Satan, “don’t tempt me.”43
            
               Fish’s reading is helpful because it redirects the thorny theological questions of substance, essence, and consubstantiation to the simpler question of quotation. The Son is able to speak the words of the Father so selflessly that he merges with the divine source, becoming the Word of God. We might say that Jesus begins the sentence in quotation marks but that the Son concludes them in his own voice—just as Adam begins speaking the words of Satan only to discover that they are unfortunately his own. In both cases, Milton demands something beyond the powers of our everyday typographical equipment. What we need in such instances is a mark to signify diminishing quotation—the process whereby words attributed to another gradually become, in the act of enunciation, the speaker’s own. If44
            Paradise Lostillustrates how easily this may happen in the case of satanic speech,Paradise Regainedoffers the possibility that it can work in the opposite direction. When the Son speaks, the divisive quotes miraculously slip away as the human and the divine merge in the space of a single utterance. This is the nature of real union with God on the poem: you start qu~<br>

Abstract: The intention to use durable materials for the Western Hills Cemetery complex is expressed throughout the text of the Prospect. First, it criticizes existing cemeteries as "dilapidated. . . and neglected," and states the need for a structure of a more enduring character. It also states the ambition to surpass the Palace of Fine Arts in beauty in the same sentence as it acknowledges that, as an exhibition pavilion, the palace had been designed as a temporary structure. The Prospect also discusses the issue of permanence in the two of the four "prime requirements" of its "General Scheme": "2nd—That it shall be permanent both structurally and in the sense that its beauty, importance, and interest will make it inviolated (sic) against molestation in any manner.. . . 4th—That it shall be of a type that will not only endure, but increase in charm and interest with age."<br>

Issue: i309685<br>
Date: 8 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Jeff<br>
Abstract: This article suggests that two distinct modes of text-building constraints coincide in the Indonesian novel "Surabaya." The first set of constraints consists of narrative functions that shape sentence-level grammar within the story; the second level of text-building constraints shapes the thematic structure of the story. The author argues that, unlike its narrative structure, which is bound by the linearity of time, the thematic structure, of "Surabaya" is defined by a hierarchy of "heavier" and "lighter" themes, the "heavier" themes being evoked more often than are the "lighter" themes. He suggests that heaviness of theme is a strategy of text building found in classical Malaysian (Hikayat) texts, gamelan orchestra musical organization, and in calendric reckoning in much of Indonesia. He argues, in sum, for a method of writing that encourages grammatical description from two or more perspectives. "Binocular vision," to use Gregory Bateson's words, is necessary in writing to provide a more honest, richer description of a text than a single mode of grammatical description can provide; it makes available to readers more than one means of access to the text.<br>

Abstract: Dans la lignée ouverte par Kant, la théorie moderne du droit tend à proposer une conception formaliste, procédurale de la justice, espérant ainsi l'arracher au débat sur les valeurs. Mais peut-on faire l'économie d'une conception plus substantielle des biens, même s'il faut en assumer le pluralisme? La réflexion de Paul Ricœur propose ici de reprendre les diverses instances de la justice (les lois, mais aussi les institutions de la justice, le juge et la sentence) à la lumière de ce débat. Et plaide pour ce qu'on pourrait appeler un « formalisme incarné ».<br>

Abstract: This paper deals with clause linkage and the concept of "sentence" in French linguistics. We claim that the modern definition of "sentence" is deceptive, as it gives more importance to syntaxic features than graphic features. First, we dwell on recent history of the term "sentence", then we argue that syntaxic domains must be distinguished from graphic chunks we call "sentences". Finally, we take a look at how clause chaining and written segments interact with each other. Cette contribution s'attache à réévaluer la pertinence de la notion de phrase, entendue dans un sens graphique, pour traiter certains phénomènes de liaison de prédications à l'écrit. Nous revenons d'abord sur l'histoire récente de la notion de phrase, puis nous proposons de distinguer les unités syntaxiques et graphiques avant d'interroger les rapports entre liaison de prédications et segmentation graphique.<br>

Abstract: Michel Riffaterre, The Semiotics of Poetry (TJloomington, Ind., 1978):
"The poem results from the transformation of the matrix, a minimal and literal
sentence, into a longer, complex and non-literal periphrasis. The matrix is hypo-
thetical being only the grammatical and lexical actualization of a structure. The
matrix may be epitomized in one word, in which case the word will not appear
in the text. It is always actualized in successive variants; the form of these is
governed by the first or primary actualization, the model. Matrix, model, and text
are variants of the same structure" (p. 19).<br>

Author(s): Wilden Dave<br>
Abstract: This paper examines a theoretical perspective on the ways in which children progress in learning mathematics. It suggests that there is a difficulty in associating teaching discourses with the mathematics they locate. This can result in an incommensurability between alternative perspectives being offered. The paper resists attempts to privilege any particular account but rather demands an analysis of these discourses and their presuppositions. In developing these themes the paper invokes Ricoeur's analysis of time and narrative as an analytical approach to treating notions such as transition, development and progression in mathematical learning. His notion of semantic innovation is introduced. This embraces both the introduction of a new metaphor into a sentence or the creation of a new narrative which reorganises events into a new 'plot'. The notion is utilised in arguing that the shift in the student's mathematical development from arithmetic to first order linear equations with unknowns reconfigures the contextual parameters governing the understanding of these mathematical forms. It is also utilised in showing how alternative approaches to accounting for such transitions suit different and perhaps conflicting outcomes. For example, demonstrating awareness of generality or performing well in a diagnostic test featuring the solution of linear equations.<br>

Abstract: Partindo de alguns pressupostos que explicitam a questão nuclear da "instância do sujeito" na obra de Ricoeur (anteriores ou contemporâneos ao debate com o estruturalismo), e que tipificam a via filosófica ricoeuriana, e partindo também da articulação axial do pensamento de Lévi-Strauss (relacionada com esse debate), são depois propostos os tópicos dessa controvérsia. Tais tópicos, que se desenvolvem em torno dos elementos já considerados, gravitam à volta da inteligibilidade do sentido e do sentido da inteligibilidade, da complementaridade dos métodos, e dos níveis semiológico e semântico, este último estabelecido mediante a pregnância da frase na linguagem, e da palavra (mot) como operador entre a estrutura e o acontecimento. /// La présente analyse commence par mettre en relief quelques présupposés qui explicitent la question nucléaire de "l'instance du sajet" dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur (présupposés antérieurs ou contemporains du débat avec le structuralisme) et qui caractérisent le chemin philosophique de celui-ci; on prend également pour point de départ l'articulation centrale de la pensée de Lévi-Strauss relative à ce débat, afin de proposer ensuite les lignes mai-tresses de cette controverse. Ces lignes maitresses, qui se développent autour des éléments déjà mentionnés, gravitent autour de l'intelligibilité du sens et du sens de l'intelligibilité, de la complémentarité des méthodes et des niveaux sémiologique et sémantique, en établissant ce dernier niveau par le biais de la prégnance de la phrase dans le langage, et du mot comme opérateur entre la structure et l'événement. /// After presenting the presuppositions which underlie a question which is central to Ricoeur's work, "the subject as act, as instance", and which exemplify Ricoeur's way of doing philosophy, as well as presenting Lévi-Strauss' thought concerning this question, the article proposes the fundamental topics which define the controversy.

Abstract: The construction of a meta-discourse in order to describe interior monologues (IM) cuts across narratologic and linguistic approaches. It varies according to whether the purpose is to establish a typology based on their wider representation or to provide a linguistic analysis restricted to reported speech. The paper highlights the persistent under-rating of a phenomenon close to the IM, and related to the "unspeakable sentence", that of "the point of view". The represented "point of view" and the free indirect speech have coexisted since the second half of the 19th. However, unlike as in the IM, these forms are not clearly differentiated as dual forms of the expression of the inner speech. Consequently, inner speech (at least as a theory issued from literary experience) is reduced to the relatively homogeneous form of the "interior speech" or "flow of consciousness". But this representation is under the influence of enormous tensions as literary manifestations of inner speech are more varied than the phrase IM gives to understand.<br>

Abstract: Metaphors are expressions in artificial, contrived, alien languages, and we understand metaphors by constructing translation schemes linking our natural, literal languages to these theoretically contrived metaphorical languages. The relation between a literal natural language and a metaphorical contrived language is like the relationship between a natively known language and a system of subsequently acquired languages etymologically emerging from that basic natural language. This model for understanding metaphorically contrived language is kin to the familiar model explaining how speakers of a language such as Latin may come to decipher a language like Spanish through projecting to Spanish what they know of Latin without the aid of a translation manual. A metaphor is, thus, seen as a sentence in a nonnatural language, itself derived from and at least partially translatable with the natural, literal language of the metaphor's author or audience. Les métaphores sont des expressions relevant de langues artificielles, construites, étrangères et nous les comprenons en construisant des schémas de traduction reliant notre langue naturelle littérale à ces langues métaphoriques théoriquement construites. La relation entre une langue naturelle littérale et une langue métaphorique construite est analogue à la relation entre une langue acquise primitivement et un système de langues apprises ensuite et qui dérivent étymologiquement de cette langue de base. Ce modèle, qui permet de comprendre un langage métaphorique construit, est apparenté au modèle familier expliquant comment les gens qui possèdent une langue telle que le latin arrivent à déchiffrer une langue telle que l'espagnol en projetant sur l'espagnol ce qu'ils savent du latin sans recourir à un dictionnaire. Une métaphore est donc considérée comme une phrase d'une langue non naturelle, dérivée elle-même de et au moins en partie traductible dans la langue naturelle littérale de l'auteur de la métaphore ou de ses lecteurs~<br>

Abstract: The use of metaphor, transposed from small to large units of speech is analogical to the structuralist transfer of the laws of language organisation from units of levels below the sentence to units of an order above or equal to the sentence. The metaphor can be defined as a word in counterdetermining context. The unconventional contextual use of the metaphoric term creates a tension which can be explained in terms of the interaction view of metaphor. The metaphor functions as a contextual filter which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the principal subject by implying statements about it that normally apply to the subsidiary subject. The contextualisation of a text can be defined as a text in counter-determining context. The tension between text and contemporary context or discourse is reminiscent of the tension between vehicle and frame in the metaphor. The contextualisation functions as contextual filter of the text which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the context or discourse by implying statements about it that normally apply to the text in its conventional or original context or discourse. As an activity, the metaphor, as well as the contextualisation has socio-political significance since it is determined by the discourse of the reader or contextualiser.<br>

Abstract: Textual memory can be explained by taking into account how the reading process works. In order to make narrative sense, reading is dependent on remembering what came before the present sentence—the past events of the reading—and assessing this memory in the present reading situation. Wolfgang Iser writes that “what has been read shrinks in the memory to a foreshortened background, but it is being constantly evoked in a new context” (111). Reading does not merely flow forward, but the recalled segments also have a retroactive effect, with the present transforming the past. The deliberate use of past narration in order to create a specific effect in present narration invokes the reader's
      textual memory. Menakhem Perry writes in his illuminating article “Literary Dynamics: How the Order of a Text Creates Its Meanings” that “a ‘backward’ directed activity, even only in the mind, plays a major role in the reading-process” (58). He makes the important distinction between retrograde movements that are forced more explicitly by the text through flashbacks or narrative directions toward past narrative events and more implicit patterns in the present text that, in conjunction with the reader's own investments, trigger past textual memories.

Abstract: Another form of
         incrementumis when “a succession of details, each stronger than the last, occurs in a continuous passage without any break in the sentence,” for example, “Vomiting is revolting even when not in an assembly, … even if not an assembly of the people, … even if it were not, … if he was doing, … if he was doing, … even if it were not” (2001, 8.4.8–8.4.9). In a more extreme form, Derrida states: “Even if the totality of what I think, … even if the totality of the world, … even if nonmeaning….Even if I do notin factgrasp the totality” (1978, 56–57). Each “even if” statement incrementally builds on the previous one until finally culminating in the excessive impossibility of “madness” and “the demonic.” Hyperbole is also expressed through the other forms of amplification, butincrementumoffers a ready example based on the hyperbolic arguments I have already presented. Hyperbole is a specific movement of amplification toward impossible heights and depths when expressed in terms of excess and extremity. It is, of course, a matter of degree.<br>

Abstract: In
         Time and Narrative, Ricoeur aligns the first stage of the hermeneutic circle, mimesis1, with the function of “prefiguration.” This concept describes the way in which narratives are “emplotted” according to “a preunderstanding of the world of action” (1984, 1:54). Ricoeur explains that preunderstanding has three primary features that affect the composition of a plot: meaningful structures, symbolic resources, and temporal character. The “meaningful structures” to which he refers can also be understood as a “conceptual network” of actions, people, events, stories, and the like. Just as words in a sentence constitute the level of semantic composition, the building blocks of activity in a narrative constitute a “semantics of action.” When writing of mimesis1, Ricoeur concentrates on the resources available within the context in which the text was produced rather than on describing how texts exhibit a semantics of action. It is in this cultural context that he locates the latent possibilities for emplotting action in a narrative. The “symbolic resources” are the ingredients of emplotment in a narrative, much as nouns, verbs, and objects are the ingredients of a sentence. Which types of resources are publicly available for representing human action? What are the various formulations for embedding human action in the unfolding of time? That is, what is the “temporal character” of narratives? How are human beings within a given cultural and historical context predisposed to understand the relation of human beings and human activities to time? How is time itself conceived in the society? Each of these elements—structures, symbols, and temporality—contributes to the prefiguration of the field of understanding wherein a narrative is emplotted (1984, 1:54–64).<br>

Abstract: Gastronomical practice and his dramaturgical philosophy charmingly intertwine in his 1897 review of John T. Day's explicitly antivegetarian play
      The Fanatic. In it, Shaw expresses his bemusement with “a dramatist who makes the whole interest of his play depend on a passionate faith in the nutritiousness of a cutlet and a glass of wine.”
            Its plot concerns a young woman newly married to a rabid vegetarian and teetotaler who immediately proceeds to feed her such enormous quantities of meatless fare that only, as Shaw writes, “if she were an elephant working out a sentence of hard labor [would] she … possibly be able to get exercise enough to keep pace” (352–53). (The playwright himself had outlined the perils of such overeating in an 18867
         Pall Mall Gazetteop-ed titled “Failures of Inept Vegetarians.”) When she sickens, a doctor is called in who earnestly if predictably prescribes cutlets and wine. Clear in its answer to, in Shaw's words, the “question … of cucumbers versus corpses” (354),The Fanaticculminates in the doctor's impulsive elopement proposition to his patient and the husband's mysterious yet gracious gesture of dropping dead.<br>
