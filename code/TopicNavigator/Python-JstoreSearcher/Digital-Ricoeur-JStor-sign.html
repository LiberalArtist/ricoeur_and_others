                  wa jaʿalnā min al-māʾi kulla shayʾ in ḥayyin,21:30); it is implicit in Genesis I, where the earth and the heavens are created by a division of the waters; it forms a basic truth claim in modern astronomical science, so that the mere presence of water on a planet may be a sign of life; it is found in many creation myths and much common sense. Thales, who launched the great adventure of Greek philosophy, also affirmed as much. There is<br>

  Abstract: Even in its early, tentative stages, the signing poetry emerging as an aspect of the ʺculture of the deafʺ challenges some of our cherished preconceptions about poetry and its relation to human speech. Ameslan (American Sign Language) represents, literally, a poetry without sound and, for its practitioners, a poetry without access to that experience of sound as voice that weʹve so often taken as the bedrock of all poetics and all language. In the real world of the deaf, then, language exists as a kind of writing in space and as a primary form of communication without reference to any<br>

To speak of the beginning, therefore, is to begin always in the middle, to begin at the beginning that is not beginning. But how do we speak of the middle? Surely from the middle.

  Abstract: At the close of the nineteenth century, Egypt was a place marked by rapid intellectual, political, economic, and cultural changes. It was an extremely dynamic era. None of the changes that occurred in the period can be explained by a single ideology (nationalism, Pan-Islamism, constitutionalism) or a fixed set of abstract intellectual agendas (positivism, Darwinism, Spenserism), and it is very important to acknowledge the diversity of thought that is to be found in the thinking of this period.

  Abstract: Even though Jesus proclaimed a gospel of peace (Matthew 10:12–13; Luke 10:5; John 14:27; 20:19, 21, 26), Christians have repeatedly engaged in violent conflicts both with their neighbors in other religious traditions and with other Christians. Christian warriors have worn the sign of the cross in battle and have often seen themselves as fighting on behalf of God’s cause; they have cited biblical passages to justify violent assaults, inquisitions, and persecutions. Christians have also invoked the Bible to place limits on violence or to end violence altogether.<br>

Although it begins with an attempt at deciphering, the passage quite deliberately escorts us into a different precinct:what happens to us when we read, or, as we might also say,what our reading makes happen. Granted, it is probably more customary to think of what we do when standing before a headstone as something other than “reading.” It is not quite scanning, which we routinely perform when we see a billboard or sign.

  Abstract: Nietzsche is fundamentally concerned with the circuitous and deceptive character of our relations to things, and with the transcendence of actuality to our representations of it at the level of the signifier. But to a semiotician, the distinction between linguistic activity and extralinguistic reality is naive, and so I turn to Umberto Eco’s more doggedly semiotic approach to this distinction in
                  A Theory of Semiotics. Eco divides semiotics into two parts: the theory of codes or signification and the theory of sign-production or language use.Codedesignates the system of rules that “generate signs as concrete occurrences in communicative intercourse.”¹<br>

As a condition for refuge in Denmark, however, any writer granted “refuge” under the umbrella of ICORN now has to sign a rather peculiar document—a “Declaration on recognition of the fundamental values of the Danish society” (cf.

  Abstract: In

Her remarkable argument may leave one question unanswered: how, in the end, do we learn from what she calls “the heterological historian” how to respond to the needs of this otherwise forgotten voice? I believe this apparent omission may be more adequately identified as a sign of modesty, of two sorts. I will suggest that, if we press the logic of her argument in ways she does<br>

  Book Title: The Experience of God: A Postmodern Response-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: The book provides a series of approaches to the ancient question of whether and how God is a matter of experience,or, alternately, to what extent the notion of experience can be true to itself if it does not include God. On the one hand, it seems impossible to experience God: the deity does not offer Himself to sense experience. On the other hand, there have been mystics who have claimed to have encountered God. The essays in this collection seek to explore the topic again, drawing insights from phenomenology, theology, literature, and feminism. Throughout, this stimulating collection maintains a strong connection with concrete rather than abstract approaches to God.The contributors: Michael F. Andrews, Jeffrey Bloechl, John D. Caputo, Kristine Culp, Kevin Hart, Kevin L. Hughes, Jean-Yves Lacoste, Crystal Lucky, Renee McKenzie, Kim Paffenroth, Michael Purcell, Michael J. Scanlon, O.S.A., James K. A. Smith.

  Book Title: Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): MACKENDRICK KARMEN<br>
  Abstract: Theology usually appears to us to be dogmatic, judgmental, condescending, maybe therapeutic, or perhaps downright fantastical-but seldom enticing. Divine Enticement takes as its starting point that the meanings of theological concepts are not so much logical, truth-valued propositions-affirmative or negative-as they are provocations and evocations. Thus it argues for the seductiveness of both theology and its subject-for, in fact, infinite seduction and enticement as the very sense of theological query. The divine name is one by which we are drawn toward the limits of thought, language, and flesh. The use of language in such conceptualization calls more than it designates. This is not a flaw or a result of vagueness or imprecision in theological language but rather marks the correspondence of such language to its subject: that which, outside of or at the limit of our thought, draws us as an enticement to desire, not least to intellectual desire. Central to the text is the strange semiotics of divine naming, as a call on that for which there cannot be a standard referent. The entanglement of sign and body, not least in interpretations of the Christian incarnation, both grounds and complicates the theological abstractions. A number of traditional notions in Christian theology are reconceived here as enticements, modes of drawing the desires of both body and mind: faith as "thinking with assent"; sacraments as "visible words" read in community; ethics as responsiveness to beauty; prayer as the language of address; scripture as the story of meaning-making. All of these culminate in a sense of a call to and from the purely possible, the open space into which we can be enticed, within which we can be divinely enticing.<br>

  Abstract: Ethical speaking is a strange, intercut mode of address and listening. As some of the peculiarities of the sign are made vivid in thinking of sacraments as divine signs, so too the strangeness of speaking is especially evident when it calls upon an infinite addressee. In considering the peculiarity of prayer as an address from finite to infinite, I have followed Nancy, for whom “The singular address to a singular God—my god!—is prayer in general.”¹ The singular address links prayer to love, with an echo of Augustine’s “what then do I love when I love my God?”² But<br>

  Book Title: A Godly Humanism-Clarifying the Hope That Lies Within<br>
  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): George Francis Cardinal<br>
  Abstract: For Francis Cardinal George, the Catholic Church is not a movement, built around ideas, but a communion, built around relationships. In A Godly Humanism, he shares his understanding of the Church in lively, compelling prose, presenting a way to understand and appreciate the relationships of God to human beings and of human beings to one another. These loving relationships are continually made present to us in and through the Church, from the time of Jesus' first disciples down to our own day. We are introduced to how the spiritual and intellectual life of Christians, aided in every generation by the Holy Spirit working through the Apostles and their successors, resist the danger of splitting apart from one another. Though they take different outward forms at different times, both wisdom and holiness are made possible for every Christian of every station of life. Sign-posting his conversation by the milestones of his own spiritual and intellectual journey, Cardinal George invites us to view the Church and her history in ways that go beyond the categories of politics - through which we find merely human initiative, contrivance, and adjustment - and rather to see the initiative as God's first and foremost. God is the non-stop giver, we are non-stop recipients of his gifts, and the recent popes, no less than the Father of the Church, have made every effort to make us aware of the graces - that is, of the unearned benefits - that God confers on us as Catholics, as Christians, as believers, and simply as human persons. Pope Francis, he reminds us, contrasts human planning with God's providence, and this book is at once an exposition of that providence and a personal response of gratitude for the way it has operated in one man's life.<br>

  Abstract: The Pool of Siloam is one of the biblical sites adjacent to the Old City of Jerusalem that has been pointed out to visitors and pilgrims for centuries. It lies south of the Old City at the tip of the Ophel Ridge, in what is now the Arab village of Silwan. The pool is known locally by its Arab name, the Birkat Silwan. Visitors to the pool are directed to a fenced-in area near a Muslim school. A small, rusty sign identifies the place as the Pool of Siloam. In order to get near the pool itself, one must enter<br>

  Author(s) Schuck Michael J.<br>
  Abstract: One way to understand the Roman Catholic Church in Lithuania during the period of Soviet oppression is through a historical-theological lens. This approach begins with the position, restated in the Second Vatican Council document
                     Lumen Gentium, that the Church is not just a social institution but also “a kind of sacrament or sign of intimate union with God, and of the unity of all humankind.” Because the Church lives this sacramentality in history, a full interpretation of that life must be sensitive to both the historical and the theological dimensions of its existence.<br>

  Abstract: In my book
                  Architecture and the Crisis of Modern Science, I described how Western architecture was profoundly affected by the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century, revealing a set of intentions that were wholly modern long before the material changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution.¹ In relation to perception and cognition, an initial consequence of that momentous transformation in European thinking was the incorporation of René Descartes’s dualistic epistemology/psychology into an understanding of how architecture communicates. This assumption had far-reaching consequences, opening the door for a subsequent understanding of architecture as a “sign,” whose meaning was articulated as the<br>

  Abstract: At the time of writing the centenary of the outbreak of the Great War is rapidly approaching. Notwithstanding the often tumultuous events of the twentieth century, the war still enjoys a unique status as a watershed in modern British history, and interest in it shows no sign of abating. On the contrary, not least as a result of the continuing growth in family history, interest in grandfather’s war and great-grandfather’s war ensures that it lives on in contemporary society. And yet the Great War has become a part of history in the sense that the passing of the last men<br>

  Abstract: It is possible that the reason so many “turns” can be claiming to change the field is, ironically, because they are not really changing much at all, but instead shifting the same methodologies and attitudes from one object (or “ideology”) to another. One sign that this might be the case is the increasing number of critics wondering about the contemporary viability of “critique,” shorthand for the righteous digging around in a text for hidden displacements of the social struggles that evade all but the politically savvy and serious critic.

  Abstract: The recent revolution in cognitive science has investigated how human minds make sense of our experience, uncovering the ways we find meaning in everything from various shapes to blinking lights. Cognitive linguistics is part of this revolutionary discovery. The study of cognitive linguistics began in the 1970s and is an influential approach to meaning construction used by an international body of scholars.¹ Cognitive linguistics examines how we think about the entire range of human experience, including causation, motion, time, relationships, entities, and emotions.² The research is interdisciplinary in nature, involving fields such as psychology, anthropology, neuroscience, philosophy, sign language, and<br>

  Abstract: The occlusion of the mother’s smile is the death of sacramental presence. The mother’s smile is the kiss of Being, the sign or symbol of all that is gratuitous, all that is gift, and therefore all that is non-calculative, nonmechanical, and non-violent. Its erasure therefore erodes the sacramental foundation of grace. A sacramental “sign,” it is also a phenomenological and metaphysical sign, a “real,” existent form from which breaks forth the splendor of the depths of Being. It signifies the permanence of the truth, goodness, and beauty of the created order. As form, it also refers to infinity, for “it<br>

This chapter considers five discourses that are not conventionally consulted for input on theological hope: nihilism, lament, disability, feminist theory, and feminist theology. The philosophical and critical theory conversation of nihilism and its relative, indeterminism or undecidability, suggests a kind of hope without over-confident claims of knowable hopes for the future. Scriptural and extra-scriptural lament demonstrates a persistent and apparently futile hope that continues into and through death with no sign of God’s response or rescue.

Nothing blocks a gift more than the knowledge that it is a gift; Christ’s words to the Samaritan woman—“If you knew the gift of God” (John 4:10)—are less a sign of nostalgia for ancestral knowledge than thoughtfulness concerning a desire that, in essence, could destroy the gift.

Preaching was not made to live. At most, preaching is a witness, a sign, a crimson X marking a demolition site. The church has developed sophisticated technologies in modernity to give preaching the semblance of life, belying the truth: preaching was born under a death sentence. It was born to die. Only when preaching embraces its own death is it able to truly live.<br>

  Author(s) Felson Nancy<br>
  Abstract: One of Charles S. Peirce’s fundamental contributions to the study of sign processes is to provide an analytic vocabulary for describing the intersecting vectors involved in all semiosis, a vector of the “representation” of some object by expressive signs that stand for it and a vector of “determination” of this sign relationship by subsequent interpreting signs, what he called “interpretants.” One way to visualize the temporal linkage of these two vectors is to consider how the same interpretants look “backward” at the signs that determine them, especially as they creatively construe or apprehend the original sign relation as having a<br>

  Abstract: As we have seen, western narrative frequently inhibits expression of American Indian realities, but contemporary Indian authors are adept in their strategies for expanding the semiotic range of western sign systems. Indeed, all semiotic forms are potentially subject to reimbrication of the sort we have considered in Chapters Two and Three. Spatial and temporal codes inscribed within narrative forms constitute particularly significant challenges to Native American and other ethnic writers in their endeavors to represent worlds not in conformity with western material and mechanical notions of space and time. “Numbers, time, inches, feet.

  Abstract: In 1935, Roman Jakobson noted that all art is influenced by an overarching principle, what the Russian Formalists called the “dominant” (1971 : 82), a structuring orientation characterizing a work or even an entire epoch. Although a narrative may have many functions and embody several forms, an internal hierarchy exists which determines the relative value of its components. The dominant of poetic language is the aesthetic function—its form. Poetry is oriented toward the sign, while prose narrative is directed toward the referent.¹ “Poetic evolution,” says Jakobson, “is a shift in this hierarchy.”<br>

  Author(s) Porter Robert<br>
  Abstract: In Chapter 14, ‘Photography and Poststructuralism: the Indexical and Iconic Sign System’, Edge reflects on how the pecularity of the photographic sign sytem, and the study of photography generally, have been informed by poststructuralist thought in two important respects: one approach is concerned with the unique structure of the photograph, its indexicality; the other with the discursive effect of specific photographs in different locations – the iconic/symbolic element of the photograph. Drawing on the work of Kristeva, as well as an original case study on very early Victorian photography, Edge offers some fresh and very interesting insights on the indexical<br>

  Abstract: One rich and wide-reaching element in language has become the focal point of much study in the past three decades: metaphor. If this element of language has aroused such interest, it is because there has been increasing recognition that all of our concepts are framed within metaphorical terms. Rather than a model of language based upon the linguistic sign (a model which implies that words designate things in the world outside of language), linguists today are more inclined to accept that there exists a figurative substructure to concepts. This in turn helps us to understand that concepts are not extra-lingual<br>

  Abstract: To be ‘Deleuzian’ represents for me a sign, not of recognition between accomplices in the context of something that could function as a ‘Deleuzian school’, but rather a sign of conniving or a ‘sign of intelligence’, according to the expression that Janicaud liked to use. I am thinking of a sign sent, not to a person (even if she is captivating), but rather to the objects that swirl around her – to her themes, her style and mannerisms, her concepts, or, if you prefer it, to the ‘mist that she brings to the room’ of your life when she writes,<br>

  Abstract: The application of neuroscience to fields beyond medicine¹ has been characterized as revolutionary, akin to the industrial and information revolutions (Lynch 2009, 10) and evidence of the birth of a “neurosociety” in which all domains of life and knowledge production are (or soon will be) under the sign of the “neuro.” Each day, it seems, the popular press reports new neuroscientific findings with breathless wonder. Recent headlines have claimed that neuroscience has the power to read our minds (Sample 2007), erase our memories (Carey 2009), predict our propensity for violence (Harrell 2010), and alter the neural fabric of our identities.<br>

  Abstract: The last forty years have seen the emergence of scholarship that attempts to read Attic drama as a visual medium, that is, to understand the extant dramatic texts in the context of Athens’ physical environment, as live performance texts, or in their relationship to the visual arts. Drawing on a variety of disciplines and methodologies, this work demonstrates that the interplay between verbal sign and visual referent in dramatic texts presents a particular challenge to interpretation.² Insofar as the dramatic text refers simultaneously to prior and future phenomena—that is, to the plot and (in principle) to the play in<br>

  Abstract: In phenomenology and classical film theory, “the trace” relates both to the materiality of an imprint and to the experience of an irrevocable past. It is conceived of as an indexical sign, an existential operator interrelating image, history, and memory. Traditionally it is an object, a mark inscribed, or a photograph that bears witness of life or events in the past.<br>

Guittone flourished from around 1255 to 1280, in the period immediately following the one in which Uc was active and the earliest extant troubadour anthologies were compiled, and he had an enormous impact on the literary culture of his day (see Marti, “Ritratto e fortuna di Guittone d’Arezzo”).

Husserl distinguishes between two fundamental kinds of signs: expressions (Ausdrücke), which mean (bedeuten) something or express a meaning (Bedeutung); and indications or indicative signs (Anzeichen), which do not express a meaning. An indicative sign indicates the presence or existence of some object, but it does not express anything: the track of an animal indicates the past presence of the animal, but it does not express the proposition that the animal passed this place.

Abstract: Members respected each other's autonomy too much to drag it into group life or to criticize it in any way. People could talk outside of group settings in ways that they could not in the group. “Staying up `til two talking” was a sure sign of love; it happened only at the moment lovers were falling in love. Talking this way allowed one to discover the true self, hidden deep inside the potential lover, but, after that initial exploration, they considered this dialogue unnecessary. In other words, Buffaloes do not consider anything beyond the individual to be fully real; they believe that what really matters is what is inside, that the tender, flickering “real self” almost never brazenly displays itself in mere words. They shared an obligation to respect that real self instead of stifling it with decorum.<br>

Abstract: 3.
         Indexicality. Philosophers including Immanuel Kant, Charles S. Peirce, and Edmund Husserl have long recognized that there are different types of signs, some of which do not stand for something else (e.g., an idea) but acquire meaning on the basis of some spatiotemporal (or memory) connection with another phenomenon or entity. The meanings of such sign expressions can be arrived at only by taking into consideration the circumstances under which they are used. Typical examples include socalled deictic terms such as the English demonstrativesthisandthatand personal pronouns such asIandyou. For example, the (first person singular) pronounIchanges meaning according to who is speaking or, rather, according to the character that the speaker is impersonating at any given time (Goffman1981[1979]). Using Peirces terminology, we can say that the EnglishIis anindex. An anthropological study of language cannot but be interested in such expressions, given the power that they have in defining what are ultimately socially constructed cultural categories, for example, speaker/sender/author versus listener/addressee/audience. Earlier studies of indexical expressions were based on linguistic forms in idealized situations, but as fieldworkers started to examine language use in culturespecific contexts they realized that every expression is indexicalthat is, needs reference toacontext to be given a culturally adequate interpretation (see also Garfinkel1967).<br>

Abstract: It follows, then, that in the particular case of man, philosophy would have for its task not to correct man’s incomprehensibility, as if it were a defect to overcome, but to preserve it as a privilege to reinforce. But for all of that, can we indeed preserve the incomprehensibility of man as the sign, the proof, and the guarantee of his humanity? How do we avoid the confusions and contradictions implied by this demand? And first and foremost, does a de jure incomprehensibility not lead finally to a simple de facto unknowing? And, since such an unknowing either disappears into a definitive ignorance or disqualifies itself as a poorly formulated question, does it not always just vanish? In short, can one maintain for very long the comprehension of such a fragile incomprehensibility? In order to surmount these difficulties, it would be necessary to found and legitimize the impossibility of defining and comprehending man—and thus to envisage such an impossibility within a new positivity and no longer as a pure and simple defect. How do we do this?<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since h~<br>

Abstract: In
         Gender TroubleButler proposes the idea of gender as a performance constructed in the very act of performing, the performance a challenge to the ubiquity of gender categories. Although at moments Butler alerts readers to the punitive system of gender performances within compulsory social systems, the book proliferates the idea of gender as infinite, individualistic performance, as rebellious carnival, without much attention to the pains and problems of performing (1990, 139). Considerations of race are virtually unaddressed in the book. However, at the end, Butler confronts the epistemology of theories that “elaborate predicates of color, sexuality, ethnicity, class, and able‐bodiedness” and “invariably close with an embarrassed ‘etc.’ at the end of the list” (143). Butler suggests that the “etc.” should not be read as a sign of failure but as a sign of the “illimitable process of signification itself,” the “excess that accompanies any effort to posit identity once and for all” (143). Problematically, what Butler questions here is the idea of an identity prior to signification, not the analogizing of vastly different vectors such as able‐bodiedness and color.<br>

Article Title: Toward a Practical and Normative Ethics for Librarianship<br>

Abstract: One specific example may illustrate how the perceived fact‐value dilemma manifests itself in librarianship. There is much that is of value that derives from the literature and practice of business. It is rational to learn, say, how to alert communities to services and resources and how to listen to community members to assess what impact the library has on their lives. There are valuable suggestions, grounded in empirical inquiry, regarding how to present what the library can offer. Does the value of business contributions translate to a fact, a good, that we should emulate businesses? Is the relationship between value and fact the product of a conscious and deliberate evaluation both of the “theory” of business and market economics and of the cultural, social, intellectual, and educative imperatives of libraries? A practical and normative ethics requires that these two questions be taken very seriously. If the theory of market economics comes to be taken as fact (or good), there are consequences for the profession, for libraries, and for communities. The word “customer” appears frequently in professional discourse but without a clear definition (whereas, in market economics, “customer” means something quite specific). One of the requirements of a practical and normative ethics is the profound contemplation of the uses of language; it is incumbent upon professionals to examine whether “customer” and “community” are congruent or discordant. “Customer” and “community” are theoretical terms, in this loose sense, that are components in a larger cognitive‐professional framework that will affect action. Use of a word or term may have cognitive effects on the ways we think about and work in libraries. Ludwig Wittgenstein offers a cautionary note: “Every sign
      by itselfis dead.Whatgives it life?—In use it isalive. Is life breathed into it there?—Or is theuseits life?” [13, p. 128].<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: It is important to recognize that the historical present as a global unity already marks the coevality and immanence of the noncontemporaneous contemporary moment. A historical present filled with mixed temporalities has always been a condition of capitalist modernization, even as its copresent uncanniness was suppressed by both the authority of the future perfect and the expectations of progress that vowed to raise all societies to the same level. The effect was to displace the uncanny temporal figure to the world outside of Euro‐America and put its societies under the sign of underdevelopment, which announced comparative lack. The force of the collective singular lay in singularizing all plural histories capital encountered along its way and in assimilating them to its exemplar. This return to a perspective of the historical present might allow us to rewind the narrative of acculturation that has reinforced the externality of clock and calendar time to disclose the texture of the uncanniness of mixed temporalities it had smoothed out and straightened.
         21What seems promising about the opening supplied by the present is the specularity of unevenness, which both constitutes its sign and defines its relationship to the industrial societies of Euro‐America, and its capacity to now become the mirror of our own nature. Specifically, this experience among so‐called late developers actually made available to the “enfeebled center” of Euro‐America both the recognition of the temporal immanence of the marginally uneven and the spectacle of its existence in our own backyard.22<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Thus, in the figure of Enoch, Smith found a figure of covenantal hope earlier than Abraham, linked that hope directly to the coming of a messiah, and directed its fulfillment to an end times conditioned on human agency to call down the powers of heaven. The JST’s repetition of the covenant to Noah makes this more explicit. The KJV provides that the bow is a reminder of God’s everlasting covenant with “every living creature” to never again destroy the earth by flood. In contrast, the JST Noah is told the bow is a sign of the covenant with Enoch “that, when men should keep all my commandments, Zion should again come on the earth.”
         86Moreover, as with Enoch himself, those who would realize the promise of the covenant must contribute to its realization by obtaining heavenly powers on a temporal plane. They must “embrace the truth and look upward.” When they do “then shall Zion look downward … [and] shall come down out of heaven and possess the earth, and shall have place till the end come.” These are the terms of “the everlasting covenant” that effects the reconstitution of the bond with the sacred and holds the key to the end of evil. Though this promise of a latter‐day Zion that would receive Enoch’s Zion, as well as partake of its theurgic powers, obtains from the past, as narrativized by Smith, it constitutes a sacred history that oriented the Latter‐day Saints to a particular future. It provided an identity that carried them from New York to the Ohio frontier, through extermination orders in Missouri to exile from Illinois, and finally to the Rocky Mountains, building city after city in hope of Zion.87<br>

Author(s): Reynolds,  Thomas E.<br>
Abstract: Still, the book has significant shortcomings. First, it suffers from a bad case of sprawl. Reynolds attempts to engage the following thinkers at some length: Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Hans‐Georg Gadamer, Jürgen Habermas, Gottfried Herder, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean‐Francois Lyotard, Gabriel Marcel, Paul Ricoeur, Richard Rorty, Friedrich Schleiermacher, Charles Taylor, Paul Tillich, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Dozens more receive passing mention. This, however, is nothing compared to the book’s many arguments. Reynolds forwards vast theses not only in philosophical theology and the theory of religion but also in hermeneutics, epistemology, and ethics. For good measure, we also get a typology of world religions (162) and an interpretation of the Enlightenment (22–41). Sheer breadth, of course, is not necessarily a weakness. It can be an impressive sign of intellectual power and agility. In this case, however, it comes at the expense of nuance. Consequently,
      The Broken Wholesometimes reads more like a term paper for a graduate survey course than a focused monograph.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 605587<br>
Date: 6 2010<br>
Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: While it may be too soon to tell if
         A Secular Agewill prove as influential asSources of the Self, historians have for some time now made productive use of the work that informed Taylor's project—especially that of Gauchet. Of signal importance is David Bell'sThe Cult of the Nation in France, a history of nationalism that draws explicitly on arguments found inThe Disenchantment of the World. Central to Bell's approach is the recognition that the modern French nation “arose simultaneously out of, and in opposition to, Christian systems of belief” as a response to the need “to discern and maintain terrestrial order in the face of God's absence.” Despite what one might assume by following the arguments of Van Kley and Catherine Maire, Bell is careful to note that nationalism owed little to the Gallican orientation of French Jansenism. This tradition might have contributed to “national sentiment,” a feeling of belonging to a community with a shared past and cultural attributes, but not to nationalism itself, which emphasizes instead the necessity of creating the nation in the present and of projecting its will into the future. Rather, what made Jansenism significant was its radical differentiation of the heavenly and temporal spheres, a distinction that produced a gap in which nationalism could form. Thus, Bell presents rhetorical similarities between sixteenth-century Protestant-Catholic polemics and French Anglophobe pamphlets as a sign that “religion was both the great absence and the great hidden presence” in which thepatriefigured as “an object of religious devotion” (Bell, 3–47, 79–105, quotes on 7, 3, 101–2).<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Kitts Margo<br>
Abstract: Catherine Bell, Valerio Valeri, James Fernandez, Roy Rappaport, and Stanley Tambiah are just a handful of established theorists who have promoted the idea that the performances we call “rituals” have as their final effect a form of communication. For Stanley Tambiah, ritual performances communicate certain paradigms of behavior that are recognized by an audience at an iconic level. As Tambiah sees it, pattern recognition is the very foundation of ritual communication, and the patterns that rituals communicate may be understood as “iconic analogues” of primordial acts. By “iconic analogue,” Tambiah appears to rely on American philosopher Charles Peirce: an icon is a sign bearing a relationship to an object in the way that a map bears a relationship to a territory. The territory is fuller than the map, but one can understand the map as lifted, as it were, from the territory but referring back to it and indeed invoking it
         pars pro toto. Some ritual performances, then, lift a kind of iconic analogue from actions conceived as occurring primordially, invoking thempars pro toto.2<br>

Article Title: Critique and Promise in Paul Tillich’s Political Theology: Engaging Giorgio Agamben on Sovereignty and Possibility<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: More, of course, remains to be said about the character of the prophetic and promissory in this scene, the tableau of a table host giving to those who desert him in the moments before his betrayal and eventual execution. Much remains to be developed in conversation with Tillich’s work to continue the work of political reasoning in and with the prophetic, searching for other ways and rationale to take the form or locus of divine promise and the character of the interaction between God’s gift as participation in the divine being, the breath of the Spirit that gives life and the promise that renews all things—all important subjects to which Tillich and others contribute. Nevertheless, the concept of possibility and promised being that we have found can develop and expand a concept of the political that does not include what it excludes, indeed, does not embrace only the abandoned. By finding the sign of the promise, we have discovered that being otherwise than sovereign does not move beyond ordinary sovereignty. It does not seek to dispel the realm of political autonomy with an ecclesial life beyond the realm of nonecclesial humanity. Yet, it recognizes the embrace of the marginal and barbarian that ordinary sovereignty includes by excluding. Finally, owing to the indeterminate character of a promissory note, the pledge, it does not trump, overwhelm, or absorb the world. It rather opens and transforms it from within with its unlooked‐for gift of possibility.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 653501<br>
Date: 08 2010<br>
Author(s): Schildgen Brenda Deen<br>
Abstract: Here, once again we find a collection of verbs in the present, some both reflexives and neologisms, which simultaneously render eternal action and linguistic impossibility (because of the neologisms) while eliding the difference between the actor and action: “s'infiora” (enflower themselves), a neologism; “si ritorna” (return themselves); “s'insapora” (ensavors itself), a second neologism; “s'addorna” (adorns itself); “risaliva” (re-ascends), and “soggiorna” (abides). With the reflexives and the present tense, Dante emphasizes the perpetual movement of angels as they sing God's praises; with the linguistic play of the neologisms he conveys the impossibility of actually describing them; and by likening them to their analogy in the created world, bees, he also heightens our awareness that in the actions of bees we can see something of the divine realm in our world of nature. This focus on the detail of creaturely action, through the verbs and this observable natural environment, once more overcomes the separation between the transcendent and the immanent, sign and signified, vehicle and referent, with the analogy hinting that alterity can become sameness or, as Badiou puts it, poetry's melding with philosophy allows it to bond object and subject and to overcome the rupture between what would otherwise be two modes of discourse.

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: But Faustus feels little need to read allegorically, to seek the signification that transcends direct presentation, for he never imagines spirit or even presence as anywhere but in signs themselves. Despite striking moments of doubt and panic in which he senses he is deceived, he consistently reads with the belief that spirit is entirely immanent in the letter. That is why he so loves the signs of magic: the lines, circles, schemes, and characters that apparently perform “the metaphysics of magicians” (1.1.51) by seeming to enact visibly, palpably, and presently that letter and spirit, and matter and soul, are one.
      28The fantasy that objects have spiritual efficacy provides his consolation. Indeed, Faustus seems even more invested in the spiritual power of the materiality of the sign than is the devil himself: when at one point Lucifer warns Faustus to “not think of God” (2.3.92), Faustus responds by vowing “never to look to heaven, / Never to name God” (2.3.95–96), as if naming God or performing acts that mark or deal in “the outside” of things were equivalent to thinking about God—as if naming and thinking were phenomenologically identical or produced the same results. For Faustus, naming suffices: for him spirit inheres in surfaces, and being therefore exists only in embodied form. And Faustus manifests this principle both in his epistemology and in his very sense of subjectivity itself. When Faustus reflects on his achievements in medicine—his having helped “whole cities” (1.1.21) to escape plague—he decides that such successes are worthless, and that only by being able to “make men…live eternally, / Or, being dead, raise them to life again” (1.1.24–25) were the medical profession “to be esteemed” (1.1.26). Faustus is not abandoning medicine here in order to take up divinity, as if he thought that the prolongation of earthly life were less vital than the pastoral care of immortal souls. Rather, Faustus is revealing that he conceives of eternal life itself ~<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: As an analytic category, evil needs to be understood in terms of qualitative distinctions between victims and perpetrators, social actors targeted as “motive” or “consequence” of the actions of others, active infliction of pain or passive suffering of afflictions. However, as the cases of child witchcraft considered by Csordas demonstrate, the practical logic of evil may blur or twist the clear positioning of “victim” and “perpetrator” when the “sign of affliction” is transposed into a “sign of evil.” Do witchcraft and sorcery thus provide a kind of key for theorizing the role of evil as situated human activity more generally, as Csordas suggests? Or is the practical logic of evil also discernible in violent human encounters framed in other moral terms? Such as, for example, in the recent revelations about the activities of a Neo-Nazi group in Germany responsible for the brutal killings of nine men with a Turkish immigrant background, all of them owners of a family business, over the last decade? One of the reasons for the apparent incapacity of the German police to solve the case for years does indeed seem to depend on the twisted logic turning the signs of affliction into signs of (potential) evil. The police categorically excluded the possibility of right-wing xenophobic motives from the start and assumed instead that the murders must be either motivated by cultural sentiments (honor killings) or by crimes attributed predominantly to “foreigners” (drug and human trafficking). A book written by the daughter of one of the victims vividly describes the destructive effects of how being suspected as a perpetrator when one experiences loss, damage, and suffering because of—in this instance—racial hatred generate illness on a personal level, suspicion and distrust on the collective one, as well as an overall feeling of injustice. The case is, of course, more complex than I could allude to it here.<br>

Issue: 673367<br>

Author(s): Lehnhof Kent R.<br>
Abstract: Suffused as it is with gentle tones and soft music, the scene is unlike any other in the play.
      
            Some of its elements, however, are familiar. When Lear rouses from sleep, Cordelia offers herself to him as she previously did in the love contest, inviting his gaze and subjecting herself to it. “Sir, do you know me?” (4.6.41), and “O look upon me, sir” (4.6.50). Lear shrinks back, confessing that Cordelia has ample cause to hate him. Her gentle reply is no more than a murmur: “No cause, no cause” (4.6.68). Like the “nothing” of act 1 that it echoes, Cordelia’s “no cause” performs the literal operation of negation or denial. Yet the meaning of her words surpasses their linguistic function.36
         
            Analysis always feels inadequate to Cordelia’s utterance because its meaning, as Levinas would say, lies not in the said (37
         le dit) but in the saying (le dire). What gives “no cause” its significance is not only the content it communicates but also the approach it enacts. Her words will always be in excess of interpretation because Cordelia is not using signs so much as she is making herself a sign, delivering herself to her father in that discursive attitude of sustained exposure and incessant offer that Levinas calls “the very signifyingness of signification.”

Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: But whether he is right or wrong, Adam with these words frames the debate for both parties and for nearly all of the critical literature on Eve’s dream. At the center of that debate is this question of what exactly happened, the night before, in Eve’s mind. But in searching for the key to her spiritual condition in the dream space, we miss the profound importance of the fact that Eve does not and perhaps cannot yet articulate sin in her own person. It may be that her yet sinless vocal chords simply cannot form the words: “And I did eat.” As William Riggs writes, “Evil thoughts, in Adam’s famous assessment, ‘into the mind of God or Man / May come and go, so unapprov’d, and leave / No spot or blame behind’ (V 117–19), but thoughts articulated—so Eve’s experience of her own words argues—constitute a significant gesture toward choice.”
      
               If Riggs is right then Eve’s famous ellipsis, far from inviting speculation, should end it altogether. What is often read as a clever evasion of guilt or at least a questionable coyness may in fact be the surest sign of abiding innocence. We need not speculate on what did or did not happen in Eve’s dreaming mind. The fact that she refuses to pronounce the incriminating words may be—to borrow another famous verse that may or may not belong in quotation marks—all we know and all we need to know.29<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Now, it has to be underscored that, unlike Bonhoeffer, Badiou talks about weakness not in a sense of a personal vulnerability that is an expression of the conformity to Christ through his cross but in the sense of the “formal” weakness of the Christian message. As Zerbe phrases it, in Badiou “evental truth declaration in the modality of weakness does not correspond to one of lived weakness.”
            
                  This results in consequent divergences between Bonhoeffer’s thought and his own. First of all, for Badiou the Christian subject is instituted not by solidarity with the world’s sufferings but through the subject’s own declaration of the event. This aspect of Badiou’s reflection points to the fundamental role of the act of declaration: “It is not the singularity of the subject that validates what the subject says; it is what he says that founds the singularity of the subject.”143
               
                  Paul himself became the subject of the Christian truth suddenly, on the road to Damascus, his “conversion” being the subjective sign of the event proper, that is, the resurrection of Christ. “Truth, event, subject, and fidelity are thus all part of a single process: truth comes into being via subjects who declare an event and, in so doing, are constituted (‘subjectivated’ Badiou likes to say) precisely by their faithful and continuous response to the irruption of that revolutionary event.”144

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673118<br>
Date: 09 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Huth Kimberly<br>
Abstract: Figurative language may not be a primary means of conveying painful sensation, but it is paramount in assigning significance to those sensations and affecting audience reactions to its portrayal—perhaps even coercing them into an interpretation they would otherwise reject. In the artistic and theatrical exploration of human suffering, metaphors and pain are intimately linked because it is this interpretive trope that cues audience response and assigns meaning to an otherwise horrifyingly senseless bodily experience. The figures of pain discussed here attest to the artistry of these playwrights, but also to the power of metaphor and other tropes to shape the thinking of an entire culture. As Wayne C. Booth writes of metaphor’s role in community discourse, “The metaphors we care for most are always embedded in metaphoric structures that finally both depend on and constitute selves and societies.”
   
            Early modern culture utilized numerous discourses to make sense of pain, from seeing it as a sign of devotion in the Petrarchan lover or religious martyr to construing it as evidence of guilt in systems of corporal or capital punishment. Early modern tragic theater draws on those cultural narratives, but it also serves as a space for practicing the types of interpretation needed to make sense of pain—an understanding that extended outward at the close of the play. By being attentive to the moments of spectacular suffering that define these plays, by noting the philosophical and affective purposes those spectacles serve, we can see at work the same systems of interpretation that made possible many early modern cultural discourses, from the literary to the judicial to the spiritual. Far from being irreconcilable, pain and metaphor work in conjunction in early modern tragedy to create a durable interpretive community out of a single, yet multifaceted, physical experience.51<br>

Abstract: Michael Ermarth summarizes the move as follows: "Particularly after his read-
ing of Husserl, he extended his notion of meaning to include the relation between the sign and the
thing signified and stipulated that what is signified cannot be resolved into experiential components
and configurations. Verstehen is not just simply the "resubjectifying of objectivations in a 'back-
ward' movement from the objective expression to the immanent subjective experiences of the
expresser, but also a 'forward movement' from the sign to its intentional object" (Wilhelm Dilthey:

Abstract: Catherine Gallagher writes against the critical tendency to foreground
Deronda's Jewishness. As Gallagher points out, "It seems an odd twist...when the
dreadful, shameful veiled core of meaning to which so much in the novel alludes
turns out not to be a loose woman, a public or private concubine, but an artist, the
greatest lyric actress of her time. All through his life, Daniel has thought that he
stood as the sign of his mother's sexual sin...Instead of having been abandoned as
a sign of shameful sex, Daniel was literally traded for an artistic career; he is, in
this sense, the representative of his mother's career because he is the thing that
she exchanged for it" (53).

Abstract: Refiriéndose a Jean-Jacques Rousseau en "From/of Blindness to the Supplement", Derrida
ofrece varias aproximaciones a la noción del suplemento tales como: "The supplement adds
itself, it is a surplus, a plenitude enriching another plenitude, the fullest measure of presence.
It cumulates and accumulates presence. It is thus that art, techné, image, representation, con-
vention, etc., come as supplements to nature... But the supplement supplements. It adds only
to replace. It intervenes or insinuates itself in-the-place-of; if it fills, it is as if one fills a void.
If it represents and makes an image, it is by the anterior default of a presence. Compensatory
[suppléant] and victorious, the supplement is an adjunct, a subaltern instance which takes-
(the)-place [tient-lieu]'. As a substitute, it is not simply added to the positivity of a presence,
it produces no relief, its place is assigned in the structure by the mark of an emptiness.
Somewhere, something can be filled up of itself, can accomplish itself, only by allowing itself
to be filled through sign and proxy. The sign is always the supplement of the thing itself.

Abstract: Children, who are composers of meaning rather than merely handlers of art materials, proceed by strategies of generative praxis that include fictive play and autobiography and involve judgment that is critically reflective and imagination that is productive. The view of things that leads an art teacher to believe that a child is making meaningful art is one in which a child's judgment is a sign, or even a criterion of thoughtful involvement. When this reflective judgment is manifested, you see that a child is guided by an inner critic of their work, and the claim that "Michael is making art" says it all. As I interpreted the long self-sustained efforts of children composing artist books, I became most aware of the way in which children's desire to represent their stories merged with drawing and a developing schema in the same way lived experience and metaphor interchange and generate each other. This interchange is the living ground of the inner critic in children's meaningful art.<br>

Author(s): Chenavier Robert<br>
Abstract: Au cours d'une période qui voit Husserl livrer son testament philosophique, la Krisis, l'étudiante Simone Weil ouvre son Diplôme d'études supérieures, en 1930, par le constat du désarroi dans lequel se trouve l'époque et de l'incertitude dans laquelle nous laisse la science. Il faut opérer un retour à Descartes, dans une automéditation proche de celle que recommandait Husserl. Cependant Simone Weil ne s'oriente pas vers une phénoménologie. Loin d'explorer la sphère d'être du cogito, elle cherche à en sortir, plus rapidement encore que Descartes, pour rencontrer la réalité du monde, et inventer une sagesse pour notre condition d'être percevant, ce qui signifie, avant tout, d'être qui travaille. Seul le travail permet d'éprouver la nécessité réelle, et de retrouver « l'union de l'âme et du monde », dans les conditions créées par l'industrie. C'est dans la ligne de la vocation mondaine de la philosophie de Descartes, que Simone Weil amorce sa réflexion sur le rôle du travail comme fondement d'une sagesse, dans ces nouvelles conditions d'existence déterminées par la forme collective de la production. À partir de 1935, elle verra dans la crise un signe de la « faillite de Descartes ». During the period that Husserl was declaring his philosophical testament, Die Krisis, Simone Weil was a student starting her Diplôme d'études supérieures in 1930, mindful of the utter confusion of the times and of the atmosphere of uncertainty generated by science. One must return to Descartes, in a self-meditation similar to the one recommended by Husserl. But Simone Weil did not move toward a phenomenology. Far from exploring the sphere of being through the cogito principle, she sought to escape from that sphere, even more rapidly than did Descartes, in order to confront the reality of the world and to invent a wisdom for the condition of a conscious being, which means, above all, a being who works. Only work makes it possible to experience real necessity and to reestablish « the union of~<br>

Abstract: Josef Macek has provided a capsule summary of historical
semantics: "The historian does not interest himself only with the relation between the
sign and the concept, or merely between the word and the psychological endowment
of man; he inquires about the relation existing between the sense of a word and the
world itself- that is, the external facts and states of affairs. The word does not reflect
things and the universe only in a passive manner but constitutes an active element in
the reflection upon these things, as in the process of knowledge itself" ("Pour une
semantique historique," in Melanges en honneur de F. Braudel [Toulouse, 1973],
p. 344).

Abstract: I had the honor of interviewing Clifford Geertz at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, USA, on October 18, 2000. The interview focused on Geertz's theoretical conceptions, the tradition on which he draws, the critique he has encountered, and on interpretive anthropology's future development. Of particular interest was the clarification of his much-debated method, his definition of symbol and his famous definition of religion as a cultural system. Geertz emphasizes his attempt to exercise an applied pragmatic phenomenological and hermeneutical method without any general theory (or philosophy) of meaning, phenomenology, or culture. He maintains that he only has a conceptual framework inspired by different scholars, which nevertheless has consistent focus and perspective, i.e., meaning and symbol. In relationship to this, Geertz defines his symbol within the Peircean semiotic tradition. Therefore, the term symbol is understood as a sign (an index for example), which becomes a symbol via a cultural interpretation. Furthermore, his definition of religion as a cultural system is, in his view, a non-essentialistic definition and therefore is not—as Talal Asad claims—ethnocentric. Although it is Geertz's opinion that interpretive anthropology has been influenced by postmodernism, he predicts that interpretive anthropology's future development will be in reasonable continuity with its past. In my closing comments I tentatively suggest that Geertz may have a theory of interpretation because of his definition of the symbol, his unavoidable assumptions, and his unique method, which has the capacity of grasping the cultural specific in a general way.<br>

Abstract: Abordaremos a autobiografia de Malcolm X (1925-1965) sob o prisma de uma hermenêutica do testemunho: ao aplicar a hermenêutica do testemunho na referida autobiografia, identificaremos as duas profundas transformações psicológicas e espirituais sofridas por Malcolm X, transformações indissociáveis de uma mudança na sua relação com a transcendência, o Islamismo e a comunidade afro-americana do seu tempo. Trata-se, em última análise, de percorrer a evolução de uma consciência humana que se cumpre e se manifesta na religiosidade (não-violência) e no testemunho. Neste estudo, o rito aparecerá como "passagem" no contexto da (re-)integração e (re)educação segundo o modelo da adoração (Mestre/discípulo), mediada pelo desejo mimético, cuja função é purgativa e fundacional porque reorientadora da existência do discípulo. O rito será visto ainda como "sinal da aceitação do testemunho". No contexto de testemunho, extrairemos ainda uma noção de coragem, integrante de noções contemporâneas. We will approach the autobiography of Malcolm X (1925-1965) from the point of view of a hermeneutics of testimony: on applying the hermeneutics of testimony in the said autobiography, we will identify the two deep psychological and spiritual transformations suffered by Malcolm X, transformations that can't be separated from a change in his relationship with the transcendence; the Islamism and the African American community of his time, being, ultimately, the go through of the evolution of human consciousness that meets and manifests itself in religion (non-violence) and witness. In this study, the rite will appear as "passage" in the context of (re-) integration and (re-)education according to the model of worship (master/disciple), taking part in the mimetic desire, whose function is purgative and functional because reorienting the existence of the disciple, the rite is still seen as "a sign of acceptance of the witness." Even in the context of testimony, we will demonstrate a sense of courag~<br>

Abstract: My aim in this memorial paper is to recall two essential Ricoeurean themes that underlie his entire philosophical orientation and that respond well to specific challenges today from postmodern deconstruction. At question is whether Ricoeur's account of sign in language and the living present in time can adequately respond to and meet the recent challenge from postmodern deconstruction, which radically challenges the very root of his phenomenological and hermeneutic orientation: the priority of the semantic in language and the priority of the living present. Although Ricoeur and Derrida will be seen to address the same problems of decentering consciousness, their accounts, although agreeing on importnat issues, quickly become mutually exclusive and deconstruction becomes a challenge to Ricoeurean hermeneutics. I will turn first to the postmodern deconstruction of Jacques Derrida before turning to Ricoeur's response with a more viable view of language, sense, and lived time.<br>

Article Title: Le corps souffrant chez Lu Xun : allégorie muette de l'obstacle et appropriation de la modernité<br>
Publisher: Presses Universitaires de Vincennes<br>
Issue: i24715391<br>
Date: 1 1, 2015<br>
Author(s): Vuilleumier Victor<br>
Abstract: Le corps chez Lu Xun est peu décrit. Cette absence permet de dire indirectement une souffrance multiple : la honte ressentie devant la crise historique de la Chine dont la nature nationale est tenue pour responsable; la mélancolie existentielle. En revanche, le corps est allégorisé comme signe de la tradition, qui fait obstacle à l'émancipation de l'individu. Libérer la voix de la nation chinoise impose de détruire symboliquement le corps reçu en héritage, de subvertir l'esthétique et les paradigmes scientistes de la corporalité et de la puissance élaborés par la modernité chinoise mondialisée. Le vrai médecin agit par l'écrit sur l'esprit, non sur le corps ou la civilisation matérielle. Accorder la primauté au cœur sur le corps permet de fonder un projet de modernité, en métaphorisant la médecine importée. The body in Lu Xun's writings is rarely depicted. This absence allows the text to indirectly express the meaning of suffering in its multiple dimension (the shame felt in the face of China's historical crisis, which the national nature is held liable for, and the existential melancholy). However, the body is allegorized, and embodies the sign of a tradition that limits the emancipation of the individual. The liberation of the Chinese national voice requires symbolically destroying the inherited body, as well as subverting the sublime aesthetics of corporeality and the scientist paradigm of the body defined by the Chinese globalized modernity. The real physician impacts on the spirit by means of the writing, and not on the body or the material civilization. To ensure a greatest value to the heart rather than to the body is regarded by Lu Xun as a way to establish a project of modernity, by the metaphorization of the imported medicine. 在魯迅作品里，很少描寫身體。這種缺席可以有助於用非直接的方式來言說一種多 重的苦痛（包含在中國的歷史危機面前所體會到的羞恥感，中國人的國民性被認為 是要對這種危機負責，也包含存在的苦悶）。相反，身體被加以寓言化，成為傳統 符號的寓言，阻礙個體的解放。解放中國民族的聲音，迫使要用象徵的方式摧毀作 為遺產來接受的身體，顛覆既有的美學観，亦顛覆由經歷世界化的中國現代性所建 構出的體魄與力量的科學主義範式。真正的醫生通過書寫的形式對精神加以作用， 而不是針對身體或者物質~<br>

Author(s): Morris Rosalind C.<br>
Abstract: This article considers the legacies of Jacques Derrida in and for Anglo-American sociocultural anthropology. It begins with a survey of Derrida's own engagement with themes that have historically been foundational to the field: (a) the critique of sign theory and, with it, the questions of language and law in Lévi-Straussian structuralism; (b) the question of the unconscious; (c) the critique of the performative and its consequences for the idea of ritual; (d) the rereading of Marcel Mauss's concept of the gift, and of economy more generally; and (e) the analysis of the metaphysical basis of law, in both religious and ostensibly secular formations. It then considers the state of the field at the time when it was being infused with different forms of poststructuralism and explores the competing claims made by these discourses in relation to deconstruction. Finally, after tracing the convergences and divergences between Derridean deconstruction and theory in sociocultural anthropology, it treats two main examples of works produced against and under the influence of Derrida's thought, respectively.<br>

Article Title: Mathematics and Mathematics Education as Triadic Communication? A Semiotic Framework Exemplified<br>
Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i25472056<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Ongstad Sigmund<br>
Abstract: The article investigates in the first part critically dyadic and essentialist understanding of signs and utterances in mathematics and mathematics education as opposed to a triadic view. However even Peircean semiotics, giving priority to triadic, dynamic sign may face challenges, such as explaining the sign as a pragmatic act and how signs are related to context. To meet these and other hurdles an explicit communicational, pragmatic and triadic view, found in parts of the works of Bühler, Bakhtin, Habermas, and Halliday, is developed. Two basic principles are combined and established in a theoretical framework. Firstly, whenever uttering, there will exist in any semiotic sign system, dynamic reciprocity and simultaneity between expressing through form, referring to content, and addressing as an act. Secondly, meaning will be created by the dynamics between given and new in utterances and between utterances and contextual genres. The latter principle explains how meaning merge in communication dynamically and create the basis for a discursive understanding of semiosis and hence even learning at large. The second part exemplifies each of the three main aspects and the dynamics of utterance and genre and given and new by excerpts from a textbook in mathematics education. The concept 'positioning', in use for operationalisation, is explained in relation to main principles of the framework. The article ends focusing crucial implications for validation when moving from a dyadic to a triadic understanding of mathematics and mathematics education.<br>

Abstract: Nous tentons de clarifier la place de la normativité dans une approche phénoménologique du politique en analysant l'opposition de la philosophie des droits de l'homme d'inspiration kantienne de Luc Ferry et Alain Renaut à la réflexion de type phénoménologique de Claude Lefort. Le projet de Lefort consiste d'abord en une tentative d'élucidation du réel et non de justification de principes. Mais la dimension normative n'en demeure pas absente puisque Lefort conçoit les droits de l'homme tant comme un phénomène du politique que comme signes de la liberté qu'il recherche dans la démocratie. Y a-t-il là nécessairement incohérence? /// Can a phenomenological analysis of political reality tackle the issue of norms? We try to answer this question through an analysis of the opposition between Luc Ferry and Alain Renaut's Kantian philosophy of human rights and the phenomenological approach of Claude Lefort. Lefort's project is an attempt to elucidate reality and not to justify principles. But the normative dimension is not entirely absent from his thought. Lefort conceives of human rights not only as a political phenomenon but also as a sign of liberty, which he supports. Is this inconsistent with the nature of his phenomenological project?<br>

Abstract: Ever since Plato the identity of philosophy has been at issue in the quarrel between philosophy and poetry. Can changing times alter the identity of philosophy, and simultaneously the identity of poetry? In the Republic poetry is a third rate illusion compared with contemplation of "the things that truly are". We can trace the background of this disqualification when we distinguish three levels in the relation of language to reality. 1. We can distinguish assertion, melody and rhythm. The first is the same in poetry and prose, the last is superfluous. 2. Speech is superior to writing in virtue of the speaker's inner mastery over himself. 3. The interiorizing move culminates in the soundless conversation of the soul with itself, contemplating the eternal identical "without the stain of speech or sign" (Boutens). For Plato, then, we move from poetry to prose, from prose to speech, from speech to silence. Is there room for aesthetics in this view? In the second part of my lecture I reconstruct Symbolism, a current in literature that in every respect is the opposite of Platonism. Although the goal is the same — the search for true reality — the difference is that the route is now reversed. I restrict myself to the French branch. 4. Baudelaire formulated the basic principle of Symbolism: the ineffable does not exist. "The ultimate goal of the universe is to be expressed" (Valéry). The same worldview is expressed later by Gadamer: an ontology "guided by language". 5. The second principle is that the primary language is script, "Book" (Mallarmé). 6. Poetry proves to be the true language. The music (rhyme, rhytm, tune) reveals the things "exactly as they are" (Wallace Stevens). In poetry the linguistic sign becomes a symbol because the sound, the physical aspect of the linguistic sign, plays a role in the production of meaning. A poem is a "sustained hesitation between sense and sound" (Valéry). Is sound not however a disturbing factor in revealing the things 'as they are'?~<br>

Abstract: A educaçao é vulgarmente considerada um importante instrumento impulsionador da transformacäo social. Alias, segundo a teoría liberal, a educaçao foi sempre considerada urna via para a mobilidade social e a chave do progresso individual e social. Todavía, foi nos anos 60 que a educaçao começou a atrair as atençôes dos economistas, dos políticos, dos organismos internacionais e dos movimentos revolucionarios. Com efeito, tiveram lugar certos acontecimentos que levaram a olhar mais de perto os processus e as instituiçôes educacionais. A elaboraçâo de teorías económicas da educaçao constituí um indicativo deste descente interesse pela educaçao e pelo saber. A concepçâo económica do « capital humano » contém, porém, pressupostos ideológicos que reforçam o modelo capitalista da sociedade. De qualquer modo, a educaçao, em termos de descimentó económico e mobilidade social, foi posta em evidencia em todos os países capitalistas desenvolvidos. Nos países capitalistas subdesenvolvidos, a crescente industrializaçâo também salientou o papel da educaçao na mudança social. Mas, além dos problemas do desenvolvimento capitalista nos países desenvolvidos e da industrializaçâo nos países capitalistas subdesenvolvidos, os anos 60 e os principios dos anos 70 proporcionaran! outras razöes para destacar a importancia da educaçao nas mudanças sociais. Designadamente, as reformas educacionais socialistas em Cuba, na China e, mais recentemente, em diversos países africanos constitiiem inspiraçao para novos e importantes estudos. Na revoluçâo socialista há a consciência de que a luta das classes também se manifesta nas escolas. Por outro lado, as teorías de confuto, marxistas e näo marxistas, também se aplicam à análise das reformas educacionais nas sociedades capitalistas. Estas teorías tentam estabelecer as bases para uma sociedade alternativa, baseada no valor do trabalho. Efectivamente, um projecto de mudanças educacionais como parte integrante de um processo de revoluçâo cultural deriv~<br>

Abstract: La signe comme expression (Husserl) consiste selon F. de Saussure dans le rapport immotivé signifíant-signifíé, sa valeur signifiante étant déterminée par la place du signifiant dans le système réel de la langue tandis que le signifié-concept (de Saussure) est noème, irréel (Husserl). Inerte tant qu'aucun acte d'expression ou de compréhension ne l'anime (ré-anime), il porte, exprime et induit l'intentionnalité de ces actes; il est conscience hors de soi, intentionnalité sans sujet, visée du signifié différenciée par son signifiant (objet d'une science de faits, la linguistique). Aussi les problèmes du «sujet», de l' «origine», de la «suffisance» du signe adéquat, de l'«insuffisance» du signe qui, en son ouverture, exprime au-delà de lui-même, exigent-ils l'élucidation du champ de signification, notamment des figures métonymiques ou métaphoriques qui y apparaissent. According to F. de Saussure a sign or an expression (Husserl) is constituted by the unmotivated relation between the signifier and the signified, the value of the signifier is determined by the position it occupies in the real system of language, while the signified concept (de Saussure) is a noema, i.e. unreal (Husserl). Inactive, as long as there is no act of expression or understanding to (re) activate it, the concept carries the intentionality of these acts, conveys it and leads us to it. It constitutes a consciousness outside of the self, an intentionality without a subject, a target of the signified, as differentiated by the signifier (the object of a science, the linguistics). In this sense the solution to the problems concerning the «subject», the «origin», the «sufficiency» of an adequate sign, the «insufficiency» of a sign, when it signifies things other than itself, requires the clarification of the idea of a field of meaning, especially the meaning of occurring metonymies and metaphors. Das Zeichen als Ausdruck (Husserl) besteht nach F. de Saussure in der unmotivierten Beziehung Bezeichnendes-~<br>

Abstract: This paper renews the problem of Africa's international presence, presence which for a long time has been contested by the Path dependence theory in international relations relegating Africa to the periphery of the world linking its destiny to that of the Western World. This thesis is anthropologically and historically erroneous for the simple reason that colonial era is an impertinent sign of Africa's presence in the international scene; rather, a long time before one could enable an objective appropriate restitution of Africa's implication in the world which began even before the colonial era (transsaharian trade, establishment of Indonesian colonies in Madagascar, regular trade with India, the regions of the Persian Golf and the Mediterranean).<br>

Abstract: L'affirmation selon laquelle le mariage chrétien est le signe efficace de l'union du Christ et de l'Église est une donnée de la Tradition. Elle n'en soulève pas moins, au regard des sciences humaines (ethnologie, psychanalyse), de la philosophie, de la théologie enfin, un certain nombre de difficultés théoriques dont plusieurs sont examinées ici. L'effort ensuite tenté pour les lever aboutit à une présentation nouvelle de la sacramentanté du mariage. Le couple uni et fécond aurait à prophétiser la réconciliation des sexes et des générations. Ainsi témoignerait-il, dans l'Esprit, de ce qui est déjà et qui sera, mieux encore: de Celui qui est et vient: Dieu tout en tous. L'étude se termine en évoquant les pratiques externes et internes du couple qui dérivent logiquement de cette prophétie. Asserting that Christian marriage is an effectual sign of Christ's union with the Church is a datum of the Tradition. It nevertheless raises, as far as human sciences (ethnology, psychoanalysis), philosophy and in fine theology are concerned, a certain number of theoretical difficulties, several of which are here examined. The subsequent effort to overcome them leads to a new presentation of the sacramental character of marriage. The united and fruitful couple should prophecies the reconciliation of sexes and generations. Thus would it testify in the Spirit, what already is and shall be, better still: from Him who is and comes, God, the whole power in all men. The essay is concluded by evoking the external and internal experiences of the couple logically resulting from this prophecy.<br>

Abstract: Le symbole opère en signifiant et signifie en opérant. Pour fonder plus tard ce propos philosophique, il convient de revenir sur trois débats qui ont contribué à résoudre le sens du symbole dans l'éthique : la scission du symbole d'avec le signe, sa reprise dans le langage, son expulsion du sacré. Si l'on est conduit à redéfinir les droits, mais aussi les conditions et les modes d'une ontologie du symbole, on ne saurait négliger ce qui rend celui-ci possible : la culture. Identifiée à la structure signifiante et opérante du symbole, la culture s'entremet entre les capacités de symbolisation du vécu sensible et l'actualisation cognitive et pratique des symboles effectifs. The symbol operates by signifying and signifies by operating. In order to justify this philosophical affirmation, it is convenient to look back at three debates which have contributed to determining the sense of the symbol in ethics: the distinction between the symbol and the sign, the symbol's reintegration in language, and its expulsion from the domain of the sacred. If one is led to redefine not only the rights, but also the conditions and modes of an ontology of the symbol, then one may not neglect the thing which makes this possible: culture. Identified with the significant and operative structure of the symbol, culture places itself between the capacities for symbolisation of sensitive living, and the cognitive and practical actualisation of existing symbols.<br>

Abstract: Textures of Time is a rich and challenging book that raises a host of important and hard questions about historical narrative, form, and style; the sociology of texts; and the core problem of ascertaining historical truth. Two that pertain to the book's main claims are of special interest to nonspecialist readers: Is register or style - "texture" - necessarily and everywhere diagnostic of "history"? Does a new kind of "historical consciousness" emerge in south India beginning in the sixteenth century, indeed as a sign of an Indian early modernity? Textures is not the first book to argue that historical discourse is constitutively marked by a peculiar style, but the claim is beset by difficulties that scholars since Barthes have detailed. Rather than textures of time - accounts of what really happened in history-what these works offer us may be only pretextures of time, textualized forms of a human experience that make claims about its degrees and types of truth through representations of various states of temporality. Instead of assessing, then, whether these works are history or something else like "myth," we might ask whether they invite us to transcend this very dichotomy, to try, that is, to make sense of historical forms of consciousness rather than to identify forms of historical consciousness. As for modernity, nothing in south Indian historiography from 1500-1800 remotely compares to the conceptual revolution of Europe. But why should we expect the newness of the early modern world to have been experienced the same way everywhere? Modernity across Asia may have shown simultaneity without symmetry. Should this asymmetry turn out to reveal continuity and not rupture, however, no need to lament the fact. There is no shame in premodernity.<br>

Author(s): Carlson Celia<br>
Abstract: Recent scholarship has given considerable attention to lyric poetry as a form of sensuous knowledge. This approach emphasizes the corporeal origins of poetry, its genesis in the body or in language viewed as material. The question of sensuous knowledge is central to the larger theoretical issue of modernity itself, in which lyric holds a central yet ambiguous status. The question of sensuous knowledge is ultimately a question of meaning. However, modern thought — thought pertaining to “modernity” — is fundamentally circular. This would seem to establish an epistemological impasse for aesthetics. But I argue that this circularity offers an important, and necessary, way to limit knowledge and thereby ground an ethical subjectivity. My essay places formalism at the heart of sensuous knowledge. In this essay I develop an account of the importance of abstraction in sensuous knowledge by way of Kant's concept of
         Darstellung, “presentation [of sensory experience].” The “presentation” is the object as it has undergone a structural process of internalization and been made available for psychic use as meaning; that requires a recognition of loss. Where this is important for literature is that twentieth-century American poetry frequently uses very personal images of family life as a way of conveying sincerity about corporeal experience. I use this discussion of circularity in modern aesthetic thought to argue that there is a risk to taking shortcuts to meaning through images of the material bodies of children. In these contemporary poems by Gary Snyder, Sharon Olds and Rita Dove, the poets reject loss in favor of a very modern “affirmation” of the material. But affirmation and the visual image as a sign of affirmation cannot alone bind meaning to us. That meaning must be internalized through theworkof poetic presentation.<br>

Abstract: According to the arguments put forward by Perloff, Dworkin, Goldsmith, and Reed, the recontextualization of language is a marker of “taste” or aesthetic judgment, and therefore a sign of genius. Perloff writes, “
      According to taste: it is important to remember that the citational or appropriative text, however unoriginal its actual words and phrases, is always the product of choice—and hence of individual taste.”
            In this interpretation, the appropriation of language becomes the reassertion of individuality and authority. Goldsmith terms this “self-expression,” “emotion,” and “authorship” in24
         Uncreative Writing. Perloff argues, “If the new ‘conceptual’ poetry makes no claim to originality—at least not originality in the usual sense—this is not to say thatgeniusisn't in play. It just takes different forms.”
            The rhetoric of Perloff and Goldsmith's claims is fascinating. Viewing the recontextualization of language as a marker of “taste” or aesthetic judgment is a hoary basis for authority. Attributing the act of recontextualizing to “genius” reinforces the fetish of authenticity that reigns in late capitalist society25
         
            and is a clear manifestation of the metaphysics of origin.26
         
            By “metaphysics of origin,” I refer to the central epistemic issue that creates a theology of “the new, the creative, the true” in the West, following Françoise Meltzer's analysis in27
         Hot Property: The Stakes and Claims of Literary Originality. Meltzer shows that the idea of literary originality functions within an economy of displacement: that is, the idea of “origin” itself is continually displaced so as “to clothe its status as invention, or myth.”
            Said has identified a similar phenomenon that he calls the “imperative connection” between the idea of a beginning and the “aboriginal human need to point to or locate a beginning.”28

Issue: jafrireli.1.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 2013<br>
Abstract: The title of our journal,
         Journal of Africana Religions, evoked the mood expressed in Countee Cullen's poem. The use of the term, “Africana,” instead of Africa, is a sign of an ambiguity of meaning. Employing “Africana” instead of Africa gives the sense of something a bit indefinite or vague as well as derivative, varied, and even mysterious. In other words, “Africana” covers a wide range of meanings, ideas, and symbols regarding things pertaining to Africa—a kind of potpourri, an olio or constellation of places, modes, and qualities. As Elliot Skinner, the late African American anthropologist of Africa, put it, “Africa is like a mirror, and African scholarship often reveals more about the scholar than the continent whose cultures he seeks to describe. Indeed, the very shape of Africa, is a question mark, it is sphinx-like in its challenge to all scholars to find the proper key to an understanding of its diversity and complexity.”
               The function and meaning of “Africa” in creating modern knowledge was also raised twenty years later when Robert H. Bates, V. Y. Mudimbe, and Jean O'Barr, the editors of1
            Africa and the Disciplines: Contributions of Research in Africa to the Social Sciences and Humanities, argued that “debates regarding how Africa should be treated within the disciplines miss a profoundly significant point: that while the curriculum may be controlled by the disciplines,the study of Africa has helped to define the very disciplines … the study of Africa is already lodged in the core of the modern university.”

Abstract: Without sovereignty and without ownership, we are responsible for what we cannot and do not control, for our unconscious fears and desires and their effects on others. The fragile hope is that by acknowledging the death drive within ourselves, we can begin to prevent killing and never give up trying to find ways to abolish death penalties in all their forms. The death drive is not the Kantian notion of death as the great equalizer but, rather, the tension in life itself, both destructive and creative, always conjoined with both pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow, and the ambiguities of life that not only exceed but also expose the fantasy of death as an absolute end point or final resting place. Far from the Perpetual Peace of the Dutch innkeeper's sign, with which Kant ironically opens his essay, the death drive is the force that fuels the fantasy of the end of life as everlasting peace.<br>

Abstract: Flush with the juices of adolescence, American philosophy declared independence from its European parentage in the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson and his generation. In 1837, Emerson addressed the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Society on the occasion of its inaugural meeting for the year, which he called a "holiday." Emerson began: I greet you on the recommencement of our literary year. Our anniversary is one of hope, and, perhaps, not enough of labor. We do not meet for games of strength or skill, for the recitation of histories, tragedies, and odes, like the ancient Greeks; for parliaments of love and poesy, like the Troubadours; nor for the advancement of science, like our contemporaries in the British and European capitals. Thus far, our holiday has been simply a friendly sign of the survival of the love of letters amongst a people too busy to give letters any more. Perhaps the time is already come when it ought to be, and will be something else; when the sluggard intellect of this continent will look from under its iron lids and fill the postponed expectations of the world with something better than the expectations of mechanical skill. Our day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close. The millions that around us are rushing into life, cannot always be fed on the sere remains of foreign harvests. Events, actions arise, that must be sung, that will sing themselves.<br>
