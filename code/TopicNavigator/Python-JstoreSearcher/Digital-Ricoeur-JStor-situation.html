  SEVEN  The Newer Musicology? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt19cc225">The Thought of Music</a><br>
  Abstract: The vicissitudes of authorship revisited in chapter 6 point to a larger issue. Since around 2000 there has been a lot of musicological effort lavished on the “workconcept” and the competing claims of the fixed, authoritative musical work and the creative act of performance, mostly to the detriment of the work. Like most such binary quarrels, this one reveals a little and obscures a lot. It certainly oversimplifies the historical situation, which is full of complex instances in which the roles of the work—as inscription, conception, or instruction—and of performance—as animation, interpretation, or reproduction—meet, mix, and<br>

  A Review of “Ethnopoetics” from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1bmzkq4">Symposium of the Whole</a><br>
  Author(s) TURNER VICTOR<br>
  Abstract: Victor Turner has been a major and highly influential anthropologist since the late 1950s. His contributions to symbolic anthropology and to a unified theory of performance include concepts of liminality andcommunitas,social drama, reflexivity, and symbolic process, applicable to a wide range of human cultures but developed from particular situations such as that of the Ndembu of eastern Africa. In the present article, he reviews the proceedings of ʺthe first international symposium on ethnopoeticsʺ as gathered by Michel Benamou and Jerome Rothenberg in a special issue ofAlcheringa(Benamou 1976).

  6  The Uncertainty of Freedom: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1cg4n9v">A Dream Denied</a><br>
  Abstract: Lucas’s situation was complicated. I met him at the Eliot Detention Center, where he was being held for armed robbery. He was released fairly quickly and spent most of the year and a half during which we met regularly on the outside. While he was on juvenile probation, one of his associates pressed charges against him. His former friend claimed that Lucas had threatened him and his pregnant girlfriend. New accusations followed, and the whole case became an increasingly confusing he said–she said scenario. Lucas insisted vehemently that the allegations were unfounded. The details were far too complex to<br>

  1  Hermeneutics from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnchw">Interpreting Music</a><br>
  Abstract: This is a book about musical hermeneutics. A generation ago, no one would have wanted to write it. Music by nature seemed to rule it out. Music did not seem to mean the way other things do if it seemed to mean at all. This book tries to show why and how that situation has changed—changed dramatically. Each chapter examines a different concept or practice associated with the deceptively simple phrase
                  interpreting music. Hermeneutics is the art of interpretation. What do we do when we interpret music? What do we learn by doing it? What is at stake? Why<br>

  CHAPTER 3  Imagining Social Life I: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnncj">Reason to Believe</a><br>
  Abstract: Participant observation in hundreds of services and events, as well as with church members in everyday life over the course of three years, left me with little doubt that hardship and suffering have permanent seats in Venezuelan Evangelical discourse. Exhortations to gain control of one’s life through Jesus Christ were mixed with warnings of what will happen if one backslides from the Way, were interspersed with testimonies about God’s power to resolve intractable problems and impossible situations. My findings agree, then, with the dominant social scientific interpretation that Latin American Evangelicalism is a religion oriented toward those experiencing sustained life<br>

  [PART THREE Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnncj">Reason to Believe</a><br>
  Abstract: An adequate theory of cultural agency needs both a nonreductionist concept of culture as something that can have an independent impact and a concept of human agency in which people can adopt cultural meanings because they understand these impacts. I have argued that such a theory can be built on the concept of imaginative rationality. In some situations people may certainly create meanings in order to avoid or escape from their problematic experiences, as neo-Marxists would have it. However, the Evangelical men studied here seem to create meanings in order to confront problematic experiences. These decisions to believe are made<br>

  CHAPTER 7  Two Lives, Five Years Later from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnncj">Reason to Believe</a><br>
  Abstract: Chapter 6 provided a relational analysis of Evangelical conversion based on a comparable sample of Evangelical and non-Evangelical men. The relatively large size of this sample allowed me to render the variety of relational situations that facilitate or prevent Evangelical conversion. Here I want to look more deeply into these issues by focusing on two cases: Augusto and Ugeth. Each was in my original sample: Augusto was one of my non-Evangelical respondents; Ugeth was one of my Evangelical informants from the first days of my research. I reinterviewed each two more times, five and six years after our original interview.<br>

  CHAPTER 7  The Gulf of Corinth from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnphx">Between One and One Another</a><br>
  Abstract: A recurring critique of the ethos of modernism is that it fosters alienation from and indifference to the world and a regressive absorption into one’s own personal situation. Faced with a macrocosm that is too overwhelming to contemplate and too complex to control, people take refuge in a narcissistic concern for their own survival and the emotional imperatives of the self.¹ “To live for the moment is the prevailing passion—to live for yourself, not for your predecessors or posterity.”² While it may be argued that being self-fulfilled is the best guarantee of being able to give support to others,<br>

  2  NON-INDIC THEORIES OF REBIRTH from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pns1h">Imagining Karma</a><br>
  Abstract: Although it is well known that rebirth beliefs exist in Africa, especially in West Africa, their ethnographic documentation is meager. West African eschatology needs the kind of rethinking done by the authors of
                  Amerindian Rebirthin their studies of Northwest Coast and Inuit religions.¹ In the African situation ethnographers were sensitive to religious and magical practices with which they were familiar, especially those resonating with their own European traditions, or they recorded customs exotic in the extreme if only to show the hidden rationality of seemingly irrational beliefs and practices. These were such things as African theism or pantheism or<br>

  18  Socrates and the Confusion of the Humanities from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pp5kk">A Usable Past</a><br>
  Abstract: The impression that the humanities are now in special trouble—perhaps even, as we sometimes say, in a “crisis”—is widespread among teachers in the traditional humanistic disciplines, and it is doubtless true that we have immediate grounds for concern. After a period of remarkable expansion and exuberance in higher education, when there were students enough for us all, enrollments are declining; and students, worried about the future, seem to be drifting into programs better designed to prepare them for jobs than anything we have to offer. This essay is directed, however, not to this immediately distressing situation, but to<br>

  TWO  Textualism and Anthropology: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pphf4">Being There</a><br>
  Author(s) Hammoudi Abdellah<br>
  Abstract: So much has been said about anthropology as writing, discourse, texts, and pretexts that the task of reconsidering the ethnographic encounter might be likened to a recourse to magic in order to resurrect the dead. A focus on experience and deep acquaintance might well prove to be essential, however, to engage with our current and future predicament, in which we can no longer manage not to be
                  in each other’s way. One paradox of the present situation is that (in many quarters of our discipline) the more globalized the world, and thus the greater the circulation of people, goods, and<br>

  TEN  Afterthoughts: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pphf4">Being There</a><br>
  Author(s) Borneman John<br>
  Abstract: As we reflect back on the essays assembled in this volume, it appears that each deals with a particular defining moment of thinking about and practicing anthropology. They do not aim to define a subdiscipline in anthropology or formulate an encompassing theoretical orientation regarding substantive issues. As a group, the authors differ in ethnicity, gender, and nationality, and in their respective stages of professional development. Though they all live near and work in U.S. and Canadian universities, their research spans societies that vary widely in geographical location, language, and sociopolitical situation: Canadian Inuit, European, Arab, African, Indian, and Russian societies.<br>

  SIX  Cannibal Feasts in Nineteenth-Century Fiji: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppn6j">Cannibal Talk</a><br>
  Abstract: Despite that fact that I am not as familiar with the political and economic situation of Fiji in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries as I am with the Maori, I believe that in Fiji also there developed a form of pronounced anthropophagy that must be seen in terms of the European presence. The lure of trade, the musket wars, and the rise of powerful chiefdoms and the political confederations that resulted drew Fiji gradually into the world capitalist order. We know that pronounced anthropophagy existed in New Zealand mainly, though not exclusively, in the Bay of Islands area.<br>

  Book Title: The Wherewithal of Life-Ethics, Migration, and the Question of Well-Being<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Ouédraogo Ibrahim<br>
  Abstract: The Wherewithal of Lifeengages with current developments in the anthropology of ethics and migration studies to explore in empirical depth and detail the life experiences of three young men - a Ugandan migrant in Copenhagen, a Burkina Faso migrant in Amsterdam, and a Mexican migrant in Boston - in ways that significantly broaden our understanding of the existential situations and ethical dilemmas of those migrating from the global south. Michael Jackson offers the first biographically based phenomenological account of migration and mobility, providing new insights into the various motives, tactics, dilemmas, dreams, and disappointments that characterize contemporary migration. It is argued that the quandaries of African or Mexican migrants are not unique to people moving between 'traditional' and 'modern' worlds. While more intensely felt by the young, seeking to find a way out of a world of limited opportunity and circumscribed values, the experiences of transition are familiar to us all, whatever our age, gender, ethnicity or social status - namely, the impossibility of calculating what one may lose in leaving a settled life or home place; what one may gain by risking oneself in an alien environment; the difficulty of striking a balance between personal fulfillment and the moral claims of kinship; and the struggle to know the difference between 'concrete' and 'abstract' utopias (the first reasonable and worth pursuing; the second hopelessly unattainable).<br>

  Author(s) MROWA-HOPKINS COLETTE<br>
  Abstract: I would like to begin with the story of Anna (not her real name); her father introduced her to French at the age of two. Although he was born in Australia, he spoke fluent French and taught her French nursery rhymes and songs. Anna went on to study French at school from reception to Yr 12, and had the opportunity to visit France on several occasions with her family. To most of us, this would seem to be an ideal situation. Yet, in spite of this, Anna disliked French as a school subject and developed a negative attitude towards the<br>

  9.5  The Humanities’ New Methods: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12877vs">The Making of the Humanities, vol. III</a><br>
  Author(s) Romeijn Jan-Willem<br>
  Abstract: In comparison to the natural and social sciences, the humanities have received comparatively little attention from the analytic philosophy of science. This discipline has been concerned primarily with the sciences narrowly construed. In particular confirmation theory, the systematic study of theory evaluation, shows remarkable lacunas when it comes to the methodology of the humanities. But developments in the humanities and in conformation theory invite us to reconsider this situation. First, due to the fast uptake of empirical and computational methods in several humanities disciplines, the humanities are presently very much in flux, and much more amenable to methodological elucidation.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287n36">Memory and Identity in Ancient Judaism and Early Christianity</a><br>
  Author(s) Schwartz Barry<br>
  Abstract: Late Second Temple period scholarship is premised on the belief that Jews of the time thought about the past differently from the way we do. Their knowledge was rooted in traditional legends and communal bonds; ours is data-driven, self-critical, and context-free. Both statements—history is subjective and situation-dependent, and history is objective and situation-transcendent—provoke ambivalence because both are partly but not absolutely true. The problem begins when this ambivalence inhibits us from applying the findings of modern research to instances of ancient memory, for these findings often tell us what it means to “remember,” help us dissect the complex<br>

  Abstract: Late Second Temple period scholarship is premised on the belief that Jews of the time thought about the past differently from the way we do. Their knowledge was rooted in traditional legends and communal bonds; ours is data-driven, self-critical, and context-free. Both statements—history is subjective and situation-dependent, and history is objective and situation-transcendent—provoke ambivalence because both are partly but not absolutely true. The problem begins when this ambivalence inhibits us from applying the findings of modern research to instances of ancient memory, for these findings often tell us what it means to “remember,” help us dissect the complex<br>

  Reality Television as Dispositive: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130h8ks">Cine-Dispositives</a><br>
  Author(s) Bouchez Charlotte<br>
  Abstract: While scholars are sometimes confronted with the ignorance of their interlocutors about their field of research, anyone who has ambitions to work on “reality TV” is in exactly the opposite situation. The mere mention of the term conjures up an impression of self-evidence, as reality television does not immediately appear to be complex subject matter. Still, a simple look at the phenomenon already reveals a variety of objects. Starting from a study carried out on reality television in French-speaking Switzerland,¹ this study questions how the term “reality television programming” has come to make sense within social exchange and examines the<br>

  Abstract: The event filmhas been a necessary outgrowth of shifting theoretical models in folkloristics. Scholars made observations about the social or cultural setting to expedite cross-cultural, cross-regional studies or in-depth cultural analyses. Like anthropologists, folklorists might analyze the content and context to demonstrate possible functions of folksongs, narratives, and other folk expressions; filmmakers explored the cultural milieu in which folklore was generated. In their published work, folklorists described situations in general terms; that is, tales are usually told at a feast, or a wedding, or at the storyteller’s home, or among certain ethnic groups. Films facilitating this stance resulted in<br>

  Abstract: We are told that our postmodern age is characterized by the breakdown of Grand (or “Master”) Narratives, the overarching systems that allow us to make sense of the world as a unified whole, as a cosmos rather than a chaos. In his famous report on knowledge, Jean-François Lyotard asserts that “incredulity toward metanarratives” is the very definition of postmodernity.¹ Without recourse to these guiding narratives, we find ourselves in a situation of paralogy, confronted by a host of “petite narratives.” These petite narratives express diverse perspectives and frequently take part in incommen-surable “language games,” each of which is as (il)legitimate<br>

  Abstract: This chapter was first drafted for a conference at the University of Florida in Gainesville, held from October 9 to October 11, 2006. Some of the first part of the chapter is “time sensitive,” as one says. It describes the political situation in the United States as it was in the fall of 2006.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0385">Crossover Queries: Dwelling with Negatives, Embodying Philosophy's Others</a><br>
  Abstract: Nominalists argue that everything that is must be particular. D. M. Armstrong contends, “Nominalists deny that there is any objective identity in things which are not identical. Realists, on the other hand, hold that the apparent situation is the real situation. There genuinely is, or can be, something identical. Besides particulars there are universals.”¹ Quine appreciates the difficulties of this position. Because the “quixotic” nominalist “foreswears quantification over universals, for example, classes, altogether,” Quine prefers “conceptualism,” a position that acknowledges that there are universals but holds them to be “manmade.” “Tactically conceptualism is … the strongest position … for the<br>

  Conclusion: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x044k">Sounding/Silence: Martin Heidegger at the Limits of Poetics</a><br>
  Abstract: At the end of the last chapter I observed that Heidegger’s readings of poetry are not exegeses but preservations, and moreover, that these preservations become genuine encounters with the poems they read only when they are themselves unable to gauge the shape of this encounter. This led to a paradoxical situation in which Heidegger’s readings are most compelling when they undermine his own portrayal of them. The first of these observations impacts on how we read Heidegger: if we take Heidegger’s refusal of exegesis seriously, we cannot perform an exegesis of Heidegger’s readings, but rather the preservation of a preservation.<br>

  Abstract: The specter of centrifugal forces, which threaten to tear our country apart, has haunted us throughout our history. Josiah Royce stands out as one of our most perceptive critics and the creator of a philosophy that could heal the dangerous tendency toward fragmentation and disintegration. Royce’s work lies before us as a national treasure, but mostly a buried treasure. His situation reminds one of a remark that novelist Walker Percy made about Charles Sanders Peirce: “Most people have never heard of him, but they will.”¹ Josiah Royce’s Philosophy of Loyalty remains little known outside of specialized American philosophy, and even<br>

  Author(s) TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: For the past several decades, continental philosophy has exhibited an ongoing concern with what we might call liminal phenomena, among them friendship, the gift, mourning, responsibility, forgiveness, and hospitality. Of course, to call these “phenomena” already begs the question, or at least a question, the question of whether and to what extent these events actually take place. Thinking in the wake of Jacques Derrida it is impossible to ignore, for example, the excess of the call to forgiveness over the sort of forgiveness that actually takes place in concrete situations. In the case of hospitality, this excess is apparent in<br>

Did not Marcel condemn legalized segregation that African Americans suffered during the early 1960s throughout the American South?² Michael Novak recalls that while Marcel visited the United States in the fall of 1961: “He was severely distressed by the situation of the negro in the United States—on trains, in restaurants, in hotels.”³ Marcel then told Novak that he<br>

At the same time, however, opera stages recognizably human situations, and these possess an inherent “realism” that demands a special and complex understanding of the music we hear.

  Author(s) ISER WOLFGANG<br>
  Abstract: In the “General Preface” to the
                  Waverley Novels,Scott reflects on his own situation as narrator. He tries to clarify his intentions, which—unlike those of earlier novelists—are no longer concerned with expounding moral norms. Instead, he takes as his guide his own personal development, as he seeks to explain the curious innovation of history as the subject of fiction. His starting point, he says, is as follows: “I had nourished the ambitious desire of composing a tale of chivalry, which was to be in the style of theCastle of Otranto, with plenty of Border characters and supernatural<br>

  Author(s) HENRICH DIETER<br>
  Abstract: At the present time there is only a loose connection between the philosophical discipline of esthetics and efforts to diagnose the condition of the arts today. The assumption would hardly be disputed that art and philosophical theory move forward in such a way as to permit their situation of the moment to be reciprocally illustrated and interpreted; nevertheless, scarcely any effort has been made to test the circumference and limits of this presupposition.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x18wb">New Perspectives in German Literary Criticism: A Collection of Essays</a><br>
  Author(s) KOSELLECK REINHART<br>
  Abstract: The main difficulty in discussing chance in historiography is the fact that this subject has its own history, which as yet is unwritten. It is certainly impossible to discuss the role of chance in any given situation without first taking into account the whole terminology of the historian concerned. One needs to ask what is the opposite term that will exclude chance, or what is the overall term that makes it relative. Raymond Aron, for instance, begins his introduction to the philosophy of history with the antithesis, based on Cournot, between “
                  ordre” and “hasard”; he concludes: “Le fait historique est,<br>

Without the tools to negotiate the new conditions, a growing number of peasants had no choice but to sell their labor and become wageworkers, especially when the economy suff ered many setbacks in the 1930s because of the Great Depression.¹ Compared with the 1920s, when certain peasants were able to strengthen their holdings in relation to landowners and take<br>

  Abstract: The current proliferation of sequels in both literary and cinematic venues suggests an abiding interest in stories that follow up on and expand previously circulated stories. Sequel novels are written, published, and read for many different reasons, the most commonly expressed being a desire by the reader for repetition, but with difference; a wish by the author to explore in more detail a character or situation from a previous book; and a need expressed by the author or publisher, or both, to continue an economically successful venture. One of the most oftquoted commentaries on sequels is Terry Castle’s 1986 study<br>

  Book Title: Joy and Human Flourishing-Essays on Theology, Culture, and the Good Life<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Volf Miroslav<br>
  Abstract: Joy is crucial to human life and central to God’s relationship to the world, yet it is remarkably absent from contemporary theology and, increasingly, from our own lives! This collection, the result of a series of consultations hosted by the Yale Center of Faith and Culture, remedies this situation by considering the import of joy on human flourishing. These essays—written by experts in systematic and pastoral theology, Christian ethics, and biblical studies—demonstrate the promise of joy to throw open new theological possibilities and cast fresh light on all dimensions of human life. With contributions from Jurgen Moltmann, N. T. Wright, Marianne Meye Thompson, Mary Clark Moschella, Charles Mathewes, and Miroslav Volf, this volume puts joy at the heart of Christian faith and life, exploring joy’s biblical, dogmatic, ecclesiological, and ethical dimensions in concert with close attention to the shifting tides of culture. Convinced of the need to offer to the world a compelling Christian vision of the good life, the authors treat the connections between joy and themes of creation, theodicy, politics, suffering, pastoral practice, eschatology, and more, driven by the conviction that vital relationship with the living God is integral to our fullest flourishing as human creatures.<br>

  Author(s) Crisp Justin E.<br>
  Abstract: Why joy—and why now? It is perhaps counterintuitive for joy to occupy a central place in a Christian theology, or at least in a theology capable of taking seriously the state of the world in which we live. Have not the masters of suspicion sufficiently warned theologians away from commending religious sentiments that, in their spiritual purity, distract their subjects from the material situation of life and issue in a total flight from the world? Did not the manifold tragedies of the mid-twentieth century disabuse theologians once and for all of their Pollyanna-ish penchant for progress, their sure confidence<br>

  Abstract: The way of the cross is adversarial, yes, but the embodied expression of that way under conditions of empire is neither violent tactical maneuvering nor passive endurance. Both of these responses may be necessary in certain situations. But the binary of violence/nonviolence is not the most important consideration when weighing how to express an adversarial politics. The greater question is how effective action is possible—action that will, in fact, resist and transform. This chapter turns to the second defining characteristic of Jesus’ way of the cross after its adversarial politics: the forging of dramatic action. It points to the<br>

  Book Title: "Insubordinate Irish"-Travellers in the Text<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): hAodha Mícheál Ó<br>
  Abstract: This book traces a number of common themes relating to the representation of Irish Travellers in Irish popular tradition and how these themes have impacted on Ireland’s collective imagination. A particular focus of the book is on the exploration of the Traveller as “Other", an "Other" who is perceived as both inside and outside Ireland’s collective ideation. Frequently constructed as a group whose cultural tenets are in a dichotomous opposition to that of the “settled" community, this book demonstrates the ambivalence and complexity of the Irish Traveller “Other" in the context of a European postcolonial country. Not only has the construction and representation of Travellers always been less stable and “fixed" than previously supposed, these images have been acted upon and changed by both the Traveller and non-Traveller communities as the situation has demanded. Drawing primarily on little-explored Irish language sources, this volume demonstrates the fluidity of what is often assumed as reified or “fixed". As evidenced in Irish-language cultural sources the image of the Traveller is inextricably linked with the very concept of Irish identity itself. They are simultaneously the same and “Other" and frequently function as exemplars of the hegemony of native Irish culture as set against colonial traditions. This book is an important addition to the Irish Studies canon, in particular as relating to those exciting and unexplored terrains hitherto deemed “marginal" - Traveller Studies, Romani Studies and Diaspora/Migration Studies to name but a few.<br>

Mais il a surtout fait débat par sa proposition d’interdire les signes religieux ostentatoires chez les employés de l’État. Cette mesure a profondément polarisé l’opinion publique.

  Abstract: In February 1945, six months after the liberation of Paris, a Jewish writer in the French capital described the situation of his fellow Jewish survivors: “We are like the inhabitants of a city that has been devastated by an earthquake; we survey the ruins and do what comes naturally; we utilize that which is still usable in order to organize emergency relief.”¹ The comparison of the condition of French Jewry in the immediate postwar period with the aftermath of a natural disaster seemed a particularly apt one, at least in the first months after liberation.

  Abstract: This chapter will examine the experience of young Jewish girls who, having survived the Shoah as hidden children (
                     enfants cachés) sheltered by French opponents of the collaborationist Vichy regime, found themselves orphaned at Liberation and placed in Jewish children’s homes. Their particular vulnerability, and correspondingly the special duty of care toward them expected of state and community assistance organs, betoken a much bigger ethical picture than their apparently very spatially singular and temporally limited situation might at first suggest. It is an ethical picture that, albeit in inflected form, globally permeates various different geopolitical configurations today.<br>

  Abstract: If the second vatican council’s contribution to the dialogue between faith and reason in our day has to be understood as a word of continuity in principle, with recognition of discontinuity in situations, then it is equally important to recognize how the situation has been redefined by the Magisterium and ministry of Pope St. John Paul II. Seldom has a papacy been so grounded in guiding the conversation between faith and reason and in showing how, in the life of the pope himself, intellectual and spiritual lives are intertwined.<br>

He was aware too that this diversity of cultures and politics was particularly urgent for the world of his time. He uses the word ‘situation’ as a term that stands over against ‘tradition’. ‘Situation’ then refers to the cultural, social and existential context of the people to whom the gospel is proclaimed here and now, the concrete situation in which the tradition of faith is handed on by Christians to new generations.¹<br>

  Book Title: What Is Fiction For?-Literary Humanism Restored<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Harrison Bernard<br>
  Abstract: How can literature, which consists of nothing more than the description of imaginary events and situations, offer any insight into the workings of "human reality" or "the human condition"? Can mere words illuminate something that we call "reality"? Bernard Harrison answers these questions in this profoundly original work that seeks to re-enfranchise reality in the realms of art and discourse. In an ambitious account of the relationship between literature and cognition, he seeks to show how literary fiction, by deploying words against a background of imagined circumstances, allows us to focus on the roots, in social practice, of the meanings by which we represent our world and ourselves. Engaging with philosophers and theorists as diverse as Wittgenstein, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Foucault, Derrida, F. R. Leavis, Cleanth Brooks, and Stanley Fish, and illustrating his ideas through readings of works by Swift, Woolf, Appelfeld, and Dickens, among others, this book presents a systematic defense of humanism in literary studies, and of the study of the Humanities more generally, by a distinguished scholar.<br>

In an ambitious account of the relationship between literature and cognition, he seeks to show how literary fiction, by deploying words against a background of imagined circumstances, allows us to focus on the roots, in social practice, of the meanings by which we represent our world and ourselves. Engaging with philosophers and theorists as diverse as Wittgenstein, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Foucault, Derrida, F. R. Leavis, Cleanth Brooks, and Stanley Fish, and illustrating his ideas through readings of works by Swift, Woolf, Appelfeld, and Dickens, among others, this book presents a systematic defense of humanism in literary studies, and of the study of the Humanities more generally, by a distinguished scholar.<br>

  1  The Question of a Latin American Philosophy and Its Identity: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzkjc">Latin American Philosophy from Identity to Radical Exteriority</a><br>
  Abstract: Philosophy and Western culture have been synonymous at least since Hegel’s philosophy of history. Even when philosophy has been ignored, degraded, reappropriated, or put into question and even when philosophers have sought to “destroy” it, philosophy has been taken as a given inseparable from Western culture and born of it. Practically speaking, no one from the West or educated under the Western tradition, no matter how critical of it, would put into question the existence of European, French, German, or Italian philosophy. In Latin America the situation is different: The question that animates the very arising into existence and the<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapters we have seen a constant attentiveness in Latin American thinkers toward thinking in light of their concrete situation. This situated thought finds a profound opening in Enrique Dussel’s insight concerning Latin American thought as arising out of a radical exteriority beyond the possible control, determination, and manipulation of Western European and North American thought and culture. We also saw that such experience is pre-rational, inasmuch as it ultimately refers us to a sensibility found at the heart of the disposition that differentiates us as human, namely the encounter of other humans in a proximity sustained by<br>

The exposure to this situation offers an opening for thinking from beyond the instrumental rationalism of contemporary modernity, from radical exteriority. Latin America is a concrete living and articulate reality that, as the underside of modernity, displaces the Western North American and European claims to a hegemonic, selfsufficient, and autonomous power and causes a fecund opening for understanding anew philosophical thought.

  Author(s) Clark-Soles Jaime<br>
  Abstract: Prodigious are the questions generated by this passage (John 13:1–20), and only slightly less prodigious are the publications devoted to it. Textual, anthropological, theological, literary, and exegetical analyses abound; only the historical remains largely untouched. When the historical is mentioned, however, treatments most often refer to the history of the Johannine situation,
                  notto the historical Jesus or the historicity of the underlying Johannine tradition. Of all the questions one could ask, we shall attend most closely in this essay to these two. (1) Is it historically plausible that Jesus washed the feet of his disciples? Why or why<br>

  Author(s) Bond Helen K.<br>
  Abstract: Despite a general preference for the Synoptic Gospels, several features of John’s narrative have often commanded a certain historical respect: the lengthier ministry and its wider geographical location, the more complex relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist, the date of the crucifixion, and the passage that concerns us now—John’s Jewish interrogation of Jesus (Smith 1993, 252–67). C. H.

  Author(s) Nakasone Arturo<br>
  Abstract: The adoption and expansion of video games in Peru has been relatively slow, mainly due to the hard economic situation the country was going through during much of the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s. Video game history in Peru basically starts with the introduction of arcade machines during the beginning of the 1980s. At that time, a small number of businesses appeared, ranging from medium-sized arcade game centers, which deployed tens of machines, to small stores that had just a handful of them. The majority of arcade machines was provided by Japanese manufacturers such as Namco, Konami,<br>

  Abstract: Video games (sometimes called “VDO games” in Thailand) are popular and attract massive numbers of players around the world. Thai players engage console games, computer games, online games, and handheld games, and many organizations and companies are involved in video games in Thailand, yet there are few studies on the subject. Therefore, this chapter will describe the history of video games, the current situation of video games, and explain the behavior of video game players in Thailand. The population in this study included four groups who are involved in video games, including e-learning, animation and computer graphics, movie production companies,<br>

  Book Title: Luther and Liberation-A Latin American Perspective<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortres<br>
  Author(s): Altmann Walter<br>
  Abstract: With the approach of the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther’s inauguration of the Protestant Reformation and the burgeoning dialogue between Catholics and Lutherans opened under Pope Francis, this new edition of Walter Altmann’s Luther and Liberation is timely and relevant. Luther and Liberation recovers the liberating and revolutionary impact of Luther’s theology, read afresh from the perspective of the Latin American context. Altmann provides a much-needed reassessment of Luther’s significance today through a direct engagement of Luther’s historical situation with an eye keenly situated on the deeply contextual situation of the contemporary reader, giving a localized reading from the author’s own experience in Latin America. The work examines with fresh vigor Luther’s central theological commitments, such as his doctrine of God, Christology, justification, hermeneutics, and ecclesiology, and his forays into economics, politics, education, violence, and war. This new edition greatly expands the original text with fresh scholarship and updated sources, footnotes, and bibliography, and contains several additional new chapters on Luther’s doctrine of God, theology of the sacraments, his controversial perspective on the Jews, and a new comparative account with the Latin American liberation theology tradition.<br>

  Abstract: Affirmative action policies have existed in Brazil for some time. Between the 1940s and 1980s, Brazilian society tolerated policies of this nature, including a quota system, without major criticism. National legislation promulgated affirmative action policies which extended to the labor market and public universities.¹ From this perspective, there is nothing new in the use of mechanisms that promote equality. However, the situation changed when these policies were specifically extended to the black population. Since its implementation in 2002 in the public universities of Rio de Janeiro state, the system of quotas for black students has been heavily criticized vis-à-vis the<br>

On the one hand, they were born out of rage and, on the other, out of hope. Rage due to the dire situation with which most of humanity is confronted and the terrible level of exploitation that brings both human life and the entire planet to the edge of destruction. This should not be interpreted as some naïve irritation, commonly found among those ‘warm souls’ who, when watching children die of hunger, cry for the suffering of the<br>

  Abstract: Considerations of community always implicitly or explicitly invoke its alter, that is, situations that do not involve community. How this is defined or set out is usually bound up with the conceptualization of community itself. For example, if community is defined in terms of boundaries – social, symbolic, political – then we would be likely to view the question in terms of who is or is not included in a particular, identifiable or claimed grouping. In this volume, however, I have suggested that it is conceptually more productive to view community in terms of mobilization and attendant issues of coordination<br>

  Abstract: The foregoing essays by Valerie Abrahamsen, Peter Oakes, and Eduard Verhoef raise important issues for a project that takes seriously a history from below that does not privilege elite writings and considers carefully the cultural situation at Philippi. All three of the essays focus to some degree on the socioeconomic and religious context of the early Christadherents. Although a full excavation of the site of ancient Philippi is far from complete, the authors use the extant material remains at the site and, by analogy, from elsewhere to construct the social situation of the Philippian Christ-adherents in the first few centuries.<br>

  Abstract: Unmistakably the recipients of Philippians told their own stories and took initiatives to make major shifts in identity and behavior related to their narratives. Joining a new group with a foreign orientation was the product of a narrative that began with deficiencies, closely related to their social and economic situation, and belonging to the assembly played a major role in surmounting them. But their initiatives are hidden under the initiatives of another—Paul. They are subjects of his discourse rather than spokespersons of their own. Is it possible for them to speak for themselves?<br>

  Book Title: The Trouble with Community-Anthropological Reflections on Movement, Identity and Collectivity<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Mitchell Jon P.<br>
  Abstract: 'Community' is one of social science's longest-standing concepts. The assumption, of much social science, has been that it is in communities -- and to communities -- that human individuals, as social and cultural beings, belong. Communities are said to embody that interactive environment from which individuals' identities and senses of self derive, and in which they continue to dwell. The trouble with 'community' is that this is not necessarily so; the personal social networks of individuals' actual experience crosscut collective categories, situations and institutions. Communities can prove unviable or imprisoning; the reality of community life and identity can often be very different from the ideology and the ideal. In this provocative new book, anthropologists Vered Amit and Nigel Rapport draw on their various ethnographic experiences to reappraise the concept and the reality of 'community', in the light of globalization, religious fundamentalism, identity politics, and renascent localisms. How might anthropology better apprehend social identities which are intrinsically plural, transgressive and ironic? What has anthropology to say about the way in which civil society might hope to accommodate the on-going construction and the rightful expression of such migrant identities? Nigel Rapport and Vered Amit give their own answers to these questions before entering into dialogue to assess each other's positions. Nigel Rapport is Professor of Anthropological and Philosophical Studies at the University of St. Andrews. He is author of Transcendent Individual (1997). Vered Amit is an Associate Professor at Concordia University in Montreal. She is the editor of Realizing Community (2002).<br>

  Abstract: Medium, Messenger, Transmissionuses the figure of the messenger as a key metaphor for the function of all transmission media. Sybille Krämer illustrates this argument with a diverse range of situations involving some form of transmission, including the circulation of money, the translation of languages, the spread of infectious diseases, processes of transference and countertransference as seen in psychoanalysis, and even the development of cartography. This rich study provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of media philosophy while illuminating transmission media as active mediators in all systems of exchange.<br>

  Abstract: One early frosty Saturday morning in mid-December, one mom and dad were initially told that there was a 25 percent chance that their third child, a newborn baby girl, would live.

  Abstract: Les brisures relationnelles s’appuient de plus en plus sur des mécanismes de malaise qui engendrent des marques de fragilité, notamment des glissements, des incompréhensions dialogiques ou des mises à l’écart. La condition de solitude qui en dérive joue autour du lien – raté ou sous-jacent – capable d’interroger les ressources du “manque”. Les espaces – urbains ou paysans – ainsi que les situations d’abandon et de détachement – propres, en particulier, aux chômeurs, aux couples et aux relations parentales – apparaissent comme des éléments qui peuvent détourner malgré tout certains outils virtuels.<br>

  Abstract: Entre hypermnésie et oubli, le brouillard enveloppe l’imaginaire de Patrick Modiano qui flotte à la recherche de ces points de repères. Tout détour biographique, autobiographique, auto-fictionnel même à l’appui habituel de témoignages différents – des souvenirs personnels ou d’autrui aux documents – empêche la cristallisation des personnages afin qu’ils puissent échapper aux douleurs issues des brisures de l’Histoire.

  Author(s) MOOSAVI AMIR<br>
  Abstract: In discussions of modern literatures rarely are modern Arabic and Persian fictions brought together in a comparative context. Despite many shared sources and intertwining histories in the classical period and similar trajectories in the development of what are now considered modern literatures, Persian and Arabic literary traditions are seldom brought into conversation with one another. As a result, and despite some more recent attempts to rectify this situation, whether in the form of conferences or publications,¹ scholars and critics of either literature face a lacuna just considering the possibilities of comparison between the two literary traditions, even though both are<br>

  Author(s) Fuhrmann Wolfgang<br>
  Abstract: The ethnographic use of motion pictures has generally been considered lagging in comparison to the growing worldwide popularity of cinema in the early 20th century.¹ Although largely true, recent studies suggest that the situation in Germany did not follow this pattern. As Martin Taureg has shown, German ethnography’s theoretical focus on material culture combined with the country’s cinema reform movement to produce a notable early interest in the use of motion pictures as both research tool and teaching aid.² Nonetheless, what sounds like another German

  Abstract: There is consensus among historians and social scientists that collective identities can undergo thorough and sometimes radical processes of redefinition. Such changes of self-definition have been observed most clearly among populations that have located themselves in new historical contexts by long-distance migration and diasporic settlement. So much is clear, yet this consensus raises a tricky theoretical question. How is it possible that the same social agents can reaffirm putatively ancient ethnic or cultural cleavages in some situations, but can construct new identities and alternative or hybrid cultural forms in others? The answer I shall propose understands cultural identities as discursive<br>

  Author(s) HOVENKAMP HERBERT<br>
  Abstract: No historical legal policy can be evaluated without an understanding of the framework in which the policymakers viewed the world. If members of a society believe a particular scientific theory—for example, that interracial sex produces degenerate children—then they may be willing to sacrifice a great deal to avoid the consequences of interracial marriages. If they later discover that interracial marriages have no such consequences, then their views will probably change accordingly. In short, people’s scientific view of the world determines in large part the social situation that they regard as optimal. The genetic determinism that dominated social science<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bw1kc5">Critical White Studies</a><br>

  Abstract: Five-month-old infants who stare at surprising events for a long time, 5-year-old children with large vocabularies, and 50-year-old adults who invent new computer programs are all described as intelligent. The use of the same adjective implies that the same process is operating in all three situations. But we have no good evidence to support the idea that the psychological processes that produce an attentive infant are the same as those that produce a creative computer programmer. Moreover, a small number of psychologists—including J. P. Guilford, Howard Gardner, and Robert Sternberg—have argued persuasively against the usefulness of the notion<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c84g4c">Insights from Performance Criticism</a><br>
  Abstract: Biblical Performance Criticism is a way of understanding the Bible. It is the result of many streams of thought meeting over the last century, including form criticism, oral-tradition studies, rhetorical criticism, narrative criticism, memory studies, media studies, and performance studies. In some way, each of these streams analyzes four elements: (1) someone speaking, (2) someone hearing, (3) a text, and (4) a social situation. Each has contributed to the understanding that the Bible should be read in terms of the interaction of those four elements rather than any one of them in isolation.<br>

  Abstract: John Evans hated formality; anything that involved suits, ties or agendas made him unhappy. This unease extended, I believe, to grand or over-abstract theorising. He was much more comfortable in informal settings; field trips, especially with a small group, or the task of cross-examining a section during excavation, were his
                  forte. There he could bring to bear, in particular situations, his extraordinarily wide frame of reference. Looking back on his last two books,Land and ArchaeologyandEnvironmental Archaeology and the Social Order(Evans 1999; 2003), and especially the latter, one might be tempted to see a superficially anecdotal style,<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, we will begin to develop a rich

In order to grasp the reality behind the phenomenon of mental illness, we need to contextualize it within its historical framework and understand why and how it is culturally perceived, and how that perception has influenced the treatment options. What are the historical and political dimensions of this phenomenon? Who is benefiting from it, and who are the victims? What are the real barriers to recovery?

  Abstract: The failure of the 1956 revolution shattered the notion that the European status quo could be changed without the consent of the Soviet Union. Washington was forced to take a hard look at the European situation, and over the course of a decade they concluded that there was nothing they could do to reverse the continental division. The calculation that Europe would remain divided for the foreseeable future was not based solely on the United States’s inability to influence the power structure behind the Iron Curtain.

  Author(s) HOWELL J. DWAYNE<br>
  Abstract: The Bible, the sermon, and the congregation are all intricately related to the personal. Each is influenced by what is seen and heard and by how events and words are interpreted. The biblical text has a rich historical context in the ancient Near East that aids the reader in understanding what the text meant. However, this history is not a static history, locked in the past. Instead, it is a dynamic history of the divine acts of God that can be seen throughout the canonizing process as successive generations interpreted the tradition and text for their situations.

  Abstract: ‘The main thrust of what I want to say is that translating the Bible is an art that we seem to have lost, for mysterious reasons.’ So said David Daniell, the distinguished Tyndale scholar, at a conference in London in February 1995. There has been, to my knowledge, no decisive answer offered to the question implied by his statement. Daniell himself points out some of the central paradoxes of this situation. The ‘we’ of his statement refers, of course, to the community of English-speakers, a language which ‘has never been in better shape … It is healthier than ever before,<br>

  Abstract: A scarlet thread ties the stories of Tamar and Rahab together, as does the fact that they are both Canaanite women who use trickery to outwit men and gain control of their situation to save their lives and the lives of others. Yet, the setting to Rahab’s story is very different to Tamar’s. Her story is embedded in the account of the conquest of Canaan by the tribes of Israel led by Joshua. The Joshua narrative seeks to define boundaries, not just in terms of who lives where in the promised land but in terms of who is “in” and<br>

  Abstract: In the last two chapters, we have examined two central responses to the postmodern situation, and concluded that neither theory, as such, can tell us with certainty what the
                  goodis and how we ought to practice it in the world. The crisis of postmodernity affects both the “supply” and “demand” of ethics, that is of moral knowledge and action, of truth and agency, and embodying and doing the good. Without a coherent moral ontology there is no coherent understanding of moral realism; we cannot have a coherent view of the good because we cannot account for the moral structure<br>

  Book Title: Religion and Violence-A Dialectical Engagement through the Insights of Bernard Lonergan<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Arcamone Dominic<br>
  Abstract: The aim of Religion and Violence is to engage dialectically key symbols of religiously motivated violence through the insights of Bernard Lonergan. Sociologists and psychologists argue the link between religion and violence. Religion is viewed more as part of the problem and not part of the solution to violence. Bernard Lonergan’s insights have helped the author arrive at a number of conclusions regarding the link between religion and violence. He argues that there is a difference between distorted religion and genuine religion, between authenticity and inauthenticity of the subject. Distorted religion has the capacity to shape traditions in ways that justify violence, while genuine religion heals persons, helps them make different moral decisions when confronted with situations of conflict, and aims to explore new ways of understanding themselves as shaping history toward progress. Further, Religion and Violence, while arguing from within the Catholic Christian tradition, nevertheless seeks to provide a number of categories that will speak to people from other cultural traditions. Since many of the examples of religious violence cited by commentators come out of the Islamic tradition, the author has evidenced and explored more authentic aspects of the Islamic tradition that would help provide a solution to violence.<br>

  8  A Dialectical Engagement with Demonization from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbhn">Religion and Violence</a><br>
  Abstract: The third symbol presented by Juergensmeyer and others for understanding the link between violence and religion is the phenomenon of demonization. In this chapter, I will argue that without a heuristic account of evil, people will be unable to discern why demonization continues the cycle of violence. We will see that social exclusion and humiliation provide for the emergence and survival of demonizing processes, while acts of dehumanization escalate those processes to the point where those demonized are robbed of their subjectivity. Emerging out of situations where there is an imbalance of power, I will demonstrate the role of

  Abstract: Within plurilegal and plurilingual legislative contexts, statutes should convey the same meaning to all citizens and should be construed by judges in a way comprehensible to all parties concerned. In jurisdictions where two or more legal traditions are merged, quite often expressed in more than one legal language, it is necessary for laws to be drafted, implemented and interpreted in accord with these different legal traditions and languages. Except for situations where one legal tradition is articulated in one language, there are a number of instances where bijuralism and/or multilingualism are operative: a few cases in point are the legal<br>

Certes, l’ONU a commencé à rédiger des rapports sur la situation sociale dans le monde. Elle a examiné les problèmes de santé, d’éducation, de logement, etc. Mais jamais elle n’a parlé de pauvreté. Et la seule solution aux problèmes qu’elle ait jamais proposée demeure le « développement ». Quant à la BM, dont le slogan est aujourd’hui «<br>

Autrement dit, il se constitue avant tout comme outil de compréhension, de transformation et de conscience sociale. C'est pourquoi, libéré de l’argent, sa pauvreté est à la fois sa chance et sa malédiction. Cette exception permet ainsi de faire contre mauvaise fortune bon coeur, situation qui le différencie fondamentalement du cinéma occidental noyé dans le lucre qui permet de diffuser une culture marchande de masse.

  Abstract: Suppose a conversation among three humanists from the recent modern past could be staged: namely, Jacques Maritain (1882–1973), a principal figure in the twentieth-century revival of Thomism and a leading Catholic philosopher; John Dewey (1859–1952), the American pragmatist and ambivalent apologist for liberalism; and Karl Marx (1818–83), founder of modern communism and the most trenchant critic of the capitalist mode of production. What might it contribute to the way we understand our contemporary situation? A successful conversation does not require complete agreement as its outcome, but it can lead to what Hans-Georg Gadamer called a “fusion of<br>

  Abstract: In
                  World of Wondersthere are, as Magnus Eisengrim says, “double words for everything.”¹ Like many of Davies’ texts, World ofWondersis an intricate structure of dialogue and duality wherein Davies continually creates situations, images, and narrative structures that are doubled. Not only are they doubled, but this doubling is done in a duplicitous way. Like Eisengrim himself, who is named after that cunning animal the wolf, Doubles are often there to trick us. I intend to examine this doubling in two ways: in terms of narrative content and narrative structure. In the content phase, I will focus on<br>

  Author(s) GAGNON CHANTAL<br>
  Abstract: In Canadian history, many sociopolitical conflicts have arisen from the coexistence of two different peoples in a single land. For instance, one can think of Canada’s Conscription Crisis in 1942, its October Crisis in 1970, or its failure to conclude the Meech Lake Accord in 1990.¹ Rival nationalism is often called upon to explain these conflict situations between French and English Canadians. According to sociologists Bourque and Duchastel (1996, 315), until 1960 two nationalisms clashed with one another: that of the French community, based on the French-Canadian “race” and the Roman Catholic faith, and that of the English community, based<br>

That is, are there natural and inalienable rights which any human being anywhere, anytime, can appropriately lay claim to no matter what his situation in life and no matter in what society he finds himself? Bentham tells us that “Natural rights is simple nonsense: natural and imprescriptable rights rhetorical nonsense — nonsense upon stilts.” But in our time some able and analytically oriented moral philosophers have again defended, albeit not without modifications, this ancient notion.<br>

  Abstract: When Proust writes about the air raid on Paris in

The dramatic political situation blends with the extreme pleasure that comes from breaking prohibition. The excitement brought about by the bombing, rather than its danger, inspires the respectable aristocracy with a stubborn inclination to precipitate theterrible.<br>

  Abstract: “Like people and schools of criticism, ideas and theories travel—from person to person, from situation to situation, from one period to another. Cultural and intellectual life are usually nourished and often sustained by this circulation of ideas, and whether it takes the form of acknowledged or unconscious influence, creative borrowing, or wholesale appropriation, the movement of ideas and theories from one place to another is both a fact of life and a usefully enabling condition of intellectual activity.” Edward Said’s words suggest how ideas and theories travel or are borrowed and used in different places for different purposes: “For<br>

  Abstract: Aujourd’hui, l’économie mondiale impose aux villes d’être compétitives. Les villes ont besoin de trouver un rôle renouvelé dans la nouvelle hiérarchie urbaine (Kearns et Forrest, 2000), rôle qui n’est pas toujours en faveur de la vie quotidienne des citoyens. Ce phénomène met les villes dans une situation souvent déséquilibrée entre recherche de compétitivité et maintien (ou renforcement) de la cohésion sociale. De fait, les financements publics sont désormais plus souvent orientés vers la recherche de compétitivité que vers la cohésion sociale des territoires (Cassiers et Kesteloot, 2012).

  Abstract: L’ampleur de la crise actuelle et les multiples soubresauts du modèle économique depuis la fin des années 1970 favorisent un regain d’intérêt pour l’innovation, supposée à l’origine d’un nouveau régime de croissance. On perçoit aussi que la croyance dans le progrès technologique comme réponse aux situations de crise trouve ses limites. Dans ce contexte, l’innovation sociale apparaît comme la nouvelle solution susceptible de favoriser non seulement la croissance, mais aussi une forme de partage de ses fruits plus équitable et, dans certains cas, de redéfinir les politiques sociales (Moulaert

  Abstract: La conversion des couvents et des autres édifices religieux devenus obsolètes pose de nombreux défis. Il faut, d’une part, faire en sorte que de nouveaux usagers se les réapproprient et, d’autre part, en conserver les valeurs collectives. La situation est particulièrement complexe lorsqu’il s’agit de conversion à des fins résidentielles, usage à la fois convoité et difficile à concilier avec de telles valeurs. Je m’intéresse ici à ce genre de transformation, sans toutefois en discuter le bien-fondé, d’autant plus qu’au Québec, les propriétés conventuelles sont privées et peuvent être vendues sans autre contrainte que les règles publiques imposées aux changements<br>

Cet ouvrage s’inscrit dans une trilogie offrant une réflexion tant sur les écritures en situation professionnelle (Cros, Lafortune et Morisse, 2009) que sur le processus de professionnalisation par l’écriture, en se centrant sur la notion d’accompagnement (Morisse, Lafortune et Cros, 2011). Celui-ci offre une perspective nouvelle en exposant les soubassements épistémologiques de recherches entreprises – dont certaines sont présentées dans les ouvrages précédents – concernant un objet de recherche encore peu exploré.

  Author(s) Duggan Anne E.<br>
  Abstract: Within the domain of fairy-tale studies, queer theory has yet to receive the critical attention that it deserves, particularly given the centrality of sexuality in fairy tales.¹ This situation increasingly is changing, evident in the work of Kay Turner and Pauline Greenhill, among others.² Approaching fairy-tale texts and films from the perspective of queer theory can help students understand the ways in which fairy-tale plots can subvert what is often—and problematically—taken for granted in classical tales: the heteronormative plot, upheld by a specific configuration of gender roles. As Turner has argued, “Even if many tales hurtle headlong toward<br>

  Abstract: When asked about the victory against Napoleon at Waterloo, the Duke of Wellington is said to have replied, “The battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton.” It was the habits and dispositions that the officers and soldiers of the British army learned in boarding school that enabled Great Britain to prevail in the encounter. Samuel Wells contends that Eton and Waterloo exemplify two distinct aspects of ethical thought and behavior, the first the long period of preparation, the second “the tiny episode of implementation—the moment of decision, or ‘situation.’” Of the two, says Wells, the<br>

  Abstract: In the
                  Seventh Letter, Plato tells us that, as a young man, he had political ambitions and that the situation of Athens seemed to favor them. A revolution had just put an end to the democracy; the aristocracy of the Thirty had gained absolute power and some of Plato’s relatives, who participated in the new government, invited him to join their political efforts. Plato had high hopes: the new regime would transform the formerly unjustpolisinto a community based on justice and internal peace. However, his hopes were cruelly dashed when the rulers committed crimes that were as scandalous<br>

  Book Title: The Chatter of the Visible-Montage and Narrative in Weimar Germany<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): McBride Patrizia C.<br>
  Abstract: The Chatter of the Visible examines the paradoxical narrative features of the photomontage aesthetics of artists associated with Dada, Constructivism, and the New Objectivity. While montage strategies have commonly been associated with the purposeful interruption of and challenge to narrative consistency and continuity, McBride offers an historicized reappraisal of 1920s and 1930s German photomontage work to show that its peculiar mimicry was less a rejection of narrative and more an extension or permutation of it—a means for thinking in narrative textures exceeding constraints imposed by “flat" print media (especially the novel and other literary genres). McBride’s contribution to the conversation around Weimar-era montage is in her situation of the form of the work as a discursive practice in its own right, which affords humans a new way to negotiate temporality, as a particular mode of thinking that productively relates the particular to the universal, or as a culturally specific form of cognition.<br>

  Chapter Six  SOME RECENT RECONSIDERATIONS OF RATIONALITY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxpb96">Knowledge and Human Liberation</a><br>
  Abstract: The concept of rationality has been subjected to numerous critiques in the history of modernity, and all these critiques have been helpful in opening rationality to crosscultural translations and examinations. Despite numerous anthropological critiques of a Eurocentric notion of rationality which looks at other people such as the tribal people having a primitive mind, a modernistic and West-centric view of rationality is still very much on the throne. This situation seems to be slightly altering in the realm of philosophical discourse with some recent foundational interrogations of rationality offered by thinkers such as alasdair macIntyre and Stephen Toulmin, who urge<br>

  Abstract: La situation des enseignants et enseignantes de la formation professionnelle est très particulière. D’abord parce qu’ils sont engagés en fonction de la maîtrise du métier à enseigner et que leur recrutement s’effectue parmi les travailleurs en emploi, ensuite parce que, contrairement aux autres enseignants du secteur général aux niveaux primaire et secondaire, leur formation à l’enseignement survient généralement une fois qu’ils sont engagés dans les centres de formation professionnelle (CFP), parfois même après plusieurs années d’enseignement, et ce, dans le même temps qu’ils doivent donner leur cours (Balleux, 2006; Ministère de l’Éducation [MEQ], 2001a; Deschenaux, Monette et Tardif, 2012; Tardif,<br>

  Abstract: La situation qui prévalait dans les programmes de formation en enseignement professionnel, avant la réforme de 2001, exigeait des enseignants de ce secteur une formation universitaire de 30 crédits menant à un certificat en enseignement professionnel ne comportant aucune formation pratique en milieu scolaire. L’augmentation substantielle du nombre de crédits universitaires nécessaires à l’obtention du brevet d’enseignement et l’intégration de stages d’une durée importante dans la formation constituent deux éléments majeurs de cette réforme de la formation des maîtres en enseignement professionnel (Ministère de l’Éducation [MEQ], 2001).<br>

  Abstract: When we think of Aboriginal people in the context of fuel, one common image is of Aboriginal protestors voicing resistance to energy projects like PIPELINES, DAMS, and uranium mines. One reason for the prevalence and the visibility of such protests is that Aboriginal people are disproportionately affected by energy megaprojects—in fact, it is difficult to find a megaproject that has

  Abstract: The Field Day Theatre Company, originating in Derry in the throes of the Troubles in 1980, set out with the express purpose of discovering a new language for the expression of Irish cultural memory.

  Abstract: The term
                  developmentin missionary activity has normally referred to the process by which the physical and social needs of persons and groups are given attention along with their spiritual needs. The goals have been to raise people from poverty, alleviate suffering, and improve the social situation of the oppressed. The motive has been twofold. First was the desire to follow the mandate of the Old Testament prophets, who called on Israel to care for the poor, the widow, and the orphan, and to follow Jesus Christ, who healed the sick and reached out to the marginalized.

  Abstract: A martyr is defined as “one who voluntarily suffers death as the penalty of witness to and refusing to renounce his religion” (
                  Webster’s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language). For purposes of quantification, Christian martyrs are “believers in Christ who have lost their lives prematurely, in situations of witness, as a result of human hostility.” This definition can be expounded as follows: “Believers in Christ” are individuals from the entire Christian community of Roman Catholics, Orthodox, Protestants, Anglicans, Marginal Christians, and Independents. “‘Lost their lives” restricts it to Christians actually put to death, for whatever reason. “Prematurely” means<br>

  Book Title: Memories of Asaph-Mnemohistory and the Psalms of Asaph<br>
  Publisher: Fortress Press<br>
  Author(s): Jacobson Karl N.<br>
  Abstract: Although the Psalms of Asaph (Pss. 50, 73‒83) contain a concentration of historical referents unparalleled in the Psalter, they have rarely attracted sustained historical interest. Karl N. Jacobson identifies these Psalms as containing cultic historiography, historical narratives written for recitation in worship, and explores them through mnemohistory, attending to how the past is remembered and to the rhetorical function of recitation in the cultic setting. Asaph “remembers" the past as a movement from henotheism to Yahwism as the core memory that informs a new historical situation for worship participants.<br>

  Abstract: The emotional violence that Phaedra releases from Hippolytus’ ostensibly peaceful landscape reveals the contradictions in his character and the precariousness of a personality that uses violence as a defense against sexuality.

  Abstract: For Seneca’s Phaedra, as for Euripides’ and Racine’s, the crossing of the barrier between silence and speech is the critical event. Once these words of desire are spoken, the relation between the speakers is irrevocably changed. Neither the lover who confesses the love nor the beloved who receives the message can ever be quite the same toward one another again. This climactic point of decisive speaking lies at the heart of dramatic representation: the art of converting the exchange of words and feelings into theatrical situation. Communication becomes surrounded with a suspenseful direction that draws us inevitably toward an overwhelming<br>

  Abstract: Ireland in the Celtic Tiger years saw an unprecedented influx of ethnically diverse migrants to a nation formerly perceived as comparatively monocultural. Sketching the two dominant representations of post-Celtic Tiger multiculturalism, Amanda Tucker notes that the first of these ‘emphasizes that fear and hostility continue to characterize Irish responses to inward migration since the Gaelic Catholic monolith remains’ at the heart of twenty-first-century Irish identity, thus reinforcing ‘the idea of Ireland as a monocultural rather than multicultural society’ (Tucker, 2010: 107).¹ The second type of response claims that, despite the legal situation of immigrants, Ireland is a country traditionally open<br>

  Abstract: One of the most interesting phenomena to appear in Irish literature since the late 1990s has been the rise of ‘homegrown’ crime fiction. Irish crime narrative has been strong, historically, as a sub-genre, but until the 1990s had largely been concerned with the representation of fictional crime in non-Irish settings, usually the US or the UK. Since the period immediately prior to the economic boom commonly known as the Celtic Tiger, however, a number of circumstances have given rise to a situation in which, for the first time, Irish readers are demanding novels and other narratives which portray Irish crime<br>

This question is at the center of Romans 9–11, and Paul Meyer has clearly articulated it: If God’s action in Christ was as radical as Paul (and subsequent Christian faith) claims, “what then becomes<br>

  Abstract: For some people the very idea that childhood can be meaningfully associated with joy and so in any meaningful way carefree is unrealistic. A significant number of children have experiences of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, and others are neglected. Some may have experienced a restrictive illness or disability, or been exposed to loss or upsetting situations by the adults or by friends or siblings in their lives. A difficult or damaged childhood will cast a long shadow and can lead to an inability to trust and problems in later relationships. The lack of trust can lead to a sense<br>

  Abstract: This paper aims to understand the meaning and role that Jaspers attributes to worldviews. By analysing the nature of the
                  Weltanschauungen, the paper shows how Jaspers, inspired by Dilthey, alludes to a fundamental stratum of the Weltanschauung that goes beyond every objective construction, every shell (Gehäuse) and every doctrine, and which is identified with the process of the existential experience. The antinomicity of the lived process and the ambiguity that characterises the worldviews becomes clearer where Jaspers introduces the notion of limit situation. By analysing the relationship between theWeltanschauungenand the philosophical faith, the paper shows that theWeltanschauungen<br>

  Abstract: The essay discusses Karl Jaspers’ concept of limit situations in his
                  Psychology of Worldviews. In limit situations, individuals experience their finite existence in an essential way. The essay shows that the concept had great influence on Martin Heidegger, who gives two of the situations, death and guilt, a decisive role in the phenomenological analysis of human existence inBeing and Time. For Jaspers’Psychology, the main emphasis lies on the individual’s spiritual counter-reaction to the experience of limit situations, which leaves the overall status of the situations unclear. The essay also shows that for Jaspers limit situations are devastating because<br>

  Abstract: Prodromal and pre-psychotic states are characterized by pervasive instabilities on all levels of experience and could lead to what Karl Jaspers calls limit-situations (
                  Grenzsituationen). In the process of defending against such existential instabilities or limit-situations, different strategies and mechanisms are employed to provide a shelter or enclosure (Gehäuse). In this article, we explore the transition from the limitsituations to enclosures in psychotic and mystical states. In both we can differentiate multiple orientations. Many individuals, who experience psychotic and mystical states, have in fact experiences of both, at least to some extent. Together with everyday, common-sense level of experience we can<br>

This announcement profoundly changed the political situation that had existed in North Lebanon since the departure of Syrian troops in April 2005. From the beginning, this jihadi group outlined a series of rather grandiose objectives aimed at winning international, Arab, and local Lebanese public opinion over to its cause. It would struggle against the West and its local allies, conduct jihad for the liberation of Palestine, and destroy all those who opposed these glorious purposes.

  CHAPTER 2  Criteria for Democratic Inquiry from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pwt43v">The Priority of Injustice</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter I want to elaborate further on why thinking about democracy in an ordinary way, as suggested at the end of the previous chapter, should lead us away from supposing that there is a particular form of politics that is properly political, as if grasping this form would allow lesser forms to be characterized as postpolitical. In particular, I want to consider how best to understand the problem of deriving “context-transcending” principles from the specific situations in which the meanings of democratic politics are articulated. I take it for granted that this possibility can no longer be premised<br>

  The Future of Medicine: from:

  Author(s) Gyarmati Gabriel<br>
  Abstract: The future is unpredictable. But one thing we can do is examine the factors that are likely to steer the development of specific institutions: in this case, medicine. That is what I will do in this essay. To identify those factors, however, it is first necessary to define the situation in which medicine currently finds itself and examine the events that forged that situation. I suggest that the current state of medicine is shaped by three circumstances.<br>

  Book Title: Redescribing the Gospel of Mark-  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Merrill P.<br>
  Abstract: This final volume of studies by members of the Society of Biblical Literature's consultation, and later seminar, on Ancient Myths and Modern Theories of Christian Origins focuses on Mark. As with previous volumes, the provocative proposals on Christian origins offered by Burton L. Mack are tested by applying Jonathan Z. Smith's distinctive social theorizing and comparative method. Essays examine Mark as an author's writing in a book culture, a writing that responded to situations arising out of the first Roman-Judean war after the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 CE. Contributors William E. Arnal, Barry S. Crawford, Burton L. Mack, Christopher R. Matthews, Merrill P. Miller, Jonathan Z. Smith, and Robyn Faith Walsh explore the southern Levant as a plausible provenance of the Gospel of Mark and provide a detailed analysis of the construction of Mark as a narrative composed without access to prior narrative sources about Jesus. A concluding retrospective follows the work of the seminar, its developing discourse and debates, and the continuing work of successor groups in the field.<br>

  Author(s) Jackson Rodger L.<br>
  Abstract: Trust on the part of a patient may be the central requirement of the fiduciary relationship between patients and health care providers.² The ideal situation occurs when a patient places himself or herself—or is placed by others—in the hands of the caregiver with complete trust. The reality is that such complete trust seldom exists. We must accept the reality that in today’s climate, limited levels of trust are likely to exist. Health care professionals must learn how to maximize the possibility of that trust wherever the opportunity exists.³ We ought to welcome moral and cultural disagreements and differences,<br>

                  Ccan be considered a text focused on aesthetic critique (i.e. an interrogation of its own conditions of aesthetic possibility and self-situation within a specific literary history and/or taxonomy, independently of the university), then this is the type of metafiction that ismostvulnerable to the accusation of political nihilism. A purely formalist mode, after all, whether in the university or in fiction seems to disavow politics, even ifRemainderdoes make an ethical critique of representational art.¹ While certain texts exemplify an aesthetic critique of the process of canonisation, taking this element<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t89d2j">Biographical methods and professional practice</a><br>
  Author(s) Nagel Ulrike<br>
  Abstract: This chapter deals with the biographical situation and coping strategies of highly educated cadres under the authoritarian regime of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). It draws from a study of work biographies of contemporary East German managers who had previously been economic cadres in the GDR. The second part of the chapter considers methodological difficulties of cross-cultural research, particularly in the arenas of post-socialist transformation research and migration research. The problem of providing an adequate framework of interpretation for the social phenomena of a culture unfamiliar to the researcher will be captured by the notion of lacking the ‘common<br>

  Author(s) SUNG JUNG MO<br>
  Abstract: Faced with situations of injustice and human suffering, people with genuine faith cannot remain indifferent. They must take a stand and engage in movements or struggles for justice and for overcoming oppressive situations and suffering. Such engagement breaks away from the divide established by the modern world between public and private spheres, the latter being the one where religion should play its role. That is why Christian groups engaging in those struggles feel the need for theologies that are not restrained by the modern relegation of religion to the private sphere and eternal life; they search for reasons for their<br>

  Abstract: When I was invited to reflect about church and gender as a contribution from the Global North, I immediately thought about the unequal presence and role of women and men within German Protestant churches. Because of this focus, this will not be a representative reflection of the Global North—which is, in my opinion, a highly questionable term—but an attempt to describe the situation of a very specific reality of a powerful church in a secularized country. As I begin my reflection, I want to note that I find it interesting, as an individual from the Global North, to<br>

  [Part III Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1v2xssp">The Film Museum Practice and Film Historiography</a><br>
  Abstract: A film is not just a physical object, an amalgam of celluloid and chemicals, it also consists of fleeting images projected onto a screen. Hence, it is both a fragile material object and an elusive, temporary, performative one. This means that all the elements related to its display, such as its projection and the interior design of the screening room, form a crucial part of the film’s presentation. The screening situation fundamentally affects the meaning an audience creates out of the images that appear before it.

  Abstract: Genres exist in nonverbal activities no less than in verbal. There are history paintings, portrait paintings, abstract paintings, as there are kinds of architecture and music genres. But if we wish to describe or explain or interpret these genres we use language—descriptive explanations and interpretation are themselves genres. I make this acknowledgment in order to indicate the range of this paper: I limit myself to our statements about speech and written genres. Since this is the first paper to be presented at this conference on genre, I want to assess the situation of genre criticism and theory as the<br>

  Innovation and Variation: from:

  Abstract: The study of literary history inevitably involves the study of literary change, and any explanation of change must distinguish among the types of change that are possible. These include changes within the work of a single writer, changes among different writers who share common ends, like the Scriblerus group (this can include, as well, changes in what are called “schools,” “movements,” and “periods”), changes in the forms of genres, changes in style, changes in critical interpretation. It is apparent that the term “change” identified with these many different literary situations—and they are not all that one can name—needs<br>

  Abstract: In the early twenty-first century a horrific event drew attention to the precarious situation of migrant workers in northern Europe and Britain. On 5 February 2004, on the beach of Morecambe Bay in northwest England, twenty-three Chinese cockle pickers drowned when gangmasters sent them out onto the sands late in the day.¹ They may have ignored the high winds, the treacherously swift local tides, and the quicksands, or, strangers to the area, they may not have known. On the way onto the sands, the Chinese workers passed groups of returning local cockle pickers who, alert to the predicted high tide,<br>

  Author(s) Dillon Mike<br>
  Abstract: There appears to be no shortage, from any nation, of conservative politicians whose hyperbolic warnings against illegal immigration smack of alarmism and racial provocation. In the case of Japan, there have been numerous instances of invoking organized a crime syndicates, commonly known as the yakuza, to inflate anti-immigrant rhetoric and generate politically handy arguments for keeping immigration under tight control.¹ Apichai Shipper has illustrated how misleading statistics are used to reinforce links between foreigners and crime, “[constructing] a public image of foreigners as ‘dangerous,’ with little connection to real events or social situations.”² The Japanese debate about illegal immigration takes<br>

  Abstract: From a narratological point of view, one of the most controversial legacies the eighteenth-century novel has bestowed onto its inheritors is the technique of authorial narration. Described by Franz K. Stanzel as one of three typical narrative situations, authorial narration as defined in the
                  Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theoryis ‘characterized by a highly audible and visible narrator’ who ‘sees the story from the ontological position of an outsider, that is, a position of absolute authority which allows her/him to know everything about events and characters, including their thoughts and unconscious motives’ (Jahn, 2005, p. 364).

  Abstract: The sociologist Peter Berger highlights one of the major differences between premodern and modern societies. In the former, one could find a great measure of fate, inasmuch as the possibilities of changing practices and conducts were restricted. In medicine, in nonscientific techniques, in methods of education, and so forth, there was little room for maneuvering. By contrast, “the modern individual … lives in a world of choice….

  Abstract: La place d’Ottawa dans le paysage culturel franco-ontarien contemporain est ambiguë. Bien que la ville abrite, depuis le tournant des années 1980, maints organismes culturels, littéraires et théâtraux, il est difficile de confirmer son rôle en tant que capitale culturelle de l’Ontario français. Est-ce attribuable au fait que la ville est plus reconnue comme capitale nationale que comme lieu d’épanouissement de la culture franco-ontarienne¹ ?

  Author(s) MÉVELLEC Anne<br>
  Abstract: La ville d’Ottawa est le siège de la capitale du Canada, mais elle est aussi une entité dont la légitimité vient du corps politique qui la dirige. À ce titre, la Ville est soumise au jeu de nombreux acteurs aux intérêts politiques divers, incluant les groupes francophones qui revendiquent des services en français. La communauté francophone représente 16,4 % de la population de la ville² et entretient des liens privilégiés avec les populations francophones de l’Est ontarien et de Gatineau, du côté québécois³. La présence historique ainsi que la situation particulière de ces populations font en sorte que la question<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1x76fs8">Ethnographica Moralia</a><br>
  Author(s) Martin Richard P.<br>
  Abstract: the relation between Classics and Anthropology must be a relation of active debate. It is difficult, if not impossible, to gain an understanding of the methods and critical standards in argument of another discipline without personal contact and discussion. Up to the FirstWorldWar both classicists and anthropologists took it for granted that their relationship should be one of exchange of ideas and collaboration in developing theory; we have to try to recreate this situation.”¹<br>

  Abstract: As a former colony of Great Britain, Australia has faced the dual challenge experienced by all settler colonies of forging an identity that allows it to distinguish itself from its ‘parent’ culture at the same time deal with its complicity in the colonization of the new land and the treatment of its original inhabitants. In the case of Australia, this situation has been further complicated by the fact that the land was simply taken – without a war, without a treaty and without negotiation. Throughout its European history, Australia has needed to perpetuate its founding myth of being a previously<br>

  4  Music without Text: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxz0jw">Sonata Fragments</a><br>
  Abstract: Rhetorical strategies in non-text-based Romantic music can be understood as analogous to the strategies that appear in the text-based slow movements by Brahms. Expressive meaning in such music may thus be interpreted in analogous ways. This chapter draws on the piano sonatas of Schumann, Brahms, and Chopin to examine situations that may be interpreted in terms of what I have defined as durational atemporality, ruptured atemporality, and conflations of these two atemporality types.<br>

  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxz0jw">Sonata Fragments</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the most important points in the foregoing analyses is that nineteenth century Romantic sonatas (and Romantic sonata forms more broadly) are governed in both structure and content by a central conflict—an essential expressive opposition that can be construed in a variety of ways: perfect versus imperfect, present versus nonpresent, real versus unreal, and so on. The conflict is best understood as stemming from the Romantic compulsion for creating, or re-creating, something better than what is currently available in one’s present situation—looking toward a better future, for example, or reminiscing on a better past.

  Book Title: Trauma in First Person-Diary Writing during the Holocaust<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): GREENBERG AVNER<br>
  Abstract: What are the effects of radical oppression on the human psyche? What happens to the inner self of the powerless and traumatized victim, especially during times of widespread horror? In this bold and deeply penetrating book, Amos Goldberg addresses diary writing by Jews under Nazi persecution. Throughout Europe, in towns, villages, ghettos, forests, hideouts, concentration and labor camps, and even in extermination camps, Jews of all ages and of all cultural backgrounds described in writing what befell them. Goldberg claims that diary and memoir writing was perhaps the most important literary genre for Jews during World War II. Goldberg considers the act of writing in radical situations as he looks at diaries from little-known victims as well as from brilliant diarists such as Chaim Kaplan and Victor Klemperer. Goldberg contends that only against the background of powerlessness and inner destruction can Jewish responses and resistance during the Holocaust gain their proper meaning.<br>

  Author(s) Hansen Jennifer L.<br>
  Abstract: Presumably, there are many cosmopolitans: the well-traveled, sophisticated, polyglot; the stoic serenely navigating heterogeneous (and fractious) cultural spaces; the migrant following new capital flows; the hospitable host; the religious seeker; or, the peace builder appealing to our shared earth. Cosmopolitans—whatever motive—are mapmakers redrawing the boundaries of the familiar in order to seek what is better.¹ And, it is this broadly shared goal—seeking what is better—that occupies me here because it is often motivated by hope. To seek what is better might be a way to describe what Gabriel Marcel calls “the fundamental situation to which it<br>

  Abstract: The history of introducing Soviet-type political regimes in countries along the European border of the USSR has long been the subject of vehement scholarly and journalistic discussions. Historians still cannot agree on what plan exactly Stalin had in mind for Eastern Europe immediately after the war. Remarkably, Soviet and Western assessments of the post-war situation in the region coincided almost completely. The American diplomat George Kennan compared Eastern Europe in the transitional period between war and peace to a ‘malleable and pliant mass’, while Soviet Foreign Minister Viacheslav Molotov spoke of it being in ‘a liquid state’.¹ There was nothing<br>

This research relates to the complex issues that the Holocaust, as well as other genocides, might be caused by situations still present in contemporary society, including the fragility of political and social institutions and society’s responsibility to its people, all in the context of post1989 Romania and its road toward democratization.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284x9r">Resilience and the virtue of fortitude</a><br>
  Abstract: Although suffering and challenge demoralize some human beings, others cope and construct instead. Rather than grinding to a halt, certain people hurdle the obstacles or creatively maneuver around them. They even make something positive out of the negative situation. In the face of crisis, they not only survive but also thrive. Resilience capacities involve coping well with difficulty, actively resisting destructive pressures, and rebuilding positively after adversity. However, people do not exercise these capacities in equal measure. Human beings faced with similar situations end up in diverse spots. Some manage destructive life events more efficaciously. Others lose a sense of<br>

  1  The Resilience Perspective from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284x9r">Resilience and the virtue of fortitude</a><br>
  Abstract: At every level of society, particular situations make or break the lives of children, adolescents, and adults—situations of violence, loss, indifference, and hatred. Some human beings cope well when faced with them, and others do not. Specialists call this capacity to do well in adversity “resilience.” Psychosocial research has documented three types of resilience phenomena: good outcomes in the midst of high risk (coping), sustained competence under stress (constancy), and recovery from trauma (constructing).² In order to track these resilience phenomena, researchers have changed their perspectives and methods.³ Moral theologians can benefit from these sciences’ insights into how humans<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284x9r">Resilience and the virtue of fortitude</a><br>
  Abstract: If any of our communities, families, or selves were invulnerable, we would need neither emotions such as fear, hope, and daring, nor virtues such as fortitude. Even in the most protected environments, we rightly experience fear when faced with real and potential deformation, destruction, or loss. Fear is based on human vulnerabilities that extend from physical to psychological, from economic to social, and from moral to spiritual levels. Can we prevent fear from causing deeper anxiety? Can we prepare ourselves in order to better control fearful situations? Can we resist fear without forgoing what is good, right, and true? Courage<br>

  10  Conclusions: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284x9r">Resilience and the virtue of fortitude</a><br>
  Abstract: The existential bridge that allows us to relate the psychosocial sciences and St. Thomas’s virtue theory is not only the reality of difficulty, but also the resourcefulness needed to overcome it, that is, the individual and social capacities to cope with difficulty, to resist destruction under hardship, and to construct something positive out of an otherwise negative situation. Both the virtue of fortitude (with its associated virtues of initiative and endurance) and resilience (as concept, phenomenon, and practice) relate to difficulty. Both fortitude and resilience contribute to a fundamentally positive perspective that counters an excessive focus on brokenness, vice, and<br>

  10.  Bishops Behaving Badly: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284zwd">Re-Reading Gregory of Nazianzus</a><br>
  Author(s) Limberis Vasiliki<br>
  Abstract: Scholars have generally overlooked the interpersonal exchanges in the lives of Gregory of Nazianzus and Gregory of Nyssa, since they are tangential to the study of theological anthropology and the Trinity. Such are the “Helladius affairs,” the rousing stories of Bishop Helladius’ contentious behavior against Gregory of Nazianzus and Gregory of Nyssa.¹ These mundane events not only give valuable biographical information, they also isolate moments in their individual lives within the context of their social situations as powerful bishops. In the fourth century a bishop’s social status was fraught with the Christian prescriptions of humility, poverty, and retreat from the<br>

  Abstract: The campaign for effective justice had its own elaborate imagery, much of which can be traced to the sixteenth century. At midcentury, justice and 
                  buon governo confronted an infinite variety of situations and unforeseen problems. Good rule had to compromise with forces it would much rather have tamed or squelched outright. It had to make do with “ministers” who fell far short of treatises’ ideals and rules Trent set. Nevertheless, in this very era, in Rome, justice and buon governo were presented, and extolled, in a new way, in a variety of idioms—in ceremonies and painted picture cycles, and<br>

  Abstract: Written between 1935 and 1942,

The sources of these poems, the significance of the various locations in which they are situated, and the personal experiences that Eliot associated with them are evoked through patterns of imagery and repetition that provide continuity to what were initially published as separate poems.¹ Briefly, the first of the quartets, “Burnt Norton,” is named after the manor house near Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, which was visited by Eliot and his American friend, Emily Hale,² in<br>

  Abstract: Theories of agency discuss the possible ways of designing complex systems that display purposeful activity. Theories of agency have been researched in several disciplines (Brooks, 1986; Agre and Chapman, 1987; Suchman, 1987; Hendriks-Jansen, 1996; Johnston and Brennan, 1996; Agre and Horswill, 1997; Clancey, 1997), where two main positions are found – which we will call the ʹdeliberativeʹ and the ʹsituationalʹ theories of agency. The two theories have quite different modes of representation and action selection.

  Author(s): Paquin Jacques<br>
  Abstract: Devant l'abondante production qui marque la poésie québécoise, acadienne et franco-ontarienne depuis 1970, de quels repères dispose-t-on pour explorer ce vaste continent?
      Nouveaux territoires de la poésie francophone au Canada 1970-2000tente de répondre à certaines interrogations : Quelle place occupent les auteurs phares? Quels sont les grands thèmes de la poésie contemporaine? Comment reconnaître les tendances les plus fortes? Quelle est la situation de l'édition? À quoi servent les anthologies? L'ouvrage jette un éclairage nouveau sur des oeuvres devenues des classiques et met en évidence l'émergence d'une nouvelle génération de poètes. Les avatars rimbaldiens, l'intimisme, le féminisme, l'urbanité et la figure de l'artiste comptent au nombre des aspects les plus frappants de ces nouveaux enjeux poétiques. Cet ouvrage met en lumière les chassés-croisés entre les constantes et les ruptures qui polarisent l'histoire de la poésie francophone contemporaine : d'Anne Hébert et Gaston Miron à Marie Uguay, en passant par Patrice Desbiens, Herménégilde Chiasson, et bien d'autres. Une cartographie inédite de la poésie francophone du Canada au tournant du XXIe siècle.<br>

  Author(s) Usher Peter J.<br>
  Abstract: In a world where even nation–states have declining power and authority in the face of global markets, international trade agreements, and harmonised laws and regulations, what does sovereignty mean at the subnational level? And what is the connection between common property and sovereignty at the subnational level? What challenges and opportunities confront minority indigenous populations in these contemporary circumstances? The situation of aboriginal peoples in Canada provides distinctive perspectives on these questions. In our country, new understandings are being reached, new arrangements forged and implemented, but also, new difficulties and challenges are emerging.<br>

  Book Title: Building a Better Bridge-Muslims, Christians, and the Common Good<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Ipgrave Michael<br>
  Abstract: Building a Better Bridgeis a record of the fourth "Building Bridges" seminar held in Sarajevo in 2005 as part of an annual symposium on Muslim-Christian relations cosponsored by Georgetown University and the Archbishop of Canterbury. This volume presents the texts of the public lectures with regional presentations on issues of citizenship, religious believing and belonging, and the relationship between government and religion-both from the immediate situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and from three contexts further afield: Britain, Malaysia, and West Africa. Both Christian and Muslim scholars propose key questions to be faced in addressing the issue of the common good. How do we approach the civic sphere as believers in particular faiths and as citizens of mixed societies? What makes us who we are, and how do our religious and secular allegiances relate to one another? How do we accommodate our commitment to religious values with acknowledgment of human disagreement, and how can this be expressed in models of governance and justice? How are we, mandated by scriptures to be caretakers, to respond to the current ecological and economic disorder of our world? Michael Ipgrave and his contributors do not claim to provide definitive answers to these questions, but rather they further a necessary dialogue and show that, while Christian and Islamic understandings of God may differ sharply and perhaps irreducibly, the acknowledgment of one another as people of faith is the surest ground on which to build trust, friendship, and cooperation.<br>

  Abstract: Where

Theologians today generally accept the claim that Thomas has no “ecclesiology” as we would understand that term, by which I mean that he never takes up the Church as a distinct locus for comprehensive theological discussion.¹ Did the famously absent-minded saint simply misplace it? One searches the Summa theologiae in vain for a treatise de ecclesiae.² The situation seems even less promising in his Commentary on the Gospel of St. John, where the commentary genre itself does not tend to the systematic treatment of anything. Yet this does not mean that Thomas’s commentary<br>

  Abstract: Typically, in 
                     Insight Lonergan credits progress to human intelligence as driven by the “detached and disinterested desire to know.” Surprisingly, however, he sometimes in this same work credits liberty. Rather than view this as an irreconcilable inconsistency, I would argue that liberty and intelligence are complementary. They work hand in hand. And both are necessary for progress.¹ Good ideas can improve the situation, but there must be liberty in the community if the ideas are to be reflected on, communicated, tested, implemented, allowed to change the social situation, and eventually to be reevaluated and corrected by new ideas.<br>

  Abstract: When students enter college, it soon becomes apparent that some of them are already comfortable with academic discourse, while other students seem quite unfamiliar with academic discourse and resistant to learning it.

  V  Heidegger: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bfxq">Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Abstract: In the nineteenth century, hermeneutic reflection remained peripheral in certain respects (especially to philosophy). Though their founding intuitions were broadly based, the classic figures in hermeneutics who were representative of the century—Böckh, Schleiermacher, Droysen, and Dilthey—did not manage to develop a unified conception of hermeneutics or publish it in systematic form. Indicative of this state of affairs is that their hermeneutic inquiries had to be compiled from posthumous writings edited by their students and published mostly in the form of overviews and fragments. This situation slowly begins to change with Heidegger (1889–1976), who was demonstrably influenced early<br>

A remarkably effective premier, Antoine Pinay, was beginning to put the Fourth Republic into economic order, and a feeling of confidence was apparent: “The French are once again happy, entirely different than two years ago.”¹ The city and its people relieved Arendt of much of the dark foreboding about the

  Abstract: Much has been made of the culture-bound nature of certain psychological healing practices, on the grounds that they are not easily transferable to another cultural setting, not easily understood by healers in another culture, and not easily compared with its healing practices. The same problems have also been raised in the “cross-cultural” situation of various subcultures within the same larger society; each subculture’s healing practices may well differ in that they cohere around alternative ethnic customs, religious beliefs, or medical views. Similar difficulties can easily arise if one compares psychological healing practices over time. Cultural influences have admittedly shaped practices<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bqqd">Rhetorical Invention and Religious Inquiry</a><br>

  Abstract: The rhetorical modes of “negative” or “apophatic” theology — and of its twin, “mystical” theology — have since the 1970s attracted serious inquiry and extended discussion not only among theologians but also among literary theorists, and philosophers, who tend to share three interconnected concerns: the human subject’s finitude, its situation in language, and its desire. Among post-Heideggerian thinkers in particular, the fascination with textual and discursive traditions deriving from the negative theology of Pseudo-Dionysius (flourished ca. 500) almost always involves a fascination as well with the radically finite, desiring subject of language—to the point that one might suspect contemporary interest in<br>

  Book Title: Metaphysics in Ordinary Language-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosen Stanley<br>
  Abstract: In this rich collection of philosophical writings, Stanley Rosen addresses a wide range of topics-from eros, poetry, and freedom to problems like negation and the epistemological status of sense perception. Though diverse in subject, Rosen's essays share two unifying principles: there can be no legitimate separation of textual hermeneutics from philosophical analysis, and philosophical investigation must be oriented in terms of everyday language and experience, although it cannot simply remain within these confines. Ordinary experience provides a minimal criterion for the assessment of extraordinary discourses, Rosen argues, and without such a criterion we would have no basis for evaluating conflicting discourses: philosophy would give way to poetry.Philosophical problems are not so deeply embedded in a specific historical context that they cannot be restated in terms as valid for us today as they were for those who formulated them, the author maintains. Rosen shows that the history of philosophy-a story of conflicting interpretations of human life and the structure of intelligibility-is a story that comes to life only when it is rethought in terms of the philosophical problems of our own personal and historical situation.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bvwm">Does Psychoanalysis Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: Every psychoanalyst of some clinical experience is aware of apparently unpromising analytic situations that turned out well and of analyses that began favorably but ended badly. Often, with benefit of hindsight, it is possible to identify sources of strength or weakness that were not recognized at the outset. Examples of such situations include barely mentioned but psychologically lifesaving relationships in the patient’s early childhood, or disturbances of thinking not manifest in the initial consultation. The analyst’s particular unresolved conflicts that lead to countertransference interferences may impede the ability to work with otherwise promising patients. Sometimes the reasons for unexpected outcomes<br>

  Abstract: One classical approach to the study of pathology is to examine a series of patients who are similar in diagnosis, age, treatment approach, or other significant features of their situation in the hope of discovering commonalities among the cases. Although there have been numerous reports of very small numbers of similar cases, in only a few instances have analysts looked at larger numbers of patients in this fashion.

In each instance we describe the conceptual basis of the method, how it is used, its validity and reliability, its advantages and drawbacks, and situations where it has found application.

  Abstract: Effective and appropriate data analytic methods have been enormously powerful tools in moving forward many disciplines that deal with complex and difficult to manipulate situations. Typically in such situations it is hard to differentiate specific meaningful effects from other sources of variation in observations (Tanur et al., 1985). Detecting effects within a morass of data, determining most likely values for variables and like variation in those values, studying the likelihood that an apparent effect really depends upon a particular intervention, and estimating the magnitude of the effect are all jobs that have been remarkably well performed statistically. Unfortunately, the very<br>

  Abstract: All that we have considered in this volume now brings us to our penultimate point—namely, that single-case methods are the most promising line of approach to exploring the efficacy of psychoanalysis. Case studies differ from case reports in that they employ rigorous and systematic means of collecting, analyzing, and reporting data, with the goal of making the epistemological status of the investigation clear. Case studies explore a single situation in depth and attempt to reach valid conclusions on the basis of such exploration. Because this method is most commonly used to describe complex phenomena, and because many case studies<br>

  Book Title: The Future of the Biblical Past-envisioning biblical studies on a global key<br>
  Publisher: Society of Biblical Literature<br>
  Author(s): Segovia Fernando F.<br>
  Abstract: What does global biblical studies look like in the early decades of the twenty-first century, and what new directions may be discerned? Profound shifts have taken place over the last few decades as voices from the majority of the globe have begun and continue to reshape and relativize biblical studies. With contributors from Africa, Asia, the Pacific, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, and North America, this volume is a truly global work, offering surveys and assessments of the current situation and suggestions for the future of biblical criticism in all corners of the world. The contributors are Yong-Sung Ahn, George Aichele, Pablo R. Andiñach, Roland Boer, Fiona Black, Philip Chia, Nancy Cardoso Pereira, Jione Havea, Israel Kamudzandu, Milena Kirova, Tat-siong Benny Liew, Monica Melancthon, Judith McKinlay, Sarojini Nadar, Jorge Pixley, Jeremy Punt, Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza, Fernando F.

  Author(s) Kirova Milena<br>
  Abstract: Every narrative addressing the state of biblical studies in Bulgaria should begin with an odd and traumatic situation in the distant past of the country. Christianity was not at all a popular religion until the mid-ninth century. Each of the two tribes comprising the Bulgarian state, the local Slavs and the old Bulgarians (or Protobulgarians), who had migrated from Asia, had their established pantheon and rituals. In contrast to the aristocratic circles in both tribes, various pagan gods coexisted quite peacefully in the lives of the common people. The situation in question took place in the year 865 c.e.<br>

  Abstract: In the late nineteenth century, the fate of the Jews of Algeria, inscribed within the vast history of Mediterranean Judaism, hinged on the relations between Jews and Muslims during the colonial period of the Maghreb, a situation that had consequences in the following century. When the first French soldiers landed in the bay of Sidi Ferruch, the Jews of Algeria constituted an organized “nation,” or
                  millet, of the Ottoman administration. In 1830 the Jewish community of Algeria was 25,000 strong, and most of its members were poor. The reactions of the Jews to colonial development varied a great deal by<br>

  Abstract: In 1923, the year Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s population, Republic of Turkey was created, there were 78,000 members of the Jewish community in Turkey. By the 2000s, the figure had fallen to 17,000. That demographic decline, which even now continues at a slower pace, stands in contrast to the rather prosperous situation of the Jewish population, whose institutions have experienced a clear revival since the late 1990s. That paradox is an expression of the complex relations between the Turkish nation and its Jewish community, and it demonstrates equally complex connections between history and memory. Despite the drop in its population, the<br>

  Abstract: Contemporary Arab writers consider the Arab-Israeli conflict a major subject, but the Jewish figure in modern Arabic literature seems relatively limited. It is true that only an exhaustive analysis of that literature would be able to reveal all the elements of that figure, but such an approach is far beyond the means of a lone researcher. Nevertheless, the examination of a large body of work and a number of studies on the subject allow us to observe that the evolution of the Jewish figure in modern Arabic literature is closely linked to developments in the geopolitical situation in the Near<br>

To the geographical variety of the tales, which take the reader on voyages from India to Italy, Africa to Iraq, and Persia to the Sunda Islands, must be added the cultural diversity of the medieval Muslim world, a fundamentally multiethnic world, as reflected in the tales. Contrary to the situation in Christian lands, in which the Jews represented the only religious minority in uniformly Christianized regions, the Jews of Islam were one religious minority among others.

  Abstract: The question of gender and women’s roles in the Arab Muslim and Jewish worlds is linked primarily to the multiplicity of social, economic, political, and geographical situations in which they have lived and continue to live in the contemporary period. Given the extreme diversity of groups and situations, we have chosen to focus our comparison on the collective and political formulations of religion inherent in gender issues and, in turn, in women’s activism. Women’s roles and the particular way they have been defined by religious affiliation, whether Muslim or Jewish, are bound to contexts that have dictated specific possibilities for<br>

  Abstract: Emigration was an economic strategy for Cape Verdeans from as early as the eighteenth century. It has become an important element of Cape Verdean social identity or, as this identity also has been called, Cape Verdeanness. In a situation where there are more Cape Verdean emigrants and their descendants outside Cape Verde than living within the archipelago itself,¹ traditional theories of migration and/or national identity placing more importance on origin than on all other features in the process of identity construction seem misplaced.<br>

This situation would appear all the more peculiar if the humanities are charged, as many argue, with challenging normative assumptions and investigating historically marginalized voices. Yet to a large extent children and youth do in fact occupy the periphery in contemporary humanities scholarship, arguably more so than any other social group. The oddness of this situation is compounded by the fact that<br>

  Abstract: In the ceaseless interplay of disorder and order in our daily lives, it is possible (and important) to imagine that there are certain situations where this unstable interaction can be held for a moment in steady state. One such suspended moment is the poem, which freeze-frames the interplay as language so that we can contemplate it, feel it, and concentrate on it. Robert Frost once characterized poetry as “a momentary stay against confusion,” and his phrase articulates with eloquent simplicity a poem’s power to lift moments of clarified drama out of the ceaseless, discombobulating flow of experience and, by doing<br>

As with his other studies, however, he is careful to ground issues of identity in the distinctive historical and cultural experience of specific groups and recognize that differences often emerge.<br>

  Abstract: The baseline center-ing function and operations of “scriptures” notwithstanding, it is important to acknowledge, as have the essayists in this section, that “scriptures” are used for different purposes in different situations and settings in ongoing and in special terms. The different uses in the different settings and situations may sometimes represent resistance to and undermining of the center-ing force; they may also simply reflect in different ways the reality and power of the center. These differences are the stuff of ongoing social-cultural dynamics—differentiation, conflict, negotiation, formation, deformation, reformation.¹<br>

These are matters having to do not with the one-time explosive moment in which the originary impulse behind the invention of scriptures is revealed. No, what has been addressed in the foregoing essays are some of the ongoing historical and new and widely varied social-psychological needs and power dynamics and issues that focus on peoples’ situations.<br>

  Book Title: Varieties of World Making-Beyond Globalization<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): WAGNER PETER<br>
  Abstract: Globalization has been the topic of heated debate in recent years, with one side asserting that it will produce a better standard of living for people around the world, and a fierce opposition arguing that it will ultimately lead to greater poverty and the destruction of unique human cultures. Varieties of World Making tackles the issue from a different angle, proposing that the contemporary global network of business, politics and culture be viewed from the inter-disciplinary perspective of ‘world making’. Drawn from the ranks of sociology, law, international relations, political philosophy and history, the distinguished contributors cut through polarized rhetoric to examine the current global situation. Their proposed diagnoses draw upon thoughtful analyses of various political dilemmas whose ripple effects are felt around the world, such as the volatile relationship between Islam and Europe, or the legal foundations for a true international order absent in the shadows of imperialism. Varieties of World Making will be an essential resource for all those grappling with the complex consequences of globalization for the future.<br>

  The Invention of Language in the Poetry of Job from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjz47">Interested Readers</a><br>
  Author(s) Greenstein Edward L.<br>
  Abstract: The book of Job, particularly its poetic core, appears to contain more unique words and linguistic usages than any comparable work from the ancient Near East. The distinctive language of Job has been attributed to a number of literary factors. For one thing, the characters and events are set in a much earlier, legendary period—the time of the patriarchs.¹ Not only does Job enjoy a lifestyle that is reminiscent of the rural, sheep-and-goat-herding Hebrew patriarchs, but the description of Job and his situation in the narrative framework of the book features language and allusions to the stories of Genesis.²<br>

  Abstract: Pontigny-en-Amérique provided a space for French refugees to gather and continue their conversation about art, ideas, and politics in the dark time of World War II. Other refugees, particularly those lucky enough to escape from Nazi Germany, were equally eager to create spaces for exchanging ideas and forging resistance, even as they found themselves in constant flight. The dark times in Europe between 1933 and 1942 are the topic of Bertolt Brecht’s conversational play about the situation of two German refugees in Scandinavian exile.¹ Brecht’s play offers both a complementary account of similar “conversations in exile” as well as some<br>

  Abstract: In March 1929, when Martin Heidegger and Ernst Cassirer met to debate at academic conferences held in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos, the situation had the potential for a dramatic confrontation.¹ Here were two philosophers with reputedly antithetical views, separated by a generation gap (Cassirer was fifteen years older), one came from a modest background in provincial Germany (and intentionally stayed away from the city) while the other stemmed from a wealthy family whose name was synonymous with modernism in the arts and the metropolis of Berlin, where he had lived so long.² Eyewitnesses called attention to the fact<br>

  Author(s) Strauven Wanda<br>
  Abstract: For a long time, talking to oneself on the street or in any other public place was considered abnormal, deviant from the expected social norm. Singing on your own was okay, but talking on your own, without having any interlocutor, was simply weird. When taken unawares by a fellow citizen in such an odd situation, a possible and often-spontaneous reaction (which I have indeed caught myself in several times) was to quickly shift from talking to singing, as if to imply: don’t worry, I was not talking to myself, I was just singing.

  CHAPTER ONE  Time, Causes, and Reasons in Action from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wpr8v">The Economics of Creativity</a><br>
  Abstract: Action analysis in both sociology and economics faces a persistent tension. To understand how individuals differ in their behavior, we may need to define each individual’s characteristics, preferences, and resources at the onset of the course of action. This essentially leads to a long-term, propelling view of the causal determination of individual action. However, as action unfolds sequentially, within an environment of interactions, people learn from each other and about themselves in ways that cannot be fully anticipated. Can we, simultaneously, fully define the identities of social actors and the situations that bring those actors together? My view is that<br>

  Abstract: During his lifetime and especially after his death, Husserl’s ideas have had an enormous influence on twentieth-century thought. Husserl may very well have been the most influential philosopher of the century. Toward the end of his life he was often discouraged. In addition to the almost unbearable political situation in which he had come to find himself, there was the full realization that there really was nobody willing and able to continue the work he had started. He had hoped that Heidegger would have been this person; yet Heidegger preferred to go his own way. In Husserl’s view, the task<br>

  Reflections on Buddhism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqmgc">Great Fool</a><br>
  Abstract: Ryōkan was critical of the Buddhist temple establishment of his day, regarding it as degraded. Yet, as the following works reveal, he remained committed to Buddhism itself and to the monk’s vocation. “Invitation to the Way” (Tōgō Toyoharu,
                  Ryōkan zenshū1, no. 1) is a summary of the history of Buddhism, and Zen in particular, in which Ryōkan assesses the current situation of Buddhism in Japan. “The Priesthood” (Zenshū1, no. 2) presents Ryōkan’s criticism of the contemporary Buddhist clergy. “On Begging One’s Food” (Zenshū1, no. 102) explains Ryōkan’s views on the importance of the monk’s begging practice.

  Abstract: Postcommunist development followed the demise of monopoly structural control on the part of the communist-statist class over the state and, through it, over the economy and all other sectors. Until the nature of the new social orders crystallizes sufficiently, we have to designate as “postcommunism” a “transition period” in which, along with the supposed break, considerable continuity with the previous situation will persist, particularly as regards cadres and the economy.<br>

Place making, they argued, was an art of placing and timing. Coherence and stability arise in this situation because public spaces are constitutionally discursive, sites incubating a primary sociality characterized by a desire to meet. The relationship of the movement form (De Quincey’s “undistinguishable blot”) to design is the same one occupied by rhythmic geography in the field of cartography. Notating what<br>

  Abstract: The situation of the Bali Aga within changing Balinese representations of their society is part of a contested and emergent knowledge system, drawing on a range of culturally specific metaphors of time and movement and, more recently, on a more “global” and Western-influenced vocabulary of modernity. But how do these local representational models compare and relate to Western portrayals of the Bali Aga, as reflected in an abundant and changing anthropological literature on Balinese society?<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapter ended with the problem of recognition, which lies at the core of the “politics of identity.” With authority internalized as individual right, mutual recognition becomes an elusive goal as, in de Tocqueville’s words, “each man is narrowly shut in himself and from that basis makes the pretense to judge the world.”¹ With recognition lost, the self comes increasingly to rest solely on the calculus and negotiation of power. Wills are, to return to the nomenclature of our opening chapter, coerced from without, rather than subjugated from within. The result is a situation fraught with paradox: the very<br>

  Abstract: The intellectual relationship of Coleridge and Wordsworth has scarcely any cultural counterpart. It is almost impossible to bring to mind any other two figures, so important each in his own right, but also so dependent the one upon the other during his richest intellectual years. The interchange between Goethe and Schiller occurred after each had established his own reputation and his own mode. That between Socrates and Plato was the relationship of master to pupil, while that between Plato and Aristotle, likewise a master-pupil situation, involved fundamental disagreements. The relationship of Beaumont and Fletcher was perhaps as close as that<br>

After 1909 and 1959, this is the third Darwinian centenary year. On the situation in 1909 we have a valuable testimony, the book published by the Cambridge University Press “at the suggestion of the Cambridge Philosophical Society” with the title

  A Novel Sense from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv117">Eros the Bittersweet</a><br>
  Abstract: Imagination is the core of desire. It acts at the core of metaphor. It is essential to the activity of reading and writing. In the archaic lyric poetry of Greece, these three trajectories intersected, perhaps fortuitously, and imagination transcribed on human desire an outline more beautiful (some people think) than any before or since. We have seen what shape that outline took. Writing about desire, the archaic poets made triangles with their words. Or, to put it less sharply, they represent situations that ought to involve two factors (lover, beloved) in terms of three (lover, beloved and the space between<br>

  Something Paradoxical from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv117">Eros the Bittersweet</a><br>
  Abstract: Critics of the novel find paradox to be “a principle of the genre” and note the frequency with which the romances speak of situations as “new and strange” (
                  kainos) or “against reason” (paralogos), or “unthought of” (adokētos) (Heiserman 1977, 77 and 226 n. 4). Techniques of paradox enrich these stories at all levels of plot, imagery and wordplay. Paradox is especially essential to their emotional texture. This can surprise no one familiar with the lyric precedents of erotic fiction. “I’m crazy! I’m not crazy! I’m in love! I’m not in love!” said Anakreon in the sixth century b.c. (413PMG).<br>

  CONCLUSION from:

  Abstract: As literature and theology were pervaded by historical standards of judgment from the eighteenth century onward, the possibilities of esthetic bonding were seen to narrow. This constriction occurred because human existence itself, and with it human knowledge, came to be seen as creatures of finite historical situations that could not recur. Human actions and feelings, confined to nonrecurring situations, could not teach by example; they were inimitable; they could not be reexperienced or performed by spectators.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvsxn">Between Muslim and Jew</a><br>
  Abstract: The late Shlomo Dov (Fritz) Goitcin (1900–1985) characterized the central relationship of Jews with Muslims in the first centuries of Islam as one of “creative symbiosis.” This usage has been institutionalized in the study of Judeo-Arabica, and shows no immediate signs of being dislodged from its preeminence.¹ The concept
                  symbiosiswas first transposed from biology to the study of Jewish history by German Jewish intellectuals. Its most salient usage was in reference to their own cultural situation.² Alex Bein’s influential study, “Discourse on the Term ‘German-Jewish Symbiosis,’” appeared at that time, as an appendix to his essay (revealingly enough)<br>

  Abstract: In the conclusion of his major treatise,

In the last section, “Ethical Implications,” he tells of how ontology and existential psychoanalysis can inform the individual that he or she is free and the source of all values. However, ontology and existential psychoanalysis cannot give moral prescriptions. All questions relative to freedom and how this freedom will deal with its situation are questions “which refer us to a pure and not an accessory reflection, [and] can find their reply only on the ethical plane.

  Abstract: The
                  Oxford English Dictionarydefines transdisciplinarity as “pertaining to more than one discipline or branch of learning” and “the ultimate degree of coordination in the education/innovation system.” My perception of transdisciplinary is of collaboration and coalition-building among two or more people or groups from different disciplines for a specific purpose; with the aim of advancing knowledge and understanding on a broad front of scholarly activitity; or to solve a particular or general problem that is pertinent to the human situation. A good example is the explosive growth of computer-based technologies and communication systems in the past ten to twenty years.<br>

  Book Title: Living Prism-Itineraries in Comparative Literature<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KUSHNER EVA<br>
  Abstract: She discusses the current state of comparative literary studies and the renewed role of comparative literature in a world that is at once more plural and more globalized, as well as some of the debates now taking place within literary criticism as a whole, including the interchange between comparative literature and cultural studies, the re-envisaging of the Renaissance, the work of Northrop Frye, myth and literature at the end of the twentieth century, modern drama, and post-colonialism. To play an important role in the human sciences, comparative literature had first to free itself of a number of restrictive habits, such as an insufficiently critical literary history. In order to do this, it had to think theoretically, but without yielding to the temptation of letting theory become an end in itself. Kushner demonstrates that, while under strong pressures to be a more rigourous science, comparative literature has realized that in the human sciences the validation of knowledge has to seek its own tests and criteria, becoming increasingly more open to individuality, difference, and life situations and controlling its tendency to universalize. With its emphasis on whether literary history is possible and the problems it raises for literary theory and for comparative literature in particular, The Living Prism adds an important dimension to the ongoing debate about criticism and comparative literary studies.<br>

To play an important role in the human sciences, comparative literature had first to free itself of a number of restrictive habits, such as an insufficiently critical literary history. In order to do this, it had to think theoretically, but without yielding to the temptation of letting theory become an end in itself. Kushner demonstrates that, while under strong pressures to be a more rigourous science, comparative literature has realized that in the human sciences the validation of knowledge has to seek its own tests and criteria, becoming increasingly more open to individuality, difference, and life situations and controlling its tendency to universalize. With its emphasis on whether literary history is possible and the problems it raises for literary theory and for comparative literature in particular, The Living Prism adds an important dimension to the ongoing debate about criticism and comparative literary studies.<br>

  1  Literature in the Global Village from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt801kq">Living Prism</a><br>
  Abstract: From their earliest days comparative literature studies have lived in a paradox: they presuppose universals at work within human literatures and cultures, and seek to bring them to light through the examination of the diversity of these literatures and cultures. In recent decades the entire field of literary studies has undergone a vast movement of self-examination and self-legitimation as part of a wider movement among the human sciences to demonstrate both their scientific worth and their relevance to the situation and psyche of mankind. The question remains, however, whether this search for truth, necessarily underpinned by questioning the process of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt801kq">Living Prism</a><br>
  Abstract: Along with other human sciences, literary studies have been undergoing a phase of intense self–legitimation and self-justification. According to Linda Hutcheon this is part of a postmodern situation in which no values are embodied a
                  prioriin any set of texts or in the study of any set of texts, and literary studies are, therefore, in a situation resembling exactly those of all other methodological and theoretical forms of discourse, trying to find their legitimacy in themselves. If that is so, literary scholars have reason to rejoice in the self-examination and autocriticism that is required of them, the need<br>

  Abstract: Few actions, few pronouncements are as symbolical of their age as Luther’s, confronting the Diet of Worms. In attempting to understand – perhaps merely in concrete and individual terms at the outset – the situation of the early modern self, it is helpful to reflect upon the mental and emotional tension experienced by Luther as he faced that august, severe assembly and uttered his famous words of resistance. Often, one reads abridged versions of his statement. Let us consider it in its entirety:<br>

  Abstract: Perhaps the time will never arrive when our common manner of speaking reflects a disavowal of the voice as the repository of being. And perhaps this refusal signifies, above all else, the unyielding reign of ontology. However, there are reasons to believe this regime is being challenged by discourses that desimplify traditional exigencies and propel thought in the direction of the unthinkable - that disturbing situation in which, or because of which, identity can no longer approach within the confines of a beyond accessible through language. While I cannot cling to any hard and fast conclusions here, it is nonetheless<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt806sg">Democracy with Justice/La juste democratie</a><br>
  Author(s) Conway Thomas<br>
  Abstract: The existence of an increased level of environmental consciousness, of the kind experienced in the 1980s, will create new opportunities for change. However, this situation in itself does not prefigure what the outcomes of that change will look like. Relations with our environment will not be set once and for all or encapsulated in one big “action plan,” but will arise out of much trial and error, changed individual behaviour, political dispute and compromise, and diverse policy initiatives developed over time and unique to specific circumstances.<br>

  Abstract: Is there a subject that is not an ethical subject?¹ To what is any subject subjected if not ethical exigency – by which I mean, not the necessity to choose to follow this or that ethical prescription but, rather, the unrefusable givenness of being-in-the-world-with-other-subjects, the state of affairs summarized negatively in Sartre’s (1962, 91)

  Author(s) O’CONNOR DANIEL<br>
  Abstract: The purpose of this chapter is to analyze morality and ethics in cinema. This analysis is based on the assumption that morality and ethics are discourses of conduct and character. Moral discourse concerns itself with the appropriateness of conduct and action relative to situations. Rather than prevent changes in conduct and character, morality (at least in its cinematic forms) aims to control their flow and regulate their transformation (see Deleuze 1992 on control). The extent and effectiveness of these efforts can be recognized in the regularities of movement they produce. Ethics also involves movement and change, but it is concerned<br>

It thus offers a model for both theological understanding and pastoral action.<br>

  Abstract: Why should we still read Merleau-Ponty? He died, after all, in 1961, at a time when the social and cultural situation and the preoccupations of philosophers were very different from those of the end of the twentieth century and the beginning of a new millennium. Is he not simply a representative of a now outmoded “humanism”, a philosophy of the “subject” and of the phenomenology of consciousness? That he was a humanist in some sense of that rather vague word is undeniable; he was certainly concerned to affirm human values and believed that there are such values to affirm. But<br>

  Book Title: Parables Unplugged-Reading the Lukan Parables in Their Rhetorical Context<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Thurén Lauri<br>
  Abstract: For far too long, Lauri Thurén argues, the parables of Jesus have been read either as allegories encoding Christian theology—including the theological message of one or another Gospel writer—or as tantalizing clues to the authentic voice of Jesus. Thurén proposes instead to read the parables “unplugged” from any assumptions beyond those given in the narrative situation in the text, on the common-sense premise that the very form of the parable works to propose a (sometimes startling) resolution to a particular problem. Thurén applies his method to the parables in Luke with some surprising results involving the Evangelist’s overall narrative purposes and the discrete purposes of individual parables in supporting the authority of Jesus, proclaiming God’s love, exhorting steadfastness, and so on. Eschatological and allegorical readings are equally unlikely, according to Thurén’s results. This study is sure to spark learned discussion among scholars, preachers, and students for years to come.<br>

  Book Title: The Rhetorical Emergence of Culture-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Girke Felix<br>
  Abstract: "Just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric" - the first half of this central statement from the International Rhetoric Culture Project is abundantly evidenced. It is the latter half that this volume explores: how does culture emerge out of rhetorical action, out of seemingly dispersed individual actions and interactions? The contributors do not rely on rhetorical "text" alone but engage the situational, bodily, and often antagonistic character of cultural and communicative practices. The social situation itself is argued to be the fundamental site of cultural creation, as will-driven social processes are shaped by cognitive dispositions and shape them in turn. Drawing on expertise in a variety of disciplines and regions, the contributors critically engage dialogical approaches in their emphasis on how a view from rhetoric changes our perception of people's intersubjective and conjoint creation of culture.<br>

  Abstract: In endeavoring to explain the fact that the Durkheimian religion cluster primarily wrote about primitive societies while other important members of the Durkheimian team, e.g., Maurice Halbwachs and François Simiand, concentrated on Western society, W. Paul Vogt argues that the religion cluster studied primitives in part because they had an attitude of “despair” regarding the modern world. They perceived something troubling about the contemporary situation in the West and attempted to use primitive societies as a means for pointing to what had been lost in the move to modernity (Vogt 1976: 43).

  Book Title: Young Men in Uncertain Times-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Dyck Noel<br>
  Abstract: Anthropology is particularly well suited to explore the contemporary predicament in the coming of age of young men. Its grounded and comparative empiricism provides the opportunity to move beyond statistics, moral panics, or gender stereotypes in order to explore specific aspects of life course transitions, as well as the similar or divergent barriers or opportunities that young men in different parts of the world face. Yet, effective contextualization and comparison cannot be achieved by looking at male youths in isolation. This volume undertakes to contextualize male youths' circumstances and to learn about their lives, perspectives, and actions, and in turn illuminates the larger structures and processes that mediate the experiences entailed in becoming young men. The situation of male youths provides an important vantage point from which to consider broader social transformations and continuities. By paying careful attention to these contexts, we achieve a better understanding of the current influences encountered and acted upon by young people.<br>

However, two points are worth noting with regard to the relationships between anthropology and museums today, when compared with the situation at the end of the nineteenth century. First, museums and material culture were synonymous during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; they gradually followed<br>

  Abstract: Advanced reader on the history of education Developments in educational systems worldwide have largely contributed to the modernization and globalization of present-day society. However, in order to fully understand their impact, educational systems must be interpreted against a background of particular situations and contexts. This textbook brings together more than twenty (collaborative) contributions focusing on the two key themes in the work of Marc Depaepe: educationalization and appropriation. Compiled for his international master classes, these selected writings provide not only a thorough introduction to the history of modern educational systems, but also a twenty-five year overview of the work of a well-known pioneer in the field of history of education. Covering the modernization of schooling in Western history, the characteristics and origins of educationalization, the colonial experience in education and the process of appropriation, Between Educationalization and Appropriation will be of great interest to a larger audience of scholars in the social sciences.<br>

On one hand, much of the vocabulary and sentence construction between these two sets of writings are similar, while differences also abound. They certainly represent the same sector of the early Christian movement, but were they written around the same time, by the same person, to the same audience, or might there be a multiplicity of answers to each of these questions?

Were their adversaries internal or external to the Jesus movement (or both)? How do these texts address these issues with implications for later generations? These questions revolve around the character of the church-situation as reflected in the Johannine Epistles, and their relation to issues reflected in the Johannine Gospel, of course, are extremely relevant. Then again, what if constructions of larger overall theories—for all their glory and value—actually distort one’s understanding of the Johannine<br>

In addition to an adequate understanding of their composition and context helping the reader get the content right, however, misconstruing such features may impede one’s adequate understanding of their message, so a good deal of modesty is required in any approach to the Johannine Epistles, as one must remind oneself that evidence can sometimes be seen as pointing in more than one direction.<br>

As Fernando Segovia has stated, “The concept of Latin(o/a)ness … is neither self-evident nor determinate—self-contained and unchanging; readily accessible to and intelligible by all; bearing the same force throughout, regardless of historical situation or social-cultural formation. It is rather a construct” (2009, 199). Segovia<br>

  Socialism is utopia from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/j.ctt1gxxrms">The Vigil of Quebec</a><br>
  Abstract: That socialism is Utopia is quite obvious. It is so for very realistic reasons -because it does not want to abandon the collective future to the interplay of blind forces or interests; because there is no other way in which a society can gain some little ascendancy over its situation than by projecting itself into a full and solid image of its future. Thus political choices are not dependent only on disparate sets of circumstances and surface compromises, but also find coherence and perspective in more clearly fixed alternatives.<br>

  Author(s) Takahashi Tess<br>
  Abstract: Since the mid-1990s, artists have explored the status of documentary reference and the material trace in the gallery with increasing frequency. In part, this line of investigation stems from a situation in which the power of documentary images has been met with a widespread cultural uncertainty about their trustworthiness. As Hito Steyerl and Maria Lind write: ‘The double bind is strong: on the one hand documentary images are more powerful than ever. On the other hand, we have less and less trust in documentary representations’ (2008: 1). In response to this uncertainty, artists and filmmakers alike have turned increasingly to<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b1vg">The Edinburgh Critical History of Nineteenth-Century Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Welchman Alistair<br>
  Abstract: ‘Romanticism’ is one of the more hotly contested terms in the history of ideas. There is a singular lack of consensus as to its meaning, unity and historical extension and many attempts to fix the category of Romanticism very quickly become blurry. In his
                  Conversations with Eckermann, Goethe says that the concept of Romanticism ‘is now spread over the whole world and occasions so many quarrels and divisions’ (Goethe [1836] 1984: 297) and this situation has not rectified itself in the 180 years since then. But the term was poorly defined from the start. Friedrich Schlegel, frequently claimed as the<br>

  Abstract: In Chapter 2 we discussed Jaspers’ account of the notion of death and the distinction between death as an objective fact and death that gives rise to a boundary situation. We noted that one’s Dasein perishes at death. 
                     Existenz, one’s true self, however, ‘knows no death’, that is to say, it is deathless.¹ We also noted that the ‘deathlessness’ of Existenz within the Jaspersian framework does not imply immortality in the traditional sense of the term. In other words, there is no continued existence for Existenz after death.<br>

It would be a caricature to represent the dominant paradigm in contemporary Anglo-American philosophy of mind as holding of all our psychological states, ‘It’s only chemicals.’ Yet this paradigm – functionalism – does hold that each of them is, in fact, a physiological state, but one individuated in terms of its function in mediating between sensory inputs<br>

These rich and complex exchanges, in a situation of acute political crisis, were the nexus out of which came some of the major works of Whig history of the first half of the nineteenth century, bedevilled by the unfinished business of 1688.¹ The Revolution debate was precisely – and this has been underplayed in the secondary literature – a dispute about history.

To begin, it examines the well-known claim that men and women tend to use interactional styles based on power and solidarity respectively. The section then goes on to maintain that, in order to explore patterns of male dominance effectively, we need to go beyond this polarised view and attend to discourses and practices in specific situations, institutions and genres which may establish men in positions from which they can dominate women.

  Abstract: Intimate engagement between friends provides a unique context for the development of relations with others and for understanding of the self. The tension between our sense of connection with a friend and our recognition of our separateness from the friend within a relationship of choice is likely to present us with dilemmas. The liking, care and concern we have for a friend, which are expressive of our connection, must be balanced by a concern for the self as a separate individual, especially in situations in which these concerns come into conflict. Kant notes in his discussion of friendship that ‘if<br>

It is good, certainly, when friends are loyal, lovers faithful, their tears authentic, vows earnest, stories trustworthy. It is generally in our interest to know what’s up and what really happened. Not always, of course, or only: fiction and flattery, artifice and illusion, duplicity and pipe-dreams are also important, sometimes necessary, perhaps even, in their various ways, truthful, indeed sometimes supremely so – or so the poets have told us, though it’s not clear they’re to be trusted<br>

This tendency is evident, for example, in the cases of journalists seeking to explain events and situations to uninitiated recipients, intellectuals in the social sciences trying to identify grand theories that can make sense of a multiplicity of diverse phenomena, and politicians wanting to identify solutions to problems and events so that they will harness electoral support.

  Abstract: The extraordinary expansion of contemporary and historical intelligence studies since the mid-1970s has been both reflected and stimulated by developments in government policy, as well as academic initiative.² On the government side – and we are confining ourselves here to the situation within the United Kingdom – there are two main aspects to this. First, there is the commissioning and writing of ‘Official Histories’; and, second, the release of documents.

  Abstract: The previous chapters pinpointed a new form of the ancient relationship between ‘slavery’ and ‘alienation’ emerging at the origins of psychoanalysis in the form of the relationship between drug-addiction and sexuality. The first chapter also showed how this emergence was coterminous with Freud’s forced transition from scientific experimentation to linguistic interlocution; that is, it entailed Freud’s departure from a strictly scientific field and directed him into situations that, while never abandoning a guiding ideal of science, required supplementation by the extra-scientific armature derived from a form of attentiveness to ‘literature’. In terms of the ‘therapy’ offered by psychoanalysis, this required<br>

  Abstract: Joseph Conrad’s reputation predominantly rests on his proto-modernist exploration of the individual male consciousness. Throughout his fiction, protagonists such as Charlie Marlow, Lord Jim, Razumov and Axel Heyst are preoccupied with (frequently failed) quests for identity, isolated figures grappling with a troubled psychology, trying to make sense of their situation in a hostile or unwelcoming community. In this context, parties (other than political ones) do not immediately spring to mind as familiar locations or sources for Conrad’s narratives, and when they do occur they are not always markers of social harmony in his work.¹ His emphasis on the relationship between<br>

  Abstract: Writing in spring 1947, Storm Jameson – the prolific Yorkshire-born novelist and former president of the English centre of International PEN – used the occasion of an essay on the ‘situation’ of contemporary fiction to glance back two years and reflect on her visit to an indelibly-scarred northern Europe. From an aerial vantage point, Jameson adopts, at least initially and fleetingly, a disinterested and reportorial perspective. Then the standpoint shifts, and with it the diction and gesture of Jameson’s treatment of destruction. Dropping the objective pretence of reportage, she progresses into a more personalised and noticeably elegiac register of remembrance:<br>

  Abstract: Street-level decision making is complexly moral and contingent rather than narrowly rule bound and fixed. A fundamental dilemma—perhaps the defining characteristic—of street-level work is that the needs of individual citizen-clients exist in tension with the demands and limits of rules. This does not mean that rules do not permeate all aspects of street-level work (they do) or that most street-level actions are not consistent with law and policy (they are). The most common situation may be that the rules effectively fit the complexity of workers’ judgments about citizen-clients. When the rules and standard procedures fit the situation, street-level<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctt32bck0">Commemorating and Forgetting</a><br>
  Abstract: The end of apartheid and the transition to parliamentary democracy produced a paradoxical situation. With the collapse of white minority rule and the dismantling of apartheid, citizens of the “new South Africa” have been called upon to look two ways in time: back to the racially divided past to confront painful memories born of discrimination and oppression, and forward to the future—with its attendant risks, uncertainties, and contingent possibilities. Looking backward, they hold onto the past by remembering and commemorating. Looking forward, they envision a radiant future unencumbered and unburdened by the sordid apartheid past. The central conundrum that<br>

  Borderline from:

  Abstract: To stage a dialogue between northern and southern experiences of meeting is to assume a productively dialectical relationship. It is already to move beyond the nostalgia inherent in most anthropological descriptions and the urgent functionalism of sociological ideas of the crowd. It relocates both in a time and space that is not reducible to the idealized level playing field of contemporary, scientific modernity (where place-based, situational knowledge is always at a loss). It retains instead a topography of hills and vales, of crisscrossing tracks, and within the network of traces of passage lozenges of ground as yet unvisited. It is<br>

  Abstract: Waiting for you, I flick through the poems of Nazim Hikmet—it’s the kind of casual literary encounter railway station bookshops specialize in—and come across the lines “statues of whoever invented airplanes / should grace the hotel rooms of all returns.”¹ Possibly it’s because the marble-floored lobbies behind me and the miscellaneous jigsaw of flatnesses in front of me could be the ruin of runways (if you extracted the street furniture and the horizon-hugging office blocks), but his strange thought captures my situation.

  All Change from:

  Abstract: So much for ground rules, but the question is: who are the players, the determinedly indeterminate multitude of singularities that peoples this newly animated environment? To answer this it is necessary to insist on the difference of the meeting place investigated as a concrete situation and the general discourse on improved sociability associated with postcolonial discussions of intercultural or transcultural reconciliation. The meeting place is in the west presided over by Eros in the guise of the Public Worker or Demiurge, a name that suggests turbulent energy.

  Abstract: The problem with Brownian motion, at least as a model of human sociability, is that it does not lead anywhere. The incessant agitation of the particles succeeds in keeping them out of one another’s path. There is much ado, but it is much ado about nothing. Although such physical energy may be cognate with the dynamical nature of, say, a colloid suspension, it proves limited in the human situation. After a while a certain fatigue sets in if the meandering leads to no change of state. I suppose this is why in sports they introduce goals, touchdowns, and points; these<br>

  Abstract: I can imagine that the defense of walls offered in the last section will be offensive to some. They will think of the wall Israel uses to confine the Palestinians or of any administrative border that punishes difference. However, the object was not to defend their instrumentalization, their colonization in the interests of power. It was to tackle the problem of containment in relation to conceptualizing the meeting place. How can the meeting place be both a situation in the here and now and a potential encounter anywhere? How can it combine the attributes of crossroads, vanishing point, and elevation?<br>

  Abstract: Giants and pygmies are ambiguously monstrous: strange “here” but normal “there,” where their species is at home, whether Scythia, Africa, Brazil, Lilliput, or Brobdingnag.

  Author(s) Pommier Gérard<br>
  Abstract: Initially it may seem strange to suggest that dreams contain ethical standards, as they often stage violence, murder, and perverse situations. To move beyond this apparent contradiction it is necessary to make the distinction between ethics and morals. Samurai warriors, gangsters, and politicians all possess ethical ideals dictating their codes of conduct. Both the gangster and the Samurai have codes of conduct based on the ethical standards of the groups with which these figures are affiliated.

The power of the interview as a documentary technique has primarily to do with the temporal continuity between the event and its cinematic representation embodied in the interview subject’s voice.

  Abstract: Marco Denevi is one of Argentina’s most influential and important prose writers. One of the most distinctive features of his writing is the creation of a situation in which a presumed truth has been concealed with a mask. Consequently, in Denevi’s work there always seems to be an uneasy tension, a nagging suspicion that something is definitely not what it appears to be. As the reader proceeds through the narration, the numerous false facades that hide the unexpected and sometimes shocking truth lying underneath are slowly chipped away. Denevi’s numerous

  Abstract: Although underestimated by defense experts, the promotion of dialogue and face-to-face encounters is by no means a radical idea. Most state actors entangled in the Korean security situation display a preference for the so-called soft landing scenario, which foresees an incremental rapprochement between North and South. All but the most radical critics of engagement advocate policies that are geared toward avoiding either a direct military conflict with or a sudden collapse of North Korea. Since the late 1990s the South Korean government has been particularly active in promoting such a step-by-step approach toward normalizing political interactions on the peninsula. While<br>

  Abstract: IN THE major capitalist countries, public expenditures (by the State and the public sector) approach or surpass half of the gross national income. The increasing rate of growth of public spending with respect to the growth of national income is an irreversible trend. “Yet despite this, there have been only isolated studies by Marxists which systematically examine the causes and consequences of this unprecedented growth” (Ian Gough, “State Expenditure in Advanced Capitalism,” p. 53).

  Abstract: Between the formation/cognition of narrative discourse and the construction of narrative significance, there is still one important mediation to consider: that of genre as technê and sociohistorical constraint. In fact, if we had not taken genre into account, implicitly at least, every time we studied individual examples of acts of narrative communication and their texts, we would have made an intolerable qualitative leap from the level of generality at which our method of analysis was situated to particular concrete situations. The purpose of this chapter is to put genre to work as efficiently as possible within the process of theorization<br>

This situation raises many issues for humanistic research, including questions about the ability of the traditional culture to survive this new electronic invasion.

  Abstract: The techniques that the Asian martial arts teach are weapons. There is no other way to put it, which means that training in these arts is training in the use of weapons. They are special weapons, of course, and ineffective against many other weapons or against various threats. But what weapon is not specialized in some way and ineffectual in certain situations? People who train in martial arts might never actually use these weapons, just as many people who own a gun never fire it in self-defense.

  Book Title: Crossing Horizons-World, Self, and Language in Indian and Western Thought<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROTEM ORNAN<br>
  Abstract: Biderman uses concrete examples from religion and literature to illustrate the formal aspects of the philosophical problems of transcendence, language, selfhood, and the external world and then demonstrates their plausibility in actual situations. Though his method of analysis is comparative, Biderman does not adopt the disinterested stance of an "ideal" spectator. Rather, Biderman approaches ancient Indian thought and culture from a Western philosophical standpoint to uncover cultural presuppositions that can be difficult to expose from within the culture in question.<br>

  Abstract: There has been reawakened interest in the forms that peasant resistance are likely to assume, particularly in historical situations where open defiance is either impossible or entails considerable hazards (Scott 1985; Colburn 1989). Under such circumstances, it is argued, peasant resistance is prone to remain in the “hidden realm of political conflict.” Hence, it is less likely to take the form of open collective acts of violence such as riots, rebellion, sedition, or revolutionary movements. Since peasant uprisings, anyway, are “few and far in between,” it is more meaningful, Scott and Colburn tell us, to shift analysis to the more<br>

  Abstract: In 
                  This New Yet Unapproachable America, Stanley Cavell recounts the following anecdote: “One of the most influential American teachers of philosophy . . . declared . . . that there are only three ways to make an honest living in philosophy: learn some languages and do scholarly work, learn mathematics enough to do some real logic, or do literary psychology.”¹ Far from deploring this situation, in which philosophy is taken up by another discipline, Cavell affirms that it matters little to him, in the final analysis, whether what he does in writing his books is deemed to be philosophical.

  3  AUTONOMY, ETHICS, INTRASUBJECTIVITY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/vazq17484">Political Responsibility</a><br>
  Abstract: One upshot of the contemporary ethical turn is the proliferation of solipsistic philosophical accounts of responsibility. If discussions of political and ethical responsibility historically emphasized social and intersubjective relations, the dominant philosophical formulations of responsibility privilege autonomy and
                  intrasubjectivity, even when abstract invocations ofintersubjectivity are adduced. Modalities of solipsism that engage in Platonic soul-crafting and dwell on the inner life of the subject, her mental reality, over consideration of the predicaments of power she inhabits, or how these are historically constituted, politically sanctioned, and socially reproduced situations that thoroughly mediate that subjectivity. But these modalities of solipsism suggest something<br>

  Chapter Two  DREAMS from:

  Abstract: While dreaming is common to all human beings, not everyone makes the recording, telling, interpreting, and circulating of them an important part of the everyday experience of dreaming. As soon as I arrived in Puerto Rico in the summer of 1995 to conduct an exploratory research on the circulation of spiritual practices between the island and the U.S. mainland, I realized that describing one’s dreams and asking others to interpret them is a common practice, even among quasi-strangers, as I was for many. In various situations since my first days in Puerto Rico—at the university, in stores, and obviously<br>

  CHAPTER 11  Ugaki Tells of Afuseti, a Woman Stolen by Angikogo from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7560/708181">The Last Cannibals</a><br>
  Abstract: Once the Alto Xingu communities recognized that they had come to share common values, they began to develop ways of dealing with outsiders that were peaceful rather than aggressive. This was sometimes even the case in situations where outsiders posed threats to them. In certain stories about events that took place long after the end of cannibalistic blood feuding, the warrior remains an important though more peaceful figure. But a more ominous practice is developing: the killing of known people, usually people living within a community, because of witchcraft accusations. The fear and anger directed formerly against enemies living elsewhere<br>

  [9]  The Challenge of the French Revolution from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt15hvrs3">News and Politics in the Age of Revolution</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the ironies of the
                  Gazette de Leyde’s situation during the last years of the Patriot struggle in the Netherlands was that the paper, despite the bitter quarrels in which its publisher was involved, was prospering as never before. The 90 percent of his news space that Jean Luzac did not devote to Dutch politics went to coverage of increasingly dramatic events elsewhere, and although the final collapse of the Patriots in September 1787 was a tragedy for Luzae himself, it freed his newspaper to concentrate even more heavily on other stories.

  Book Title: God and the Gawain-Poet-Theology and Genre in Pearl, Cleanness, Patience and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Hatt Cecilia A.<br>
  Abstract: Pearl, Cleanness, Patience and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight are accomplished examples of four different literary genres and represent some of the finest poetry in Middle English. They are, by turns, fast and funny, powerfully dramatic, gentle and ironic, telling of painful bereavement and the terror of victims of disaster and violence, as well as the comic bewilderment of people entangled in alarmingly mysterious situations. The anonymous poet's evident delight in the pleasures and artistry of courtly life has led some readers to suggest that he was a gifted but complacent frequenter of courts, his attention dedicated to the wealthy and his sympathies to the powerful, and moreover, that his poems pay the merest lipservice to religious observance. God and the Gawain-poet argues that, on the contrary, the poet's wide-ranging engagement with all human life explicitly acknowledges all material creation as God's gift, revelling in its physicality, in bodily senses and movement and the ways a community celebrates itself. Dr Hatt shows how, in exhorting readers to recognize and respond to the narrative of divine gift, he appears as an energetic Christian poet and a humane and compassionate observer.

  Abstract: Nations in the South Pacific face the dramatic dual pressures of local reinventions and global engagements over processes of political decolonisation (both external and internal), cultural revitalisation and economic development. However, we have a limited understanding of how cultural practices can embody these processes and illuminate the ways in which they are being negotiated. This chapter addresses this situation by laying the foundation for a documentation and analysis of the contribution of curatorial practices in museums to (re)negotiating identities, cultural revitalisation and economic development.<br>

  Abstract: The anniversary of the American Equal Rights Association of May 12 and 13, 1869, was a watershed for American reformers. During the meeting, abolitionists and women’s rights activists severed personal ties already weakened by the debate over the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and divided into opposing camps. How did people who had been working side by side for several decades find themselves in the situation of choosing between the two causes—the rights of African Americans and those of women—they had previously fought for almost indiscriminately?¹ Trying to make sense of this rift, women’s rights activist Lucy Stone opted<br>

  Abstract: Though there is little evidence that it was used in the 
                  immediate aftermath of the Second World War, the term “Stunde Null,” or “Zero Hour,” was often at the core of later West German narratives about 1945.¹ As a concept it has been a much disputed one. For some, Germany’s destruction, misery, and shame was so complete that a tabula rasa situation existed in the aftermath of the Third Reich, one in which a completely new set of institutions and values that could not in any way be rooted in the Nazi past had to be developed for German society.<br>

  Abstract: Public and community archaeologies clearly have their deepest roots in places characterised by structural, societal inequities, and in situations where archaeologists have sought to be inclusive. As such, community archaeology has been generally theorised within a postcolonial, post-processual framework whereby we as scholars and trained professionals question our own position and our right to talk about the past of ‘other people’, often disenfranchised people. As characterised by Gemma Tully, the principal rationale for community archaeology is that ‘better archaeology can be achieved when more diverse voices are involved in the interpretation of the past.’¹ The best of these new inclusive<br>

  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Large Duncan<br>
  Abstract: German-language thinkers such as Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud are central to modernity. Yet their reception in the English-speaking world has largely depended on translations, a situation that has often hampered full engagement with the rhetorical and philosophical complexity of the German history of ideas. The present volume, the first of its kind, is a response to this situation. After an introduction charting the remarkable flowering of German-language thought since the eighteenth century, it offers extracts -- in the original German -- from sixteen major philosophical texts, with extensive introductions and annotations in English. All extracts are carefully chosen to introduce the individual thinkers while allowing the reader to pursue broader themes such as the fate of reason or the history of modern selfhood. The book offers students and scholars of German a complement to linguistic, historical, and literary study by giving them access to the wealth of German-language philosophy. It represents a new way into the work of a succession of thinkers who have defined modern philosophy and thus remain of crucial relevance today. The philosophers: Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Georg Lukács, Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, Jürgen Habermas. Henk de Berg is Professor of German at the University of Sheffield. Duncan Large is Professor of German at Swansea University.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt6wp91n">Modern German Thought from Kant to Habermas</a><br>
  Abstract: Sigismund Schlomo Freud was born in 1856, in the small town of Freiberg, which at the time belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire (renamed Příbor, it is now part of the Czech Republic). Both his parents were Jewish. Their domestic situation was unusual: Freud’s mother, Amalia, was not only twenty years younger than her husband, Jacob, but also younger than Freud’s oldest half-brother. In 1859, Jacob’s wool business was facing financial ruin and he moved the family to Leipzig. They settled in Vienna the following year (by which time Freud’s two half-brothers had emigrated to England). Jacob’s commercial position remained precarious,<br>

  Book Title: Spanish American Poetry after 1950-Beyond the Vanguard<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): SHAW DONALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a basis for understanding the main lines of development of poetry in Spanish America after Vanguardism, this volume begins with an overview of the situation at the mid-century: the later work of Neruda and Borges, the emergence of Paz. Consideration is then given to the decisive impact of Parra and the rise of colloquial poetry, politico-social poetry (Dalton, Cardenal) and representative figures such as Orozco, Pacheco and Cisneros. The aim is to establish a few paths through the largely unmapped jungle of Spanish American poetry in the time period. The author emphasises the persistence of a generally negative view of the human condition and the poets' exploration of different ways of responding to it. These vary from outright scepticism to the ideological, the religious or those derived from some degree of confidence in the creative imagination as cognitive. At the same time there is analysis of the evolving outlook on poetry of the writers in question, both in regard to its possible social role and in regard to diction. DONALD SHAW holds the Brown Forman Chair of Spanish American literature in the University of Virginia.<br>

  Abstract: As we survey the scene presented by Spanish American poetry after the mid-twentieth century, what strikes us most is the virtual absence of any critical framework within which we can situate all but the most famous of the individual poets. The critic’s situation is rather like that of someone hacking a way through a jungle which contains a few clearings here and there but remains basically unmapped. Occasionally he or she will meet someone who is similarly engaged and exchange a few cautious signals, before both proceed on divergent paths. The trees are many; the landmarks few; the danger of<br>

  Abstract: Bicycle messengers provide a valuable on-demand service to urban businesses that require same-day delivery of time-sensitive material. This chapter analyzes the spatial and organizational contradictions that enable and disrupt the urban bicycle messenger industry’s production of speed. It begins with the industry’s general context, describing the congestion that makes the “low-tech” bicycle the city’s fastest mode of delivery. It then moves to explore two sides of the messenger’s labor situation, the stress that arises conjointly out of that enabling congestion and the industry’s demands for speed, and the stress-mitigating enjoyment that arises out of those aspects of the labor similar<br>

  Abstract: The inability of scholars and practitioners in the field of law and economics to conceptualize the value commitments that characterize professional responsibility, their expectation that all actors will act opportunistically in situations of imperfect information, and their commitment to private ordering and the undermining of legal rules have weakened severely the duties of care and loyalty that ground corporate law.

  Author(s) HEISE DAVID R.<br>
  Abstract: Symbolic interactionism (e.g., McCall & Simmons 1978; Stryker 1980) provides insights into how humans understand social events. Definitions of situations categorize settings and the people in them, narrowing a person’s attention to a constrained range of phenomena, a restricted set of identities and objects that guide understanding and anticipation of social events. Events are created and interpreted to confirm the situational meanings provided by the definition of the situation. People create events to establish identities, to maintain identities, and to restore damaged identities. Expectations for another’s behavior reflect his or her identity, and if an observed event does not confirm<br>

  Book Title: Promises of 1968-Crisis, Illusion and Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): TISMANEANU VLADIMIR<br>
  Abstract: This book is a state of the art reassessment of the significance and consequences of the events associated with the year 1968 in Europe and in North America. Since 1998, there hasn’t been any collective, comparative and interdisciplinary effort to discuss 1968 in the light of both contemporary headways of scholarship and new evidence on this historical period. A significant departure from earlier approaches lies in the fact that the manuscript is constructed in unitary fashion, as it goes beyond the East–West divide, trying to identify the common features of the sixties. The latter are analyzed as simultaneously global and local developments. The main problems addressed by the contributors of this volume are: the sixties as a generational clash; the redefinition of the political as a consequence of the ideological challenges posed to the status-quo by the sixty-eighters; the role of Utopia and the de-radicalization of intellectuals; the challenges to imperialism (Soviet/American); the cultural revolution of the sixties; the crisis of ‘really existing socialism’ and the failure of “socialism with a human face”; the gradual departure from the Yalta-system; the development of a culture of human rights and the project of a global civil society; the situation of 1968 within the general evolution of European history (esp. the relationship of 1968 with 1989). In contrast to existing books, the book provides a fundamental and unique synthesis of approaches on 1968: first, it contains critical (vs. nostalgic) re-evaluations of the events from the part of significant sixty-eighters; second, it includes historical analyses based on new archival research; third, it gathers important theoretical re-assessments of the intellectual history of the 1968; and fourth, it bridges 1968 with its aftermath and its pre-history, thus avoiding an over-contextualization of the topics in question.<br>

  Abstract: The exercise of impetuosity, an instance of devastating and powerful force or an unjust and unwarranted display of physical intention for the purpose of intimidation, injury and destruction, are all aspects of violence, an elusive concept often applied in the description of a recognisable reality and an actual situation. Within the institutional confines and structures of a society, violence is roughly definable as “the illegal employment of methods of physical coercion”³ in the pursuit of individual and collective objectives. Étatist traditions are conterminal with the use of constitutionally sanctioned coercion⁴ in the defence and consolidation of state authority. All human<br>

  Book Title: Given World and Time-Temporalities in Context<br>

  Author(s): Miller Tyrus<br>
  Abstract: The interconnections of time with historical thought and knowledge have come powerfully to the fore since the 1970s. An international group of scholars, from a range of fields including literary theory, history of ideas, cultural anthropology, philosophy, intellectual history and theology, philology, and musicology, address the matter of time and temporalities. The volume’s essays, divided into four main topical groups question critically the key problem of context, connecting it to the problem of time. Contexts, the essays suggest, are not timeless. Time and its contexts are only partly “given” to us: to the primordial donations of time and world correspond our epistemic, moral, and practical modes of receiving what has been granted. The notion of context may have radically different parameters in different historical, cultural, and disciplinary situations. Topics include the deep antiquity, and the timeless time of eternity, as well as formal philosophies of history and the forms of histories implicit in individual and community experience. The medium specific use of time and history are examined with regard to song, image, film, oral narration, and legal discourse.<br>

Journal Title: Ethics<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: et.2001.112.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 2001<br>
Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: The necessity of both solidarity and proceduralism thus holds for both distributive and criminal justice. In the end, Ricoeur remains committed to notions that ground the just polity in community and mutual sharing without thinking that these notions require us to dispense with the formalism of procedures of justice. While the latter are not sufficient on their own to create or sustain a just society, while, indeed, formal procedures always presuppose some conception of the good, procedural conceptions allow us to recognize each other as subjects of rights. Although it is not always clear that Ricoeur succeeds in reconciling Rawls and Walzer or Habermas and Gadamer, he does provide a fresh perspective on current debates within his own interesting account of the structure of moral action.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Doctrine and method, theory and interpretation are not necessarily coordinate. Were such coordination possible, a metacritical stance would be required. By accepting uncritically the presuppositions that lie behind psychoanalytic metapsychology, Juillerat abrogates, in my view, ethnological responsibility, that is, the responsibility to measure in a receptive manner the presuppositions of ones hermeneutic against those of the culture one is studying. Though his attention to ethnographic detail leads Juillerat to refine psychoanalytic doctrine, it confirms the epistemological and hermeneutic assumptions of that doctrine (e.g., notions of the unconscious, id, ego, and superego, drives, repression, and, indeed, psychic space). Yafar myth and ritual as he presents them become allegories of that doctrineallegories, I would argue, of allegories. There would appear to be no escape, were it not for the Yafar voices that sound through Juillerats psychoanalytically predetermined presentations. (He offers us almost no contextualized verbatim texts in these essays, though he does in his monographs.) They remind us that, as LviStrauss demonstrated, myths are readily translated one into another, particularly when they are decontextualized. What is of ethnographic, indeed, psychoanalytic import is howand perhaps whytranslation is arrested and a particular myth (e.g., the Oedipal tale) becomes so authoritative that it has the power of promiscuous reduction. Though fascinated by the range of Yafar cultural expression, Juillerat fails to consider the implications of Yafars refusal to reduce their corpus of mythology and ritual to a single mytha singular ritual.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”
            Theological Studies47 (1986): 44–45.<br>

Abstract: Hence, our choice of philosophies should not be limited to the two main philosophies identified by Budd but rather could take up ideas from process thinking, which is a quieter but nevertheless relevant philosophy to which LIS should attend. By valuing the processes and articulating this with better abstractions more congruent with our action, we not only further our own project; we also sustain a vital engagement with the projects of individuals. We more clearly articulate the library in the life of the user, to use the words of Wiegand [

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] I wish to thank the editors of the AHR, first, for inviting me to consider the issues in this essay, second, for the helpful comments of Acting Editor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, and, third, for the quite stimulating commentary of several anonymous reviewers. 1 See Eric Foner, ed., The New American History (Philadelphia, 1990); Foner, ed., The New American History, rev. and expanded edn.

Beard.4 But during the 1970s, the claims being made for a national mind or culture were challenged by social historians. Intellectual history was chastened and transformed by the confrontation with social history. Eschewing their former embrace of synthesis, intellectual historians pulled back to study more precisely defined themes and thinkers.5 Not only intellectual history but other subfields accommodated social history's provocation to rethink conventional gen- eralizations. In addition, a professional, even "social-scientific," concern for precision and specificity of reference collaborated-sometimes with forethought, often not-with a sharpened awareness of difference and conflict that came from social movements outside the academy to undermine older composite narratives. Neither the frame supplied by Charles and Mary Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927), with its dramatic narrative of conflict between the "people" and the "interests," nor the consensual pluralism that succeeded that interpretation in the 1950s survived.6 If the consensus historians underplayed conflict, the Beards' approach, for all of its sympathy for the dispossessed, was found to be inadequate as well. Their narrative revealed little feel for the diversity of Americans, and it paid scant attention to non-whites. Most important of all, while their narrative voice was sympathetic, one did not discover the quotidian life or hear the voices of those groups that have found voice in more recent historiography. Judged by newer historiographical expectations, The Rise of American Civilization seemed "thin," compared with the increasingly popular "thick" description that was built, in part, on the enormously influential anthropological work of Clifford Geertz.7 In the past quarter century, there has been a proliferation of exciting new research, much of it bringing previously overlooked or explicitly excluded groups and events into the light of history. The number and variety of American stories multiplied. Suddenly, there were histories where there had been none or where the available histories had not been attended to by professional historians: histories of African Americans in the era of slavery and beyond; of Native Americans; of workers at home in their communities, at work, and at play; of women at home and outside of the home and of gender relations more generally; of consumption as well as production; of ethnic minorities and "borderlands"; of popular culture and other "marginal" forms of cultural production; of objects and material culture; of whites and whiteness as historical subjects; of non-state international and intercultural relations; and much more. [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 4Frederick Jackson Turner never completed a major synthesis, but one can see how he might have done that work in his posthumously published The United States, 1830-1850 (New York, 1935); Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (1927; 2 volumes in 1, New York, 1930).. In fact, the Beards participated in this shift with the publication of The American Spirit: A Study of the Idea of Civilization in the United States (New York, 1942). 5 For an early anticipation of this development-from the point of view of intellectual history-see Lawrence Veysey, "Intellectual History and the New Social History," in Paul K. Conkin and John Higham, eds., New Directions in American Intellectual History (Baltimore, Md., 1979), 3-26. See also, in the same volume, David A. Hollinger, "Historians and the Discourse of Intellectuals," 42-63; and Thomas Bender, "The Cultures of Intellectual Life: The City and the Professions," 181-95. 6 For consensus history as synthesis, see especially Daniel J.

These developments were occurring at a moment when the number of American historians was expanding to an unprecedented degree. Disciplinary expansion both allowed and prompted increased specialization. And that worried some, who began to speak of hyperspecialization and fragmentation. The structure of specialization derived in large part from the impact of a social history that often fused the group-based particularity of focus with ideological commitments to class and identity-based social movements. This pattern of work discouraged the integration of particular histories into some kind of synthesis.8 Traditionalists, perhaps not surprisingly, were unnerved by these develop- ments.9 But even some proponents of the newer history worried. Early on, Herbert G. Gutman, one of the leading figures in the movement to write a history that included all Americans and that recognized differences-class, ethnic, racial, gender-was concerned that instead of enriching and enlarging the usable history of the United States, the new scholarship was failing to do that, perhaps making it in fact less usable. The "new social history," he wrote in the introduction to his collection of pioneering essays in the field, "suffers from a very limiting overspe- cialization." Take an Irish-born Catholic female textile worker and union organizer in Fall River involved in a disorderly strike in 1875. She might be the subject of nearly a dozen sub-specializations, which would, he feared, "wash out the wholeness that is essential to understanding human behavior."10 Later, in the wake of a national meeting of writers at which historians and history seemed to be largely ignored in discussions of the political and cultural situation in the aftermath of Richard Nixon, Gutman mused aloud in the pages of The Nation over whether the failure of historians to incorporate social history's findings into a new synthesis had seriously diminished, even evacuated, history's possible contribution to public debate."1 In the mid-1980s, in what turned out to be a controversial pair of articles, I raised a related question: how might one construct the (to my mind) needed synthesis of recent historiography on the United States.12 There was considerable negative reaction to those articles, coming from two different positions. One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 8 For an insightful and quite worrisome examination of recent scholarly practice and its trajectory, see Winfried Fluck, "The Modernity of America and the Practice of Scholarship," in Thomas Bender, ed., Rethinking American History in a Global Age (Berkeley, Calif., 2002). 9 See, for example, Gertrude Himmelfarb, The New History and the Old (Cambridge, Mass., 1987).

Gutman, Work, Culture and Society in Industrializing America: Essays in American Working-Class and Social History (New York, 1976), xii-xiii.

These arguments were equated with a carelessness about scholarly rigor.13 The other, and more widespread position, focused on the risks of a national narrative itself. It was evidently feared that such a narrative would, by definition, re-exclude those groups and themes that had so recently been brought under the umbrella of history and would re-inscribe a "master narrative" dominated by white, elite males.14 By the end of the 1980s, however, the question of synthesis had become less controversial. The issue became more practical, more professional in some sense: how to do it and how to do it within the parameters of inclusion that had been central to the discussion from the beginning. It was on this note that Alice Kessler-Harris, the author of the chapter on social history in The New American History (1990 edition), addressed the question. In the last section of her essay, with the section title of "The Problem of Synthesis," she acknowledged the problem and explored various possible ways to overcome "fragmentation" and move toward synthesis.15 A different issue emerged in the 1990s. Poststructuralist literary and cultural theory, sometimes broadly and even more vaguely characterized as postmodernism, was and is suspicious of any aspiration toward a comprehensive narrative. It is to this body of theory that we owe the commonplace use and misuse of the epithet "master narrative."16 These theories have been rather slow to penetrate workaday historical practice among American historians. Levels and types of awareness of them vary: from shocked indignation at the whole idea, to vague awareness and thoughtless dismissal, to intellectual fascination largely in isolation from the making of one's own histories. In his recent book, Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (1995), Robert Berkhofer seeks to force more attention to these issues. Insistently, but not always consistently, he urges historians to recognize the dimensions of the postmodern crisis that surrounds them. He seems more interested in sounding the alarm about the quicksand before us than in guiding us [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 13 Eric H.

But either way, he intends to challenge the very possibility of narrative synthesis.17 While these worries, proposals, and polemics were being fashioned, the daily work of historians proceeded. Among the products of that work have been a good number of explicitly synthetic volumes. There is, of course, no clear or settled notion of what defines a work of synthesis. I have used a rather generous definition. Some of the books I am calling synthetic might alternatively be designated as monographs-archivally based but exceptionally ambitious books that tackle big questions and seek to frame a large field or to provide an interpretation for an audience well beyond specialists. Others are more obviously synthetic, relying heavily on secondary literature to establish the state of the art in a broad field for a wide audience, including, often, students and the general public. With this diversity of form, purpose, and audience in mind-as well as a concern for a reasonable distribution of fields and periods-I have, with the help of the editors of the American Historical Review, selected a few recent synthetic works for examina- tion.18 The very existence of these books mutes the question of whether we need synthetic works or whether, under the constraints of present historiographical practice, synthesis is possible. In fact, the seeming proliferation of syntheses at present-and their variousness-suggests that the field of American history is at a formative (or reformative) moment that invites synthesis: the quest for new understandings that has undermined established narratives has now, perhaps, prompted new efforts at crystallizing a very unstable body of historical writing into new syntheses. A different question, however, provides the focus of this essay. What strategies for narrative synthesis are available to historians today? How might we think about the relation between a particular structure of narrative synthesis and the author's purpose or interpretation? How do these different strategies relate to current historiography? What particular work do they do, within the profession and beyond it? And finally I want to ask some questions about the firmness of the boundaries (mostly geographical) that define what is and is not captured in synthetic narratives of U.S. history. These works do not, of course, cover the whole field of synthetic works. More and other books could have been chosen, but these eleven books (and several others mentioned along the way) at least represent different kinds of history, different [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 17 Robert F.

Together, the eleven total nearly 6,000 pages of outstanding historical writing. If nothing else, I can conclude that synthetic narrative invites long books. Because I cannot claim special knowledge in any of the fields being synthesized in these books, I do not propose to do the kind of analysis one would find in specialized reviews. Such criticisms that I have will be framed from the position of my interest in synthetic narrative. I say that in part to be honest about my own limitations in appraising these books but also for another, more positive reason. I want to insist that narrative synthesis is a form of knowledge, indeed, a particularly powerful form of creating, not simply summarizing, knowledge. I hope to get past or under the story enough to probe the implications of different modes of structuring a narrative synthesis. The way different narrative strategies construct that knowledge is important. While inclusion is one of the tests our generation will rightly ask of synthesis, there are other important historiographical issues that are embedded in the question of narrative synthesis.19 The more seriously we consider possible narratives of American history, the more we may be prepared to ask questions that press beyond inclusion. We may even be both bold enough and hopeful enough to worry a little about the language of inclusion, if not the principle. Is there perhaps more than a hint of dominant culture noblesse oblige in the language of inclusion? Might not a more sophisticated notion of the temporal and geographical boundaries of American history, including an awareness of the diasporic stories within American history, complicate and enrich the notion of inclusion?20 Can the historical and historiographical terrain be opened a bit more in a way that enables a deeper, denser, and more complex historiographical exploration of justice and difference at the center of American history? Might democracy be the word, the concept, the commitment that will move us in that direction? As I examine the stack of books before me, I propose to keep these issues in mind and to return to them at the end of this essay. JON BUTLER'S Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (2000) covers the whole mainland British colonial space and history, and it addresses a wide range of themes. In fact, themes, not time or chronology, organize his story. His brief, often one-word, chapter titles reveal a very distinctive type of synthesis, one immediately accessible to the reader, whether professional or lay: Peoples, Economy, Politics, Things Material, Things Spiritual. It is a reasonable progression, and in each case he brings together a good deal of material. Although his theme is transformation, Butler also claims (following recent historiography) a more inclusive geography, making more of the middle colonies than would have been the case a generation ago. In some ways, his manner of organizing the material topically bears a relation to [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 19 I do not propose to go into theories of narrative or even my own notions, but I will here indicate that my understanding has been greatly influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative, Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, trans., 3 vols. (Chicago, 1984-88). 20 Such thinking is not restricted to specialists in the profession exploring the theme of diaspora. The novelist Russell Banks has recently argued that the focus for a synthesis of American history ought to be the African diaspora. See "The Star-Spangled Novel," Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2000.

If Hofstadter's book was intended to provide a snapshot that would serve as a starting point, Butler's title ("Becoming America") and his stated intentions announce change as his theme. He means to persuade the reader of a broad pattern of transformation that produced a distinctive and modern society in advance of 1776 and that in turn spawned the first modern revolution. Such an argument demands more complex and careful attention to process and cause than his framing of the book seems to allow. While he has surely gathered together a considerable body of material (his notes run to fifty pages), he has not produced a synthetic narrative of change over time, one that sketches a develop- mental sequence that integrates disparate elements in the interest of a causal interpretation. By bounding each unit of synthesis, Butler is stuck with a structural isolation of topics that undercuts narrative explanation. Given that Butler's theme is transformation, this narrative structure is crippling. For reasons related to structure and style of argument, Butler's claims for American modernity are quite vulnerable. While there are doubtless some specific ways in which the British North American colonies became "modern" before independence, they were not uniformly modern-over space or in all aspects of life. Many historians would readily grant numerous anticipations of modernity by the middle of the eighteenth century, but few would insist, with Butler, that so much modernity had been achieved so soon, implying that only a few pre-modern anomalies remained on the eve of revolution.22 Most give a significant role to the revolution.23 But the most serious problem is not with the phenomena he notices or does not notice, even if there is some real unevenness on this point. Rather, it is Butler's teleology of the modern, combined with his exceedingly loose, elusive, and, as is so often said today, undertheorized definition of modernity. Add to this an unneces- sary but apparently irresistible tendency to claim American uniqueness and "firsts" for nearly everything he identifies as modern in America. He names a number of phenomena that he considers evidences of the modern-polyglot, slaves, cities, market economy, refined crafts and trades, religious pluralism, and "sophisticated politics." Without further historical specification and theoretical precision, one can indulge in reductio ad absurdum. With the exception of religious pluralism, all of these qualities probably described Athens in the age of Aristotle at least as well as the British colonies. In fact, I suspect that Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, relying on their recent book The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (2000), would argue that the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 21 Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (New York, 1971). 22 Jon Butler, Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (Cambridge, Mass., 2000), 1. 23 See, for example, Gordon S. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York, 1992). Long before, Bernard Bailyn suggested certain developments that Butler would consider modern had developed in the eighteenth century, but he emphasized the unevenness and even paradoxical character of this proto-modernity.

In the end, however, it is diversity, which he tends to equate with multiculturalism, that for Butler makes Americans modern. But if we look around, we cannot but wonder about his claims for a uniquely polyglot society. This assertion may be quite vulnerable from any sight line approaching a global perspective. Can he fairly claim that New York City harbored a level of diversity "never before gathered together"?25 Might not this be as plausibly said of Constantinople during the period covered by Butler's book? And did not the Ottoman Empire-of which Constantinople was the capital-far exceed the religious and ethnic diversity of the British colonies? My point here is partly one of fact, of care in making comparative statements without comparison. More important, however, are the criteria of the modern. Few, if any, major political bodies in the past half millennium more successfully accommodated diversity than the Ottomans, yet that achievement has never brought them recognition for a precocious modernity. One needs greater defini- tional and descriptive specificity to make the argument he claims. Because of the breadth and generality of synthetic narratives, it is especially important to be clear about key concepts. Similarly, he tends to claim the realization of "Americanness"-here equated with some vague notion of modernity-for events that, however interesting in themselves, hardly sustain his assertion that they designated "the American future."26 For example, writing of the French Huguenots, a group he knows well, he notes their assimilation, and he calls this "American."27 Well, of course it is, but so are the endogenous marriages that continue for various groups well into the twentieth century-sometimes because of racial difference and even legislation (as in the case of African Americans) or out of choice, as in the case of Scandinavians in the upper Midwest. Or to take a more ominous subject, it seems a bit fatalistic to say that colonial encroachment on Indian land "predicted" nineteenth-century relations with the Indians.28 Oddly, such a claim, while taking the moral high ground, nonetheless erases the postcolonial history of the United States by denying contingency and thus diminishing both the capacity and moral responsibility of all later actors or potential actors. The twin and linked teleologies of "modern" and "American" produce a distorting and de-historicizing synthesis. If there is a problem with the sort of synthesis Butler has written, what precisely is it? He makes historical claims about patterns and meanings of development on the basis of a narrative structure that effectively isolates and de-historicizes his themes. By not constructing a developmental narrative that integrates the various themes now separated in distinct chapters, the process and complexity of develop- ment is obscured.

In the absence of a narrative of change to explain and interpret, he resorts for a theme to repeated assertions of "modernity." The issue is not so much the claim for an eighteenth-century American modernity-although I am myself drawn to much more complex, nuanced, and contradictory discussions of that theme-as it is the incapacity of the particular model of synthesis he deploys to advance that theme or argument. Philip D. Morgan's Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (1998) is at once similar to Butler's and quite different. Both focus tightly in each chapter on a particular topic or theme; there is little play among the different themes in both cases. While Butler's themes propose a reorganization of material, thus giving an impression of freshness, Morgan's quite important questions are phrased in well-established ways. While Butler's structure works against his theme of transformation, Morgan's similar structure better fits his goals for the book, partly because transformation plays a smaller role in his analysis than one might expect. Slave Counterpoint addresses nearly all the issues raised by a half century of vigorous scholarship on the beginnings of slavery, the practices of racial slavery as a labor and social system, and the nature of African-American culture in early America. It is a book of enviable learning: with a seeming total command of the historiography and an impressive knowledge of a substantial archival base, Morgan proceeds to pose (or re-pose) difficult historiographical issues. Again and again, he offers compelling answers. Want to know what scholarship has disclosed about slavery and African-American culture in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and Lowcountry? Look to Morgan's synthesis of a generation of scholarship. To have done that is to have done a great deal, and he has done it magnificently. Yet one gets the sense of a summary volume, a volume driven by the past, by past questions. Synthesis can either cap a phase of scholarship or initiate another. I think Morgan's book falls into the former category, while Ira Berlin's new book, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (1998), which also relies on a generation of scholarship and addresses many of the same issues, has the potential to become a new starting point. Berlin has captured the shift to an Atlantic perspective that has increasingly characterized scholarship by early modern Europeanists, Africanists, Latin Americanists, and historians of British North America. In this sense, his work, at least the early parts that sketch out and populate the Atlantic littoral, points forward.29 In a dramatic opening section, Berlin, relying more on secondary literatures than does Morgan, locates his story in very broad understandings of time (periodization) and space (the Atlantic world), the dimensions of which are shadowy, almost invisible, in Morgan's account. He locates Africans in an Atlantic history connecting four continents and in a rich and growing historiography reaching out from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America.30 One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 29 Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge, Mass., 1998). 30 Berlin's powerful evocation of the Atlantic builds on many predecessors. At minimum, mention should be made of Philip D. Curtin's The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (Madison, Wis., 1969); and The AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 138 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] wishes Berlin had sustained this perspective in the later sections. But even if he narrows the story to the territory that later became the United States and loses the multiple histories implied by his portrait of the Atlantic world, the beginnings of stories, whether novels or histories, are heavy with intention and implication that can, I hope, be built upon.31 In fact, the four Atlantic continents remain an always changing aspect of American and African histories. Attending to, or at least recognizing, that larger and continuing extended terrain of American history would enrich the story of the making of African Americans and America, a historiography that is at present too much captured by an implicit and too simple assimilation or "Americanization" model. Nonetheless, Berlin has provided a powerful image of the creation of the Atlantic world and of the origin of modern slavery within it. Morgan has a quite different strategy. His domain is not the Atlantic but the South, or two regions of the South, which he is anxious to reveal as differentiated. Thus his is a comparative history, comparing two regions within the South. Suggesting a certain scientific aspiration, he refers to his delimited space as a kind of laboratory, a site for an "indirect experiment."32 This approach offers him much. He is able to focus tightly on his questions and generally achieves sharply phrased answers. Yet, like any good scientific laboratory, his field of inquiry is almost hermetically sealed. A two-hundred-page part of the book titled "The Black World" begins with a fifteen-page section on "Africans." Yet it is in only one paragraph at the beginning and a few other scattered references that one reads anything about Africa. His story rarely strays east (or south or north or west) of the Maryland/ Virginia and South Carolina boundaries. His comparative method has impressive rigor. Yet one senses that not only does his approach trap him within a particular place, he is also caught within a very confining net woven from the existing historiography. As Walter Johnson pointed out in a review of the book in this journal, his questions are smaller than the stories he has unearthed.33 Much like another important book on African-American history, Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), this book, for all its synthetic aspirations, cannot capture some of its best material within the tightly bounded historiographical questions and issues that frame it.34 As in the case of Berlin's book, Morgan's is quite explicit about time and space. There is a well-thought-out chronology of change, and one of his major arguments is that the South, and thus the black as well as white experience, was not uniform over space. He shows real and important distinctions between the experience of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex (New York, 1990; 2d edn., 1998); and John K.

Yet by treating both the temporal and spatial aspects of the story as sites (and very limited ones) rather than as processes of historical making, he weakens the capacity of his local analyses to explain change over time and, to a lesser extent, space. His major explanatory claims appear in the introduction. They are not only brief but also separate from the rich stories he tells and the analyses he makes of historiographical questions.35 The expansiveness of Many Thousands Gone, by contrast, evokes a strong sense of change, of process. It achieves a narrative synthesis of the movement of Africans onto the Atlantic and into the Western hemisphere. The difference between this approach and the tightly controlled analysis crafted by Morgan is striking. Like Morgan's, Michael Schudson's book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998), is organized around fairly established questions- especially one big question. Has American civic life deteriorated over the course of the past three centuries? Naturally, the question is of a different order than those driving Morgan's analysis. It has not been generated by disciplinary scholarship. It arose out of American public life. Schudson thus draws on history and other disciplines to address directly a public question, one endlessly repeated today and, as he shows, in the past. Schudson himself, we should note, is not a historian. He was trained as a sociologist, and he teaches in a Department of Communication. While he reveals an impressive command of the relevant historiography, historians are not his primary reference group or audience.36 Although I am sure specialists will find some of his formulations to be of considerable historiographical significance and likely to encourage new lines of research, his intention, again, is different: his audience is a general one, and he seeks to bring historical knowledge to bear on a civic issue. What he is doing points toward the most important work that one kind of successful narrative synthesis can do, for the profession and for the public. By openly declaring his address to a public issue and for a public audience, Schudson participates in a very important tradition of historical writing. Some of the very best professional historians of the United States in this century have done precisely that: Frederick Jackson Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Beard, and Richard Hofstadter all focused on issues, worries, or preoccupations of fairly general interest to write synthetic works that importantly rephrased fundamental themes in American history. This mutual enrichment of public and professional discourse is perhaps the ideal cultural work of narrative synthesis. Let us hope that historians can do this more often and more effectively. Yet as I make this point, I realize that all of the historians just named, including Schudson himself, were either trained as social scientists or did not recognize a significant boundary between history and the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 35Morgan, Slave Counterpoint, xv-xxiv. I should note that my concerns about boundary setting in Morgan's book do not apply nearly so much to Philip D. Morgan, "The Black Experience in the British Empire, 1680-1810," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, Vol. 2: The Eighteenth Century, P. J. Marshall, ed. (Oxford, 1998), 465-86. 36 This command is at once impressive and sometimes puzzling. In discussing the Founding and the Constitution, he does not mention Gordon Wood's The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969). Nor, in writing about the first decades of the nineteenth century, does he mention either of two key books by Robert H. Wiebe, The Opening of American Society: From the Adoption of the Constitution to the Eve of Disunion (New York, 1984); and Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy (Chicago, 1995). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 140 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] (other?) once more expansive social sciences. Is this a mere coincidence, or is it an issue to be addressed by the profession? While I would not place Schudson's book in the same class as the scholarship produced by the short list of great historians, he has written a fine book. It is a book about change over time, and he establishes three eras of citizenship and participa- tion, each clearly defined. He does not devote much attention to how each configuration changes into the next, but he effectively characterizes their differ- ences, even in some very brief summaries, as in the following paragraph from early in the book: Another way to characterize the past three hundred years of political change is to say that the type of authority by which society is governed shifted from personal authority (gentlemen) to interpersonal authority (parties, coalitions, and majorities), to impersonal authority (science, expertise, legal rights, and information) ... The geographical center of politics has shifted from the countryside to the cities to the suburbs and perhaps, today, to "technoburbs," "postsuburbs," or "edge cities," or whatever we name our newer habitations. Correspondingly, the kind of knowledge a good citizen requires has changed: in an age of gentlemen, the citizen's relatively rare entrances into public discussion or controversy could be guided by his knowledge of social position; in the era of rule by majorities, the citizen's voting could be led by the enthusiasm and rhetoric of parties and their most active partisans; in the era of expertise and bureaucracies, the citizens had increasingly to learn to trust their own canvass of newspapers, interest groups, parties, and other sources of knowledge, only occasionally supported by the immediacy of human contact; and in the emerging age of rights, citizens learn to catalog what entitlements they may have and what forms of victimization they may knowingly or unknowingly have experienced.37 This paragraph reveals the argument and the narrative strategy that Schudson uses to undercut the widespread notion of civic decline: rather than a story of decline, it is one of restructuring, one that recalibrates citizenship and civic practice in relation to changing values and social experiences. What some, including me, see as the erosion of our public life and the thinning of American political culture, he presents as a complex rearticulation of expectations and institutions. Whether one fully agrees with Schudson or not, the book and the point of view it ingeniously argues constitutes an important contribution of contemporary civic life. And a narrative strategy of restructuring (as opposed to the usual rise or fall scenarios) deserves a place in the historian's menu of narrative types. "Presentist" purposes may, however, carry the danger of anachronistic readings. Schudson is vulnerable on this score, especially in his consideration of the colonial period. He too easily asks how democratic any phase of political life was. A commitment to explore the fate of democracy in our past-something I endorse- surely includes recognizing when democracy is not an available concept. He might better have asked how the legitimation and exercise of power worked. Indeed, such a deeper historicism would complement his anti-anti-Whig approach. Similarly, while a then-and-now binary invites sometimes interesting questions and offers some illumination of past and present, it also invites problems. Again, one sees this risk in Schudson's work. False categories of judgment are explicitly or implicitly brought to bear.

Voters then were expected to have "local knowledge-not of laws or principles, but of men."38 The binary obscures the role of principles in the past and knowledge of men in the present. Most important of all, it diverts our attention from the principles that it was thought would aid voters in judging character.39 Sometimes, by focusing so much on the party system that we worry about today, he overlooks those important issues that eluded the parties or that parties avoided. Substantive issues-the reason citizenship and civic life are important-are marginalized in his account of the different concepts and patterns of public life. The result, whether intended or not, is a form of consensus history.40 "Progress or decline is not the real question," Schudson concludes.41 He converts that question into one of restructuring that points to his core argument: there must be a fit between forms of citizenship and forms of everyday life, between values and institutions, between aspirations and commitments. It is that historically informed understanding that allows him in his conclusion to speculate in quite promising ways about an evolving pattern of citizenship that may yet serve our collective hopes and needs. Still, his conclusion leaves me uneasy. Like the journalistic coverage of politics today, the substance of political conflict is subordinated to discussion of the "health" of the system, of the institutions and practices. By contrast, the tensions, conflicts, and substantive issues that made politics so important in the development of the United States and in the lives of individuals are at the center of Eric Foner's The Story of American Freedom (1998). Foner's book has an uncanny resemblance to one that at first glance might seem utterly unrelated: Richard Hofstadter's The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It.42 Of course, Foner inverts the point Hofstadter sought to make. If Hofstadter famously played down conflict and (less remarked upon) paid little attention to the social making of political ideologies, Foner emphasizes conflict and the changing historical construction and reconstruction of the idea and ideology of freedom. Foner's work is much more explicitly sensitive to social history, even if it parallels Hofstadter's in its interest in ideology and the limits and possibilities of American political culture. While Hofstadter was alternately comic and ironic, bitterly so at times, in The American Political Tradition, Foner's Story of American Freedom is strikingly fair and straightforward. Yet the underlying hope is similar. As James Oakes has perceptively noted, Foner's narrative is undergirded by an unstated but firm liberal ideal of freedom- one that at once shares in an Enlightenment universalism and [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 38 Schudson, Good Citizen, 81. 39 See Joyce Appleby, Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans (Cambridge, Mass., 2000). 40 See, for example, his summary judgment of the party system at Schudson, Good Citizen, 132.

Both appraised American political culture and its prospects from the position of a richer, more textured liberalism than we usually recognize in current debates.44 In thinking about the core issue in Foner's narrative, therefore, it seems fair to consider it to be the quest for a democratic liberalism, insisting on the relevance and indispensability of the modifier inserted before liberalism. One might thus characterize Foner's as a democratic synthesis, which, as I suggested above, offers a stronger and more egalitarian standard of judgment than commonplace invoca- tions of inclusion. It offers as well the implication of voice and empowerment. To Foner, as he indicates in his introduction, "abstract definitions" of freedom are not the focus. His concern is "with the debates and struggles through which freedom acquires concrete meanings, and how understandings of freedom are shaped by, and in turn help to shape, social movements and political and economic events."45 The result is a narrative that is at once focused yet always open to an examination of larger issues, structures, and events that intersect with and often drive his story. It is a dynamic story, filled with actors, with agents making freedom and using freedom. He selects key events or controversies of different eras, events that are widely contested (slavery, labor and property, the role of the state, social movements). Of course, coverage is selective; the gain is the richness deriving from a series of concentrated focal points. In each case, he examines the conflict, the parties contending, and the stakes. He does not hesitate to declare justices and injustices, to name winners and losers, and he does so from a consistently democratic perspective. Foner thus achieves inclusion without the dilution conse- quent with the faux openness characteristic of talk radio and without the postmod- ern hesitations that undermine moral judgment.46 The American West: A New Interpretive History (2000) by Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher spans the whole of American history, from "the European invasion" until the present.47 The book is written in the spirit of Frederick Jackson Turner. Instead of lamenting the ambiguity of Turner's conception of the frontier, which after Turner got reduced by rigorous historians to a place, the West, Hine and Faragher embrace its fullness.

That openness allows them to tell the history of the United States as a story of successive frontiers, including a fascinating rethinking of American regionalism as urban-centered at the end of the twentieth century.48 In fact, the chapter on the postwar era is a tour de force-imaginative, original, and quite compelling. In Turnerian fashion, they argue that "westering defined America's unique heritage."49 To a very impressive degree, they give substance to this claim, but recent historiography makes that claim, even for western history, problematic. As Hine and Faragher show, in the nineteenth century as well as today, the West (and the United States) was formed by migrations from west to east and south to north, and even in a limited way north to south, as well as east to west. The notion of westering is so strong in American and European history and culture, it is difficult to construct an alternative narrative structure, though no less important for the difficulty.50 This worry does not, however, undercut another summary point they make: the "frontier is our common past."51 The book is grounded in social history. Of all the books under consideration here, The American West is probably the most sensitive to the categories of experience and groups previously excluded from mainstream narratives of Ameri- can history. Their work goes well beyond mere representation of such groups and categories; previously invisible groups, whether Native Americans, migrating women, African-American settlers, working people, or the people of the border- lands, are actors who contributed to the shaping of history. But there are limits to this achievement. While there are multiple positions and voices represented in their narrative, only rarely does their narrative bring the reader inside group life. There is not much inquiry into the interior experience and subjective meanings shared by the various groups identified and recognized.52 While the story could have been situated in a wider context, one that revealed the global reach of the empires or, later, the importance of global markets, in its particular geographical focus the book consistently avoids privileging the English line of settlement. Other settler efforts are considered and sometimes compared. As is often the case with synthetic histories, however, there is a tendency to do the work of inclusion at a particular moment, and then lose the group at issue.

At times, the transnational themes they develop are extremely illuminating. They refer to what would later be characterized by theorists of the global cities as a "dual economy" in describing the role of foreign migrants, especially Chinese, in the nineteenth-century California agricultural economy.53 Likewise the interplay of national and international in their discussion of the Zimmerman telegram inviting Mexico to ally with Germany in World War I and in their discussion of San Francisco's "commercial hinterland."54 But, as in the case of Butler's book, there is a bit of parochialism in making claims of distinction. Perhaps such assertions can be demonstrated, but more rigorous definitions and empirical research than we have here are required to establish, for example, that the United States is today the world's most multicultural society.55 How would it compare with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, whose citizens speak more than 100 languages and live on almost numberless islands? The social-history approach, whatever its success in representing difference, has in this instance under-represented national political institutions and policies. The development of the West, as Richard White and other historians of the West have pointed out, was profoundly indebted to what western Republicans now call "big government," for water, transportation, Indian removal, and, more recently, direct investment, as in defense contracts and installations and aerospace industries.56 The political economy and the role of markets, as has already been suggested, do not get the attention they deserve. We often overlook how much industry was in the West, and how much western industries-from milling and meatpacking to mining-were integral to the industrial system of the United States. And we forget how much the astonishing productivity of western agriculture enabled the formation of a large urban industrial labor supply. More of these dimensions of western history might have been included if only in the interest in enabling the story better to tell the national experience. If Hine and Faragher encompass both the full geographical and temporal dimensions of western history, Linda Gordon's microhistory builds out from a very delimited western space, the Sonoran highlands of Arizona, to develop a highly innovative narrative synthesis that locates itself at the various and causally interrelated scales of town, region, nation, and the transnational. Her work reminds us that there is a difference between a mere local study and a microhistory. The local histories of villages, towns, and cities, so common in the 1970s, tended to use global concepts but within artificially bounded fields of inquiry. One of the most famous of them all, Kenneth Lockridge's study of Dedham, Massachusetts, offered an isolated inwardness as a principal finding, although it was a finding that derived [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 53Hine and Faragher, American West, 358-60. 54 Hine and Faragher, American West, 395-97, 414.

Mostly, her account is the story of the arrival and fate of Catholic orphans from New York who were to be placed in Catholic homes. The homes were Mexican as well as Catholic, and that was the problem and the focus of conflict. The conflict played out along class, ethnic, religious, and gender lines, and it eventually reached the Supreme Court. It is a compelling and very human narrative, but one that also addresses a whole range of analytical and interpretive issues of broader interest to historians. Bringing the issues of gender, class, and race into relation with each other allows for an appraisal of their relative importance in this particular historical explanation. I think that her story reveals class to be more important than her conclusion argues, but the real point to be made is that only a narrative synthesis that brings diverse threads together will enable the historian and the reader to make this kind of judgment. These complex ends are achieved in part by her adoption of an imaginative literary strategy. Gordon's book is constructed of two types of chapters. One is quite often a broad frame for local events. In these chapters, her perspective as narrator is exterior to the action. The issues addressed are frequently structural and, as often as not, extend beyond the community. Here, one gets an analytical explanation of the relation of local experience to larger national and international cultural, political, and economic developments. Between these chapters, she has crafted others that get inside the culture of the community, providing wonderfully rich, thick descriptions of daily life and the development of the conflict. With oral histories as well as fragmentary documentary evidence, she brings the reader very close to the experience and voices of the community. The play between these accounts and the more conventional chapters produces an unusual but powerful synthesis. Whether a microhistory qualifies as a synthesis, even by my generous definition, may be debated. But the singular relevance of this book for the discussion of synthesis concerns not scale but its literary ambition, the literary experiment that gives structure to the book. Those who would write other syntheses-at various scales-will, I hope, be encouraged, even inspired, to experiment with novel narrative strategies in the interest of more powerful representations of the past. Quintard Taylor presents a third version of western history, In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990 (1998). He offers a broad synthetic account that characterizes the experiences of African Americans over a very long period of time.

Drawing on a substantial body of scholarship, most of it published in the past quarter century, he aims to "reconstruct the history of African American women and men" in the West over five centuries, although mostly his focus is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Taylor's central themes are the quest for community by blacks and the relative degrees of freedom and opportunity they find in different times and places. The conjuncture of the map of African-American presence and the conventional history of the West that his story brings out compels rethinking of both African-American and western history. He makes the point, for example, that the issue of Texas independence in 1836 was not simply, as myth, even the more recent multicultural version, would have it: Anglos and Tejanos in Texas confronting a despotic government in Mexico. It was also an Anglo effort to preserve slavery.60 More broadly, the map literally reveals that African Americans in the West were overwhelmingly city and town dwellers, and it is that fact that unifies their experience. The kind of synthetic narrative that he has constructed provides an invaluable service at a particular moment, crystallizing a generation of scholarship, making generalization possible. His work not only informs the public of the dimensions of previously unrecognized histories, it also provides a base for the next generation of scholarship. In a similar way, another recent synthesis, one that focuses on a more narrowly defined but also more developed area of scholarship, reveals the harvest of recent scholarship on work and workers. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and Vhite Labor (1998) by Jacqueline Jones at once brings this rich scholarship to a wider audience and proffers a fresh way of framing the field.61 If The American West, In Search of the Racial Frontier, and American Work cover very long chronological spans, books by David M. Kennedy and Fred Anderson address short periods. Their focus is also quite different, since both concentrate on political and military history. Kennedy's Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) addresses what might well be called "high politics," while Anderson's The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 (2000) brings social history and high politics into fruitful play, finding in that interaction the terms of his central argument about the nature of power in the British Empire. At the outset, both books locate their stories in a broad international context. Kennedy's book begins at the close of World War I, and the first character introduced is Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler, who was in a military hospital recovering from a poison gas attack when he heard the news of Germany's surrender.

The geography of Washington, D.C., even that of the White House, and the biographies of three men-Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Hitler-are more important to Kennedy's story than the world beyond the borders of the United States or, for that matter, than the American people of his subtitle. One of Kennedy's aims is evidently to urge upon Americans a greater attention to and sense of responsibility in the larger world, yet with the exception of the excellent discussion of the differing explanations of the economic crisis offered by Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt, there is surprisingly little incorporation of inter- national elements into the dynamic of the story. For all the importance of the larger world, for Kennedy, as for many Americans, whether professional historians or not, the international is a sort of "other," something "over there," if I may reverse the title of one of Kennedy's earlier books.62 Kennedy- also pays little attention to social history, not even to social histories that have sought to better explain the politics of the interwar years.63 Nor does the book address intellectual history, the history of science and technology (except briefly in connection with war production), the states, education, urban history, and much more. In fact, the book would have been more accurately described by the title of William E. Leuchtenburg's classic, F.D.R. and the New Deal, 1932-1940, which is here superseded and extended into the war years.64 So titled, adding the war to the New Deal, one could have no objection to this extraordinarily well-written, deeply researched, and compellingly argued book. But is it a history of "the American people"? Freedom from Fear is a masterful narrative on the terms it has assumed for itself. Yet having said that, historiographical questions remain. Kennedy apparently assumes that three voices are the important ones; not many other voices are heard, even though each of a small clutch of additional figures is presented very effectively as a full human being: Lorena Hickok, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Raymond Moley, Herbert Hoover, John L. Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph, among a few others. History for Kennedy, unlike for the other authors of these syntheses, is made by select leaders, not by ordinary people. What is remarkable, therefore, is the illusion of synthesis that is achieved. The book was published in a series that promises narrative syntheses of the defining periods of American national history. Most so far published accept traditional definitions of periods, and they are framed as political history, but none is so severely restricted as this one, which won the Pulitzer Prize in part because it was recognized as a work of grand synthesis. Dramatic changes in the historiography of the American field make it seem anachronistic. Yet its success makes the point that political history in the grand [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 62 David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (New York, 1980).

Fred Anderson's Crucible of War again engages us with the question of elites and ordinary people, and it provides -a promising approach. While Kennedy seems quite confident of the importance of a few leaders, Anderson seems to be ambivalent, and that ambivalence enriches his history. Although I think the principal contribution of Crucible of War to our understanding of the British Empire is grounded in the social history of the political and military experience of ordinary Americans, the dramatic focus, as with Francis Parkman's great nineteenth-century narrative, is on two great leaders of the French and Indian War, the marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe.65 Yet, as Alan Taylor has insightfully insisted, Anderson has rewritten the story of their confrontation in a way that diminishes these actors, especially Wolfe.66 To be sure, Anderson's book goes beyond Parkman in its respect for Native Americans, their agency, and their role in the empire (and the role of the empire and war for them). He also modifies Parkman on a point that is central to the book's contribution to imperial history: unlike Parkman, Anderson not only notices but makes much of the division between English colonials and English metropolitans. These differences in expectation and experience make the war in his view a "theatre of intercultural interaction."67 Like Butler, Anderson seeks to diminish the role of 1776 in understanding the development of what became the United States. Historians, he argues, will better understand the creation of the United States by closely examining the Seven Years' War and, more generally, by challenging the usual tendency to "take as our point of reference the thirteen rebelling colonies, not the empire as a whole."68 Yet, even as he argues the importance of getting behind the Revolution of 1776 so that one can discover the eighteenth century as it was experienced, the revolution remains a touchstone for him. More than anything else, he wants the reader to recognize that the shots fired in the Seven Years' War were the ones with implications around the world. But he keeps de-historicizing his story to use it to diminish the shot of lesser implication (in his view) heard 'round the world in 1775. When one begins the book, there is a sense of excitement. Here is a history of the United States ready to take the globe as its context. Before the narrative even begins, the reader is presented with a portfolio of maps. Only two of eight describe the British colonies; no more than four of them consider North America at all. The portfolio begins with a world map, revealing the global distribution of the battles that marked the Seven Years' War. There are also maps of the Indian subcontinent, Central Europe, and the Caribbean. The introduction promises a book that will make the world, or at least the full extent of the British Empire, its context and subject. We are told that "if viewed from Montreal or Vincennes, St. Augustine, Havana, Paris or Madrid-or, for that matter Calcutta or Berlin-the Seven Years' War was far more significant than the War of American Independence."69 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 65 Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 6th edn., 2 vols.

We get very little of Asia (although Manila makes a brief but important comparative appearance), the Caribbean, Africa, and continental Europe. Of course, other European powers are part of the narrative, but they only have walk-on roles. We learn little of them at home or about the ways leaders or ordinary citizens interpret events, while we are, by contrast, led through elaborate accounts of high British politics. The preface, presumably written last, sketches an extraordinary agenda for what would be a stunning book. Unfortunately, Anderson did not write the book he there described. Still, judged in terms of what it did rather than what it proposed to do, it is an outstanding work of craft. It will no doubt be our generation's account of the Seven Years' War. As military history, it is superb, and it contributes importantly-but not so grandly as some of the opening rhetoric promises-to the non-controversial but still unclear issue of the causal relations that connect the Seven Years' War to the coming of the revolution. Anderson in fact offers a rich Anglo-centric narrative that explores and explains the different meaning of the war both as strategic event and as experience for the British of the metropole and in the colonies. It is written with verve and confidence-and a seemingly complete command of the materials, primary and secondary. One of its themes is the misperception of events by political elites; with the exception of William Pitt, surely Anderson's hero in this story, they fail to understand the different meaning of the war and empire for ordinary soldiers and colonial subjects. He thus makes cultural issues the heart of the book. Military and political elites play a dramatic role in the narrative, but causation for Anderson- and here he points to important newer developments in military and diplomatic history-is to be found in the culture of everyday life.70 In making this point, he not only offers an important interpretation of the war (building in part on his previous book on Massachusetts soldiers), he also reveals the empire to be less solid, more a matter of continuous negotiation, than historians often consider such entities, whether empires or nations or states.71 MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN ANDERSON, Ira Berlin, referring to the earliest history of Afro-European North America, and Daniel T. Rodgers, addressing the early twentieth century, incorporate the Atlantic, or at least the North Atlantic, into their narratives of American history. Berlin and Rodgers write very different kinds of history and focus on different periods. Berlin's is a social history, while Rodgers has written an intellectual history, or, perhaps, a history of political culture. Yet both Berlin and Rodgers recognize the complex webs that route movements-of people, of ideas, of money, of things-in the Atlantic world. The transnational terrains that Berlin and Rodgers evoke establish larger and truer frames for national histories than do notions of bounded and self-contained regions or nations.

Berlin's opening tableau describes the emergence of the Atlantic world as an ever- expanding historical terrain, where the African presence is pervasive on the sea and in the cities, including Lisbon, where they made up 10 percent of the population in the sixteenth century. He evokes a world defined by a network of cosmopolitan cities populated by creolized peoples. African people were not only omnipresent, they were often crucial cultural and economic brokers, helping to knit this new world together. Berlin lets go of this powerful frame and image in his later chapters, where he narrows the focus to regional difference within the bounds of British North America. Still, the book's protean beginning remains in the reader's mind, inviting others to realize its narrative logic and moral meaning.72 In Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998), Daniel T. Rodgers also achieves a richer historicism by expanding the space of analysis. One small indication is in the subtitle. He refers to "social politics," not the more usual "welfare state." His approach, examining relations in space as well as over time as fields of contingency, makes the welfare state a problematic common term. When he uses the more general and more mobile term "social politics," he effectively historicizes the concept, lineage, and practice of the welfare state. The development of a social politics has other possible paths and outcomes besides evolution into the national welfare state.73 The national welfare state thus becomes a historically and place-specific invention rather than a universal or, worse, the teleological endpoint of American liberal narratives-an endpoint surely upended by the politics of the last quarter of the twentieth century. Following the pioneering work of James T. Kloppenberg, who also assumed a Euro-American context for progressivism and social democracy, Rodgers ap- proaches this age of reform as at once a transnational and national issue.74 A variety of reforms-from urban planning to social insurance to regulation of capitalism- are examined as products both of general, transnational ideas and of particular, national political cultures. The complex narratives thus developed by Rodgers and Kloppenberg-ones that recognize, especially in the case of Rodgers, the historicity of the balance between national and transnational-are a major advance in the narrative synthesis of a national history. Both Rodgers and Kloppenberg impress on the reader that ideas could cross the Atlantic in either direction. This is salutary; American intellectual history is too often thought by Europeans and Americans as well to be either insignificant or derivative, not quite up to equal participation in an international world of ideas. This common point is handled differently in each book. While Kloppenberg notes [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 72 One hopes this extension of the historiographical terrain will continue and that connections as well as comparisons will be made between the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic and between the Atlantic slave trade and the slave trade that turned to the east, to the Muslim empires of the Mediterranean and today's Middle East. Big as it is, the Atlantic does not capture the logic and dimensions of slavery in this era. 73 See, for example, the argument (somewhat dependent on Rodgers's work) in Thomas Bender, "Cities, Intellectuals, and Citizenship in the United States: The 1890s and 1990s," Citizenship Studies 3 (1999): 203-20. 74 Daniel T. Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (Cambridge, Mass., 1998); James T. Kloppenberg, Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870-1920 (New York, 1986).

Rodgers, by contrast, focuses on the specific transit of ideas and emphasizes the way intellectuals and reformers on either side of the Atlantic drew selectively on these ideas, depending on personal taste and local circumstance. The result is a fundamental and valuable reorientation of the way we might understand intellectual history. The conceptual opening they have created invites a yet more radical under- standing of the territory and movement of ideas. Let me go back to the title of Rodgers's book. I think that "Atlantic Crossings" projects too narrow an under- standing of the implications of the book. It emphasizes the movement of people and ideas back and forth across the Atlantic. To that extent, it recalls a much older Anglo-American historiography of "trans-Atlantic influences."75 Rodgers goes well beyond this historiography in showing that, in important respects, Europe was partly Americanized and the United States was partly Europeanized by the phenomena he describes. But his really important accomplishment is to get away from the "influence" model, to displace the linear A to B notion of intellectual history. But he could have gone farther yet. There is more to the circulation of ideas than this framing recognizes. It is more than an Atlantic crossing, more than a link between Western Europe and the United States. The whole Atlantic, South Atlantic as well as North Atlantic, and, indeed, increasingly, parts of the Pacific world better describe the extent of the intellectual network his book evokes. In regard to urban development and reform, an important theme in Rodgers's book, it is clear that there is a global conversation at work. Rather than the linearity of steamship crossings (the dustjacket illustration) between the port cities of Western Europe and New York, I imagine a Great Bazaar of urban ideas, technology, and aesthetics hovering over the Atlantic, with many traders and buyers. This exchange is not, of course, symmetrical, and that itself is an issue, but participation was nearly global in 1900. Progressive ideas, especially those dealing with urban reform and technologies, traveled through many circuits and with different voltage, but nearly the whole world was connected, not only Western Europe and the United States. Simply look at the cities of Eastern Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, Central and East Asia. Surely, they were part of an international conception of urbanism-and of urban commercial culture. The remnants of the era make it clear that New York and Chicago, no less than Lyons, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Shanghai, were local instances of a global process of city-making. THESE LAST COMMENTS SUGGEST what I take to be the next challenge of narrative synthesis. But before I conclude, let me briefly review what has been accomplished by the cohort of synthetic histories considered here. These books reveal, even verify, the capacity of narrative synthesis to achieve inclusion and to respect issues of identity. Moreover, it seems possible in synthetic narratives to combine structure [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 75 See Frank Thistlethwaite, The Anglo-American Connection in the Early Nineteenth Century (Philadelphia, 1959).

The volumes here examined reveal many narrative strategies and quite different relations to a wider reading public. There is no single model, and no one volume (yet) does all the things we might fairly expect in a realized synthesis. In addition, these books, both in what they do and do not do, suggest to me the value of embracing a narrative core that is a more explicit and deeper exploration of democracy and difference, freedom and empowerment, contest and justice. Such a focus promises a sharper analytical history, one more historical and less susceptible to teleology, whether of modernity or anything else. It seems plausible to propose that a wider canvas, a supranational context, may in fact enhance the examination of these issues. The work of Hine and Faragher, Berlin, Gordon, and Rodgers in particular enables one to imagine an even more radical synthesis of national history, one that operates on multiple geographical scales, from narratives smaller than the nation to supra-national ones-thus identifying the nation as a product of history as well as an object of historical inquiry. Such a framing of national history will increase awareness of the complexity of the multiple axes of historical interaction, causation, and identity formation. While I mean these concluding comments to suggest an ambitious new agenda for the discipline, we must not overlook an already existing and compelling example. Decades ago, David Brion Davis embarked on a multivolume history that considered all these issues. He brought them together in his majestic synthesis that explores slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world, a history of nearly global reach that is also-and I emphasize this fact-a history of the United States.76 My point, then, is that such histories can be written, have been written, and I trust that more will yet be written. The present moment seems especially propitious for such histories. The relation of the nation to both subnational and transnational solidarities is very much in question. It is a public concern as well as an object of interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry. Historians surely have an open invitation to rethink the boundaries of national histories.77 Colonial historians have been moving in this direction for some time, redefining their field as the Atlantic world long before the globalization talk. Likewise, Rodgers and Ian Tyrrell, both of whom work on the modern period, moved in this direction fairly early and for a different reason: their concern about the claims of American exceptionalism.78 With these various concerns at work, we may fairly expect a movement of American historians and other historians as well toward a wider sense of their fields. National histories will not be so firmly bounded, and the assumption of their national autarky will be softened by the recognition that national histories are [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 76 David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966); The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (Ithaca, 1975), with the final installment yet to come. 77 See Bender, Rethinking American History in a Global Age; and Thomas Bender, The La Pietra Report (Bloomington, Ind., 2000), also available on the World Wide Web at www.oah.org/activities/ lapietra/index.html. 78 Ian Tyrrell, "American Exceptionalism in an Age of International History," AHR 96 (October 1991): 1031-55; Daniel T.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau. For reading the current essay, my particular thanks to Catherine Desbarats, Eric Jabbari, James Ron, and Michael Wasser, as well as to Tim Rowse, Desley Deacon, Ann Curthoys, and John Docker for helpful suggestions.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 437 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne political, economic, and cultural colonialism-fields the authors argue are in any case impossible to disaggregate.9 The programmatic claims that lend Of Revelation and Revolution its force also, however, cause some interesting tensions in the book. The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M. Larson, "'Capacities and Modes of Thinking': Intellectual Engagements and Subaltern Hegemony in the Early History of Malagasy Christianity," AHR 102 (October 1997): 969-1002; Richard Elphick and Rodney Davenport, eds., Christianity in South Africa: A Political, Social, and Cultural History (Berkeley, Calif., 1997); and many other works discussed in David Chidester, Judy Tobler, and Darrel Wratten, Christianity in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography (Westport, Conn., 1997). The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86.

This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76.

Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman.

Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word. Elizabeth Elbourne is an associate professor in the Department of History at McGill University, where she teaches British and South African history. She is also currently a visiting fellow in the History Program of the Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University. Her publications include Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (2002), as well as various articles, most recently "Domesticity and Disposession: British Ideologies of 'Home' and the Primitive at Work in the Early Nineteenth-Century Cape," in Wendy Woodward, Patricia Hayes, and Gary Minkley, eds., Deep Histories: Gender and Colonialism in Southern Africa (2002). She earned her D.Phil. in 1992 from the University of Oxford, under the supervision of Terence Ranger. Her major fields of interest include colonialism, gender, and religion, especially the early nineteenth- century British white settler empire and southern Africa. Her current work in progress explores the creation of networks around the idea of being "aborig- inal" in the early nineteenth-century British empire, and is focusing on links between New South Wales, the Cape Colony, New Zealand, and Canadian colonies as well as on activists in Great Britain. She is also writing on liberalism and Khoekhoe citizenship at the Cape. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 459 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]]<br>

Author(s): Reynolds,  Thomas E.<br>
Abstract: Theorizing for theory’s sake certainly has its place, and not every book needs to be focused on practical issues. Nonetheless, even the most gymnastic theoretician needs some grounding connection to relevant cases. Reynolds is profoundly uninterested in this level of analysis. While he flies through the theoretical air with great speed in
   The Broken Whole, it is unclear whether the book can make any sort of stable or decisive landing.<br>

Abstract: Ibid., p. 111. Even Riffaterre's approach to the structuring unsaid of textual writing can be seen to represent on its own terms a shift from the ontology of narrative toward its epistemology at the level of form rather than content. By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific
            truth:a story's immanent signifying patterns in their subtextual disclosure.<br>

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Author(s): Eades Caroline<br>
Abstract: Readers without solid background knowledge of French film and colonial history may have some difficulty navigating through Eades's tightly packed, allusive prose, especially since no index of any kind is provided. This absence is difficult to understand in a work of serious scholarship aimed at academic readers, as is the press's decision to invest in numerous glossy still‐frame illustrations that add nothing substantive to the analysis. However, the extensive, thematically organized filmographies and bibliographies that conclude the volume should prove very useful to all readers by providing a starting point for further reading and research.<br>

            Theodramatik(Einselden: Johannes, 1980), 3:363–78. Von Balthasar’s use of dramatic conceptuality seems to satisfy these demands by offering the Eucharist as a phenomenon that is surprising and free yet deeply imbedded within the economy of creation as a drama. Also of significance would be Bernd Wannenwetsch,Political Worship: Ethics for Christian Citizens, trans. Margaret Kohl (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004).<br>

Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Abstract: In sum: while it has it flaws, this book is one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date surveys of the field of theories of religion around. It is worth the cover price for that alone, which makes it definitely recommendable. Those who want to learn about the current state of theory, especially if they tend in the realist direction, will find this book very useful. Constructivists acquainted with theory will likely find it less so.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: Critchley uses the term in a discussion of Levinas and politics. Noting that government tends to become tyrannical when left to itself, Critchley commends the way Levinas’s ethical ideas can cultivate forms of “dissensual emancipatory praxis” that “work against the consensual idyll of the state, not in order to do away with the state or consensus, but to bring about its endless betterment” (“Five Problems in Levinas’s View of Politics,” 183).<br>

Abstract: This paper analyzes J. Habermas's theory of “universal pragmatics” and examines the extent to which Habermas's ideal speech community is predicted upon a specific type of relationship between the individual and society. The ability of the theory of universal pragmatics to overcome the form of domination institutionalized by modern societies is questioned, and the argument is made that Habermas's radical program of emancipation is vitiated (1) by Habermas's conflation of “transcendental” and “situationally engaged” enlightenment and (2) by Habermas's inability to reintegrate practical-emancipatory and technical forms of reason. Habermas's idea of “communicative competence” replicates, rather than displaces, the “modern” solution to the problem of the relationship between the individual and society.<br>

Abstract: This paper attempts to uncover the mytho-symbolic parallels between the social-psychological theories of noted sociologist W. I. Thomas and the vision of moral-religious transformation recorded in John Bunyan's "The Pilgrim's Progress." Thomas' emphasis on the "definition of the situation," precise stages of moral development, and the four wishes are seen to be derived from Bunyan's themes of spiritual instruction along Christian's journey, his progress through various stages of sanctification, and the various spiritual polarities established by Bunyan as structuring principles of his text. Thomas is understood to have distorted Bunyan's vision of ultimate transcendence by equating salvation with adoption of the Protestant ethic and its institutional context of the American political and economic status quo.<br>

Abstract: Notre analyse repose sur deux hypothèses générales complémentaires. La première hypothèse affirme l'existence non pas d'une crise de la pensée politique mais de trois situations critiques auxquelles doit faire face le pensée politique et qui déterminent des formes d'incertitude spécifiques, irréductibles les unes aux autres. La deuxième hypothèse affirme que l'intelligibilité des crises que connaît la pensée politique passe par celle des conditions politiques dans lesquelles s'exerce cette pensée. Pour préciser ces deux hypothèses nous faisons appel à un modèle construit à partir de la structure d'une action. Trois formes d'incertitude sont ainsi repérées: une incertitude concernant les valeurs, une incertitude concernant l'état des choses et une incertitude portant sur les voies d'action. Transposées sur le plan ou la dimension de la structure sociale, ces trois formes d'incertitude sont à saisir et à examiner respectivement comme crise au niveau du système de légitimation et de motivation, comme crise au niveau du système organisationnel ou des institutions et comme crise au niveau des stratégies ou système "opérationnel". Nous localisons la première forme de crise dans les sociétés du capitalisme "central", la deuxième dans les formations sociales socialistes et la troisième dans les sociétés du capitalisme "périphérique". A partir d'une analyse des conditions politiques qui ont rendu possible l'émergence de ces formes spécifiques de crise nous essayons de déterminer au moins certaines conditions nécessaires--mais non pas suffisantes--de leur dépassement. /// Two general complementary hypotheses underlie this analysis. The first contends that, although political science does not confront a crisis, it faces three critical challenges giving rise to uncertainty in the discipline. The second hypothesis asserts that to understand the present challenges testing political theory, it is necessary to relate the latter to the prevailing political context. To clarify the two hypotheses a model is presented, growing out of the structure of action. Three forms of uncertainty are thus identified, relating respectively to values, the state of affairs, and the means of action. These three uncertainties, seen in terms of social structure, are to be understood and examined in turn, in terms, respectively, of questions of legitimization and motivation, at the level of institutional and organizational arrangements, or with respect to strategy and "operational" systems. The first are identified in societies under a "central" capitalism, the second with socialist social organization, and the third with "peripheral" capitalism. On the basis of an analysis of political conditions which have facilitated the emergence of these specific forms of challenges, an effort is made to determine conditions which are necessary--but not sufficient--for these challenges to be dealt with.<br>

Abstract: The ways in which values are assimilated to social research differ according to the theoretical frame of reference informing the research. An example from the writings of E. Digby Baltzell illustrates how a moral commitment shaped his assumptions about the nature of the social matrix and his research strategies. A Western moral rhetoric fares well if the researcher chooses a methodologically individualist framework. The framework assists a moral rhetoric by providing it with concrete rather than abstract social actors and with a basis for explanation in terms of motive rather than situational forces. Along the way moral statements can appear in the form of empirical generalizations and historical laws. Should sociologists deem ethically neutral social research desirable, this study suggests that concentration on scientific method, without exploring the value bases for selecting a frame of reference, is not a promising approach. A value analysis, especially around Weber's "value relevance," may function propaedeuticly.<br>

Abstract: Conventionally, proposals to improve working relations between sociology and history have been interdisciplinary. The present essay advances an alternative approach-consolidation of sociohistorical inquiry as a transdisciplinary enterprise. All socio-historical inquiry depends on four elemental forms of discourse: discourse on values, narrative discourse, social theoretical discourse, and the discourse of explanation. Though inquiry is transdisciplinary in the problematics of these discourses, concrete methodology typically is oriented either toward theorization in relation to cases (historical sociology) or toward comprehensive analysis of a single phenomenon (sociological history). Varying the articulated relations among the four forms of discourse once for historical sociology and again for sociological history yields eight ideal typical strategies of inquiry. The four strategies of historical sociology include universal history, theory application, macro-analytic history, and contrast-oriented comparison. The parallel strategies for sociological history are situational history, specific history, configurational history, and historicism. These ideal types offer standard reference points that help clarify the underpinnings of a diverse range of scholarly practices.<br>

Abstract: Formative assessment has attracted increasing attention from both practitioners and scholars over the last decade. This paper draws on the authors' empirical research conducted over eleven years in educational situations ranging from infant schools to postgraduate education to propose a theorisation of formative assessment. Formative assessment is seen as taking place when teachers and learners seek to respond to student work, making judgements about what is good learning with a view to improving that learning. However, the theorisation emphasises formative assessment as being a discursive social practice, involving dialectical, sometimes conflictual, processes. These bring into play issues of power in which learners' and teachers' identities are implicated and what counts as legitimate knowledge is framed by institutional discourses and summative assessment demands. The paper argues that, rather than only paying attention to the content of learning, an ambition for formative assessment might be to deconstruct these contextual issues, allowing a critical consideration of learning as a wider process of becoming. The article suggests a model that might be useful to teachers and learners in achieving this.<br>

Abstract: In this article I consider "narrative mind reading," the practical capability of inferring the motives that precipitate and underlie the actions of others. Following Jerome Bruner, I argue that this everyday capacity depends on our ability to place action within unfolding narrative contexts. While Bruner has focused on narrative mind reading as a within-culture affair, I look to border situations that cross race and class lines where there is a strong presumption among participants that they do not, in fact, share a cultural framework. Instead, interactions often reinforce actors' perceptions of mutual misunderstanding and cultural difference. Drawing on a longitudinal study of African American families who have children with severe illnesses, I examine narrative mind reading and misreading in one mother's interactions with the clinicians who treat her child. I further explore how narrative misreadings are supported through chart notes and "familiar stranger" stories. The focus on miscommunication grounds a theory of the reproduction of cultural difference in interactive dynamics and brings Bruner's emphasis on narrative into dialogue with contemporary anthropology of cultural borderlands.<br>

Abstract: Although the Thai-Lao peasants living in rain-fed agricultural communities in northeastern Thailand have experienced some improvements in their socioeconomic situation as a consequence of the growth of the Thai economy since the mid-1950s, these peasants still constitute the poorest sector of the population of Thailand. Moreover, the socioeconomic position of the rural northeastern Thai populace has actually declined relative to that of the urban populace and that of the rural populace living in central Thailand. The economic disadvantageous position of Thai-Lao peasants is linked with a sense of being an ethnoregional minority within a polity that has been highly centralized since reforms instituted at the end of the nineteenth century. Much of the social action of Thai-Lao peasants with reference to the political-economic constraints on their world can be understood, as long-term research in one community reveals, as having been impelled by rational calculation aimed at improving the well being of peasant families. The ways in which peasants have assessed in practice the justice of these constraints as well as the ways in which they have assessed the limits to entrepreneurship must be seen, however, as being rooted in moral premises that Thai-Lao villagers have appropriated from Theravada Buddhism as known to them in their popular culture.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I try to show what kind of theory Giddens' theory of structuration is. I do so by first listing what Giddens accepts and what he rejects in his assessments of functionalism, hermeneutics, structuralism, and the writings of Marx. For what I think are good reasons, most of this part is given over to the use Giddens makes of Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy. Next I set out my understanding of Giddens' view of theory as primarily concerned "with reworking conceptions of human being and human doing, social reproduction and social transformation" (Giddens 1984:xx). I seek to show the crucial implications of this for the way that theory enters directly into and helps to consitute social life. Taken together, these two steps lead to the conclusion that Giddens' theory is neither an attempt at an over-arching "Grand Theory," nor an imposition of new orthodoxy in place of the old. Instead I suggest that his avowed eclecticism is closely akin to the hermeneutic goal contained in Gadamer's concept of the "fusion of horizons." This notion recognizes the never-to-be-completed, but basic, human activity of creatively questioning what has been handed down from the past. It is questioned so that it may be applied — incomplete as it is — to the changed situation of the present with its different interests and problems. That those who can and do question it are themselves the products of past tradition, calls for a kind of social theory that is in some ways different from that modeled on the explanatory "laws" of natural science. I contend that Giddens' theory of structuration is such a theory. (For an introductory overview of the theory itself, see Dickie-Clark, 1984).<br>

Abstract: This essay explores the suggestion that many American narratives are supplementary, correcting narratives — alternatives to the main story on offer. The guiding thought is that of Henry James's "possible other case," and the chief example is Cormac McCarthy's "No Country for Old Men," in which one story after another fails to cope with the ongoing mystery it faces. The novel may imply, then, that narrative itself, rather than any individual report or fiction, is in crisis or has come to the end of its road. A coda to the essay proposes the option of nonnarrative understandings of the world in those extreme situations where storytelling is no longer the sense-making activity we so often take it to be.<br>

Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining resources for re-establishing communication when the hermeneutic circle breaks down in a moment of misunderstanding.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in confusing motives with causes; irrationalism, which advocates a "liberté d'indifférence", basing itself on the same premise as rationalism, and confusing motives with causes, is wrong in seeing the negation of the very existence of motives as the one way of saving human freedom. Both views disregard the fact that human action is impossible and cannot be understood without motives and that this, in turn, does not mean a determination of man in a mechanical way, for motives are not a part of nature but rather an organic element in a specific human situation—voluntary action. Human freedom is the freedom peculiar to a finite being immersed in time. Both those who stress passivity and receptivity and those who stress the dynamic creating ability of the self are wrong; both those who thought that freedom is possible only on the basis of clear and distinct motives and that action is nothing but the end of deliberation (St. Thomas) and those who thought that freedom is possible only by an irrational emergence of the vital ego (Bergson) or by negating the existence of any previous determination of the self (Sartre) are mistaken. A true human decision is composed of two elements; given motives and values on the one hand, and non-intellectualist spontaneous choice on the other. Duality is peculiar to human action. This is made more explicit in dealing with the more fundamental involuntary elements; character, sub-consciousness and life. Man acts freely from a finite and determined point of view; he acts in a clear and transparent way on the basis of confused and amorphous data; he lives his freedom when thrown into life. Necessity is inherent in man; it is one of his modes of being. There is no "inner freedom" on the one hand and "objective" causal necessity on the other. This conception of human action as both activity and passivity is reminiscent of Merleau-Ponty's statement in his "Philosophie du perception": "Le monde est déjá constitué, mais aussi jamais complètement constitué.... Il n'y a donc jamais déterminisme et jamais choix absolu, jamais je ne suis chose et jamais conscience nue". There is no dilemna between determinism and irrationalism, just as there is none between extended substance and thinking substance; there is dialogue.<br>

Abstract: IN THIS ESSAY I CONSIDER POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF FEMINIST THEOLogy to theological aesthetics and ethics by comparing the work of Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905—88), the predominant figure in theological aesthetics, with that of Elizabeth Johnson and Sallie McFague. Balthasar's emphasis on contemplation and obedience in response to the unexpected revelation of God's glory contrasts with the practicality, mutuality, and creativity of feminist theological ethics. On the other hand, feminist theology's emphasis on appropriate language and images for God suggests an implicit aesthetics. The artistic work of contemporary African women in crisis situations sheds further light on both Balthasar and feminist theology and brings into relief the relationship of beauty and justice. Although Balthasar's emphasis on the transcendent glory of God may leave him with an undeveloped ethics, feminist theology's agent-oriented approach could benefit from greater attention to contemplation and a transformed understanding of obedience. These conclusions urge greater appreciation and development of the aesthetic and imaginative dimensions of feminist theological ethics.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues that a religious perspective on South African writing (the term is defined as including any cultural artefact, spoken or written, which uses language(s) as its main means of communication) is both fruitful and long overdue. The essay traces, or outlines, the general situation and lists some areas in which religious concerns, such as transformation, suffering and hope, poverty and marginality, can contribute to debates on South African writing. Some of these are further discussed.<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to examine the development of the notion of "The Other" and to trace the implications of its effect on the dialoguic Philosophy. In "I and Thou" this category was not developed, at best it was suggested only vaguely, for in this text Buber does not carry out any ontological explication of this category. But such an explication was necessary and was later formulated gradualy by Buber. The clearer the ontological explication, the sharper the category of "the Other" is delineated. It is this category which establishes the I-Thou relationship. This development is expressed in Buber's writings with great tension, and we analyze it in detail, for the category of "the Other" and the central position which it occupies undermine the significance of the I-Thou relationship as it is presented in the book "I and Thou". Together with an acceptance of the primacy of "the Other" in this relationship, we must also assert the primacy of the "I" as the subject of reflective action, of the recognition of the other in his otherness. In this situation it is not the relationship which comes first but the detachment and the aloneness which exist between the I and Thou. We now have to rewise the notion of the dialogue from that purety of an event without content to that of an action of mutual assertion between I and the Other, where each one asserts the other in his otherness, where at the same time each is conscious of being asserted by the Other.<br>

Abstract: J'ai remarqué que, dans les congrès, qu'ils soient médicaux, juridiques ou «psy », il est
fréquent d'entendre l'orateur parler du «père biologique», voire de vrai père pour désigner le
donneur de sperme... puis, se rendant compte de son lapsus au vu de quelques sourires dans la
salle, tâche de se rattraper - mal, comme dans toutes les gaffes - parlant alors de « père social »
pour désigner le vrai père, ce qui constitue tout autant un lapsus que le premier...<br>

Abstract: Attached for a long time to the illusion of its national "singularity", French philosophy has remained, for a good part of this century, closed to any foreign influence (with the exception of German phenomenology and existentialism). This situation started to change, however, in the early 1980's. From that moment on, the tendency to translate foreign philosophy has strongly increased among French publishers, allowing France to take a more active part in the international philosophical conversation. The French-American dialogue, in particular, is currently experiencing an expanding phase – but this recent trend must continue to be encouraged from both sides of the Atlantic.<br>

Abstract: Le présent article s'inscrit dans le prolongement d'une recherche en cours portant sur la compréhension et l'analyse des usages de jeux vidéo en ligne par des personnes en situation de handicap. En soulignant les apports épistémiques et méthodologiques d'une ethnographie en ligne, il pointe les limites heuristiques de la classique distinction entre un monde supposé réel qui se verrait redoublé par son pendant virtuel. L'exemple précis des jeux vidéo permet ici non seulement de questionner la dichotomie virtuel / réel mais aussi la définition traditionnelle du jeu élaborée à partir du modèle de la règle distincte de son effectuation concrète. L'analyse des pratiques ludiques de personnes en situation de handicap pointe enfin la nécessité d'une attention portée sur les modes d'appropriation corporelle d'un dispositif techno-communicationnel. En conséquence, il s'agit d'envisager les formes d'expériences vidéo-ludiques comme des « instances de procuration » autorisant l'exploration sensible de mondes moins disjoints les uns des autres qu'en interaction constante. This article is a continuation of ongoing research to understand the uses of online gaming by people with physical disabilities. By emphasizing the epistemic and methodological contributions of online ethnography, it points to the heuristic limits of the traditional distinction between a supposedly real world and that which would be repeated in the virtual. The specific use of video games in this example, makes it possible not only to question the virtual–real dichotomy, but also to question the traditional definition of the game which starts from the premise that the rule is distinct from its concrete execution. Analysis of the recreational practices of disabled people also points to the need for attention to modes of bodily appropriation of techno-communication devices. In the end, it is a question of considering video entertainment experiences like "instances of proxy," authorizing the sensitive exploration of worlds that are less disconnected and instead are in constant interaction.<br>

Abstract: Si comme Foucault lui-même le souligne, la question de la vérité occupe dans
toute sa recherche une place à différents égards cruciale (Foucault 1994 III : 30-
31, IV : 693), ce n'est qu'à partir des années 1980 qu'elle devient ensemble à
la problématique du sujet la préoccupation principale du philosophe. En effet,
déjà dans ses recherches sur la sexualité, Foucault s'est intéressé à une forme
particulière d'assujettissement à l'œuvre dans la pastorale chrétienne et qui sera
par la suite un modèle exemplaire pour les actions disciplinaires (Foucault 1994
III: 256-257, IV: 125-129, 148, 383-385, 783-788). Le sujet est contraint
d'avouer la vérité sur sa vie la plus intime, et notamment celle sexuelle, « pour
mieux renoncer à lui-même et se soumettre à son directeur de conscience » (Granjon
2005 : 42). Il s'agit d'un processus de formation du sujet dans un rapport à soi
aliéné. Selon FOUCAULT (1994 III : 551), ce modèle de formation du sujet est à
l'œuvre également dans « toutes les grandes machines disciplinaires : casernes,
écoles, ateliers et prisons [...] qui permettent de cerner l'individu, de savoir ce
qu'il est, ce qu'il fait, ce qu'on peut en faire, où il faut le placer, comment le
placer parmi les autres ». En 1980 lors d'une leçon au Collège de France pour
le cours intitulé « Du gouvernement des vivants », Foucault (2012 : 80-81) refor-
mule la question de la formation du sujet dans les termes de « régimes de vérité ».
Les années 1980 représentent un tournant dans les orientations analytiques du
philosophe. Dans un article paru en 1981, FOUCAULT (1994 IV : 693) annonce son
projet de recherche à venir, toutefois interrompu par sa mort prématurée. Il
reviendra à plusieurs reprises sur ce changement de thème directeur en essayant
aussi de montrer qu'il était sous-jacent dans ses recherches antérieures.<br>

Abstract: Evoquant l'habitude, Ricœur constate qu'elle donne une histoire au
caractère : « une histoire dans laquelle la sédimentation tend à recouvrir et, à la
limite, à abolir l'innovation qui l'a précédée [...]. C'est cette sédimentation qui
confère au caractère la sorte de permanence dans le temps que j'interprète ici
comme recouvrement de Y ipse par l'idem ». In Soi-même comme un autre,
Paris, Seuil, 1990, p. 146.
L'ipseque Philippe Corcuff synthétise comme « la part subjective de l'identité
personnelle » (« Figures de l'individualité, de Marx aux sociologies
contemporaines », Espacestemps.net, web : http://www.espacestemps.net/
documentl390.html, 2005, non paginé) renvoie à la possibilité de n'être que
partiellement investi dans un rôle. On glisse ici du caractère à l'appartenance
pour amener cette idée d'un retrait ou d'une déprise de l'identité stabilisée
autour de symboles rigides en faveur de moments de mise en avant d'une
identité personnelle répondant à un besoin d'individualisation.<br>

Abstract: Ernst Troeltsch distinguished between naive, apologetic and evolutionistic absoluteness.
From the original spontaneity of 'naive absoluteness' and its artificial (partly super-
naturalistic, partly rationalistic) defence as 'apologetic absoluteness' (in the Middle Ages and
in the Enlightenment, respectively) there came forth in Hegel the idea of 'evolutionistic
absoluteness' — an ingenious but untenable attempt to reconcile the solid apologetic
conception of absoluteness of that day with the dynamics of history by presenting it as the
outcome and terminus of historical progression. See Troeltsch, Die Absolutheit des Christen-
tums, 87ff. Cf. J. Klapwijk, Tussen historisme en relativisme, 222-29. At present the belief in
progress and thus also the mix of it with the idea of absoluteness is no longer a subject of
discussion.<br>

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-
versed version of the structural features of evil. Resolving the evil I do toward the other re-
quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: Broad definitions are often used in Christian apologetics. One example: 'Everyone has a
worldview. Whether or not we realize it, we all have certain presuppositions and biases that
affect the way we view all of life and reality. A worldview is like a set of lenses which taint our
vision or alter the way we perceive the world around us.' (http://christianworldview.net/,

Abstract: Much light can be shed on events which characterize or underlie scandals at firms such as Enron, Arthur Andersen, Worldcom, ImClone, and Tyco by appealing to the notion of ethical distance. Various inquiries have highlighted the difficulties in finding or identifying particular individuals to blame for particular events, and in the context of situations as complex as these it can sometimes be helpful to investigate the comparative ethical distance of various participants in these events. In this essay I offer a characterization of ethical distance in terms of moral responsibility, and in doing so I describe and illustrate the rough inverse correlation between moral distance and degrees of moral responsibility. I urge that the concept of ethical distance is capable of shedding light upon situations in which several people are involved in bringing about a state of affairs. I then argue that moral responsibility cannot do justice to all situations involving ethical distance. When the distance between a person and a state of affairs grows sufficiently large, a different type of treatment is called for, and I introduce the notion of moral taint to describe the moral status of agents in these situations.<br>

Abstract: On September 11, 2001, the passengers and crew members aboard Flight 93 responded to the hijacking of their airplane by organizing a counterattack against the hijackers. The airplane crashed into an unpopulated field, causing no damage to human lives or national landmarks beyond the lives of those aboard the airplane. We draw on this story of courageous collective action to explore the question of what makes this kind of action possible. We propose that to take courageous collective action, people need three narratives-a personal narrative that helps them understand who they are beyond the immediate situation and manage the intense emotions that accompany duress, a narrative that explains the duress that has been imposed upon them sufficiently to make moral and practical judgments about how to act, and a narrative of collective action-and the resources that make the creation of these narratives feasible. We also consider how the creation of these narratives is relevant to courageous collective action in more common organizational circumstances, and identify how this analysis suggests new insights into our understanding of the core framing tasks of social movements, ways in which social movement actors draw on social infrastructure, the role of discourse and morality in social movements, the formation of collective identity, and resource mobilization.<br>

Abstract: From the beginning of his career, sixteenth-century playwright Angelo Beolco (also known as Ruzante, the name of the peasant character he created and played) declared his anguish at the worsening of the peasants' economic and political position. Illegitimate child of the authoritarian patriarch of a minor noble family beginning its decline and (probably) a household servant likely of peasant origin, he appears to have identified with the peasants' exclusion from governing institutions and the blocking of their access to wealth. At first, the Evangelical reform movement, with its emphasis on justice for the poor, appealed to him as an effective instrument for persuading the powerful to correct the situation. That hope having proved illusory, Beolco passed through a rapid evolution of beliefs that calls into question Lucien Febvre's theory of the parameters of religious experience in the Renaissance. The present article explores this evolution.<br>

Abstract: How places are made is at the core of human geography. Overwhelmingly the discipline has emphasized the economic and material forces at work. Neglected is the explicit recognition of the crucial role of language, even though without speech humans cannot even begin to formulate ideas, discuss them, and translate them into action that culminates in a built place. Moreover, words alone, used in an appropriate situation, can have the power to render objects, formerly invisible because unattended, visible, and impart to them a certain character: thus a mere rise on a flat surface becomes something far more-a place that promises to open up to other places-when it is named "Mount Prospect." The different ways by which language contributes toward the making of place may be shown by exploring a wide range of situations and cultural contexts. Included in this paper are the contexts of hunter-gatherers, explorers and pioneers, intimate friendship, literary London, Europe in relation to Asia, and Chinese gardening and landscape art. There is a moral dimension to speech as there is to physical action. Thus warm conversation between friends can make the place itself seem warm; by contrast, malicious speech has the power to destroy a place's reputation and thereby its visibility. In the narrative-descriptive approach, the question of how and why language is effective is implied or informally woven into the presentation, but not explicitly formulated or developed. Ways of making place in different situations-from the naming of objects by pioneers, to informal conversation in any home, to the impact of written texts-are highlighted and constitute the paper's principal purpose, rather than causal explanations, which must vary with each type of linguistic behavior and each situation.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines the correspondence between Beckett and Duthuit in the light of the unpublished notes that Beckett took in Germany in 1936-37. The underlying issue that Beckett's reflections on the image seems to address is the reorientation of his creative writing and the development of a new aesthetic. There is, when Beckett is confronted to an image, a double movement that can be discerned in the way he beholds the image, of fascination, first, but also of mistrust towards this painting. In stripping paintings of their narrative of figurative intention, Beckett's comments seem to aim at a situation of mankind in the world, apprehended outside of all preoccupations with its causes or as the effect of an absent cause. Cette contribution examine la correspondance entre Beckett et Duthuit et cherche à la mettre en perspective avec les notes inédites que Beckett prend en Allemagne (1936-37). L'enjeu indirect des réflexions de Beckett sur le problème de l'image, c'est la réorientation de son écriture, le développement d'une esthétique nouvelle. Il y a chez Beckett un double mouvement, de fascination, mais aussi de méfiance, face à l'image. En dépouillant ces peintures de leur charge narrative ou figurative, les commentaires de Beckett semblent viser une situation de l'homme, appréhendée en dehors de toute cause ou comme l'effet d'une cause absente.<br>

Kolbe (1894-1941), son capaces e dar su vida por otros, sin pedir nada a cambio, sin furia y sin rencor, tan sólo porque su idea de Dios omprende a la humanidad. Kolbe murió en un «búnker de inanición» del campo de exterminio de uschwitz. Entregó voluntariamente su vida a cambio de la de otro prisionero que era padre de familia. l suplicio del hambre (inanición absoluta) duró catorce días, en los que fallecieron seis condenados; uego, una inyección letal liquidó a los tres moribundos restantes, que «tardaban» demasiado. Así acabó olbe. La pena se dictó como castigo colectivo por la fuga de otro preso del bloque

Abstract: In the context of the family’s crisis, in addition to the marital failures that produce suffering and inconvenience, there are biases due to controversies, ideological interests and opinions, which originate general and simplistic solutions to complex problems with peculiar characteristics. The article, – according to the commitment of the Holy Father Francisco to mitigate the heavy burden of people in “irregular” unions (where situations of fragility or misery improve stigma of exclusion) – try demonstrate the continuity of the Magisterium Pontifical Council, in which
         Amoris Laetitiaand the reform of the canonical matrimonial process were inserted. Through the study of the answers and the search for solutions that are careful to the hierarchy of truths, the Holy Father pointed out: “to generate personal and personalized processes”; to follow paths of reflection and discreet understanding the conditions of each case; ultimately, to help progress guided by a logic of forgiveness and reconciliation, according to a merciful and encouraging pastoral care. Sacraments and consciences, both sacred, require to be served with truth.<br>

Abstract: Dans cette perspective, toute pratique de lecture
peut être décrite comme un mouvement en trois temps :
«avant lire »/«lire »/«après lire». Des «intérêts
à la lecture » qui trouvent leur origine dans la situation
du lecteur - « avant lire » - incitent à un « faire » - « lire » -
qui porte à conséquences, immédiates ou différées
- «après lire» - et qui consolident en retour les «intérêts
à la lecture ». L'accent mis classiquement sur la seconde
phase (« lire ») - qui est aussi la plus difficilement
accessible à l'enquête - est alors déplacé sur les deux autres.<br>

Abstract: An existential-phenomenological description of everyday consumer experiences of contemporary married women with children is offered. An idiographic case study provides a thick description of this phenomenon and illustrates the hermeneutic process used in the interpretation. Following the case study, three interpretive themes are presented as mutually related aspects of an experiential gestalt that is shaped by the contextual ground of participants' life-world situations. Viewed holistically, the thematic aspects exhibit several dialectical relations that can be understood in terms of the emergent meaning of free choice. The applicability of this experiential gestalt to other life-world contexts is discussed.<br>

Abstract: Particular problems are posed in the study of lives since the course of life may be less continuous and predictable than sometimes assumed. Further, the most important aspect of developmental study may be the subjectively constructed narrative of development, or life history, which itself changes over personal and historical time. Following the interpretive approach pioneered by Dilthey, Weber, Freud, and, more recently, Ricoeur, Taylor, and others, lives may be considered as texts to be studied in a systematic manner. The concept of empathy as formulated within the clinical situation, and applied most recently to study of biography, may also foster understanding of changes over time in the life history.<br>

Abstract: Reflections by scientists, philosophers and sociologists upon the role of science as the motor of modern history show that apocalyptics can be interpreted neither as irrationalism nor as rhetorical, emphatic speech. Speaking out of the imagination, apocalyptics takes the form of a discourse that is hypercritical of and the least inexact about science, whenever scientific successes have rendered the habitual distinction between reality and model untenable. The imaginary realm of apocalyptics follows upon utopia and science fiction. However it has to be separated from "catastrophism". The latter still takes science to be a messiah because its idea of scientific develop. ment conceals favorable future effects underneath presentday catastrophic consequences. By refusing to separate intentions and effects and by objectifying science as a "totalizing" power, apocalyptics, on the other hand, leads to an irreversible situation that identifies history and destiny. Not only the semantic contents of the apocalyptic discourse are examined but also its "pragmatic" value is weighed. Its paradoxical declarations assume the form of a discourse whose proclamation has a meaning-an instituting scope-that literally contradicts its content, the proclaimed "non-sense" of science.<br>

Abstract: Gérard Genette's Narrative
Discourse:
I propose, without insisting on the obvious reasons for my choice of terms, to
use the word story for the signified, or narrative content (even if this content
turns out, in a given case, to be low in dramatic intensity or fullness of incident),
to use the word narrative for the signifier, statement, discourse or narrative text
itself, and to use the word narrating for the producing narrative action and, by
extension, the whole of the real or fictional situation in which that action takes
place. (27)<br>

Abstract: The authors outline a sociology of narrative-an analysis of the role of narrative in various social contexts, including academic sociolegal scholarship. Narratives are social acts that depend for their production and cognition on norms of performance and content that specify when, what, how, and why stories are told. Because narratives are situationally produced and interpreted, they have no necessary political or epistemological valence but depend on the particular context and organization of their production for their political effect. The analysis specifies the variable conditions that produce hegemonic tales-stories that reproduce existing relations of power and inequity-and subversive stories-narratives that challenge the taken-for-granted hegemony by making visible and explicit the connections between particular lives and social organization.<br>

Abstract: The recent turbulent events in the Middle East indicate the importance and the challenges of uniting citizens in each of these countries in some commonly known story of who they are and from whence they have come. A consciously constructed sense of collective history is one especially fertile ground from which stories of national identity can be drawn. This article interprets a set of symbols displayed in a political drama in one particular Turkish small town. Following Ricoeur's analyses of ideology, it shows how sentiments of national identity are created and maintained in seemingly small ways. The symbols and processes which affirm identity, however, concomitantly disguise and distort other expressions of the historic situation. Although distortions may be the result of benign processes of signification, they may also be manipulated to favor the needs and desires of persons and groups which seek to maintain power and influence.<br>

Author(s): Zuck W. Widick<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the professionalization of religious research in the United States and related topics. Because professional societies illumine value orientations and practices among workers in a given field, the nature of the American Catholic Sociological Society, the American Society of Christian Ethics, the Religious Research Association, and the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion are briefly considered. The differential appropriation of religious research in various ecclesiastical bodies, the problem of funding religious research in the American situation, and the shift in emphasis from a pragmatic problem-solving approach focused on institutional survival to a more theoretical approach to the understanding of religious phenomena are discussed. The bifurcation between persons interested in religious research trained under theological faculties and those trained under social science faculties is noted. Likely future lines of development in theory and research are projected.<br>

Abstract: An account of character is developed on the basis of Ricoeur's philosophy of the will. Particular attention is paid to the role of the bodily involuntary in the process of character-formation. This augments the interpretation of the moral meaning of sanctification developed by Hauerwas. When interpreted in light of corporeality, sanctification entails not only a perceptual transformation but also an affective change in the agent's value orientation, the competent retraining of the agent's emotions, and the gracious triggering of an adoptive disposition toward the agent's incarnate situation. Finally, the rootedness of character in embodiment, with the attendant problem of automatism, indicates the limits of the usefulness of an "ethics of character" for moral theology.<br>

Abstract: The essay sets forth a historical style in ethics. At the center is the explication of meanings forming the life worlds of representative actors in concrete situations. The sense of life world is sketched in terms of intentionality, intersubjectivity, temporality and embodiment. The essay then delineates the kinds of interpretative activity relevant for understanding life situations: the application of received conventions; suspicion of those conventions as distortions of underlying personal/social dynamics; and a dialectical interplay between a retrieval of one's own traditions, and hospitality to understandings of others differently oriented to the situations in question. The goal is the achievement of common ground which enables us to determine "fitting" action, or at least to keep open the wholeness it promises.<br>

Abstract: Vico maintained that metaphor is a fundamental process of human mental life which bridges the gap between emotion and cognition. This Vichian perspective is reflected in areas of critical theory treating metaphor and other tropes, particularly their use in narrative. In psychology too, the significance of metaphor is increasingly recognized despite the Cartesian emphasis on literal thought and language in contemporary psychology's central paradigm, cognitive science. The paper compares the Cartesian and Vichian perspectives and suggests that the former limits the integrated treatment of cognition and emotion. This is illustrated with an example of how a child's feelings about a distressing situation are both revealed and changed in storytelling. The Vichian perspective is more appropriate to understanding this therapeutic interaction of cognition and emotion through metaphoric narrative play. This perspective has significant echoes in psychoanalytic and textual studies suggesting how sensitivity to the latent content of narrative metaphors offers both speaker and hearer a unique insight into the experience of the narrator.<br>

Author(s): Fink-Jensen Kirsten<br>
Abstract: In this paper Kirsten Fink-Jensen suggests how a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective can contribute to the knowledge of learning and teaching processes in music education in school The philosophical frame is Danish philosophy of life, represented by Knud Ejler Løgstrup, and Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of body, both pointing to the wholeness of mind and body in all kinds of actions. Within this framework interpretation is an epistemological, practical-hermeneutic activity based on different analytical methods. Phenomenologically, experiences of music are constituted in an intertwinement of personal, cultural, and local meaning. The challenge facing the teacher is then to understand what becomes meaningful to persons in a given situation. 'Bodily dialogue' is a metaphor of a hermeneutic process of understanding that highlights the importance of bodily aspects in the teacher's answer to a child's musical attuned articulations. This focus can facilitate children's learning processes and change and qualify the teacher's didactic reflections on the impact and progression of music lessons.<br>

Abstract: The critical discourse on U.S. military detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib prison has been dominated by Weberian-style arguments (a bureaucracy gone wrong, insufficient or badly applied administrative rules, or individuals acting as cogs in a machine). We argue that Michel Foucault's "security apparatus" provides a more insightful model for understanding the Abu Ghraib phenomenon. According to this model, the prison becomes a nodal point in an information-gathering nexus confronting unforeseen, emergent, and unclear events, a place where power is less disciplinary than improvisational, exercised through practical judgments about uncertain situations. The performance of such power at Abu Ghraib included the use of photography and acts that, we claim, resemble M. M. Bahktin's negative carnivalesque.<br>

Abstract: L'auteure présente un outil d'exploration des situations sociales : l'arrêt sur image. Elle revient sur ses diverses contraintes techniques et méthodologiques et démontre leur intérêt au sein d'une enquête inspirée par la sociologie de l'action. C'est en tenant compte de la temporalité des actions humaines que l'image semble pouvoir évoluer d'un rôle d'illustration à celui d'outil d'analyse. En passant indifféremment d'image animée à image statique, l'enregistrement vidéo permet un choix de séquences filmées et une lecture multiple des contextes observés. Il aide à suivre finement les activités des acteurs, et à mettre en évidence la différence entre les normes du groupe et celles de l'individu. The author présents a tool for explorating social situations : freezing on the frame. She evokes its various technical and methodological limits and shows its interest for a survey inspired by action sociology. By taking into account the temporality of human actions the image can be more than illustrative and become an analysis tool. By passing indiscriminately from an animated image to a static one video recording permits a sélection of filmed séquences and a multiple reading of the observed contexts. It helps to follow minutely the actors' activities and to show the différence between group norms and individual norms. Die Autorin stellt ein Beobachtungsmittel der sozialen Lagen dar : das Standbild. Sie beschreibt seine verschiedenen technischen und methodologischen Beschränkungen und zeigt sein Interesse für eine von der Handlungssoziologie inspirierten Erhebung. Durch die Berücksichtigung der Zeitlichkeit der Menschenhandlungen ist das Bild mehr als illustrativ und kann zum Analysemittel werden. Beim unterschiedslosen Übergehen von einem belebten zu einem statischen Bild bietet die Videoaufnahme eine Auswahl von gefilmten Bildfolgen und ein vielfaches Lesen der beobachteten Kontexten. Sie hilft dazu, den Unterschied zwischen Gruppennormen und individualen Normen hervorzuheben.<br>

Abstract: Cet article examine le concept de la performativité du don dans une communauté côtière ethniquement diversifiée, composée majoritairement d'autochtones sames et de Norvégiens. Inspirée par Mauss puis par Ricœur, l'auteure avance l'idée que la pratique du don revêt une importance capitale dans ces territoires isolés et peut être vue comme facteur d'émergence d'un sentiment de communauté et d'identité. Le don devient un acte performatif de relations et d'ethnicité, et une manière d'aborder la situation postcoloniale dans la région. This article addresses the performativity of the gift in an ethnically mixed coastal community, the population being predominantly indigenous Saami and Norwegian. Taking inspiration from Mauss and later Ricœur, my argument is that giving is highly important in these remote areas and can be seen as a way of creating community as well as identity. The gift becomes an act of performing relations as well as ethnicity and a way of approaching the postcolonial situation in the region. Das Konzept der Performativität des Gebens innerhalb einer ethnisch gemischten Gemeinschaft (Norweger und Samen) an der Küste Norwegens steht im Mittelpunkt dieses Artikels. Inspiriert durch die Theorien von Mauss und Ricœur verfolgt der Autor die Idee, dass das Geben eine wichtige Funktion in isolierten Gemeinschaften übernimmt und zum Aufkommen eines Gefühls von Gemeinschaft und Identität beiträgt. Das Geben wird zu einem performativen Akt unter den Ethnien und zu einer Mittel mit der postkolonialen Situation der Region umzugehen. Artikkelen adresserer gavens performativitet i etniske sammensatte kystsamfunn bestående av samisk og norsk befolkning. Inspirert av Mauss og Ricœur blir det argumentert for at å gi gaver ; er viktig i disse samfunnene og kan ses som konstituerende i forhold til både fellesskap og identitet. Gavebytte er handlinger som relasjoner gjøres gjennom og adresserer etnisk ambivalens, i tillegg til à være tilnærmingsmåter til den postkoloniale situasjon i region.<br>

Abstract: Au Brésil, le récit officiel concernant la mémoire de l'esclavage différe nettement de la vision des leaders du mouvement noir contemporain, notamment à propos de la situation et des conditions de vie des Afro-Brésiliens à Rio de Janeiro. Ce mouvement demande à l'État et à la société brésilienne de reconnaître les conditions misérables dans lesquelles les esclaves ont été laissés après l'abolition de l'esclavage, mais aussi la contribution des esclaves à la construction de la société, de l'économie et de la culture brésiliennes et enfin le racisme dont les Afro-Brésiliens sont encore l'objet. Aujourd'hui, des décisions juridiques tendent à favoriser une égalité effective, permettant ainsi l'émergence d'une image positive de la culture afro-brésilienne. This article discusses the difference between the official account on the memory of slavery in Brazil and how contemporary black movement's leaders, notably in Rio de Janeiro, see the Afro-Brazilians' situation and living conditions. This movement, which seeks to reveal in public space the memory of slavery and its consequences, claims Brazilian State and society to recognize not only the miserable conditions under which former slaves were left after the abolition of slavery, but the contribution of the slaves to the construction of Brazilian society, economy and culture and also that Afro-Brazilians are still the object of racism. If in today's Brazil, the public debate on reparations comprises a legal aspect of rectification, by creating measures aiming to provide effective equality, this discussion also takes the form of symbolic fight, in which one of the objectives is to build a positive image of the Afro-Brazilian culture. In Brasilien weicht die offizielle Berichterstattung über die Wahrnehmung der Sklaverei vor allem in Bezug auf die Situation und Lebensbedingungen der Afro-Brasilianer in Rio de Janeiro stark ab von der Sichtweise der Führer der zeitgenössischen « Schwarzen-Bewegung ». Die Bürgerbewegung fordert von der brasilianischen Regierung und Gesellschaft die Anerkennung der schlechten Lebensbedingungen unter denen die Menschen seit der Abschaffung der Sklaverei leben. Sie verlangen ebenso die Einbeziehung der ehemaligen Sklaven in den gesellschaftlichen, wirtschaftlichen und kulturellen Prozess sowie die Anerkennung des Rassismus, dem Afro-Brasilianer noch immer zum Opfer fallen. Die derzeitige Rechtsprechung scheint eine tatsächliche Gleichheit zu fördern und trägt so zur Entwicklung eines zunehmend positiven Bildes der afro-brasilianischen Kultur bei.<br>

Abstract: Partant du constat que les faits sociaux de mémoire sont portés par des actes de communication, il s'agit ici de dégager les pratiques qui alimentent les formes de « l'agir » socio-mémoriel, aujourd'hui présent en France et ailleurs. Quels processus sont a l'œuvre dans des situations post-génocidaires, souvent aussi post-migratoires, comme dans la Shoah (« Khurbn » en yiddish) par exemple ? Dans le cas d'Ashkénazes, il s'agit d'une reinscription qualitative au sein des cartographies de la parenté, mais aussi d'une reconnexion avec des périodes antérieures au genocide et à l'ethnocide à travers des événements culturels. Since the work of memory cannot exist without inter-subjective exchanges, this paper introduces in the study of memory the concept of « social acting » created by Weber. Attempting to point out the plurality of the practices that feed the various forms of socio-memorial movements present today in France and elsewhere. Which are the processes taking on a very particular aspect in post-genocidal as in post-migratory situations such as after the Shoah (Khurbn in Yiddish) ? In the case of the Ashkenase, these processes are also post-ethnocide and consist in a qualitative re-inscription within genealogical mapping and simultaneously in the long development of a history in which the genocide constitutes a memorial screen as well as actions of re-inscribing and re-connecting with cultural markers associated to periods antedating the genocide and ethnocide. Da Erinnerungsarbeit nicht ohne das Betrachten von zwischenmenschlichem Austausch und sozialer Praxis erfolgen kann, soll im Rahmen dieses Artikels das Webersche Konzept des « Sozialen Handelns » in die Untersuchung von Erinnerungen einbezogen werden. Ausgehend von der Tatsache, dass soziale Erinnerungen durch Kommunikation ausgedrückt werden, möchte dieser Artikel die Vielfalt der Praktiken zeigen, die heute in Frankreich und anderswo die Vielzahl der gesellschaftlichen Erinnerungsbewegungen prägen. Die Erinnerungsprozesse verdeutlichen vor allem die soziale und zeitliche Beziehung zum Anderen. Besonders interessant zu analysieren ist sind Post-Shoah-(Khurbn auf Jiddisch) und Post-Auswanderungs-Erinnerungenen. In diesem Artikel richtet sich das Augenmerk vor allem auf Ashkenasische Juden aus Deutschland, Zentral-und Osteuropa, deren Situation nach dem Ethnozid betrachtet wird. Dabei ist eine qualitative Wiederaufnahme der Lebenspraxis der Elterngeneration zu beobachten ; ebenso wie ein Anknüpfen im Rahmen bestimmter kultureller Riten an die Zeit vor dem Völkermord.<br>

Abstract: Que ce soit à l'IUFM ou à l'Université en Sciences de l'Éducation, les enseignants sont de plus en plus confrontés à la diversité des expériences des parcours de formation des étudiants à qui ils s'adressent. Cette pluralité n'impose-t-elle pas un changement des pratiques de formation et notamment le développement, dans les groupes de travail, d'une communication favorisant la symbiose des divers apports culturels de ces étudiants ? L'utilisation des biographies ou des histoires de vie en formation ne peut-elle pas permettre d'instrumenter ce travail et notamment faciliter la prise en compte des itinéraires individuels de formation ? The students are more specifically invited to meditate on the development of their curriculum. The building of their formative biography creates the mental space that is needed to question the ideas and notions which will allow them to use biography as an instrument to identify the mental representations as well as the events and situations of their life from which the individual, collective, social and cultural dimensions of their activities emerged. In this sense, this research and training shows that formative life history can allow us to distance ourselves from a priori assumptions, as well as introduce students to different methods of research.<br>

Abstract: À partir d'une définition de l'éducation comme « relation dissymétrique, nécessaire et provisoire, visant à l'émergence d'un sujet », la pédagogie est proposée comme effort pour penser cette activité dans des situations données. Refusant une posture philosophique qui décrète l'existence du sujet pour le faire advenir, comme une attitude inspirée des sciences humaines qui abolit le sujet en réduisant ses actes à la résultante des forces qui s'exercent sur lui, la pédagogie peut se définir comme « anticipation contextualisée ». Dans cette perspective, elle requiert un discours qui exprime la singularité des sujets en situation et la mette en perspective d'universalité. Le récit peut avoir cette fonction et « faire théorie » sans, pour autant, s'abstraire des situations particulières qu'il décrit. La pédagogie comme « récits d'éducation » a alors pour fonction de favoriser la prise de décision éducative. Education being defined as "a dissymetric, necessary and temporary relation focusing on the emergence of a subject", pedagogy is considered as an endeavour to think this activity in given situations. If we refuse a philosophical position which decides the existence of a subject to make it turn into a reality - as an attitude inspired by human sciences which reduces the subject's acts to the resultant of forces exerced on him - pedagogy may be defined as a "contextualized anticipation". In this perspective, we must display the uniqueness of subjects in a specific situation and set it in a universal perspective. Narratives may have this function without neglecting the specificity of situations. Pedagogy as "narratives on education" is able to facilitate educational decision making.<br>

Abstract: Les processus complexes et souvent paradoxaux que l'alternance met en jeu chez l'apprenant se révèlent de possibles points d'appui des apprentissages signifiants. Une pédagogie qui ne tente pas de les éliminer amène alors à concevoir le travail de l'enseignant comme un travail de médiation elle aussi paradoxale. Une telle conception de l'alternance, loin d'enfermer celle-ci dans un rapport sclérosant à la tradition et sans pour autant l'en couper, montre en quoi l'articulation d'espaces et de temps contradictoires peut être pédagogiquement dynamique. Ce qui, en retour, ne manque pas d'interroger l'enseignement/apprentissage dans l'école dite traditionnelle. Complex and often paradoxical processes elaborated by the learner in an alternation situation may help realizing relevant learning. When pedagogy doesn't try to eliminate them, teacners'work can be conceived of as a mediation activity equally paradoxical. In such a conception, alternation is not separated from tradition but not blocked by it either. It shows to what extend links between contradictory spaces and periods of time may be educationally dynamic. Which, in return, asks questions concerning teaching/learning in a traditional school.<br>

Abstract: L'alternance entre les trois pôles de la formation (auto-hétéro-oïko) présente dans les pratiques de formation alternée (variété des situations d'apprentissage et des acteurs) renvoie à la différenciation des trois personnes pronominales (je-tu-il) du langage courant et s'inscrit dans l'épistémologie ternaire de la sémiotique initiée par Peirce. L'intelligence pratique et rusée (la métis des Grecs), repérée chez des artisans grâce à l'expression régionale « le biais du gars », met en scène une logique ouverte où transduction et abduction s'articulent à déduction et induction. Une « raison expérientielle » , dialogique, écologique, à visée éthique, est ainsi forgée. C'est une rationalité pratique cherchant à actualiser le potentiel de la situation. Elle est empreinte de sagesse et de « prudence » en action, au sens d'Aristote (phronésis). L'éc(h)oformation qui émerge de cette raison expérientielle, de ce regard interactionnel, est indissociable de la boucle étrange entre deux autres raisons : la raison sensible et la raison formelle, entre spontanéité et habitude. The tripolar concept of training (auto-hetero-oïko), foundation of alternating courses practice (with multiple learning situations and actors), draws us back to the differenciation between the three main persons singular (I, You, He) expressed in common language as the compound epistemology of semiotics put forward by Peirce... Practical intelligence (close to the "metis" of the Greeks) can be noticed among craftsmen when they refer to the "biais du gars" bespeaking an open logic where transduction and abduction are linked to deduction and induction. A constructive reasoning, interactive ans ecological, with ethical objectives, is created. It's a practical rationality aiming at actualizing the potentiality of the situation and marked by sagaciy and prudence in action in the Aristotelian sense (phronesis). The "ec(h)otraining" emerging from the wisdom of experience, this interactive vision of things is necessarily included in the chain linking two other thoughts : the intuitive thought and the formal thought, between spontaneity and habit.<br>

Abstract: Se former dans le travail apparaît maintenant comme une part naturelle, évidente de l'activité. Les personnes semblent pouvoir spontanément passer d'une posture de production à une position d'apprenant. Étudier les conditions pour se former dans des univers contraints révèle la nécessité de s'ajuster aux délais de la production et au rythme de la formation. Nous désignons par tempo cet ajustement de l'individu aux contraintes temporelles de la production, lui permettant de saisir dans les situations des occasions d'apprentissage. Les exemples fournis, issus de formations qualifiantes dans l'industrie, en proposent une interprétation croisant les dimensions d'engagement personnel et de transformation de l'activité. The "on the job training" seems for everyone, a natural part of the working activity. People would be able to change their point of view to perform the product target and in the same time the goals of training. This article shows that workers have to play with the time constraints to create by themselves a learning situation. We call "tempo" this capacity to catch in the course of the job, an opportunity to learn. From examples taken in the field of the training within industry, we suggest that this tempo depends on personal involvement in the changing or the activity.<br>

Abstract: A community, in the same way as an individual, can follow as a normal way of behaviour — or as a wanted criteria for behaviour — for all future circumstances to decide discretionally, «case by case», or to define in a moment in time the rule (or a set of rules) that must be valid for the future. To define rules in a community has been indicated by some authors (Geoffrey Brennan and James M. Buchanan particularly) as a way to exit from a situation of a war of every man against every other man, as in the Hobbesian jungle, on one side, and from a situation dominated by a Leviathan on the other. This in a perspective where rules of a common living have been set through a social contract. The rules established through this contract would also form the criteria for a just conduct, in the end therefore for criteria of justice. The essay analyzes the situations and the conditions in which constraining oneself can be rational, even as it is not definible that in all circumstances constraining is more rational than not constraining oneself, that it is more desirable to have rules rather than discretionary decisions, the definition of ways of behaviour rather than the pre-definition of outcomes. As for what concerns the problem of justice, it is indicated how through a contractarian and constitutional procedure rules can be put by unanimous consent, but the problem of the foundation of the same rules remains unresolved. Rules do not seek truth, but only express values accepted by the counterparts in a certain moment in time, and have individuals as sources of these values.<br>

Abstract: I begin by introducing the Ilongots and some of their attitudes toward speech. Whereas most modern theorists think of language as a tool designed primarily to "express" or to "refer," Ilongots think of language first in terms of action. They see commands as the exemplary act of speech, displaying less concern for the subjective meanings that an utterance conveys than for the social contexts in which utterances are heard. An ethnographic sketch thus outlines how Ilongots think of words and how their thought relates to aspects of their practice -- providing an external foil for theorists found closer to home. Speech Act Theory is discussed and questioned first on internal grounds, as an approach that recognizes but slights important situational and cultural constraints on forms of language use. A consideration of the application of Searle's taxonomy of acts of speech to Ilongot categories of language use then leads to a clarification of the individualistic and relatively asocial biases of his essentially intra-cultural account. Last, I return to Ilongot directives. A partial analysis of Ilongot acts of speech provides the basis for a statement of the ways in which indigenous categories are related to the forms that actions take, as both of these, in turn, reflect the sociocultural ordering of local worlds.<br>

Abstract: The principle of hermeneutical interpretation (i.e., the art and discipline of analyzing the symbols of sacred texts) is explained and applied to the analytical group situation. It is maintained that the approach employed by this methodology provides a viable manner for understanding patients' unconscious communications. In particular, the relationship between metaphorical communication and the here-and-now therapeutic experience is discussed. It is argued that the unconscious manifests itself as a set o f metaphorical expressions. The paper presents two clinical vignettes illustrating how this hermeneutical methodology can aid the therapist to "read" the unconscious meanings of such metaphors.<br>

Abstract: In an empirical study using five real-world creative teams from an advertising agency, participants were given a strategic brief for a new beverage product and asked to design the layout for a print ad. Think-aloud concurrent protocols obtained from each team's copywriter, art director, and the two working together were analyzed to examine the creative process and its relationship to the created advertisement. Interpretive analyses of the protocols reveal that the teams access culturally available plot patterns but in different ways. In this study and with the particular materials and situational context explored here, four of the five teams chose to pursue a single mythic structure to the apoarent detriment of their final product. Only one team engaged in fully diversified idea generation involving a wide range of alternative scenarios. Not coincidentally, as a tentative conclusion, this more flexible team produced the ad judged most successful by advertising professionals. This still-to-be-tested exploratory finding deserves further investigation in future research that embodies various methodological refinements.<br>

Abstract: The policy literature has long recognized the inherent need for a program to fit the unique conditions found in a certain context. We present a theory of institutional contextualism that focuses on the mechanisms by which actors adapt a policy design to fit a situation. We conceptualize institutions as phenomena that are constituted by a constant dialectic between text (the general blueprint) and context (the particular setting). The first half of this dialectic, which is the diffusion of the constitutive text or norm onto the institutional setting, has been discussed in the literature. Our research focuses on the second half, and we delineate, in concept, mechanisms for fitting the program to the local context. We then use a case study of improvised microfinance programs in Tamil Nadu, India, to illustrate how this occurs in reality. The research underscores the unexamined link between effective governance and contextual fit and offers a typology of mechanisms for fit that should inform future research.<br>

Abstract: Bohumil Nuska points out the predominant limited conception of rhythm, which is usually linked only with acoustically symbolized and aurally perceived rhythms, while the rhythms that are optically symbolized and visually perceived are utterly ignored. In lyric verse, the double, parallel mental construction, which stems from the opposition of syllable and morpheme as constituents of a higher construct of the word, creates parallel Iines of mixed mental spaces of linear and non-linear rhythms (the rhythm of verse, the rhythm of the situation; the atmosphere of the verse, and the atmosphere of the situation). Shared abstract structures in generic spaces within individual mixed spaces of lyric rhythm are shared axiological structures, represented at the highest level of abstraction by tension and relaxation (detension). The dynamic nature of these structures stems from the asymmetric distribution of tension and relaxation with regard to the dualistic symmetrical model of the axiological system. And thus deviations from its axial scheme emerge, creating these four parallel rhythmicized lyric structures (in terms of form). Similarity amongst the individual mixed mental spaces is only possible in a fractal dimension. In this theory, presented as a working hypothesis, it is assumed that the forms of the rhythm of the verse, the rhythm of the situation, the atmosphere of the verse, and the atmosphere of the situation, will be similar to each other, and their fractal mutual similarity emerges from the text.<br>

Abstract: Sartre's theory of the imagination is important both as an alternative to the idea that the imagination consists of images contained somehow in the mind - the "illusion of immanence" — and as an early formulation of Sartre's conception of consciousness. In this paper I defend Sartre's theory of imaginative consciousness against some of its critics. I show how difficulties with his theory parallel a perennial problem in Sartre-interpretation, that of understanding how consciousness can negate its past and posit possibilities beyond the facticity of its situation. In this short essay I will not provide a detailed exposition of Sartre's theory of the imagination. Rather, I provide the basis of an interpretation of this theory that emphasizes the role that the past plays in imaginative consciousness.<br>

Abstract: Recent events indicate that self-interest and technicism today triumph over social consciousness; yet educators naturally turn to the humanities as an antidote to positivism and technical domination, even as humanities scholars are increasingly defensive, struggling to hold on to their enclaves. For those committed to the practice of freedom in education the humanities are of vital interest, particularly when they are defined as works that are articulations of some human consciousness thrusting into the world. After giving examples of works that may be classified as "humanities" according to this definition, the following essay discusses teaching situations and literary works which might free persons for awareness of human possibility, for authentic talk and widening perspectives. The humanities must be presented not as monuments to be revered but as works to be shared by students and applied to their own life situations. Students grounded in their "everydayness" can be awakened by Freiré's dialogical method, awakened to crítical consciousness and to the possibility of praxis in a world they share.<br>

Abstract: Beginning with the paradoxical fact of the plurality of philosophical systems, the irrationality of this situation is examined, first, from the point of view of two solutions — the Hegelian solution and that which dissolves the paradox by denying that systems are exclusive of one another — judged to be inadequate; and then from the viewpoint of the contrast between the claims of genuine philosophy and its actual historical practice. The idea of system is examined from the perspective of Spinoza's Ethics and, finally, M. Gueroult's idéalisme intégral serves as a guide in exploring the result of subordinating the historical features of philosophical activity to its systematic features. Partant du fait paradoxal de la pluralité des systèmes philosophiques, l'auteur examine l'irrationalité de cette situation d'abord du point de vue de deux solutions — celle de Hegel et celle qui résoud le paradoxe en niant que les systèmes s'excluent mutuellement — solutions qui sont jugées inadéquates; puis du point de vue du contraste entre la véritable philosophie et sa pratique historique effective. L'idée de système est examinée dans la perspective de l'éthique de Spinoza et, enfin, l'idéalisme intégral de M. Gueroult sert de guide pour explorer les conséquences d'une subordination des aspects historiques de l'activité philosophique à ses aspects systématiques. Angesichts der paradoxen Situation der Pluralität von philosophischen Systemen wird die Irrationalität dieser Situation untersucht: zunächst vom Gesichtspunkt zweier Lösungen — nämlich der Lösung Hegels und derjenigen die darin besteht, die Unvereinbarkeit der Systeme zu leugnen —, die beide als inadäquat verworfen werden; dann von einem Standpunkt aus, der zwischen den Ansprüchen echter Philosophie und deren tatsächlicher historischer Praxis unterscheidet. Der Begriff des Systems wird aus der Perspektive von Spinozas Ethik untersucht und schliesslich wird M. Gueroults integraler Idealismus als Führer verwendet, um das Ergebnis einer Unterwerfung der historischen Züge philosophischer Tätigkeit unter ihre systematischen Züge zu durchleuchten.<br>

Abstract: L'article qui suit envisage quelques unes des questions que soulève aujourd'hui la notion d'identité aussi bien individuelle que collective dans le politique. En prenant appui notamment sur les réflexions d'Ernst Tugendhat dans Conscience de soi et autodétermination, je suggère que les préoccupations identitaires et les interrogations autour d'une crise de l'identité gagnent à être abordées à partir de la notion de projection et de détermination de la volonté et des actions plutôt qu'en termes de traits définitionnels statiques. Je suggère aussi que l'étude doit prendre en compte non seulement la situation dans ses dimensions individuelles et collectives mais aussi les conditions de désorientation que produit désormais l'incertitude concernant l'idée de l'humain elle-même. In this paper I consider some of the issues raised by the notion of identity in the political area to-day. Drawing upon the reflections of Ernst Tugendhat in his book Selbstbewusstsein und Selbstbestimmung, I suggest that contemporary problems of identity, individual and collective as well, and namely the idea of a postmodern crisis of political identities, are better understood when we view them in terms of projects and determination of actions. I also suggest we have to take into account not only individual and collective aspects of identity but also our inability to define our idea of what it is to be human.<br>

Abstract: The problem being dealt with in this paper is whether a text has only one legitimate meaning, or no meaning at all. The question becomes even more acute when the contexts of sender and receiver are different. Polysemy and ambiguity are well-known obstacles to communication on the level of the word. The necessity of a general semiotic theory is stressed, and explains the difference between denotation and connotation. The functionality of metaphor in biblical language points to the interpretive value of polyvalency. The impression of unlimited indeterminacy created by the recent emphasis on the active role of the reader, is in a sense misleading since author and reader function as a textual strategy. On the other hand, the actualization of the textual expression as the content of the text by applying the various codes and subcodes, implies a continuous interaction between intensional and extensional approaches. In this respect topics, thematics, ideological and world structures are operative. Since interpretation and application are not to be separated in a pragmatic context, as is the case with the text of the Bible, there inevitably remains the possibility of multiple interpretations due to the interpreting and applying of the text of the Bible in a concrete situation. Yet this interpretation and appropriation should always be done as comprehension of the text and in continuity with the tradition.<br>

Abstract: This contribution is an attempt to continue a dialogue on the issue of reference in biblical text which has its origin in an interchange with Willem Vorster and which is partly documented in the publication Text and reality. In the first section, the continuing relevance of reference is illustrated by a discussion of a number of contemporary Afrikaans historical novels, where the relationship between (historical) narrative and (historical) 'reality' is treated in a very innovative way. In a second section the dynamic nature of reference is discussed in the light of three aspects developed by Ricoeur, namely reference as self-transcendence, as redescription and as an integrative process. In a final section, the inevitable return to reality is explained. It is argued that a better understanding of the function of reference in all its facets holds the key to unlock the transformative potential of these texts in contemporary situations.<br>

Publisher: The University of Wisconsin Press<br>

Author(s): Corner James<br>
Abstract: This essay is about the crisis of creativity and meaning in contemporary Western culture and how the use of modern landscape and architectural theory works to perpetuate an excessively "hard" or neutral world—a world in which culture can no longer figure or recollect itself. A brief critique of three predominant approaches toward contemporary theory is presented: positivism, the use of paradigms, and the Avant-Garde. In different ways, each approach derives from modern techno-scientific thinking and invariably seeks closure, certainty, and control. The built landscapes that result often suffer from an equally closed explicitude: a stifling immanence where all is exposed and nothing is left to imagination. The essay suggests an alternative strategy grounded in the tradition of hermeneutics. Here, theory is something ever-open, permitting a free association of ideas through the mechanics of situational interpretation and metaphor. Hermeneutics provides the basis for a landscape architectural theory that transcends pictorial image and historical style by critically engaging contemporary circumstance and tradition. The landscape itself is a hermeneutic medium and becomes the ground for such an endeavor, enabling the remembrance, renewal, and transformation of a cultural tradition. The author argues that a hermeneutic approach to the theory and practice of landscape architecture is a way of returning to our designed landscapes the powers of the everyday and the revelatory—the grounds of memory and hope.<br>

Author(s): WOLICKA ELŻBIETA<br>
Abstract: The article of Elzbieta Wolicka is consecrated to the consideration of the phenomenon of time taken in the contexts of individual human experience, contemporary cultural situation and Christian faith. The starting point of the 1st part of the article is the fragment of Confessiones (ch. XI) of St. Augustine and the short parable of Franz Kafka entitled HE. The author of the article brings to the light the dialogical basis of the human perception of time and raises up the quaestion of "a hidden sabotage of trust" which is characteristic to the social relations of our times. This is also the one among many other factors of the so called "crisis of culture" (mal du siècle). The crisis consists of a feeling of a threat, a burden of the past and a fear of the future. The 2nd part of the article is concerned with the analysis of the eschatological meaning of some words of Christ in the Gospel of St. John (4, 23; 5, 25-29; 12, 13; 12, 27, 31). They reveal the Christian sense of the human temporal condition in the light of "the economy of salvation" and the dialogue between a believer and God. A catastrophic thrill, a feeling of existential paradox, a blockage of communication - the symptoms of the crisis of cultural conscience - could be described as "the edipse of God" (M. Buber) or "the abandonment of God" (J. Ellul) in the contemporary world. The Gospel points out that in the heart of human temporal experience there is still existing conversatio sacra and the presence of God in our history is actual.<br>

Abstract: This paper contrasts intersectionality, the negative definition of identities, and multiple identities, the situational valorisation of positive identities, to argue for a generational shift in the performance of everyday multiculturalism in Britain. In everyday encounters, actors work to sustain the definition of the situation (Goffman) and with it a surface of civility and mutual respect which are nevertheless morally compelling. Everyday relationships flow smoothly and naturally, in an unreflexive, taken-for-granted way, to constitute shared positive identities (Schutz). Such surface civility may, however, be disrupted by communicative breakdowns whenever participants do not share implicit systems of relevancy. Deconstructive analyses that probe beneath the surface of the everyday can also reveal the existence of negative identities, subject to discrimination and stigmatisation. This paper contrasts the experience of first-generation Commonwealth immigrants to Britain with that of successive generations, who unreflexively displayed a shared British identity during the London 2012 Olympics.<br>

Abstract: Contemporary rural anthropology, both applied and ethnographic, often takes place in situations of extreme political and class conflict. Despite recent debates over reflexivity and ethics generally in such studies, the methodological problems of doing fieldwork under conditions of class conflict rarely figure into the debate; this is particularly true of southern Europe. These problems are at once personal, moral, epistemological, and methodological. This paper describes one fieldworker's efforts to maintain scholarly neutrality in an agro-town in Franco Spain where class conflict was severe. The implications of this experience for critical anthropology and for applied anthropology are discussed.<br>

Abstract: Disciplinary specialties and boundaries may impede as well as facilitate understanding. Standard scholarly orientations to the study of Navajos and other ethnic populations manifest many biases of ethnocentrism and a general tendency to stereotype. Specific observer-related tendencies to distort are noted, among them tendencies to understate social dynamics and the degree to which Navajos are functioning parts of wider social systems. The literature on Navajos is a product of changing tools in the hands of changing observers applied to changing communities in the context of ongoing change in the wider societies of both observer and observed. It is argued that "multiplying glimpses," or increasing the number and types of observers and the variety of disciplines and paradigms represented, may reduce observer and position biases that distort existing views of Navajo society. An overview of the massive literature on the Navajo leads to the identification of 21 distinct genres. These genres and other Navajo texts may profitably be viewed in the perspective of textual analysis, broadly defined. Issues of meaning and interpretation are considered, including the reality-language-text nexus, construction of texts, text-context patterns, and the interaction of text, situation, and analyst in interpretation. Appropriate use of existing texts is socially responsible "green research" and should not be professionally stigmatized. It substitutes resource-efficient recycling of discarded and underanalyzed texts for the old expensive, obtrusive colonial patterns of work.<br>

Abstract: This article describes how the people of Cartago, Costa Rica -- compelled, like each of us, to create -- incorporate the material culture of their town's market and plaza into social situations. In so doing, they move from the physical reality of simply being there to the distinctive social realities of being-in-the-market and being-in-the-plaza. The juxtaposition of these two complementary realities, the article concludes, constitutes the dialectic through which Spanish American culture becomes.

Abstract: To date, little is known about when and to what degree science students begin to participate in authentic scientific graphing practices. This article presents the results of a series of studies on the production, transformation, and interpretation of graphical representation from Grade 8 to professional scientific practice both in formal testing situations (inside) and in the course of field/laboratory work (outside). The results of these studies can be grouped into two major areas. First, there is a discontinuity in the graph-related practices that marks a boundary between people who engage in work that requires them to transform data into graphical representations (converted) and people who do not have such experiences (cannibals). Second, the didactic practices of high school textbooks and university lectures exhibit a marked discontinuity relative to graphing practices in scientific journals. Graphs used in didactic circumstances may be associated with students' difficulties in interpreting "real data." It appears that school teachers and university professors (missionaries) do little to put their students on trajectories of increasing participation in authentic scientific graphing practices.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: In short, it is exposure to the experientially inspired and theoretically casual atmosphere of those early SPEP meetings—where neglected topics and unorthodox modes of thinking and speaking were encouraged in an undisciplined way—to which I owe the most. Of course, SPEP grew up. It has experienced its share of embarrassing upheavals, as the heavy presence of its own versions of the social and political prejudices in the larger culture became too obvious to ignore. But it is now a major event—the four-day anchor for a week-long convention that takes over hotels, runs multiple concurrent sessions, fosters satellite groups, and often follows established lines of discussion. Some even call it the alternative APA. Yet I am sure that as long as lifeworld experience continues to trump whatever it is currently fashionable to say about it, grown-up SPEP will retain enough of its original vitality and intellectual generosity so that another generation of aging academics will have cause to repeat our present thank-yous in another fifty years.<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>

Issue: sciefictstud.41.issue-1<br>
Date: 3 1, 1973<br>
Abstract: This essay examines the role of agency and metatextuality in Élisabeth Vonarburg's B
         ridgeCycle, comprised mainly of a group of short stories originally published between 1977 and 2002 and then revised in their definitive French versions for the collectionLe Jeu des coquilles de nautilus(2003). The cycle's main storyline involves the uncertain journey between parallel worlds by a series of recurring characters. Three intimately linked narrative components—each closely related to certain protocols of reading fiction and of particular interest to science fiction—form the theoretical and analytical bases of this study: the three recurring topoï of the protagonist-Voyager's travels; character agency that in part drives the sense of these realms and their occupation; and the dénouement which gives a certain meaning and closure to the spaces in their diverse manifestations and to the characters who pursue their quests in these spaces. Vonarburg's narratives place their protagonists in a situation precisely similar to that of the reader as she must negotiate the trans-world context, come to grips with her own relative lack of agency, and at the same time seek some level of control through knowledge. Suchmise en abymeallows the author, through the choice of dénouement, to comment on the manner in which this universe and the real one are imagined, represented, and decoded, and on how meaning is conveyed.<br>
