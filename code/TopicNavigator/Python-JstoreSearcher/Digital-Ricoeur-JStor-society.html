  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76ttq">Exploring Jesuit Distinctiveness</a><br>
  Author(s) Leitão Henrique<br>
  Abstract: For historians of science, one of the most distinctive features of the Society of Jesus was its dedication to science and scientific education, especially when compared with other religious orders. The Jesuits’ contributions to early modern science have been studied extensively and are now widely known, lending further credence to George Sarton’s (1884–1956) dictum that “one cannot study the history of mathematics in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries without coming across Jesuits at every corner.”¹ Fifty years later, in his book on the history of electricity in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, John Heilbron (1934–) echoed this assertion<br>

  Book Title: The Political Style of Conspiracy-Chase, Summer, and Lincoln<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Pfau Michael William<br>
  Abstract: The turbulent history of the United States has provided a fertile ground for conspiracies, both real and imagined. From the American Revolution to the present day, conspiracy discourse-linguistic and symbolic practices and artifacts revolving around themes, claims, or accusations of conspiracy-has been a staple of political rhetoric. Some conspiracy theories never catch on with the public, while others achieve widespread popularity. Whether successful or not, the means by which particular conspiracy theories spread is a rhetorical process, a process in which persuasive language, symbolism, and arguments act upon individual minds within concrete historical and political settings.Conspiracy rhetoric was a driving force in the evolution of antebellum political culture, contributing to the rise and fall of the great parties in the nineteenth century. One conspiracy theory in particular-the "slave power" conspiracy-was instrumental in facilitating the growth of the young Republican Party's membership and ideology.
      The Political Style of Conspiracyanalyzes the concept and reality of the "slave power" in the rhetorical discourse of the mid-nineteenth-century, in particular the speeches and writing of politicians Salmon P. Chase, Charles Sumner, and Abraham Lincoln. By examining their mainstream texts, Pfau reveals that, in addition to the "paranoid style" of conspiracy rhetoric that inhabits the margins of political life, Lincoln, Chase, and Sumner also engaged in a distinctive form of conspiracy rhetoric that is often found at the center of mainstream American society and politics.<br>

  Abstract: To be Fundamentalist is to be marginal. It is to adopt and enact one’s own marginalization in society. It is to assume a position of outsider. It is to invoke counterpublic speech against public norms. Yet it is also to lay claim to an imagined higher standard than that which society currently upholds. It is, as we discussed in the last chapter, to envision a world in which Fundamentalist speech is normative. It is to speak for a public that the Fundamentalist community imagines but cannot, itself, enact. Therefore, we have seen, within Fundamentalism, a continual and productive tension between<br>

  Author(s) Alison James<br>
  Abstract: René Girard’s complex and sophisticated theory of sacrifice offers insights into the workings of human society that transcend culture and time and, while privileging Christianity and modernity, claim a certain universality. This invites scholars of other cultures and religions to consider the applicability of Girardian thought to their own fields of study. As scholars of Buddhism we take up this challenge by bringing Buddhism into conversation with Girard. Instead of concentrating on a particular text (Schlieter 2009) or genre (Hahn 2009) or practice (Arifuku 2009), we aim for a more comprehensive and general engagement with Girard by suggesting how Buddhism<br>

  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: Sovereignty is the vote. The union card. The insignia of membership in the club. Less exclusive than it once was, the club now encompasses much of the globe and those not members at present continue to seek entry, often utilizing rather impolite methods to that end. Sovereignty remains the “essential qualification for full membership in international society, or, to express the point more comprehensively, the qualification which makes a state eligible for full membership.”¹ Sovereignty names an aspiration; serves as a goad to action; signifies an accomplishment; defines an opposition (state/society); and encodes a legalistic construction (formal sovereignty).<br>

  Book Title: Shared Land/Conflicting Identity-Trajectories of Israeli & Palestinian Symbol Use<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frank David A.<br>
  Abstract: Shared Land/Conflicting Identity: Trajectories of Israeli and Palestinian Symbol Useargues that rhetoric, ideology, and myth have played key roles in influencing the development of the 100-year conflict between first the Zionist settlers and the current Israeli people and the Palestinian residents in what is now Israel. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is usually treated as an issue of land and water. While these elements are the core of the conflict, they are heavily influenced by the symbols used by both peoples to describe, understand, and persuade each other. The authors argue that symbolic practices deeply influenced the Oslo Accords, and that the breakthrough in the peace process that led to Oslo could not have occurred without a breakthrough in communication styles.Rowland and Frank develop four crucial ideas on social development: the roles of rhetoric, ideology, and myth; the influence of symbolic factors; specific symbolic factors that played a key role in peace negotiations; and the identification and value of criteria for evaluating symbolic practices in any society.<br>

  Abstract: Two of the most important developments of the twentieth century have been the return of large numbers of Jews to Israel (and the creation of the state of Israel following that return), along with the rise of a Palestinian people. In this book, we illuminate these events through an analysis of the trajectories of Palestinian and Israeli symbol use over roughly the last century. Our thesis is that symbolic practices—speeches, essays, poetry, and other public communication—have played a crucial role in shaping each society and the conflict between them.<br>

  Abstract: Young minority men are often portrayed in popular media as victims of poverty and discrimination.
      A Dream Denieddelves deeper, investigating the social and cultural implications of the "American dream" narrative for young minority men in the juvenile justice systems in Boston and Chicago. This book connects young male offenders' cycles of desistance and recidivism with normative assumptions about success and failure in American society, exposing a tragic disconnect between structural reality and juvenile justice policy. This book challenges us to reconsider how American society relates to its most vulnerable members, how it responds to their personal failures, and how it promises them a better future.<br>

  Abstract: One of the “hallmarks of modernity,” writes Henri Lefebvre in his 1974 study,
                  The Production of Space,is its “expulsion” or “erasure” of time. Inscribed in spaces and in social relationships in the premodern, time in modernity is subordinated to the economic and expelled from the political. In deliberately violent imagery Lefebvre writes that time in modernity “has been murdered by society” (96). If this separation of time from space was so dramatic and violent, why, Lefebvre wonders, did it not cause an “outcry”? How did it become “part and parcel of social norms”? “How many lies have their roots”<br>

  Abstract: Our exploration of the complex relationship between literature and space began with a legendary account of the origin of Sanskrit literature and a literary-theoretical discourse on Sanskrit styles and their regional dimensions. Both perspectives are conditioned by a conceptual matrix fundamental to Sanskrit thought for ordering and explaining the diverse phenomena of culture and society as elements in a transregional network closely related to Sanskrit’s own nonlocalized mode of existence. But there are other, literary linkages between literature and space. Narrative has an internal spatial logic, a “semiotic domain around which a plot coalesces and self-organizes,” as one scholar puts<br>

  Book Title: A Usable Past-Essays in European Cultural History<br>

  Author(s): BOUWSMA WILLIAM J.<br>
  Abstract: The essays assembled here represent forty years of reflection about the European cultural past by an eminent historian. The volume concentrates on the Renaissance and Reformation, while providing a lens through which to view problems of perennial interest.
      A Usable Pastis a book of unusual scope, touching on such topics as political thought and historiography, metaphysical and practical conceptions of order, the relevance of Renaissance humanism to Protestant thought, the secularization of European culture, the contributions of particular professional groups to European civilization, and the teaching of history. The essays inA Usable Pastare unified by a set of common concerns. William Bouwsma has always resisted the pretensions to science that have shaped much recent historical scholarship and made the work of historians increasingly specialized and inaccessible to lay readers. Following Friedrich Nietzsche, he argues that since history is a kind of public utility, historical research should contribute to the self-understanding of society.<br>

More recently, the debates over historiography in biblical studies in the 1990s raised in an acute fashion issues relating to the preservation of reliable data in the historical narratives of the Bible versus the invention of<br>

  Abstract: Catholic Studies emerges in the North American context precisely at a time when the boundaries for identifying “Catholic” are contested. Under conditions of globalization when persons shift in and out of a variety of local and transnational affiliations, the identifier is not as clear as perhaps it once was. In earlier periods, in so-called Catholic countries, the category “Catholic” encompassed the whole of society and the definition was bound up with national and ethnic identities. In non-Catholic Christian contexts, such as in the United States, where identity was constructed “over-against” the dominant ethos, the category “Catholic” was identifiable in contrast<br>

  Abstract: Public theology is sometimes defined by the praxis of doing theology for the differing audiences, communities of accountability, or publics of the church, academy, and society that theologians address.¹ At other times, public theology is characterized by the method used to reach those audiences, either by making religious claims more intelligible to wider society via shared norms and practices of rational public discourse or by relying on religious institutions to shape and equip persons with virtues for participating in political discourse.² And, at other times, public theology is determined by the goal of integrating theology and ethics into the discursive<br>

  Abstract: The rise of religious fundamentalism in the closing decades of the twentieth century continues to have enormous repercussions not only for politics, but also for the disciplines of the human sciences, philosophy, and theology. The sociology of religion, perhaps the paradigmatic achievement of the discipline of sociology, has been dealing with the effects of the crisis of its theories of secularization. The so-called deprivatization of religion has forced on the table the old-age question of the relation between God and society, or faith and the constitution of community, with the added complication that the community at stake nowadays is a<br>

As postmodern theories constantly remind us, the order of the body is also the political, social, economic, religious, and sexual order of a society.

  Book Title: Finding God in All Things: Celebrating Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stagaman David<br>
  Abstract: Three of the most influential Catholic theologians of the twentieth century-Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-were all born in 1904, at the height of the Church's most militant rhetoric against all things modern. In this culture of suspicion, Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner grew in faith to join the Society of Jesus and struggled with the burden of antimodernist policies in their formation. By the time of their mature work in the 1950s and 1960s, they had helped to redefine the critical dialogue between modern thought and contemporary Catholic theology. After the dtente of the Second Vatican Council, they brought Catholic tradition into closer relationship to modern philosophy, history, and politics. Written by leading scholars, friends, and family members, these original essays celebrate the legacies of Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner after a century of theological development. Offering a broad range of perspectives on their lives and works, the essays blend personal and anecdotal accounts with incisive critical appraisals. Together, they offer an accessible introduction to the distinctive character of three great thinkers and how their work shapes the way Catholics think and talk about God, Church, and State.<br>

  Book Title: Believing Scholars: Ten Catholic Intellectuals-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burrell David B.<br>
  Abstract: How do Catholic intellectuals draw on faith in their work? And how does their work as scholars influence their lives as people of faith?For more than a generation, the University of Dayton has invited a prominent Catholic intellectual to present the annual Marianist Award Lecture on the general theme of the encounter of faith and profession. Over the years, the lectures have become central to the Catholic conversation about church, culture, and society.In this book, ten leading figures explore the connections in their own lives between the private realms of faith and their public calling as teachers, scholars, and intellectuals.This last decade of Marianist Lectures brings together theologians and philosophers, historians, anthropologists, academic scholars, and lay intellectuals and critics.Here are Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J., on the tensions between faith and theology in his career; Jill Ker Conway on the spiritual dimensions of memory and personal narrative; Mary Ann Glendon on the roots of human rights in Catholic social teaching; Mary Douglas on the fruitful dialogue between religion and anthropology in her own life; Peter Steinfels on what it really means to be a liberal Catholic; and Margaret O'Brien Steinfels on the complicated history of women in today's church. From Charles Taylor and David Tracy on the fractured relationship between Catholicism and modernity to Gustavo Gutirrez on the enduring call of the poor and Marcia Colish on the historic links between the church and intellectual freedom, these essays track a decade of provocative, illuminating, and essential thought. James L. Heft, S.M., is President and Founding Director of the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies and University Professor of Faith and Culture and Chancellor, University of Dayton. He has edited Beyond Violence: Religious Sources for Social Transformation in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (Fordham).<br>

The proposal immediately captured my fancy since faith and theology have been, so to speak, the two poles of my existence. The subject, besides, has considerable importance for our time and place, because many of the difficulties we experience in Church and society are due to the impoverishment of faith or to theology that is not in harmony with faith.<br>

  Book Title: Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SULLIVAN LAWRENCE E.<br>
  Abstract: What has happened to religion in its present manifestations? In recent years, Enlightenment secularization, as it appeared in the global spread of political structures that relegate the sacred to a private sphere, seems suddenly to have foundered. Unexpectedly, it has discovered its own parochialism-has discovered, indeed, that secularization may never have taken place at all.With the return of the religious,in all aspects of contemporary social, political, and religious life, the question of political theology-of the relation between politicaland religiousdomains-takes on new meaning and new urgency. In this groundbreaking book, distinguished scholars from many disciplines-philosophy, political theory, anthropology, classics, and religious studies-seek to take the full measure of this question in today's world. This book begins with the place of the gods in the Greek polis, then moves through Augustine's two cities and early modern religious debates, to classic statements about political theology by such thinkers as Walter Benjamin and Carl Schmitt. Essays also consider the centrality of tolerance to liberal democracy, the recent French controversy over wearing the Muslim headscarf, and Bush's God talk.The volume includes a historic discussion between Jrgen Habermas and Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, concerningthe prepolitical moral foundations of a republic, and it concludes with explorations of new, more open ways of conceptualizing society.<br>

  Abstract: In modern society there is typically a multiplicity of religious beliefs and identities, and—so we are told—they can be held together only by a formal separation between religious belonging and political status, and by the allocation of religious belief to the private sphere. To be fully part of a democratic community, citizens holding different religious beliefs (or none) must share values that enable them to have a common political life. These values reflect the unity of the state that represents them. Without shared values there can be no integration, without integration no political stability, without some measure of<br>

  Book Title: Labors of Imagination: Aesthetics and Political Economy from Kant to Althusser-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mieszkowski Jan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a major new study of the doctrines of productivity and interest in Romanticism and classical political economy. The author argues that the widespread contemporary embrace of cultural historicism and the rejection of nineteenth-century conceptions of agency have hindered our study of aesthetics and politics. Focusing on the difficulty of coordinating paradigms of intellectual and material labor, Mieszkowski shows that the relationship between the imagination and practical reason is crucial to debates about language and ideology.From the Romantics to Poe and Kafka, writers who explore Kant's claim that poetry sets the imagination freediscover that the representational and performative powers of language cannot be explained as the products of a self-governing dynamic, whether formal or material. A discourse that neither reflects nor prescribes the values of its society, literature proves to be a uniquely autonomous praxis because it undermines our reliance on the concept of interest as the foundation of self-expression or self-determination. Far from compromising its political significance, this turns literature into the condition of possibility of freedom. For Smith, Bentham, and Marx, the limits of self-rule as a model of agency prompt a similar rethinking of the relationship between language and politics. Their conception of a linguistic labor that informs material praxis is incompatible with the liberal ideal of individualism. In the final analysis, their work invites us to think about social conflicts not as clashes between competing interests, but as a struggle to distinguish human from linguistic imperatives.<br>

  Abstract: “Civilized Girl,” the title poem of Jully Makini’s first collection of poetry, published in 1981 (Sipolo 1981)—the first by a Solomon Islands woman—is about a young urban-based Solomon Island girl questioning her identity. “Roviana Girl,” published five years later in Makini’s second collection,
                  Praying Parents(Sipolo 1986), is about a village-based girl critiquing her changing society. In indigenous literature, the urban-based civilized girl often serves as a trope for the ills of Westernization and colonization. She is implicitly contrasted with the traditional girl, who is based in the village and whose adherence to static traditional roles remains unquestioned<br>

  Book Title: Citizenship in Heaven and on Earth-Karl Barth's Ethics<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Massmann Alexander<br>
  Abstract: While Karl Barth is one of the most significant theologians of the twentieth century, his contribution to ethics is less well known and subject to controversy among interpreters. Barth combined his commitment to the church and its particular task in faith and theology with a concern for ethics and politics in wider society. By examining the historical development of Barth’s ethics, this study traces the vital influences and considerable shifts in Barth’s understanding of the ethical task, situating him within his political context. Alexander Massmann provides a comprehensive explication and assessment of the full scope of Barth’s ethics, from the first edition of the Romans commentary to the final volume of the Church Dogmatics. General questions of Barth’s methodology in ethics and case studies in applied ethics are both analyzed in their intricate connection to his dogmatic thought. The study highlights how an ethical approach emerged in which the freedom of the gospel allows for considerable openness to empirical insights from other disciplines. The author reevaluates Barth’s ethics in a constructive vision of the role of the church in the quest for a just society.<br>

  Abstract: In 1913, Walter Benjamin was a central figure alongside his teacher, Gustav Wyneken, in the ‘German Youth Movement’, agitating for substantial reforms in the German educational system and, beyond that, in German society. He placed one of his first serious publications, an essay entitled ‘Experience’, in
                  Der Anfang, the magazine of the movement, as a contribution to the debates. In this essay, he points out that a society’s elders have a bad habit of legitimising their views through recourse to their ‘experience’(Erfahrung), their amassing of ‘felt life’, as we might call it, which is axiomatically greater than that amassed<br>

  Abstract: This volume has traced the development of the Traveller image as ‘Other’ through mythical and binary discourses of alterity. Until the recent arrival of a more overtly multicultural society in Ireland Travellers have constituted the ‘Other’ for mainstream Irish society. As ‘Other’ they have often acted as objects on whom power is exercised. Their representation and the roles constructed for them have been determined primarily by the settled community and have been influenced by the need to define national, social and class identity. This project of representation has used the tools of mythology and history. These two related aspects of<br>

  Abstract: The relationship between the representation of motherhood and the construction of dramatic narrative that has been explored in this book, gained resonance from the placing of the mother in contexts that attested to her relationship to domestic and civic spaces, to the economies of society and household. Alongside this developed a dramatic interest in the complexities of the mother’s role as experienced by her children. Each of the plays discussed in the previous chapter invites its audience to consider, albeit briefly, the consequences for the child of its mother’s negotiation of her domestic, social and moral role.

  Abstract: In
         Tropical Apocalypse,Martin Munro argues that since the earliest days of European colonization, Caribbean-and especially Haitian-history has been shaped by apocalyptic events so that the region has, in effect, been living for centuries in an end time without end. By engaging with the contemporary apocalyptic turn in Caribbean studies and lived reality, he not only provides important historical contextualization for a general understanding of apocalypse in the region but also offers an account of the state of Haitian society and culture in the decades before the 2010 earthquake. Inherently interdisciplinary, his work ranges widely through Caribbean and Haitian thought, historiography, political discourse, literature, film, religion, and ecocriticism in its exploration of whether culture in these various forms can shape the future of a country.<br>

Moreover, public debates about what is heritage and who is in charge of heritage management have emerged among different social groups. These discussions accord with the theoretical considerations about the role of heritage in society.

  Abstract: Was World War II a radical break in French Jewish history—a turning point in notions of community, identity, and political expression—or did the restoration of Jewish citizenship and the Fourth Republic’s promise to protect and defend all citizens regardless of religion or ethnic origin allow long-standing patterns of Jewish identification to reinstate themselves? This chapter will address this question by turning to an aspect of Jewish communal life that transcended the pre- and postwar years—that of how to integrate incoming Jewish refugees and immigrants into communal institutions and French society more broadly.

  Author(s): Sandberg Sveinung<br>
  Abstract: The contributors uncover the narratives at the center of their essays through qualitative interviews, ethnographic fieldwork, and written archives, and they scrutinize narrative structure and meaning by analyzing genres, plots, metaphors, and other components of storytelling. In doing so, they reveal the cognitive, ideological, and institutional mechanisms by which narratives promote harmful action. Finally, they consider how offenders' narratives are linked to and emerge from those of conventional society or specific subcultures. Each chapter reveals important insights and elements for the development of a framework of narrative criminology as an important approach for understanding crime and criminal justice. An unprecedented and landmark collection,
      Narrative Criminologyopens the door for an exciting new field of study on the role of stories in motivating and legitimizing harm.<br>

Yet, if we leave aside the important distinction that exists between the reverent contrition of Augustine and the self-aggrandizement associated with, say, contemporary “hooli-lit” (Fischer 2006), it is clear that, as long as society has recognized the concept of crime, a shadow process of making sense<br>

  Abstract: The catholic intellectual tradition begins with Catholics who become intellectuals or intellectuals who become disciples of Christ in his body the Church. But because both discipleship and the intellectual life are universal in scope, the life and worth of Catholic intellectuals is lived in the Church and in society at large. The institutionalization of that conversation between the human intellect and the faith that comes to us from the apostles began with the conversion of philosophers in ancient Rome and moved, over the centuries, from their schools and their coteries of disciples to the monastic schools during feudal times, then,<br>

It was proposed that the ‘mysticism of politics’ appears to gain currency precisely at times of political and social innovation in which there exists the experience of the potential of human agency according to an evangelical vision. Secondly, it was suggested that in a modern, liberal society in which it discovers itself as one voice amongst others the Church will tend towards a ‘politics of mysticism’ for social identity.

  Book Title: Child Sexual Abuse, Society, and the Future of the Church-  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Regan Hilary D<br>
  Abstract: In November 2012 the Australian federal government announced the establishment of a ‘Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse’. This Royal Commission was set up after many years of reports of sexual abuse in Australia within religious institutions of various Christian churches, some state government inquiries and in the context of inquiries in other countries, most notably Ireland. The Royal Commission began its first hearing in April 2013. It has been forecast that the Commission will be hearing submissions for a number of years from witnesses, both from those who ask to speak to the Royal Commissioners and from those who will be asked to appear before the Commission. At the same time as the establishment of the Royal Commission, the Catholic Church in Australia established a Truth, Justice and healing Council to oversee the Catholic Church’s engagement with the Royal Commission. This collection brings together essays from biblical scholars, a church historian, theologians, ministers of religion from a number of churches, lawyers and a psychologist. They each address the issues of sexual abuse, society and the church in the context of the Australian inquiries. The volume ends with an overview of the processes engaged with by the Catholic Church and the State in the Republic of Ireland and reactions to these inquiries. The volume of essays considers sexual abuse from the perspective of the victims. What is to be done about the mess we are in over clerical sexual abuse? That question is puzzling concerned people today. This diverse collection offers them profitable reading, wherever they are coming from. It has enough useful suggestions and ideas to stimulate the calm, intelligent discussion now demanded by our communities.’ Edmund Campion, Australian Catholic University.<br>

We meet the contributors at diverse stages of their careers-from the unmarried researcher arriving for her first stint in the field to the seasoned fieldworker returning with spouse and children. They offer frank descriptions of what it means to take up residence in a place where one is regarded as an outsider, learn the language and local customs, and struggle to develop rapport. Moving reflections on friendship, kinship, and belief within the cross-cultural encounter reveal why study of Moroccan society has played such a seminal role in the development of cultural anthropology.<br>

  Abstract: They have stalked the horizons of our culture, wreaked havoc on moribund concepts of dead and not dead, threatened our sense of identity, and endangered our personal safety. Now zombies have emerged from the lurking shadows of society's fringes to wander the sacred halls of the academy, feasting on tender minds and hurling rot across our intellectual landscape. It is time to unite in common cause, to shore up defenses, firm up critical and analytical resources, and fortify crumbling lines of inquiry. Responding to this call, Brain Workers from the Zombie Research Center poke and prod the rotting corpus of zombie culture trying to make sense of cult classics and the unstoppable growth of new and even more disturbing work.

  Author(s): KATZ CLAIRE ELISE<br>
  Abstract: Reexamining Emmanuel Levinas's essays on Jewish education, Claire Elise Katz provides new insights into the importance of education and its potential to transform a democratic society, for Levinas's larger philosophical project. Katz examines Levinas's "Crisis of Humanism," which motivated his effort to describe a new ethical subject. Taking into account his multiple influences on social science and the humanities, and his various identities as a Jewish thinker, philosopher, and educator, Katz delves deeply into Levinas's works to understand the grounding of this ethical subject.<br>

Shakespeare’s line, “There are more things in heaven and on earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy,” though applicable to many thinkers, seems inappropriate when applied to Weiss. In his own way, Weiss is even more ample than the omnivorous Hegel, who, after all, never elaborated a philosophy of sport. But then again, many seem inclined to reverse Shakespeare’s line in Weiss’s case: “There are more things in Weiss’s philosophy<br>

  Book Title: Border Watch-Cultures of Immigration, Detention and Control<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Mitchell Jon P.<br>
  Abstract: Questions over immigration and asylum face almost all Western countries. Should only economically useful immigrants be allowed? What should be done with unwanted or 'illegal' immigrants? In this bold and original intervention, Alexandra Hall shows that immigration detention centres offer a window onto society's broader attitudes towards immigrants. Despite periodic media scandals, remarkably little has been written about the everyday workings of the grassroots immigration system, or about the people charged with enacting immigration policy at local levels. Detention, particularly, is a hidden side of border politics, despite its growing international importance as a tool of control and security. This book fills the gap admirably, analysing the everyday encounters between officers and immigrants in detention to explore broad social trends and theoretical concerns. This highly topical book provides rare insights into the treatment of the 'other' and will be essential for policy makers and students studying anthropology and sociology.<br>

Issues such as identity construction, dilemmas in public service sectors and the experience of rapid social change. It recognises that the split between individual and society, sociology and psychology is now unhelpful if we are to understand social and psychological phenomena.

  Book Title: Leaving the North-Migration and Memory, Northern Ireland 1921–2011<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Trew Johanne Devlin<br>
  Abstract: Leaving the North is the first book that provides a comprehensive survey of Northern Ireland migration since 1921. Based largely on the personal memories of emigrants who left Northern Ireland from the 1920s to the 2000s, approximately half of whom eventually returned, the book traces their multigenerational experiences of leaving Northern Ireland and adapting to life abroad, with some later returning to a society still mired in conflict. Contextualised by a review of the statistical and policy record, the emigrants’ stories reveal that contrary to its well-worn image as an inward-looking place – 'such narrow ground' – Northern Ireland has a rather dynamic migration history, demonstrating that its people have long been looking outward as well as inward, well connected with the wider world. But how many departed and where did they go? And what of the Northern Ireland Diaspora? How has the view of the ‘troubled’ homeland from abroad, especially among expatriates, contributed to progress along the road to peace? In addressing these questions, the book treats the relationship between migration, sectarianism and conflict, immigration and racism, repatriation and the Peace Process, with particular attention to the experience of Northern Ireland migrants in the two principal receiving societies – Britain and Canada. With the emigration of young people once again on the increase due to the economic downturn, it is perhaps timely to learn from the experiences of the people who have been ‘leaving the North’ over many decades; not only to acknowledge their departure but in the hope that we might better understand the challenges and opportunities that migration and Diaspora can present.<br>

  Book Title: The Trouble with Community-Anthropological Reflections on Movement, Identity and Collectivity<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Mitchell Jon P.<br>
  Abstract: 'Community' is one of social science's longest-standing concepts. The assumption, of much social science, has been that it is in communities -- and to communities -- that human individuals, as social and cultural beings, belong. Communities are said to embody that interactive environment from which individuals' identities and senses of self derive, and in which they continue to dwell. The trouble with 'community' is that this is not necessarily so; the personal social networks of individuals' actual experience crosscut collective categories, situations and institutions. Communities can prove unviable or imprisoning; the reality of community life and identity can often be very different from the ideology and the ideal. In this provocative new book, anthropologists Vered Amit and Nigel Rapport draw on their various ethnographic experiences to reappraise the concept and the reality of 'community', in the light of globalization, religious fundamentalism, identity politics, and renascent localisms. How might anthropology better apprehend social identities which are intrinsically plural, transgressive and ironic? What has anthropology to say about the way in which civil society might hope to accommodate the on-going construction and the rightful expression of such migrant identities? Nigel Rapport and Vered Amit give their own answers to these questions before entering into dialogue to assess each other's positions. Nigel Rapport is Professor of Anthropological and Philosophical Studies at the University of St. Andrews. He is author of Transcendent Individual (1997). Vered Amit is an Associate Professor at Concordia University in Montreal. She is the editor of Realizing Community (2002).<br>

  Book Title: Truth Commissions-Memory, Power, and Legitimacy<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Bakiner Onur<br>
  Abstract: Since the 1980s a number of countries have established truth commissions to come to terms with the legacy of past human rights violations, yet little is known about the achievements and shortcomings of this popular transitional justice tool. Drawing on research on Chile's National Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Peru's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and exploring the scholarship on thirteen other transitional contexts, Onur Bakiner evaluates the success of truth commissions in promoting policy reform, human rights accountability, and the public recognition of human rights violations. He argues that although political elites often see a truth commission as a convenient way to address past atrocities, the findings, historical narratives, and recommendations of such commissions often surprise, upset, and discredit influential political actors. Even when commissions produce only modest change as a result of political constraints, Bakiner contends, they open up new avenues for human rights activism by triggering the creation of new victims' organizations, facilitating public debates over social memory, and inducing civil society actors to monitor the country's human rights policy.<br>

It was clearly a moment for Kellner and his audience to savor; together, the Arab Spring and Occupy protests of 2011 seemed to vindicate the very idea of revolution and with it the work of a philosopher variously dismissed as impractical, irrational, irrelevant, and<br>

  Book Title: Timing Canada-The Shifting Politics of Time in Canadian Literary Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Huebener Paul<br>
  Abstract: From punch clocks to prison sentences, from immigration waiting periods to controversial time-zone boundaries, from Indigenous grave markers that count time in centuries rather than years, to the fact that free time is shrinking faster for women than for men - time shapes the fabric of Canadian society every day, but in ways that are not always visible or logical. In Timing Canada, Paul Huebener draws from cultural history, time-use surveys, political statements, literature, and visual art to craft a detailed understanding of how time operates as a form of power in Canada. Time enables everything we do - as Margaret Atwood writes, "without it we can't live." However, time also disempowers us, divides us, and escapes our control. Huebener transforms our understanding of temporal power and possibility by using examples from Canadian and Indigenous authors - including Jeannette Armstrong, Joseph Boyden, Dionne Brand, Timothy Findley, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Gabrielle Roy, and many others - who witness, question, dismantle, and reconstruct the functioning of time in their works. As the first comprehensive study of the cultural politics of time in Canada, Timing Canada develops foundational principles of critical time studies and everyday temporal literacy, and demonstrates how time functions broadly as a tool of power, privilege, and imagination within a multicultural and multi-temporal nation.<br>

  Abstract: In

The ratio between financial and imaginative success was inverse. One can see this in the counterculture as late as the 1960s, when the American bohemian writer Seymour Krim could say, “if you are a proud, searching ‘failure’ in this society, and we can take ironic comfort<br>

Jameson’s negative utopianism embraces this aspect of failure, but it is important to understand that this failure is not simply the commonplace fatality of a compromised individual or authorial imagination. It is, instead, what Jameson calls “the systemic, cultural, and ideological closure of which we are all in one way or another prisoners.”¹ Despite Thomas More’s inspiration for, and association with, utopianism of<br>

In the process of structuring social experience, narrative necessarily reinvents itself in each epoch, offering an historically specific experience.

  Abstract: French exceptionalism in politics comes down in many respects to French ‘political culture’. ‘Political culture’ is used here to mean the orientation that people have towards politics and their expectations of political action. However, political culture is not a passive given. Political culture is inherited from the past but it is adapted and built on by political institutions which in this way help shape a society’s attitudes to politics. In the case of the French Communist Party (Parti communiste français: PCF), it successfully picked up and used aspects of a pre-existing political culture but it also added its own components.<br>

Like the Vietnam War for the United States a decade later, it tore through the very fabric of French society, and destroyed the fragile institutions of the Fourth Republic, bringing de Gaulle to power in 1958. Sartre again found himself in a triangular relation with the PCF and the anti-Stalinist left. Above all, the war led to a profound and lasting radicalisation of Sartre’s position.<br>

Second, much of this innovation originates, or is seen to originate, from outside the cosmic order both of the pantheon and of society.

As a social construction, time is a narrative through which events and nonevents are ordered in relation to people. Within society, time sets some crucial standards for living. Both individuals and societies try to reproduce themselves and try to keep themselves healthy, sometimes in conflicting ways.

  Book Title: Writings on Medicine-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Todd<br>
  Abstract: At the time of his death in 1995, Georges Canguilhem was a highly respected historian of science and medicine, whose engagement with questions of normality, the ideologization of scientific thought, and the conceptual history of biology had marked the thought of philosophers such as Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Pierre Bourdieu, and Gilles Deleuze. This collection of short, incisive, and highly accessible essays on the major concepts of modern medicine shows Canguilhem at the peak of his use of historical practice for philosophical engagement. In order to elaborate a philosophy of medicine, Canguilhem examines paramount problems such as the definition and uses of health, the decline of the Hippocratic understanding of nature, the experience of disease, the limits of psychology in medicine, myths and realities of therapeutic practices, the difference between cure and healing, the organism's self-regulation, and medical metaphors linking the organism to society. Writings on Medicine is at once an excellent introduction to Canguilhem's work and a forceful, insightful, and accessible engagement with elemental concepts in medicine. The book is certain to leave its imprint on anthropology, history, philosophy, bioethics, and the social studies of medicine.<br>

  Book Title: Archaeology and Memory-  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): Borić Dušan<br>
  Abstract: Memory can be both a horrifying trauma and an empowering resource. From the Ancient Greeks to Nietzsche and Derrida, the dilemma about the relationship between history and memory has filled many pages, with one important question singled out: is the writing of history to memory a remedy or a poison? Recently, a growing interest in and preoccupation with the issue of memory, remembering and forgetting has resulted in a proliferation of published works, in various disciplines, that have memory as their focus. This trend, to which the present volume contributes, has started to occupy the dominant discourses of disciplines such as sociology, philosophy, history, anthropology and archaeology, and has also disseminated into the wider public discourse of society and culture today. Such a condition may perhaps echo the phenomenon of a melancholic experience at the turn of the millennium. Archaeology and Memory seeks to examine the diversity of mnemonic systems and their significance in different past contexts as well as the epistemological and ontological importance of archaeological practice and narratives in constituting the human historical condition. The twelve substantial contributions in this volume cover a diverse set of regional examples and focus on a range of prehistoric and classical case studies in Eurasian regional contexts as well as on the predicaments of memory in examples of the archaeologies of 'contemporary past'. From the Mesolithic and Neolithic burial chambers to the trenches of World War I and the role of materiality in international criminal courts, a number of contributors examine how people in the past have thought about their own pasts, while others reflect on our own present-day sensibilities in dealing with the material testimonies of recent history. Both kinds of papers offer wider theoretical reflections on materiality, archaeological methodologies and the ethical responsibilities of archaeological narration about the past.<br>

  Author(s): O’Connor Terry<br>
  Abstract: This volume is derived, in concept, from a conference held in honour of John Evans by the School of History and Archaeology and The Prehistoric Society at Cardiff University in March 2006. It brings together papers that address themes and landscapes on a variety of levels. They cover geographical, methodological and thematic areas that were of interest to, and had been studied by, John Evans. The volume is divided into five sections, which echo themes of importance in British prehistory. They include papers on aspects of environmental archaeology, experiments and philosophy; new research on the nature of woodland on the chalklands of southern England; coasts and islands; people, process and social order, and snails and shells - a strong part of John Evans' career. This volume presents a range of papers examining people's interaction with the landscape in all its forms. The papers provide a diverse but cohesive picture of how archaeological landscapes are viewed within current research frameworks and approaches, while also paying tribute to the innovative and inspirational work of one of the leading protagonists of environmental archaeology and the holistic approach to landscape interpretation.<br>

  Abstract: This book examines how evangelicals in Northern Ireland read the Troubles (1966–2007) in the light of how they read the Bible. Notwithstanding its rootedness in the Northern Ireland context, this work is more than yet another addition to the existing articles and monographs that constitute the historiography of the Troubles. By considering the ways in which evangelical readings of the Bible inform their interpretations of society, this work supervenes on issues that reach out beyond this specific field of scholarly debate and makes sustained critical incursions into the much larger academic provinces of critical theory, hermeneutics and biblical studies.<br>

  Book Title: Drinking from the Wells of New Creation-The Holy Spirit and the Imagination in Reconciliation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Dearborn Kerry<br>
  Abstract: The Holy Spirit, as God’s abiding presence to draw people to Christ, can cleanse wounds and bring love and hope into our hearts. Kerry Dearborn’s insightful focus on the Holy Spirit transforming our moral imagination and putting us on the path of reconciliation with Jesus Christ is both profound and encouraging. Biblical analysis, historical surveys and references to acclaimed theological authors support Dearborn’s nuanced yet practical application of imagination as a tool for awakening, recovery, and dissolving intellectual or psychological barriers that isolate us from God. She considers effectively how imagination can be connected to reality, and is able to delve deep into this vein of thought with startling clarity. Drinking from the Wells of New Creation provides spiritual guidance for dealing with oppression in society; an issue that affects people both within and outside the Christian faith. The acknowledgement of reconciliation as a creative process provides a fresh outlook and will excite those delving into both theological and psychological studies, as well as those seeking to understand God’s unification of life, regardless of tribe, tongue and nation.<br>

  Book Title: Justification in a Post-Christian Society-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Gunner Göran<br>
  Abstract: Since the Reformation in the sixteenth century, Lutheran traditions have impacted culture and politics in many societies. At the same time, Lutheran belief has had an effect on personal faith, morality, and ethics. Modern society, however, is quite different from that at the time of the Reformation. How should we evaluate Lutheran tradition in today’s Western multicultural and post-Christian society? Is it possible to develop a Lutheran theological position that can be regarded as reasonable in a society that evidences a considerable weakening of the role of Christianity? What are the challenges raised by cultural diversity for a Lutheran theology and ethics? Is it possible to develop a Lutheran identity in a multicultural society, and is there any fruitful Lutheran contribution to the coexistence of diff erent religious and non-religious traditions in the future?<br>

On the other hand, we have a Protestantism of blood and flesh which knows that faith, hope, and love can only thrive in and through social forms of embodiment.

  Book Title: Biblical Knowing-A Scriptural Epistemology of Error<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Bartholomew Craig G.<br>
  Abstract: The Christian Scriptures could be theologically described as beginning and ending with an epistemological outlook. The first episode of humanity’s activity centers on the knowledge of good and evil. The final stage of humanity is pictured by Jeremiah as a universally prophetic and knowing society: 'And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord', for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord' (Jer 31:34). What happens to knowledge in between? In this work, Dru Johnson reconsiders epistemology with the tool of biblical theology: an approach to knowledge as developed in Genesis 2 and explored throughout the Tanakh (i.e., the Old Testament) and New Testament. By re-examining the neglected idea that Christian Scripture might be developing robust descriptions of knowing that can direct us today, the ambition of this book is to lay the groundwork for a biblical theology of knowledge - how knowledge is broached, described, and how error is rectified within the texts of the Christian canon. Proper knowing as it occurs in the Scriptures means that there are better and worse ways to know. Even more, the epistemology that is found to be advocated in Scripture is not relegated to religious knowing. Johnson argues that scientific epistemology and biblical epistemology make significant points of contact suggesting that they are fundamentally consistent with each other.<br>

  Abstract: This ethnography explores how Balinese citizens produce postcolonial intimacy-a complex interaction of claims to proximity and mutuality between themselves and the Dutch under colonialism that continues today. Such claims, Ana Dragojlovic explains, are crucial for the diasporic reconfiguration of kebalian, or Balinese-ness, a concept that encompasses the personal, social, and cultural complexities involved in Balinese identity in Dutch postcolonial society. This identity enables Balinese migrants to see themselves as carriers of unique cultural traditions both promoted by and in disagreement with Dutch cultural values.<br>

  Author(s) Herzfeld Michael<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, I analyze the Balinese reception of a major exhibition featuring Balinese royal regalia obtained during the Dutch colonial conquest. This analysis allows me to tease out the correlations that my interlocutors make between the looted objects and their own Balinese presence in contemporary Dutch society.

  Abstract: Claude Lévi-Strauss is often accused of paying too little regard for history and human agency. But this is misguided, for as the above quote shows, Lévi-Strauss, notwithstanding the importance he attached to the study of the unconscious mind, clearly felt that history and agency contribute crucially to the way in which we live our lives, for otherwise (and whether or not

  Abstract: While some cultural critics are pronouncing the death of the novel, a whole generation of novelists have turned to other media with curiosity rather than fear. These novelists are not simply incorporating references to other media into their work for the sake of verisimilitude, they are also engaging precisely such media as a way of talking about what it means to write and read narrative in a society filled with stories told outside the print medium.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter takes as its focus the question of how Hopi feelings, experiences, and knowledge of the past are, or can be, translated. Our motivation for this chapter grew out of our work together and conversations about the first author’s own (non-Pueblo) experiences at ancient sites compared to how the second author perceives the role of the past in his own life and more broadly in Hopi society. From our exchanges we have to come to believe that addressing the ways in which these two disparate affinities for the material past—and ultimately closing the gap between non-Pueblo and Pueblo<br>

  Book Title: Violence in Francophone African and Caribbean Women's Literature-  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): KALISA CHANTAL<br>
  Abstract: Chantal Kalisa examines the ways in which women writers lift taboos imposed on them by their society and culture and challenge readers with their unique perspectives on violence. Comparing women from different places and times, Kalisa treats types of violence such as colonial, familial, linguistic, and war-related, specifically linked to dictatorship and genocide. She examines Caribbean writers Michele Lacrosil, Simone Schwartz-Bart, Gisèle Pineau, and Edwidge Danticat, and Africans Ken Begul, Calixthe Beyala, Nadine Bar, and Monique Ilboudo. She also includes Sembène Ousmane and Frantz Fanon for their unique contributions to the questions of violence and gender. This study advances our understanding of the attempts of African and Caribbean women writers to resolve the tension between external forms of violence and internal forms resulting from skewed cultural, social, and political rules based on gender.<br>

  Book Title: Forms of Life-Character and Moral Imagination in the Novel<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): PRICE MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Martin Price writes here about ways in which character has been conceived and presented in the novels of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Beginning with chapters that cogently argue the artistic value of character, Price then deals with the different forms character has taken in individual novels. His first discussions center on authors-Jane Austen, Stendhal, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, and Leo Tolstoy-who define individuals by their adherence or opposition to social norms. The next chapters deal with novelists for whom the moral world is largely internalized. The characters of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, D.H. Lawrence, and E.M. Forster live in society and act upon it, but the authors are particularly concerned with the confusions, terrors, and heroism that lie within consciousness. The last chapter uses novels about the artist by James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Thomas Mann in order to apprehend the process by which experience is transformed into art.<br>

Tylor (1832–1917). Hartland was a prominent figure in the Folklore Society, which he presided over at the turn of the century. Indeed, he was one of the members of the “Great Team” of British late Victorian folklorists, to use the expression coined by Richard Dorson (1968:202). Between 1884 and 1924 Hartland’s prolific production included his magnum opus: a three-volume work titled

  Abstract: À l’heure de la désaffection des traditions religieuses historiques, les couvents, les monastères et les abbayes qui émaillent les paysages de nos villes et de nos campagnes sont menacés de déshérence : les communautés qui les ont bâtis, habités et qui en ont assuré la survie n’ont plus les moyens d’assumer leur charge patrimoniale. En même temps que s’impose l’affection citoyenne pour ces vastes ensembles et leurs jardins, ceux-ci sont de plus en plus convoités à des fins de développement. Que faire de cet héritage riche et lourd ? Cet ouvrage collectif regroupe des contributions qui apportent des pistes de réflexion sur les problèmes de la sécularisation, de la réaffectation ou de la gouvernance d’anciens ensembles conventuels. Il vise également à nourrir la discussion sur les implications financières, juridiques, urbanistiques et mémorielles du changement de vocation des couvents et de leur mise en valeur. In this time of abandonment of historical religious traditions, the convents, monasteries, and abbeys that punctuate our rural and urban landscapes are in danger of becoming escheated properties. The communities who built them, lived in them, and have thus far ensured their survival can no longer bear the burden of their heritage value. These magnificent properties and their gardens are increasingly the objects of society’s affection, and yet at the same time are more and more coveted by real estate developers. What is to be done with such a rich and weighty legacy? This collective publication brings together contributions that provide ways of thinking about the issues of secularization, adaptive reuse, or the governance of former religious buildings. It also intends to contribute to the debate on the financial, legal, urbanistic, and memorial implications of the new destinies of convents and their redevelopment.<br>

  Abstract: Thinking about perceptions of body as they are used in the Bible leads, inevitably, to reflecting on clothing and the idea of clothing. Clothing is a powerful image throughout biblical literature and in human society generally.¹ At the most obvious level, clothing covers and conceals the body, protecting it from exposure to the elements and the view of other persons. But the significance of clothing extends much further since garments not only cover and conceal, but also function to display the body in particular ways and with many meanings. The ways in which bodies are clothed have far-reaching and sometimes<br>

  Book Title: Taking Hold of the Real-Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Profound Worldliness of Christianity<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Harvey Barry<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer writes in one of his last prison letters that he had “come to know and understand more and more the profound this-worldliness of Christianity." In Taking Hold of the Real, Barry Harvey engages in constructive conversation with Bonhoeffer, contending that the “shallow and banal this-worldliness" of modern society is ordered to a significant degree around the social technologies of religion, culture, and race. These mechanisms displace human beings from their traditional connections with particular locales, and relocate them in their “proper places" as determined by the nation-state and capitalist markets. Christians are called to participate in the profound this-worldliness that breaks into the world in the apocalyptic action of Jesus Christ, a form of life that requires discipline and an understanding of death and resurrection. The church is a sacrament of this new humanity, performing for all to hear the polyphony of life that was prefigured in the Old Testament and now is realised in Christ. Unable to find a faithful form of this-worldliness in wartime Germany, Bonhoeffer joined the conspiracy against Hitler, a decision aptly contrasted with a small French church that, prepared by its life together over many generations, saved thousands of Jewish lives.<br>

  Book Title: Indebted-Capitalism and Religion in the Writings of S. Y. Agnon<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Sagiv Yonatan<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book to examine the oeuvre of Shmuel Yosef Agnon, 1966 Nobel laureate in literature, through a reading that combines perspectives from economic theory, semiotics, psychoanalysis, narrative theory, and Jewish and religious studies. Sagiv outlines the vital role economy plays in the construction of religion, subjectivity, language, and thought in Agnon's work, and, accordingly, explores his literary use of images of debt, money, and economy to examine how these themes illuminate other focal points in the canonical author's work, excavating the economic infrastructure of discourses that are commonly considered to reside beyond the economic sphere.Sagiv's analysis of Agnon's work, renowned for its paradoxical articulation of the impact of modernity on traditional Jewish society, exposes an overarching distrust regarding the sustainability of any economic structure. The concrete and symbolic economies surveyed in this project are prone to cyclical crises. Under what Sagiv terms Agnon's "law of permanent debt," the stability and profitability of economies are always temporary. Agnon's literary economy, transgressing traditional closures, together with his profound irony, make it impossible to determine if these economic crises are indeed the product of the break with tradition or, alternatively, if this theodicy is but a fantasy, marking permanent debt as the inherent economic infrastructure of human existence.<br>

  Abstract: Money was the rising star at the turn of the nineteenth century in Europe. Heralded by many contemporary economists as the symbol of economic rationality and the facilitator of a stable social order, money was considered one of the greatest institutional advances of humankind.¹ Yet in spite of such warm praises, money also gained a rather dubious reputation. Rumor had it that money was indeed something unimportant, at times even suspicious, a neutral “veil” that only obscures the “real” economic basis of society, namely, the good old practice of barter, the direct exchange of good and services.²<br>

  Abstract: It is Jürgen Habermas (1981) himself who quite some time ago had challenged us that now we need a new philosophy of science which is not scientistic. It is worth asking Habermas, and all of us sociologists for whom sociological engagement is nothing more than an elaboration of the agenda of modernity, whether we need an understanding of and relationship with modernity which is not modernistic. This inquiry is at the core of understanding paths of civil society and experiments with modernities, not only in India but also in Europe, East Asia, Africa, Latin America and around the world.

  Author(s) Susen Simon<br>
  Abstract: Whereas in recent years many of sociologists and philosophers have come to the conclusion that religion has to be taken seriously in debates about modern politics and the public sphere, such was not the case with many post-war social theorists. Louis Althusser, Luc Boltanski, Ralf Dahrendorf, Norbert Elias, Anthony Giddens, David Harvey, Edward Said and Göran Therborn either ignored religion or paid little attention to it, rather than treating it as a central aspect of modern society. Michel Foucault was probably alone in his consistent interest in religion – for example, in his essays on medieval Christian teaching on chastity<br>

Do blacks want to maintain themselves indefinitely as a distinct, politically autonomous subnation and to view their autonomy, not simply as a means to full and equal civic standing within a multiracial democratic polity, but as an intrinsic goal? Or should they, following the principles of pragmatic nationalism, regard themselves as a community burdened by the stigma of race and racial inequality, collectively seeking to bring about a society where individuals are no longer unfairly disadvantaged because of their racial classification?<br>

  Book Title: Fueling Culture-101 Words for Energy and Environment<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yaeger Patricia<br>
  Abstract: How has our relation to energy changed over time? What differences do particular energy sources make to human values, politics, and imagination? How have transitions from one energy source to another—from wood to coal, or from oil to solar to whatever comes next—transformed culture and society? What are the implications of uneven access to energy in the past, present, and future? Which concepts and theories clarify our relation to energy, and which just get in the way? Fueling Culture offers a compendium of keywords written by scholars and practitioners from around the world and across the humanities and social sciences. These keywords offer new ways of thinking about energy as both the source and the limit of how we inhabit culture, with the aim of opening up new ways of understanding the seemingly irresolvable contradictions of dependence upon unsustainable energy forms. Fueling Culture brings together writing that is risk-taking and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from literary and cultural studies, environmental history and ecocriticism, political economy and political ecology, postcolonial and globalization studies, and materialisms old and new. Keywords in this volume include: Aboriginal, Accumulation, Addiction, Affect, America, Animal, Anthropocene, Architecture, Arctic, Automobile, Boom, Canada, Catastrophe, Change, Charcoal, China, Coal, Community, Corporation, Crisis, Dams, Demand, Detritus, Disaster, Ecology, Electricity, Embodiment, Ethics, Evolution, Exhaust, Fallout, Fiction, Fracking, Future, Gender, Green, Grids, Guilt, Identity, Image, Infrastructure, Innervation, Kerosene, Lebenskraft, Limits, Media, Metabolism, Middle East, Nature, Necessity, Networks, Nigeria, Nuclear, Petroviolence, Photography, Pipelines, Plastics, Renewable, Resilience, Risk, Roads, Rubber, Rural, Russia, Servers, Shame, Solar, Spill, Spiritual, Statistics, Surveillance, Sustainability, Tallow, Texas, Textiles, Utopia, Venezuela, Whaling, Wood, Work For a full list of ~<br>

  Abstract: The past is always present in Northern Ireland, structuring everyday experience to a degree not generally found elsewhere. In a society where historical events are continually relevant to contemporary life, both cultural memory and processes of memorialization become significant means whereby people live out their identities. In turn, this level of awareness also informs aspects of the visual: artists are not separate from the culture they inhabit but are equally formed by its shared experiences of community, danger, and loss. Much of the work of artists in post-conflict Northern Ireland bears the marks of this communality of experience, whether through<br>

Her ancestors on both the Italian and the Russian side were aristocratic people born to wealth and privilege, but the Russians in her family tree were notable for not allowing privilege to blind them to the human misery at the bottom of society, a misery endured by the moujiks (slaves) to serve the interests of the rich.

  Abstract: “Secularism” is a philosophy that holds that the affairs and organization of society should be arranged according to principles and rules derived from experience and human insight without reference to customs, revelations, or sacred books whose authority is derived from God or the gods or ancestors. It is distinct from the process of “secularization” whereby the state, professions such as medicine and law, and academic fields such as archeology gradually take over areas of human life once governed by religion and the church. Both words derive from the Latin word

  Abstract: When sponsors invite a dhalang and his troupe to perform at a ritual celebration, the guests’ attention is further distracted away from the sponsors. The performance once again dissembles and enhances the sponsors’ aura of authority, as the sponsors seek to make the dhalang’s voice an extension of their own. In particular, they hope his voice will win the guests’ voluntary, yet total, submission. Relations between the sponsors of a wayang and the dhalang who performs it, however, are complicated.

  Abstract: Gerald Graff argues that our schools and colleges make the intellectual life seem more opaque, narrowly specialized, and beyond normal learning capacities than it is or needs to be. Left clueless in the academic world, many students view the life of the mind as a secret society for which only an elite few qualify.In a refreshing departure from standard diatribes against academia, Graff shows how academic unintelligibility is unwittingly reinforced not only by academic jargon and obscure writing, but by the disconnection of the curriculum and the failure to exploit the many connections between academia and popular culture. Finally, Graff offers a wealth of practical suggestions for making the culture of ideas and arguments more accessible to students, showing how students can enter the public debates that permeate their lives.<br>

  Abstract: IT IS NOT SURPRISING if students feel ambivalent about talking the talk of the academic world, since this ambivalence is pervasive in the larger society in which academics’ funny way of talking is a common joke. Nor is it surprising if teachers themselves so internalize this ambivalence that they hesitate to ask students to master academic discourse, or they fail to master it themselves. Like other divisive issues in academia, the unresolved debates over academic discourse tend to reach students in the form of curricular mixed messages rather than straightforward discussions of the problem.<br>

Although the same can be said of current literary practitioners, something else can be said as well: Unlike those who interpret books today, earlier critics possessed an implicit belief in literature’s significance, not simply because literature espoused a point of view,<br>

However, such a distinctive definition of eroticism seems to be compromised by the concept of pornography, which, at least over the last fifteen years, is increasingly thought to circumscribe the same semantic space.¹ This confirms that the concept of eroticism is highly subjective as it depends on a moral judgment, which, by virtue of its very existence, makes the theoretical use of the former concept unstable.

  Abstract: From 1958 to 1969 General Charles de Gaulle wholly dominated the landscape of French politics. One cannot understand France during the 1960s, as well as the nature of the political system against which the sixty-eighters rebelled, without examining the general’s central role. By the same token, the political closure the general had mandated engendered a trenchant body of oppositional cultural criticism that ultimately succeeded in undermining Gaullism’s credibility as a political model. As the decade evolved, pathbreaking works of fiction, film, and theory emerged, forming a cultural template through which the sixty-eighters viewed the shortcomings of postwar French society.<br>

  Abstract: To speak, in contemporary society, of art and beauty in the same sentence, much less as realities integrally involved with one another, is to risk becoming the object of smiling condescension. The great philosophers of beauty in the eighteenth century, including Burke, Hume, and Kant, treated beauty as a matter of sensation or taste, as either a physiological experience or a spiritual one, but always a subjective one. The arts of the beautiful were thought “to gentrify” the soul, softening it, making it more sympathetic in itself and sociable as part of a culture.¹ They succeeded in providing to the<br>

  Author(s) Callahan Daniel<br>
  Abstract: There is no reason to doubt that a society can indeed very well be judged on the basis of how it takes care of its elderly. By assuring high-quality care, whether by providing it directly in public institutions or by supporting private caregivers, society could demonstrate its appreciation to a whole generation. High-quality care is an ethical concern in at least two senses: providing good care for the elderly is itself an ethical obligation; and care must be provided in an ethical manner, that is, the human dimensions of care ought to take the central place.<br>

  Book Title: Redescribing the Gospel of Mark-  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Merrill P.<br>
  Abstract: This final volume of studies by members of the Society of Biblical Literature's consultation, and later seminar, on Ancient Myths and Modern Theories of Christian Origins focuses on Mark. As with previous volumes, the provocative proposals on Christian origins offered by Burton L. Mack are tested by applying Jonathan Z. Smith's distinctive social theorizing and comparative method. Essays examine Mark as an author's writing in a book culture, a writing that responded to situations arising out of the first Roman-Judean war after the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 CE. Contributors William E. Arnal, Barry S. Crawford, Burton L. Mack, Christopher R. Matthews, Merrill P. Miller, Jonathan Z. Smith, and Robyn Faith Walsh explore the southern Levant as a plausible provenance of the Gospel of Mark and provide a detailed analysis of the construction of Mark as a narrative composed without access to prior narrative sources about Jesus. A concluding retrospective follows the work of the seminar, its developing discourse and debates, and the continuing work of successor groups in the field.<br>

  Book Title: Identity and Control-How Social Formations Emerge (Second Edition)<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): White Harrison C.<br>
  Abstract: In this completely revised edition of one of the foundational texts of network sociology, Harrison White refines and enlarges his groundbreaking theory of how social structure and culture emerge from the chaos and uncertainty of social life. Incorporating new contributions from a group of young sociologists and many fascinating and novel case studies, Identity and Control is the only major book of social theory that links social structure with the lived experience of individuals, providing a rich perspective on the kinds of social formations that develop in the process. Going beyond traditional sociological dichotomies such as agency/structure, individual/society, or micro/macro,
      Identity and Controlpresents a toolbox of concepts that will be useful to a wide range of social scientists, as well as those working in public policy, management, or associational life and, beyond, to any reader who is interested in understanding the dynamics of social life.<br>

  Abstract: When the beachy amish-mennonites withdrew from the Old Order Amish,¹ they not only loosened restrictions on dress and technology usage, but adopted evangelical Christian theology, that is, a preoccupation with the sudden, dramatic salvation of individual souls (Cronk; Geiger). Yet, Beachy Amish-Mennonites have sought to retain Amish characteristics, including an emphasis on lifelong redemption through separatist community life, defined gender roles, and distinct practices. This hybridization of evangelical and Old Order reorganized their society in nuanced ways, including how women contributed to community and family formation. Among the Amish, women are responsible for having and raising children, that is, perpetuating<br>

Even though migration constitutes the ‘normality’ of many societies to a greater or lesser degree, the public and, not least, the sociopolitical discourses of migration, are still predominantly shaped by the view that the large-scale movement of people somehow constitutes a problem.

  Author(s): Apitzsch Ursula<br>
  Abstract: The turn to biographical methods in social science is invigorating the relationship between policy and practice. This book shows how biographical methods can improve theoretical understanding of professional practice, as well as enrich the development of professionals, and promote more meaningful practitioner - service user relationships.This book uses a range of interpretive approaches to reveal the dynamics of service users' and professionals' individual experiences and life-worlds. From their research the contributors show how biographical methods can improve theoretical understanding of professional practice, as well as enrich the learning and development of professionals, and promote more meaningful and creative practitioner - service user relationships. The book: · reviews applications of biographical methods in both policy and practice in a range of professional contexts, from health and social care to education and employment; · explores the impact of social change in three main arenas - transformation from Eastern to Western types of society in Europe, major shifts in social and welfare principles, experiences of immigration and of new cultural diversities - on professional practice; · critically evaluates subjective and reflexive processes in interactions between researchers, practitioners and users of services; · considers the institutional arrangements and cultural contexts which support effective and sensitive interventions; · draws on actual projects and tracks reflection, progress and outcomes. With contributions from leading international experts, it provides a valuable comparative perspective. Researchers, policy analysts and practitioners, postgraduate students, teachers and trainers will find this book a stimulating read.<br>

  Abstract: The Holocaust did not only divide humanity into survivors, bystanders, perpetrators and rescuers and define generations as first, second and third generations of each category. The Holocaust also reinforced perspectives that became associated with the construction of collective memory, especially in countries where society identified itself, or was identified by, these categories, specifically Israel and Germany. ‘Who was a Holocaust survivor?’ was determined first legally and then historically (Gutman, 1990). In Israel, this identity became an important issue in terms of social labelling in the 1950s, and later became salient in terms of self-chosen categorisation in the 1980s and 1990s<br>

  Author(s): Bradley Quintin<br>
  Abstract: A critical analysis of neighbourhood planning. Setting empirical evidence from the UK against international examples, the Editors engage in broader debates on the purposes of planning and the devolution of power to localities.Governments around the world are seeing the locality as a key arena for effecting changes in governance, restructuring state/civil society relations and achieving sustainable growth. This is the first book to critically analyse this shift towards localism in planning through exploring neighbourhood planning; one of the fastest growing, most popular and most contentious contemporary planning initiatives. Bringing together original empirical research with critical perspectives on governance and planning, the book engages with broader debates on the purposes of planning, the construction of active citizenship, the uneven geographies of localism and the extent to which power is actually being devolved. Setting this within an international context with cases from the US, Australia and France the book reflects on the possibilities for the emergence of a more progressive form of localism.<br>

  Book Title: The Qing Formation in World-Historical Time-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Struve Lynn A.<br>
  Abstract: For many years, the Ming and Qing dynasties have been grouped as “late imperial China," a temporal framework that allows scholars to identify and evaluate indigenous patterns of social, economic, and cultural change initiated in the last century of Ming rule that imparted a particular character to state and society throughout the Qing and into the twentieth century. This paradigm asserts the autonomous character of social change in China and has allowed historians to create a “China-centered history." Recently, however, many scholars have begun emphasizing the singular qualities of the Qing. Among the eight contributors to this volume on the formation of the Qing, those who emphasize the Manchu ethos of the Qing tend to see it as part of an early modernity and stress parallel and sometimes mutually reinforcing patterns of political consolidation and cultural integration across Eurasia. Other contributors who examine the Qing formation from the perspective of those who lived through the dynastic transition see the advent of Qing rule as prompting attempts by the Chinese subjects of the new empire to make sense of what they perceived as a historical disjuncture and to rework these understandings into an accommodation to foreign rule. In contrast to the late imperial paradigm, the new ways of configuring the Qing in historical time in both groups of essays assert the singular qualities of the Qing formation.<br>

Their resounding silence about race, and his exclusion from their canons, bespeak the very conditions he analyzes as a political and moral catastrophe. These conditions are, in short, ongoing racial domination as the foundation of American life, and its disavowal by those it enfranchises. On<br>

  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>

  Abstract: The events of 1968 have been seen as a decisive turning point in the Western world. The author takes a critical look at "May 1968" and questions whether the events were in fact as "revolutionary" as French and foreign commentators have indicated. He concludes the student movement changed little that had not already been challenged and altered in the late fifties and early sixties. The workers' strikes led to fewer working hours and higher wages, but these reforms reflected the secular demands of the French labor movement. "May 1968" was remarkable not because of the actual transformations it wrought but rather by virtue of the revolutionary power that much of the media and most scholars have attributed to it and which turned it into a symbol of a youthful, renewed, and freer society in France and beyond.<br>

In fact, according to Robert F.

  Abstract: Felix Rosenheim, a taciturn man, had kept a journal since his arrival in Jaffa in 1936, when he was twenty-four. In essence, it was the journal of a stranger, someone ill equipped to cope with the mental and physical pressures of the climate and the new society. In his journal, the carefully chiseled German prose, the classical German of Goethe and Schiller, conferred upon the content a cool ironic tone. What the irony concealed was the<br>

  Book Title: Vatican II and Beyond-The Changing Mission and Identity of Canadian Women Religious<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Smyth Elizabeth M.<br>
  Abstract: The year 2015 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second Vatican Council, which aimed to align the Church with the modern world. Over the last five decades, women religious have engaged with the council’s reforms with unprecedented enthusiasm, far exceeding the expectations of the Church. Addressing how Canadian women religious envisioned and lived out the changes in religious life brought on by a pluralistic and secularizing world, Vatican II and Beyond analyzes the national organization of female and male congregations, the Canadian Religious Conference, and the lives of two individual sisters: visionary congregational leader Alice Trudeau and social justice activist Mary Alban. This book focuses on the new transnational networks, feminist concepts, professionalization of religious life, and complex political landscapes that emerged during this period of drastic transition as women religious sought to reconstruct identities, redefine roles, and signify vision and mission at both the personal and collective levels. Following women religious as they encountered new meanings of faith in their congregations, the Church, and society at large, Vatican II and Beyond demonstrates that the search for a renewed vision was not just a response to secularization, but a way to be reborn as Catholic women.The year 2015 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second Vatican Council, which aimed to align the Church with the modern world.

  Book Title: The Ambiguous Allure of the West-Traces of the Colonial in Thailand<br>
  Publisher: Hong Kong University Press, HKU<br>
  Author(s): Chakrabarty Dipesh<br>
  Abstract: The book brings studies of modern Thai history and culture into dialogue with debates in comparative intellectual history, Asian cultural studies, and postcolonial studies. It takes Thai Studies in new directions through case studies of the cultural hybridity and ambivalences that have emerged from the manifold interactions between Siam/Thailand and the West from 1850 to the present day. Central aims of The Ambiguous Allure of the West are to critique notions of Thai "uniqueness" or "exceptionalism" and locate Thai Studies in a broader, comparative perspective by arguing that modern Siam/Thailand needs to be understood as a semicolonial society. In contrast to conservative nationalist and royalist accounts of Thai history and culture, which resist comparing the country to its once-colonized Asian neighbours, this book's contributors highlight the value of postcolonial analysis in understanding the complexly ambiguous, interstitial, liminal and hybrid character of Thai/Western cultural interrelationships. At the same time, by pointing to the distinctive position of semicolonial societies in the Western-dominated world order, the chapters in this book make significant contributions to developing the critical theoretical perspectives of international cultural studies. The contributors demonstrate how the disciplines of history, anthropology, political science, film and cultural studies all enhance these contestations in intersecting ways, and across different historical moments. Each of the chapters raises manifold themes and questions regarding the nature of intercultural exchange, interrogated through theoretically critical lenses. This book directs its discussions at those studying not only in the fields of Thai and Southeast Asian studies but also in colonial and postcolonial studies, Asian cultural studies, film studies and comparative critical theory.<br>

To Thais of all social strata, the relationship with the West has entailed a paradoxical set of desires: how to catch up with the West without “kissing the asses of the farang” (tam kon farang); how<br>

  Abstract: Any national literature is to some significant extent a mirror held up to its people’s collective countenance: its myths, aspirations, national triumphs and traumas, current ideologies, historical understanding, linguistic traditions.

  Book Title: Signs and Society-Further Studies in Semiotic Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Parmentier Richard J.<br>
  Abstract: Brilliantly articulating the potent intersections of semiotic and linguistic anthropology, Signs and Society demonstrates how a keen appreciation of signs helps us better understand human agency, meaning, and creativity. Inspired by the foundational contributions of C. S. Peirce and Ferdinand de Saussure, and drawing upon key insights from neighboring scholarly fields, noted anthropologist Richard J. Parmentier develops an array of innovative conceptual tools for ethnographic, historical, and literary research. His concepts of "transactional value," "metapragmatic interpretant," and "circle of semiosis," for example, illuminate the foundations and effects of such diverse cultural forms and practices as economic exchanges on the Pacific island of Palau, Pindar's Victory Odes in ancient Greece, and material representations of transcendence in ancient Egypt and medieval Christianity. Other studies complicate the separation of emic and etic analytical models for such cultural domains as religion, economic value, and semiotic ideology. Provocative and absorbing, these fifteen pioneering essays blaze a trail into anthropology's future while remaining firmly rooted in its celebrated past.<br>

  Abstract: How is the Holocaust remembered in Romania since the fall of communism? Alexandru Florian and an international group of contributors unveil how and why Romania, a place where large segments of the Jewish and Roma populations perished, still fails to address its recent past. These essays focus on the roles of government and public actors that choose to promote, construct, defend, or contest the memory of the Holocaust, as well as the tools-the press, the media, monuments, and commemorations-that create public memory. Coming from a variety of perspectives, these essays provide a compelling view of what memories exist, how they are sustained, how they can be distorted, and how public remembrance of the Holocaust can be encouraged in Romanian society today.<br>

  Abstract: This cross-disciplinary exploration of the role of the sacred, blasphemy and sacrilege in a multicultural society brings together philosophers, theologians, lawyers, historians, curators, anthropologists and sociologists, as well as Christian, Jewish and Islamic and secular perspectives. In bringing together different disciplinary and cultural approaches, the book provides a way of broadening our conceptions of what might count as sacred, sacrilegious and blasphemous, in moral and political terms. In addition, it provides original research data on blasphemy, sacrilege and religious tolerance from a range of disciplines. The book is presented in four sections: Section I: Religion Sacrilege and Blasphemy in Australia. Section II: Sacrilege and the Sacred Section III: The State, Religion and Tolerance Section IV: The Future: Openness and Dogmatism. The book will appeal to both those actively involved in religious negotiation and to scholars and students of religion in history, philosophy, anthropology, sociology and political science.<br>

  Abstract: The traditional political systems of the Malay and Bugis worlds, northern Sumatra and Java, produced a high frequency of female rulers by world standards (Reid 1988:169-172). Nonetheless the élite titles in these systems still tended to be inherited patrilineally even though very different descent principles, usually bilateral but even matrilineal, operated within society as a whole (e.g. Gullick 1958; Palmier 1969; de Josselin de Jong 1980:10; Millar 1989:25). Fox observes that élite patrilinealism within a bilateral system is only one variant, albeit the most common, of a widespread tendency for Austronesian élites to claim a separate origin from commoners and<br>

  Abstract: Education in its most basic sense is coeval with humanity. In historical societies, as the author of a distinguished study of education in Western antiquity has noted, education can be seen as transmitting “the concentrated epitome of a culture and as such it is inseparable from the form of that culture and perishes with it.”¹ In another sense, however, as the conscious effort to form—and reform—human individuals and society to correspond to ideals of imagined but unrealized possibilities, education is one of the great legacies of the Axial turn.

There had, of course, been a Bronze Age palace society, the Mycenaean, in second-millennium bce Greece, with powerful rulers, monumental buildings, and a written script.

  Abstract: Over his twenty-plus year tenure in Hollywood, Spike Lee has produced a number of controversial films that unapologetically confront sensitive social issues, particularly those of race relations and discrimination. Through his honest portrayals of life's social obstacles, he challenges the public to reflect on the world's problems and divisions. The innovative director created a name for himself with feature films such as
         Do the Right Thing(1989) andMalcolm X(1992), and with documentaries such as4 Little Girls(1997) andWhen the Levees Broke(2006), breaking with Hollywood's reliance on cultural stereotypes to portray African Americans in a more realistic light. The director continues to produce poignant films that address some of modern society's most important historical movements and events.<br>

The language of human rights is problematic for theology; for certain perspectives on rights assume an adversarial view of relationships within society and can be erosive of visions and structures of communal life.

  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nylund Anastasia<br>
  Abstract: Narratives are fundamental to our lives: we dream, plan, complain, endorse, entertain, teach, learn, and reminisce through telling stories. They provide hopes, enhance or mitigate disappointments, challenge or support moral order and test out theories of the world at both personal and communal levels. It is because of this deep embedding of narrative in everyday life that its study has become a wide research field including disciplines as diverse as linguistics, literary theory, folklore, clinical psychology, cognitive and developmental psychology, anthropology, sociology, and history. In
      Telling Storiesleading scholars illustrate how narratives build bridges among language, identity, interaction, society, and culture; and they investigate various settings such as therapeutic and medical encounters, educational environments, politics, media, marketing, and public relations. They analyze a variety of topics from the narrative construction of self and identity to the telling of stories in different media and the roles that small and big life stories play in everyday social interactions and institutions. These new reflections on the theory and analysis of narrative offer the latest tools to researchers in the fields of discourse analysis and sociolinguistics.<br>

There was no carrying through consequential reforms, let alone revolutionary transformations, without significantly changing the relationship between, on the one hand, the political, social, and cultural spheres and, on the other, the ecclesiastic sphere. Since criticism of church and, to a lesser degree, religion was central to the enlightenments of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it is hardly surprising that after 1789 and 1917 there should have been a drive for disestablishment, followed by<br>

  Book Title: Genuine Multiculturalism-The Tragedy and Comedy of Diversity<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): FOSTER CECIL<br>
  Abstract: While many modern societies are noted for their diversity, the resulting challenge is to determine how citizens from different backgrounds and cultures can see themselves and each other as equals, and be treated equally. In Genuine Multiculturalism, Cecil Foster shows that a society's failure to bridge these differences is the tragedy of modern living and that pretending it is possible to mechanically develop fraternity and solidarity among diverse groups is akin to seeking out comedy. Arguing that genuine multiculturalism is the search for social justice by individuals who have been trapped by ascribed identities or newcomers who have been shut out of perceived ethnic homelands, Foster details how this process, in essence, is the story of the Americas. Reconceptionalizing the terms of multiculturalism, he offers an intervention into Canada's claim that its definition and practice are based on recognizing equality of citizenship. Identifying genuine multiculturalism as an ongoing work in progress, rather than a tightly defined policy position, Foster challenges readers to imagine a greater and more harmonious ideal. A necessary theoretical reconsideration of diversity within society, Genuine Multiculturalism refocuses the debate about ideals and practices in modern societies.<br>

Strauss wrestled with the question of the sovereign individual and whether one can remain authentic while living in a society – can he or she live happily ever after? Strauss starts always with the desires of the individual in discussing freedom and tyranny. He sees a “crisis in modernity” because neither the individual nor the state knows<br>

  Book Title: Art and Its Uses in Thomas Mann's 'Felix Krull'-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Schonfield Ernest<br>
  Abstract: The turn of the twentieth century was a time of identity crisis for the upper and middle classes, one in which increased social mobility caused the blurring of traditional boundaries and created a need for reference works such as the British Who's Who (1897). At the same time, the rise of a new leisure industry and an increase in international travel led to a boom period for confidence men, who frequently operated in hotels and holiday resorts. Thomas Mann's "Felix Krull", written between 1910-13 and continued (though never completed) in 1951-54, uses contemporary accounts of these figures as a starting-point from which to explore the aesthetics of society. The early Krull marks an important stage in Mann's development in a number of respects.In writing it, Mann acquired a more flexible conception of identity and a new understanding of the relation between artist and public. Krull also signals a deeper engagement with Goethe and a shift in Mann's work towards a more open treatment of sexuality. The novel presents art as being central to the development of the individual and to social interaction. While Krull is nominally a confidence man, he is more of a performance artist, a purveyor of beauty who relies upon the complicity of his audience. The later Krull takes up where Mann left off and continues the justification of art as an essential human activity. This study draws upon unpublished material in order to provide a comprehensive reading of "Felix Krull". It examines the novel within the context of Mann's work as a whole, and, in doing so, it seeks to demonstrate the remarkable continuity of Mann's creative achievement.<br>

  Abstract: The main argument of this book is that, in

The Müller-Rosé episode offers a paradigm of how art works: not as an imposed illusion, but as a mutually agreed, deliberate pretence.¹ The crucial point of this episode is that art is not a deception, but an imaginative exchange which relies upon an intersubjective arrangement. Müller-Rosé requires the ‘stillschweigende[s] Einverständnis’ (294) of his audience in order to succeed. Mann, like Coleridge, is advocating a willing suspension of disbelief,² in<br>

  Book Title: The Uncertain Sciences-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mazlish Bruce<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging book one of the most esteemed cultural historians of our time turns his attention to major questions about human experience and the attempts to understand it "scientifically." Bruce Mazlish considers the achievements, failings, and possibilities of the human sciences-a domain that he broadly defines to include the social sciences, literature, psychology, and hermeneutic studies. In a rich and original synthesis built upon the work of earlier philosophers and historians, Mazlish constructs a new view of the nature and meaning of the human sciences.Starting with the remote human past and moving through the Age of Discovery to the present day, the author discusses what sort of knowledge the human sciences claim to offer. He looks closely at the positivistic aspirations of the human sciences, which are modeled after the natural sciences, and at their interpretive tendencies. In an analysis of scientific method and scientific community, he explores the roles they can or should assume in the human sciences. Mazlish's approach is genuinely interdisciplinary, and he draws on an array of topics, from civil society to globalization to the interactions of humans and machines, to inform his thought-provoking discussion of historical consciousness.<br>

  Abstract: Positivism often is, or at least has been, viewed as a royal road to certainty in both the natural and the human sciences. Philosophically, it is seen as an epistemology that grounds all knowledge in experience and declares some objects accessible to observation and others inaccessible; the former are objects about which knowledge can be obtained, and the latter are not. In the human sciences, positivism takes the form of a sociology that claims that scientific knowledge about society is possible.<br>

Essays explore the historical backgrounds of Paul’s interpretive practices, the question of Paul’s “faithfulness" to the context of his biblical references, the presence of Scripture in letters other than the Hauptbriefe, and the role of Scripture in Paul’s theology. All of the essays look at old questions through new lenses in an effort to break through scholarly impasses and advance the debate in new directions. The contributors are Matthew W. Bates, Linda L.

King notes, by “the rejection of the nationally-constituted society as the appropriate object of discourse, or unit of social and cultural analysis, and to varying degrees, a commitment to conceptualising ‘the world as<br>

  Abstract: From the outset, the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission faced a formidable task. Unlike the Latin American commissions, which were rebuilding moral and political communities that had at least in theory preexisted the periods of oppression, the South African commission was creating an entirely new and hitherto inconceivable state that had never existed on the southern cape of Africa. The postapartheid South African government was committed to building a bridge between the past and the present, a link that fully acknowledged the harms that had occurred during the reign of apartheid and the new society that embraced equality.

  Book Title: Shelter Blues-Sanity and Selfhood Among the Homeless<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Desjarlais Robert<br>
  Abstract: Desjarlais shows us not anonymous faces of the homeless but real people.While it is estimated that 25 percent or more of America's homeless are mentally ill, their lives are largely unknown to us. What must life be like for those who, in addition to living on the street, hear voices, suffer paranoid delusions, or have trouble thinking clearly or talking to others.
      Shelter Bluesis an innovative portrait of people residing in Boston's Station Street Shelter. It examines the everyday lives of more than 40 homeless men and women, both white and African-American, ranging in age from early 20s to mid-60s. Based on a sixteen-month study, it draws readers into the personal worlds of these individuals and, by addressing the intimacies of homelessness, illness, and abjection, picks up where most scholarship and journalism stops.Robert Desjarlais works against the grain of media representations of homelessness by showing us not anonymous stereotypes but individuals. He draws on conversations as well as observations, talking with and listening to shelter residents to understand how they relate to their environment, to one another, and to those entrusted with their care. His book considers their lives in terms of a complex range of forces and helps us comprehend the linkages between culture, illness, personhood, and political agency on the margins of contemporary American society.Shelter Bluesis unlike anything else ever written about homelessness. It challenges social scientists and mental health professionals to rethink their approaches to human subjectivity and helps us all to better understand one of the most pressing problems of our time.<br>

They owed their strength to political concerns and pragmatic effects, and served as tropes in the lives of staff and residents alike. Paul Rabinow notes that sociologies of scientific practices “have sought (with some success) to lower-case the abstractions of Science, Reason, Truth and Society.”¹ Reflections on a commonplace but perhaps less well understood kind of reasoning—reasoning that takes form in everyday life—might enable us to similarly lower-case reason, intimate its cultural and political features, and<br>

  Book Title: Dreams of Fiery Stars-The Transformations of Native American Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Rainwater Catherine<br>
  Abstract: Selected by
      Choicemagazine as an Outstanding Academic Book for 1999 Since the 1968 publication of N. Scott Momaday'sHouse Made of Dawn, a new generation of Native American storytellers has chosen writing over oral traditions. While their works have found an audience by observing many of the conventions of the mainstream novel, Native American written narrative has emerged as something distinct from the postmodern novel with which it is often compared. InDreams of Fiery Stars, Catherine Rainwater examines the novels of writers such as Momaday, Linda Hogan, Leslie Marmon Silko, Gerald Vizenor, and Louise Erdrich and contends that the very act of writing narrative imposes constraints upon these authors that are foreign to Native American tradition. Their works amount to a break with-and a transformation of-American Indian storytelling. The book focuses on the agenda of social and cultural regeneration encoded in contemporary Native American narrative, and addresses key questions about how these works achieve their overtly stated political and revisionary aims. Rainwater explores the ways in which the writers "create" readers who understand the connection between storytelling and personal and social transformation; considers how contemporary Native American narrative rewrites Western notions of space and time; examines the existence of intertextual connections between Native American works; and looks at the vital role of Native American literature in mainstream society today.<br>

  Abstract: Contemporary fiction by Native Americans frequently traces crises of self-transformation.² Unique complications in the transformational process arise for Indian characters, sometimes on account of their half-blood or mixed-blood status, sometimes owing to their efforts to sustain tribal values in a white world, and other times due to their attempts to live by the rules of the dominant society. In the end, such characters usually shape themselves less according to traditional models drawn exclusively from a particular culture than to models that they half-invent and half-discover through bicultural experience. Thus, in their patterns of character development, American Indian narratives emphasize flexibility<br>

As women who commoditize their voices and bodies in contexts of public celebration (both outdoors at saint’s festivals, and indoors at wedding celebrations) shikhat (pl.) are often associated with the marketplace. In fact, women without moral scruples may be compared to shikhat who are “lost in the suq.”<br>

  Author(s): McGuire Randall H.<br>
  Abstract: The Archaeology of the Colorado Coalfield War Project has conducted archaeological investigations at the site of the Ludlow Massacre in Ludlow, Colorado, since 1996. With the help of the United Mine Workers of America and funds from the Colorado State Historical Society and the Colorado Endowment for the Humanities, the scholars involved have integrated archaeological finds with archival evidence to show how the everyday experiences of miners and their families shaped the strike and its outcome.The Archaeology of Class War weaves together material culture, documents, oral histories, landscapes, and photographs to reveal aspects of the strike and life in early twentieth-century Colorado coalfields unlike any standard documentary history. Excavations at the site of the massacre and the nearby town of Berwind exposed tent platforms, latrines, trash dumps, and the cellars in which families huddled during the attack. Myriad artifacts—from canning jars to a doll’s head—reveal the details of daily existence and bring the community to life.The Archaeology of Class War will be of interest to archaeologists, historians, and general readers interested in mining and labor history.<br>

  Author(s): Skinner Alex<br>
  Abstract: According to Joas, every single human being has increasingly been viewed as sacred. He discusses the abolition of torture and slavery, once common practice in the pre-18th century west, as two milestones in modern human history. The author concludes by portraying the emergence of the UN Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 as a successful process of value generalization. Joas demonstrates that the history of human rights cannot adequately be described as a history of ideas or as legal history, but as a complex transformation in which diverse cultural traditions had to be articulated, legally codified, and assimilated into practices of everyday life. The sacralization of the person and universal human rights will only be secure in the future, warns Joas, through continued support by institutions and society, vigorous discourse in their defense, and their incarnation in everyday life and practice.<br>

  Book Title: Seasons of Misery-Catastrophe and Colonial Settlement in Early America<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DONEGAN KATHLEEN<br>
  Abstract: The stories we tell of American beginnings typically emphasize colonial triumph in the face of adversity. But the early years of English settlement in America were characterized by catastrophe: starvation, disease, extreme violence, ruinous ignorance, and serial abandonment.
      Seasons of Miseryoffers a provocative reexamination of the British colonies' chaotic and profoundly unstable early days, placing crisis-both experiential and existential-at the center of the story. At the outposts of a fledgling empire and disconnected from the social order of their home society, English settlers were both physically and psychologically estranged from their European identities. They could not control, or often even survive, the world they had intended to possess. According to Kathleen Donegan, it was in this cauldron of uncertainty that colonial identity was formed. Studying the English settlements at Roanoke, Jamestown, Plymouth, and Barbados, Donegan argues that catastrophe marked the threshold between an old European identity and a new colonial identity, a state of instability in which only fragments of Englishness could survive amid the upheavals of the New World. This constant state of crisis also produced the first distinctively colonial literature as settlers attempted to process events that they could neither fully absorb nor understand. Bringing a critical eye to settlers' first-person accounts, Donegan applies a unique combination of narrative history and literary analysis to trace how settlers used a language of catastrophe to describe unprecedented circumstances, witness unrecognizable selves, and report unaccountable events.Seasons of Miseryaddresses both the stories that colonists told about themselves and the stories that we have constructed in hindsight about them. In doing so, it offers a new account of the meaning of settlement history and the creation of colonial identity.<br>

  Book Title: Theorizing Scriptures-New Critical Orientations to a Cultural Phenomenon<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): WIMBUSH VINCENT L.<br>
  Abstract: Historically, religious scriptures are defined as holy texts that are considered to be beyond the abilities of the layperson to interpret. Their content is most frequently analyzed by clerics who do not question the underlying political or social implications of the text, but use the writing to convey messages to their congregations about how to live a holy existence. In Western society, moreover, what counts as scripture is generally confined to the Judeo-Christian Bible, leaving the voices of minorities, as well as the holy texts of faiths from Africa and Asia, for example, unheard. In this innovative collection of essays that aims to turn the traditional bible-study definition of scriptures on its head, Vincent L. Wimbush leads an in-depth look at the social, cultural, and racial meanings invested in these texts. Contributors hail from a wide array of academic fields and geographic locations and include such noted academics as Susan Harding, Elisabeth Shnssler Fiorenza, and William L. Andrews. Purposefully transgressing disciplinary boundaries, this ambitious book opens the door to different interpretations and critical orientations, and in doing so, allows an ultimately humanist definition of scriptures to emerge.<br>

Signifying is also intended to capture the creation of symbols, meanings, and approaches that are unsettling and made by the social categories defined as subalterns, nondominant populations, minorities, populations on the margin of society, subordinated groups, the oppressed, and the exploited.

Listen to the words of William Canton, the passionate historian of the British and Foreign Bible Society: “The blind had a new world opened to them. Hospitals were supplied with small volumes suitable for the sick-wards, and many a little book was afterwards found under the pillow of the dead. In prisons, penitentiaries, workhouses, the Bible wrought wonders.”⁴ Those of<br>

  Book Title: Fragile Dignity-Intercontextual Conversations on Scriptures, Family, and Violence<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Spronk Klaas<br>
  Abstract: Human dignity insists that every human deserves respect and a safe place to live. For many, this is not a reality. The essays collected here analyze the background of this problem in contemporary family life and society at large, with special emphasis on the role of women and on the Bible as a source of inspiration and transformation. The collection is the product of a six-year conversation on family, violence, and human dignity between the Protestant Theological University in Kampen, The Netherlands, and the Faculty of Theology at Stellenbosch University, South Africa, a North-South dialogue that included annual conferences, a series of responsive letters, and additional external responses. The contributors are Cheryl B. Anderson, Hendrik Bosman, Gerrit Brand, Athalya Brenner, L. Juliana Claassens, Dorothea Erbele-Küster, Leo J. Koffeman, Frits de Lange, Monica Jyotsna Melanchthon, Magda Misset-van de Weg, Beverly Eileen Mitchell, Anne-Claire Mulder, Ian Nell, Mary-Anne Plaatjies-van Huffel, Jeremy Punt, Petruschka Schaafsma, D.

  Author(s) Harrold Deborah<br>
  Abstract: Images of disaffected workers rising up against communist regimes—most evident in the case of the Solidarity-led movement in Poland and the 1989 miners’ strikes in the Soviet Union—initially spawned hopes that unions could spearhead the emergence of civil society throughout the postcommunist world. Within a decade after the fall of communism, however, a much bleaker picture emerged: “Not only have unions not experienced a rebirth—on the contrary, they have seen a drop in membership—but they have been largely unable to create for themselves a pronounced political role to allow them to shape the postcommunist transformation.”¹ Labor<br>

  Abstract: FOR THE MERTONIANS, social science is an autonomous subsystem of society unified by its own institutionalized values. The values have to be maintained by socialization and by rewards handed out by elite scientists for conformity. However, Mertonian empirical investigations have complicated this scheme by suggesting that all or nearly all norms are accompanied by equally valid counternorms. The resulting normative ambivalence produces conflict as well as unity, since scientists can urge norms on others while they themselves follow counternorms. Shared values thus can serve as rhetorical devices in disputes, rather than as unifying forces. Consequently, the unity-disunity balance must be<br>

  Book Title: Michel Tournier and the Metaphor of Fiction-  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): PLATTEN DAVID<br>
  Abstract: Michel Tournier is a writer who explores complex philosophical questions in the guise of concrete, imagistic narratives. This comprehensive study privileges the notion of literary reference, by which the world of text is understood or experienced in metaphorical relation to the world outside of it. Metaphor, in the context of Tournier’s fiction, shows how the fantastic merges with the real to provide new perspectives on many diverse aspects of the modern world: the Crusoe myth, Nazism, the value to society of art and religion, and the nature of education. This book elucidates an aesthetic of Tournier’s fiction that encompasses the writer’s stated ambition to ‘go beyond literature’.<br>

  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): SHEPPARD ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: In The Poetry of Saying Robert Sheppard explores an array of ‘experimental’ writers and styles of writing many of which have never secured a large audience in Britain, but which are often fascinatingly innovative. As a published poet in this tradition, Sheppard provides a detailed and thought provoking account of the development of the British poetry movement from the 1950s. As well as analysing the work of individual poets such as Roy Fisher, Lee Harwood and Tom Raworth The Poetry of Saying also examines the influence of the Poetry Society and poetry magazines on the evolution of British poetry throughout this period. The overriding virtue of the poetry of this period is its diversity, a fact that Sheppard has not ignored. As well as providing a fascinating into the work of these poets, The Poetry of Saying offers an ‘insider’s’ commentary on the social, political and historical background during this exciting period in British poetry.<br>

Today the remnants of that experience pervade the depopulated Irish landscape: abandoned stone cottages, crumbling workhouses and overgrown mass graves, and the endlessly stonewalled and subdivided smallholdings that are testament to the meagre acreage allotted to the Famine poor existing at the very margins of society.

  Abstract: ‘L’intellectuel est quelqu’un qui se mêle de ce qui ne le regarde pas.’¹ Sartre’s canonical definition of the intellectual suggests a basic question about the public impact of French scholars.

Assuming that world-making possibly means that a society must be framed, then this frame entails rules – i.e., rules can be the frame. This call for rules answers Nancy Fraser’s call (in Chapter 10) for a frame. But the frame she suggests should be of a special kind.

The idea of the rule of law is the centuries-old solution for mediating interhuman conflict over applicable moral principles and for controlling the despotism of rulers.¹ The law, as conceptualized by this idea, is an articulated set of rules, objectively enforced.

  Abstract: Why does the tension between science and religion continue? How have those tensions changed during the past one hundred years? How have those tensions impacted the public debate about so-called "intelligent design" as a scientific alternative to evolution? With wit and wisdom the authors address the conflict from its philosophical roots to its manifestations within American culture. In doing so, they take an important step toward creating a society that reconciles scientific inquiry with the human spirit. This book, which marks the one hundredth anniversary of The Terry Lecture Series, offers a unique perspective for anyone interested in the debate between science and religion in America.<br>

The contributors argue that the humanities can regain their relevance for society, pose new questions and provide fresh answers, while maintaining their core values: critical reflection, historical consciousness and analytical distance.<br>

  Abstract: The city would not exist as a modern urban society without the urban public domain. This is the central claim of a large number of theories of urban culture.¹ After all, urban life is defined by the fact that we are forced to share the city with a multitude of strangers from disparate backgrounds and with diverse identities and interests. For this reason it is of great importance that there are public spaces where we encounter these “others”, are confronted by them and must relate to them. In each of these theories, the urban public domain in which people negotiate<br>

  Book Title: Making Transcendents-Ascetics and Social Memory in Early Medieval China<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Campany Robert Ford<br>
  Abstract: By the middle of the third century B.C.E. in China there were individuals who sought to become transcendents (xian)—deathless, godlike beings endowed with supernormal powers. This quest for transcendence became a major form of religious expression and helped lay the foundation on which the first Daoist religion was built. Both xian and those who aspired to this exalted status in the centuries leading up to 350 C.E. have traditionally been portrayed as secretive and hermit-like figures. This groundbreaking study offers a very different view of xian-seekers in late classical and early medieval China. It suggests that transcendence did not involve a withdrawal from society but rather should be seen as a religious role situated among other social roles and conceived in contrast to them. Robert Campany argues that the much-discussed secrecy surrounding ascetic disciplines was actually one important way in which practitioners presented themselves to others. He contends, moreover, that many adepts were not socially isolated at all but were much sought after for their power to heal the sick, divine the future, and narrate their exotic experiences.

  Abstract: Buddhism and Christianity are currently the two dominant religions in South Korea, with approximately one-half of the country’s population of forty-five million as their adherents. Of these adherents, approximately one-half are Buddhists and the other half Christians.¹ Under such circumstances, it seems obvious that a dialogical and cooperative relationship between these two religions in Korea is both a prerequisite and an imperative for the peaceful and harmonious future of Korean society.<br>

  Book Title: Cult, Culture and Authority-Princess Lieu Hanh in Vietnamese History<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): DROR OLGA<br>
  Abstract: Princess Liễu Hạnh, often called the Mother of the Vietnamese people by her followers, is one of the most prominent goddesses in Vietnamese popular religion. First emerging some four centuries ago as a local sect appealing to women, the princess’ cult has since transcended its geographical and gender boundaries and remains vibrant today. Who was this revered deity? Was she a virtuous woman or a prostitute? Why did people begin worshiping her and why have they continued? Cult, Culture, and Authority traces Liễu Hạnh’s cult from its ostensible appearance in the sixteenth century to its present-day prominence in North Vietnam and considers it from a broad range of perspectives, as religion and literature and in the context of politics and society. Over time, Liễu Hạnh’s personality and cult became the subject of numerous literary accounts, and these historical texts are a major source for this book. Author Olga Dror explores the authorship and historical context of each text considered, treating her subject in an interdisciplinary way. Her interest lies in how these accounts reflect the various political agendas of successive generations of intellectuals and officials. The same cult was called into service for a variety of ideological ends: feminism, nationalism, Buddhism, or Daoism.<br>

  Author(s) BORGEN ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: The elites of Kyoto — emperors, court officials, monks, literati, and poets — have been the focus of many studies of Heian Japan. What is often overlooked is that the local population in the provinces provided the food, clothing, and various supplies the elites needed to perform their daily duties. And although the commoners rarely appear in the historical sources or the literary works of the age, they were of central importance to the livelihoods of the central elites. This chapter focuses on provincial life and examines Heian society from a material point of view in an attempt to explore this codependence.<br>

  Book Title: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains-Culture and Society in the Highlands of Bali<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Reuter Thomas A.<br>
  Abstract: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains is the first comprehensive ethnography of the Bali Aga, a large ethnic minority that occupies the island's central highlands. The Bali Aga are popularly viewed as the indigenous counterparts to other Balinese who trace their origin to invaders from the Javanese kingdom of Majapait, who have ruled Bali from the fourteenth century A.D. Although Bali remains one of the most intensely researched localities in the world, the Bali Aga have long been overshadowed by the more exotic courtly culture of the south. A closer analysis of the changing position of the Bali Aga within Balinese society provides a key to understanding the politics and social process of cultural representation in Bali and beyond. The process is marked by a blend of representational competition and cooperation among the Bali Aga themselves, among the Bali Aga and southern Balinese, and later among the island's aristocratic elites and foreign colonizers or scholars, and state authorities. The study of this process raises important issues about the establishment and maintenance of status and power structures at regional, national, and global levels. Custodians of the Sacred Mountains explores the marginalization of the Bali Aga in light of a critical theory of cultural representation and calls for a morally engaged approach to ethnographic research. It proposes an intersubjective and communicative model of human interaction as the foundation for understanding the relative significance of cooperation and competition in the cultural production of knowledge.<br>

  Abstract: This final chapter asks what people generally and social scientists in particular can learn from the highland Balinese and from their approach to representation. We all have a practical interest in representational models insofar as they have a tangible effect on all of our lives, for better or worse, as models for living. Social scientists also have a theoretical interest in representational models, as they struggle to gain a general understanding of particular societies and of society in general. The Bali Aga, likewise, approach representation from these two inseparable perspectives as they negotiate practical conflicts among self-interested subjects and simultaneously<br>

  Abstract: We should not be surprised, while reading the autobiographies of fellow Americans, to encounter religious self-disclosures. After all, roughly 85 percent of Americans self-identify as religious. In addition, religion is so pervasive in our society that the life of any American is likely to include references to religion in some form and degree or other. American autobiographies that include religious disclosures are not exceptional, then. Conversely, autobiographies that include religious self-disclosures are potentially engaging to American readers because they themselves are likely to have had to deal with religion as part of their pasts, their current interactions, or their thoughts<br>

It is not attained through individual concepts or through individual thinkers, because neither language nor societies host these elements in isolation. The raw material of political thought at the disposal of any society is immense, and the meanings and semantic structures of political language are necessarily indeterminate. That<br>

  Abstract: In some quarters, the study of ritual has shifted emphasis in recent decades. Scholars have gradually abandoned the functionalist view that ritual serves to create social unity,¹ stressing instead its marking of social difference. In part, this shift signals a dissatisfaction with functionalism’s inherently conservative emphasis on “societal balance,” on the preservation of the

  Abstract: Wolin's riveting narrative reveals that Maoism's allure among France's best and brightest actually had little to do with a real understanding of Chinese politics. Instead, it paradoxically served as a vehicle for an emancipatory transformation of French society. French student leftists took up the trope of "cultural revolution," applying it to their criticisms of everyday life. Wolin examines how Maoism captured the imaginations of France's leading cultural figures, influencing Sartre's "perfect Maoist moment"; Foucault's conception of power; Sollers's chic, leftist intellectual journal
         Tel Quel; as well as Kristeva's book on Chinese women--which included a vigorous defense of foot-binding.<br>

One cannot understand France during the 1960s, as well as the nature of the political system against which the sixty-eighters rebelled, without examining the general’s central role. By the same token, the political closure the general had mandated engendered a trenchant body of oppositional cultural criticism that ultimately succeeded in undermining Gaullism’s credibility as a political model. As the decade evolved, pathbreaking works of fiction, film, and theory emerged, forming a cultural template through which the sixty-eighters viewed the shortcomings of postwar French society.<br>

  Abstract: In this rigorous and imaginative study, Seligman seeks to discover a durable source of moral authority in a liberalized world.

Furthermore, Seligman restores the indispensable role of religious traditions--as well as the features of those traditions that enhance, rather than denigrate, tolerance. Sociologists, political theorists, moral philosophers, and intellectual historians will find Seligman's thesis enlightening, as will anyone concerned with the ethical and religious foundations of a tolerant society.<br>

To be sure, they soon came in for vigorous criticism themselves.

  Book Title: Christian Political Ethics-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Coleman John A.<br>
  Abstract: Christian Political Ethicsbrings together leading Christian scholars of diverse theological and ethical perspectives--Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, and Anabaptist--to address fundamental questions of state and civil society, international law and relations, the role of the nation, and issues of violence and its containment. Representing a unique fusion of faith-centered ethics and social science, the contributors bring into dialogue their own varying Christian understandings with a range of both secular ethical thought and other religious viewpoints from Judaism, Islam, and Confucianism. They explore divergent Christian views of state and society--and the limits of each. They grapple with the tensions that can arise within Christianity over questions of patriotism, civic duty, and loyalty to one's nation, and they examine Christian responses to pluralism and relativism, globalization, and war and peace. Revealing the striking pluralism inherent to Christianity itself, this pioneering volume recasts the meanings of Christian citizenship and civic responsibility, and raises compelling new questions about civil disobedience, global justice, and Christian justifications for waging war as well as spreading world peace. It brings Christian political ethics out of the churches and seminaries to engage with today's most vexing and complex social issues.<br>

  Book Title: Politics and the Imagination-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geuss Raymond<br>
  Abstract: In politics, utopians do not have a monopoly on imagination. Even the most conservative defenses of the status quo, Raymond Geuss argues, require imaginative acts of some kind. In this collection of recent essays, including his most overtly political writing yet, Geuss explores the role of imagination in politics, particularly how imaginative constructs interact with political reality. He uses decisions about the war in Iraq to explore the peculiar ways in which politicians can be deluded and citizens can misunderstand their leaders. He also examines critically what he sees as one of the most serious delusions of western political thinking--the idea that a human society is always best conceived as a closed system obeying fixed rules. And, in essays on
      Don Quixote, museums, Celan's poetry, Heidegger's brother Fritz, Richard Rorty, and bourgeois philosophy, Geuss reflects on how cultural artifacts can lead us to embrace or reject conventional assumptions about the world. While paying particular attention to the relative political roles played by rule-following, utilitarian calculations of interest, and aspirations to lead a collective life of a certain kind, Geuss discusses a wide range of related issues, including the distance critics need from their political systems, the extent to which history can enlighten politics, and the possibility of utopian thinking in a world in which action retains its urgency.<br>

  Abstract: Among the canonical markers of utopian writing is the ambiguous location of the ideal society in space and time. Thus, a good point of departure for a discussion of meta-utopian fiction will be a definition of it in terms of its treatment of spatial and temporal dimensions.

  Book Title: Sung Dynasty Uses of the I Ching-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wyatt Don J.<br>
  Abstract: The
         I Ching, or Book of Changes, has been one of the two or three most influential books in the Chinese canon. It has been used by people on all levels of society, both as a method of divination and as a source of essential ideas about the nature of heaven, earth, and humankind. During the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Sung dynasty literati turned to it for guidance in their fundamental reworking of the classical traditions. This book explores how four leading thinkers--Su Shih, Shao Yung, Ch'eng I, and Chu Hsi--applied theI Chingto these projects. These four men used the Book of Changes in strikingly different ways. Yet each claimed to find in it a sure foundation for human values. Their work established not only new meanings for the text but also new models for governance and moral philosophy that would be debated throughout the next thousand years of Chinese intellectual history. By focusing on their uses of theI Ching, this study casts a unique light on the complex continuity-within-change and rich diversity of Sung culture.<br>

  Abstract: In his critique of Kantian-liberal politics Merleau-Ponty contends that there is a chronic divergence between the universal values that liberals preach and the self-interested values incarnated in the bourgeois way of life. Yet the precedence of lived values over verbal ones need not destroy all hopes for a more humanistic society. It is conceivable that a different class might exist whose incarnated values are not inherently self-serving. A class might exist that in its very existence stands a chance at actualizing the as yet only ideal claims of the liberal tradition. The symmetrical solution to the problem of a class<br>

  Abstract: With an original combination of close reading and political theory, Joy Connolly argues that Cicero, Sallust, and Horace inspire fresh thinking about central concerns of contemporary political thought and action. These include the role of conflict in the political community, especially as it emerges from class differences; the necessity of recognition for an equal and just society; the corporeal and passionate aspects of civic experience; citizens' interdependence on one another for senses of selfhood; and the uses and dangers of self-sovereignty and fantasy. Putting classicists and political theorists in dialogue, the book also addresses a range of modern thinkers, including Kant, Hannah Arendt, Stanley Cavell, and Philip Pettit. Together, Connolly's readings construct a new civic ethos of advocacy, self-criticism, embodied awareness, imagination, and irony.<br>

Elegance, defined as the symbiosis of excellence and magnificence, is the ultimate attribute of any creative endeavour and achieving it is the architect's prime motivation. Using this concept, Lincourt develops a set of archetypes for designing a more satisfactory architecture and provides an in-depth analysis of three examples of architectural elegance: the Palais-Royal and the Fondation Rothchild Workers' Residence in Paris and the Municipality of Outremont in Montreal.<br>

  Book Title: Ethics of Catholicism and the Consecration of the Intellectual-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): BÉLANGER ANDRÉ J.<br>
  Abstract: Using France as the most representative case of a Catholic context, Bélanger argues that as French society became more secularized intellectuals replaced the clergy as arbitrators of justice and enlightenment. Catholic morality was consolidated by the scholastic tradition and confirmed by the Counter-Reformation, providing the foundation that allowed the establishment of a lay elite. Bélanger describes the progressive takeover of positions of influence by the new elite in Catholic society and examines arguments used by thinkers from the seventeenth to the twentieth century to legitimize their positions. In contrast, the Anglo-Saxon Protestant tradition, due to its emphasis on the priesthood of all believers, led to recognition of the individual's conscience as the sole judge of her or his deeds and failed to provide intellectuals with the basis for any claim to serve as moral leaders in political affairs.<br>

  Abstract: In The Knight-Monks of Vichy France John Hellman describes the founding, operation, transformation, and demise of the school, details the institution's ideological and political struggles with other segments of French society, and deals with the remarkable rise of Uriage ideas and alumni in postwar France. By focusing on the social, philosophical, and psychological concepts propounded by the staff of the school, Hellman has produced the first study that shows the École Nationale des Cadres d'Uriage to have been an original educational and group experience which inspired French youth from very different backgrounds to abandon the liberal democratic tradition for a new political and social vision. Drawing on a variety of sources, including interviews, newly available archival material, Vichy publications, correspondence, and diary entries, Hellman contributes to the current, lively debate concerning the phenomenon of collaboration and the response of the French population to fascism and to the occupation during the Second World War. This book will be of particular interest to readers concerned with the intellectual and political life of modern France, modern religious thought and experience, fascism and the Vichy regime, changes in France in the prewar and postwar periods, and the "third way" political option in contemporary Europe.<br>

  Author(s): Matthews Eric<br>
  Abstract: In this clear and comprehensive account of Merleau-Ponty's thought Eric Matthews shows how Merleau-Ponty has contributed to current debates in philosophy, such as the nature of consciousness, the relation between biology and personality, the historical understanding of human thought and society, and many others. Surveying the whole range of Merleau-Ponty's thinking, Matthews examines his views about the nature of phenomenology and the primacy of perception; his account of human embodiment, being-in-the-world, and the understanding of human behaviour; his conception of the self and its relation to other selves; and his views on society, politics, and the arts. A final chapter considers his later thought, published posthumously. The ideas of Merleau-Ponty are of immensely important to the development of modern French philosophy. Matthews evaluates his distinctive contributions and relates his thought to that of his predecessors, contemporaries, and successors, both in France and elsewhere. This unrivalled introduction will be welcomed by analytic philosophers and cognitive scientists as well as all students taking courses in contemporary continental philosophy.<br>

Even more, how do we articulate identity as a defining particularity in the disappearance of borders, boundaries, and spaces in an increasingly globalist world? What constitutes identity and the formation of narratives under such conditions? How do these issues affect not only discursive practices, but theological and ethical construction and practice? This volumes explores these issues in depth. Diasporic Feminist Theology attempts to construct feminist theology by adopting diaspora as a theopolitical and ethical metaphor. Namsoon Kang here revisits and reexamines today’s significant issues such as identity politics, dislocation, postmodernism, postcolonialism, neoempire, Asian values, and constructs diasporic, transethnic, and glocal feminist theological discourses that create spaces of transformation, reconciliation, hospitality, worldliness, solidarity, and border-traversing. This work draws on diverse sources from contemporary critical discourses of diaspora studies, cultural studies, ethnic studies, postmodernism, postcolonialism, and feminism and feminist theology from a transterritorial space. This book is a landmark work, providing a comprehensive discourse for feminist theology today.<br>

  Abstract: René Latourelle is a theologian typical of the focus phase¹ in the history of fundamental theology. Born in Montreal in 1918, he entered the Society of Jesus in 1938 and, after completing doctoral studies in both history and theology, he began in 1959 to teach theology at the Gregorian University, where he subsequently became dean of the faculty of theology.² Latourelle’s career as a student, theologian, and teacher spans the era of the development of fundamental theology through phases that he later calls “Reaction,” “Expansion,” and “Focusing.” Educated within the era of classical apologetics, he was involved with the development<br>

  Book Title: The World in the Trinity-Open-Ended Systems in Science and Religion<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Bracken Joseph A.<br>
  Abstract: Joseph A. Bracken argues that the failure of theology and science to generate cohesion is the lack of an integrated system of interpretation of the Christian faith that consciously accords with the insights and discoveries of contemporary science. In The World in the Trinity, Bracken utilizes the language and conceptual structures of systems theory as a philosophical and scientific grammar to show traditional Christian beliefs in a new light that is accessible and rationally plausible to a contemporary, scientifically influenced society. This account opens new possibilities for rethinking the God-world relationship, the Trinity, incarnation, creation, and eschatology within the context of a broader ecological and cosmological system. In re-describing these articles constitutive of Christian belief, the author is conscious of the vital importance of retaining the inherent power and meaning of these concepts. This volume freshly retrieves pivotal themes and concepts constitutive of the Christian tradition in a conscious rapprochement with current scientific understandings of nature.<br>

To qualify as a star, the scale of celebrity must be such that the performer’s name and image are familiar not just to those within their specialised field (for example, film enthusiasts, sports fans, intellectuals), but to the general public. For a society to produce stars, and for stars to play an important role in the definition of values and identities, certain conditions are required.

Paul Vogt argues that the religion cluster studied primitives in part because they had an attitude of “despair” regarding the modern world. They perceived something troubling about the contemporary situation in the West and attempted to use primitive societies as a means for pointing to what had been lost in the move to modernity (Vogt 1976: 43).

This phenomenon can be called a “new culture of disaster,” and it is currently shared by large numbers of people around the world. Beyond the specificity of each society, history, and religion, when a catastrophe strikes, people seem to draw on the same repertory of actions. For centuries, we have shared a common political activism in the form of demonstrations and strikes (Tilly 1986). But the public culture of disaster seems different for<br>

  Book Title: Protest Beyond Borders-Contentious Politics in Europe since 1945<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Romanos Eduardo<br>
  Abstract: The protest movements that followed the Second World War have recently become the object of study for various disciplines; however, the exchange of ideas between research fields, and comparative research in general, is lacking. An international and interdisciplinary dialogue is vital to not only describe the similarities and differences between the single national movements but also to evaluate how they contributed to the formation and evolution of a transnational civil society in Europe. This volume undertakes this challenge as well as questions some major assumptions of post-1945 protest and social mobilization both in Western and Eastern Europe. Historians, political scientists, sociologists and media studies scholars come together and offer insights into social movement research beyond conventional repertoires of protest and strictly defined periods, borders and paradigms, offering new perspectives on past and present processes of social change of the contemporary world.<br>

Instead, by avoiding unidirectional answers, I introduce the multiplicity of arguments voiced in the debate. I demonstrate how it split along the lines of civil society theory and practice, of pre– and post–1989 developments of civic activism in the region, and of divergent disciplinary approaches to the problem. On this basis, I suggest that the analysis of civil society as a frame of protest<br>

These young men threw rocks, chanted protests, and clashed with police. The Ethiopian government argued that the volatile nature of this large population of predominantly urban, unemployed young men necessitated intervention for the good of society as a whole.

Many works, often controversial originally but now considered as classics, are still performed regularly in Vienna, Prague, Budapest, or Krakow. This volume not only offers an excellent overview of the theatrical history of the region, it is also an innovative, cross-disciplinary attempt to analyse the inner workings and dynamics of theater through a discussion of the interplay between society, the audience, and performing artists.<br>

  Book Title: Between Educationalization and Appropriation-Selected Writings on the History of Modern Educational Systems<br>

  Abstract: Advanced reader on the history of education Developments in educational systems worldwide have largely contributed to the modernization and globalization of present-day society. However, in order to fully understand their impact, educational systems must be interpreted against a background of particular situations and contexts. This textbook brings together more than twenty (collaborative) contributions focusing on the two key themes in the work of Marc Depaepe: educationalization and appropriation. Compiled for his international master classes, these selected writings provide not only a thorough introduction to the history of modern educational systems, but also a twenty-five year overview of the work of a well-known pioneer in the field of history of education. Covering the modernization of schooling in Western history, the characteristics and origins of educationalization, the colonial experience in education and the process of appropriation, Between Educationalization and Appropriation will be of great interest to a larger audience of scholars in the social sciences.<br>

At first sight, that is rather remarkable, because the question about how it should be done contrasts sharply with the blurred norms that are prevalent in postmodern society, as well as with the plurality of opinions and views that are consciously cultivated there. Perhaps it is because in the field of the history of education, there are no longer any “eminent examples”¹ that the question is put explicitly? There too, a diversity of approaches prevails.<br>

  Book Title: Islam & Europe-Challenges and Opportunities<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): TIBI Bassam<br>
  Abstract: Dedicated to increasing our knowledge and awareness of the ever-growing diversity and pluralism of global society, Forum A. & A. Leysen has initiated an annual debate/lecture series, beginning with a focus on Islam in today's world and in Europe in particular. Seven well-known influential authorities - each an active participant in the public debate on the global role of Islam past, present and future - recently presented papers at the first Intercultural Relations Conference sponsored by Forum A.& A. Leysen. These important contributions, on the topic Islam and Europe: Challenges and Opportunities, are reprinted in this volume. Although each contributor speaks from his own distinctive point of view, a common message emerges from all seven texts: only dialogue - on the one hand between the West (countries that manifest themselves as Western Democratic constitutional states) and Islam, and on the other hand within and among societies historically identified with Islam- will overcome entrenched confrontation and negative animosity, engender new possibilities and understandings, and, by encouraging free and critical thinking, pave the way to social equity and the scientific innovation that, potentially, can lead to more prosperity. In the course of the conference all seven talks led to fascinating debates. This book includes the most important questions asked and the speakers' responses. Although the question of how to actually construct the dialogue remains unsettled, this ground-breaking book takes a giant step toward an answer.<br>

  Book Title: Islam & Europe-Crises are Challenges<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): SHAH Prakash<br>
  Abstract: Within the framework of the Forum A. & A Leysen, several experts from in and outside the Muslim world contributed to this book. In Islam and Europe: Crises Are Challenges they discuss how dialogues between Islam and the West, with a focus on Europe, can be achieved. The various authors (legal scholars, political theorists, social scientists, and psychologists) explore in these collected essays such interrelated questions as: How much diversity is permissible within a liberal pluralistic democratic society? How strong are the implications of citizenship? What are equitable accommodations of contested practices? They argue for an adequate understanding of how Western Muslim communities in Europe experience their minority position and what needs to be done to improve their participation in European society. The second part of this volume is a collection of papers written around the work of Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, who also makes his own contribution to the book. The Catholic University of Leuven awarded An-Na'im an honorary doctorate in 2009 on the theme of multiculturalism, intercultural relations and diversity. An-Na'im is recognized the world over as a leading expert in the area of religion and law, and as a human rights activist. Islam and Europe: Crises Are Challenges reinforces our sense that a better knowledge and awareness of the growing diversity of our society, and striving for harmonious relations between Islam and the West, are among the most important challenges of our time.

Ahmed, Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, Shaheen Sardar Ali, Mohamed Benzakour, Jean-Yves Carlier, Marie-Claire Foblets, Ziba Mir-Hosseini, Fouad Laroui, Bettina Leysen, Rashida Manjoo, Bhikhu Parekh, Mathias Rohe, Cedric Ryngaert, Prakash Shah.

  Book Title: America's Education Deficit and the War on Youth-Reform Beyond Electoral Politics<br>
  Publisher: Monthly Review Press<br>
  Author(s): GIROUX HENRY A.<br>
  Abstract: America's latest war, according to renowned social critic Henry Giroux, is a war on youth. While this may seem counterintuitive in our youth-obsessed culture, Giroux lays bare the grim reality of how our educational, social, and economic institutions continually fail young people. Their systemic failure is the result of what Giroux identifies as four fundamentalisms: market deregulation, patriotic and religious fervor, the instrumentalization of education, and the militarization of society. We see the consequences most plainly in the decaying education system: schools are increasingly designed to churn out drone-like future employees, imbued with authoritarian values, inured to violence, and destined to serve the market. And those are the lucky ones. Young people who don't conform to cultural and economic discipline are left to navigate the neoliberal landscape on their own; if they are black or brown, they are likely to become ensnared by a harsh penal system.Giroux sets his sights on the war on youth and takes it apart, examining how a lack of access to quality education, unemployment, the repression of dissent, a culture of violence, and the discipline of the market work together to shape the dismal experiences of so many young people. He urges critical educators to unite with students and workers in rebellion to form a new pedagogy, and to build a new, democratic society from the ground up. Here is a book you won't soon forget, and a call that grows more urgent by the day.<br>

When asked about the moral basis of toleration the general answer is that toleration comes from pluralism, and ours is a pluralistic society. Q.E.D. It<br>

In the intricate verbal constructions of modern literature, the 'disarticulate' - those at the edges of language - have, paradoxically, played essential, defining roles.Drawing on the disarticulate figures in modern fictional works such asBilly Budd, The Sound and the Fury, Nightwood, White Noise,andThe Echo Maker,among others, James Berger shows in this intellectually bracing study how these characters mark sites at which aesthetic, philosophical, ethical, political, medical, and scientific discourses converge. It is also the place of the greatest ethical tension, as society confronts the needs and desires of the least of its brothers. Berger argues that the disarticulate is that which is unaccountable in the discourses of modernity and thus stands as an alternative to the prevailing social order. Using literary history and theory, as well as disability and trauma theory, he examines how these disarticulate figures reveal modernity's anxieties in terms of how it constructs its others.<br>

  Abstract: Blake’s famous poem lauds the triumphs of modern urban planning and natural science. Both city and nature have been placed under the charter of rational knowledge and guidance, and a just and fecund society prospers through this knowledge. Oh! Sorry! I was looking at the wrong note card! Of course, “London” is a bitter condemnation of modern forms of knowledge and their effects on nature and social life. But this mistaken conflation points toward the central epistemological and moral tensions of modernity, which can be summed up as the problem of knowledge as system or model.

He briefly traces the history of modern multiculturalism and argues that progress, albeit fragile, has been made globally through the proliferation of various iterations of the idea of human rights. Now, he argues, the challenge is to convince majority groups that social relations with minorities are not a zero-sum game and that society as<br>

In his last book,Ancient Society(1877), Morgan argued that the status of women was the single best indicator of a people’s development from “savagery” to “civilization.” The level of women’s participation was a test for Morgan of a society’s movement toward modern civilization and an indication that a militarized aristocracy was being replaced by democratic cooperation.

  Book Title: Re-imagining child protection-Towards humane social work with families<br>
  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Morris Kate<br>
  Abstract: Why has the language of the child and of child protection become so hegemonic? What is lost and gained by such language? Who is being protected, and from what, in a risk society? Given that the focus is overwhelmingly on those families who are multiply deprived, do services reinforce or ameliorate such deprivations? And is it ethical to remove children from their parents in a society riven by inequalities? This timely book challenges a child protection culture that has become mired in muscular authoritarianism towards multiply deprived families. It calls for family-minded humane practice where children are understood as relational beings, parents are recognized as people with needs and hopes and families as carrying extraordinary capacities for care and protection. The authors, who have over three decades of experience as social workers, managers, educators and researchers in England, also identify the key ingredients of just organizational cultures where learning is celebrated. This important book will be required reading for students on qualifying and post-qualifying courses in child protection, social workers, managers, academics and policy makers.<br>

However, meeting these aspirations in social work services has proved a wicked issue. The quotations above are a stark reminder of the pervasiveness of a blaming culture in statutory children’s services which spreads beyond English social work and which has resulted from failed attempts to ensure consistent high standards.

In this present chapter we will describe the formation of a civility tradition that was not the outcome of aristocratic society, but a reaction to it.

  Abstract: The Greeks made major contributions to the development of democracy not only as an idea, but even more significantly as a set of practical laws and pragmatic institutions that evolved over centuries to translate the sovereignty of the people into a relatively stable and effective system of government. However, while the Greek invention of democracy is often treated as an indisputable truth, recent work suggests that democracy may have antecedents. Martin Bernal stirred a major controversy with his book,

  Abstract: At the end of this tour of worldviews, what are we to conclude? Ultimately, this will depend, to a large extent, upon our own worldview. The pessimist and the fatalist will conclude that ideology and cultural mindsets are inescapable. From such a perspective, a worldview appears as a confining space, a prison. And, indeed, it seems true that in thinking and in expression, metaphor (one constitutive element of all worldviews) is ubiquitous and inescapable. The social sciences, with their objectifying rhetoric and, not least of all, their conception of the relationship between society and individuals (the ‘products of social processes’),<br>

  Abstract: In the Akwapim kingdom of southeastern Ghana,¹ clothing is used as a form of communication to make statements about personhood and status; to conceal or reveal identity; to express desires and impulses. It may do so directly or indirectly, conventionally or rebelliously. Clothing is owned, bestowed and gives identity. The clothed body expresses the person of the wearer and society’s image of that person. As a result, clothing absorbs the particular times in which it has been worn² and becomes like a relic of these past events.<br>

Yet the ‘spaces’ in which virtuous behaviour can flourish are rather different. For Ferguson, civil society constitutes an intermediate realm between the family and the state that in the modern context requires communication among strangers; for Grierson, model citizens effectively become

  Book Title: Post-beur Cinema-North African Émigré and Maghrebi-French Filmmaking in France since 2000<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Higbee Will<br>
  Abstract: Since the early 1980s and the arrival of Beur cinema filmmakers of Maghrebi origin have made a key contribution French cinema's representation of issues such as immigration, integration and national identity. However, they have done so mostly from a position on the margins of the industry. In contrast, since the early 2000s, Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmakers have occupied an increasingly prominent position on both sides of the camera, announcing their presence on French screens in a wider range of genres and styles than ever before. This greater visibility and move to the mainstream has not, however, automatically meant that these films have lost any of the social or political relevance. Indeed in the 2000s many of these films have increasingly questioned the boundaries between national, transnational and diasporic cinema, whilst simultaneously demanding, either implicitly or explicitly, a reconsideration of the very difference that has traditionally been seen as a barrier to the successful integration of North African immigrants and their descendants into French society. Through a detailed study of this transformative decade for Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking in France, this book argues for the emergence of a 'Post-Beur' cinema in the 2000s that is simultaneously global and local in its outlook. Its key features include: A comprehensive overview of the key developments in Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking in France since the 2000s: counter-heritage cinema and the memorialisation of France’s colonial past; journey narratives and the myth of return; the ‘mainstreaming’ of Maghrebi-French directors and stars; representations of Islam. Detailed case studies of key films from the 2000s that have yet to receive scholarly attention, such as Hors-la-loi, Dernier maquis and Vénus noire.

Usage and need make that everyone learns the language of his country; but what is it that makes this language the language of his country and not of another? In order to tell, one must go back to an explanation that belongs specifically to the place and that predates even the local customs: speech, the first institution of society, owes its shape only to natural causes.<br>

  Abstract: How should we think about the roles that institutions play as determinants of the content of collective outcomes in international society? Many mainstream analysts, whether they embrace the precepts of neorealism or lean toward the tenets of neoliberalism, assume (often implicitly) that we can understand these outcomes by envisioning causal chains in which institutions emerge as proximate forces coming into play only in the later stages of specific chains. They conclude, on the basis of this perspective, that institutions should be treated as intervening variables in contrast to basic causal forces.1 But this is by no means the only way<br>

  Abstract: Understanding continuity and change in international order is a central question in the study of International Relations. IR theories conceptualize order in different ways. Each theory underpins a narrative about how an effective resolution to obstacles or tensions in the international system can be reached and stability secured. Neorealists conceive order as the result of power balances in the international system between dominant states (Waltz 1979). The English school conceives order being built on a “society of states” (Bull 2002; Linklater and Suganami 2006; Linklater 2007).

The relationship between archives and the constructs of a national past is a very close one. State archives are almost always dependent on governments for their existence. They are sustained to serve the state, however its interests may be defined. Like the interests of society more broadly, these are in constant evolution, as are those of individual citizens<br>

By the late-seventeenth century, Harvard-trained ministers and Royal Society natural philosophers continued to advance their practices, though with renewed caution, aware both of mechanical philosophy’s limitations and the parameters surrounding empirical inquiry—especially interdictions against studying preternatural phenomena. Yet neither New England ministers nor London natural philosophers abandoned efforts to apply empirical methods to advance knowledge of God.

  Book Title: Sufi Narratives of Intimacy-Ibn 'Arabī, Gender, and Sexuality<br>
  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): Shaikh Saʿdiyya<br>
  Abstract: Thirteenth-century Sufi poet, mystic, and legal scholar Muhyi al-Din ibn al-'Arabi gave deep and sustained attention to gender as integral to questions of human existence and moral personhood. Reading his works through a critical feminist lens, Sa'diyya Shaikh opens fertile spaces in which new and creative encounters with gender justice in Islam can take place. Grounding her work in Islamic epistemology, Shaikh attends to the ways in which Sufi metaphysics and theology might allow for fundamental shifts in Islamic gender ethics and legal formulations, addressing wide-ranging contemporary challenges including questions of women's rights in marriage and divorce, the politics of veiling, and women's leadership of ritual prayer.Shaikh deftly deconstructs traditional binaries between the spiritual and the political, private conceptions of spiritual development and public notions of social justice, and the realms of inner refinement and those of communal virtue. Drawing on the treasured works of Sufism, Shaikh raises a number of critical questions about the nature of selfhood, subjectivity, spirituality, and society to contribute richly to the prospects of Islamic feminism as well as feminist ethics more broadly.<br>

  Abstract: This book is about close reading. It is about a practice of close reading that oscillates rapidly between domains—the literary-aesthetic, the social, the cultural, and the political—in order to explore the mutually illuminating heterogeneity of these domains when taken together. It does this not to assert the often repeated postmodernist view that there is nothing outside the text, but to outline a reading practice I call

  Abstract: William Lloyd Garrison operated literally in the forefront of the American abolition movement, soliciting subscribers and readers for his newspaper before there were organized, nonsectarian abolition societies. Inspired by the mass pamphleteering campaign of the English emancipation movement, he published the first issue of
                  The Liberatorin 1831 and thereafter linked the progress of the cause to the circulation of the newspaper and other printed articles.

  Book Title: Labor of Dionysus-A Critique of the State-Form<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Negri Antonio<br>
  Abstract: “Labor is the living, form-giving fire,” Marx wrote. “It is the transitoriness of things, their temporality, as their transformation by living time.” How is it, then, that labor, with all its life-affirming potential, has become the means of capitalist discipline, exploitation, and domination in modern society? The authors expose and pursue this paradox through a systematic analysis of the role of labor in the processes of capitalist production and in the establishment of capitalist legal and social institutions. Critiquing liberal and socialist notions of labor and institutional reform from a radical democratic perspective, Hardt and Negri challenge the state-form itself.<br>

  Abstract: Traditional utopian literature relates to the novel’s contemporary historical circumstances through a process of negation—contemporary society is present only as a repressed subtext, and visible only in the conceptual “antinomies” that the utopian text attempts to neutralize or resolve. In the previous chapter, I explored the effects that occur when, instead of repressing the connection between contemporary society and imaginary society (a repression that is designed to preserve the absolute “elsewhere” of utopia), a text actively foregrounds and thematizes the interaction between utopia and contemporary society. This increased interaction funds an “ideologeme of activism” within the text, while the<br>

  Book Title: The Habermas Handbook-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): LAFONT CRISTINA<br>
  Abstract: Jürgen Habermas is one of the most influential philosophers of our time. His diagnoses of contemporary society and concepts such as the public sphere, communicative rationality, and cosmopolitanism have influenced virtually all academic disciplines, spurred political debates, and shaped intellectual life in Germany and beyond for more than fifty years. In
      The
            Habermas Handbook, leading Habermas scholars elucidate his thought, providing essential insight into his key concepts, the breadth of his work, and his influence across politics, law, the social sciences, and public life.This volume offers a comprehensive overview and an in-depth analysis of Habermas's work in its entirety. After examining his intellectual biography, it goes on to illuminate the social and intellectual context of Habermasian thought, such as the Frankfurt School, speech-act theory, and contending theories of democracy. TheHandbookprovides an extensive account of Habermas's texts, ranging from his dissertation on Schelling to his most recent writing about Europe. It illustrates the development of his thought and its frequently controversial reception while elaborating the central ideas of his work. The book also provides a glossary of key terms and concepts, making the complexity of Habermas's thought accessible to a broad readership.<br>

  Abstract: Essays feature close readings of both familiar and lesser known materials, offering provocative interpretations of John of Rupescissa's alchemy; the relationship between the living and the saintly dead in Bernard of Clairvaux's sermons; the nomenclature of heresy in the early eleventh century; the apocalyptic visions of Robert of Uzès; Machiavelli's
      De principatibus; the role of "demotic religiosity" in economic development; and the visions of Elizabeth of Schönau. Contributors write as historians of religion, art, literature, culture, and society, approaching their subjects through the particular and the singular rather than through the thematic and the theoretical. Playing with the wild possibilities of the historical fragments at their disposal, the scholars in this collection advance a new and exciting approach to writing medieval history.<br>

  Author(s): BROWN SASKIA<br>
  Abstract: Our presentist present is by no means uniform or clear-cut, and it is experienced very differently depending on the position we occupy in society. We are caught up in global movement and accelerated flows, or else condemned to the life of casual workers, living from hand to mouth in a stagnant present, with no recognized past, and no real future either (since the temporality of plans and projects is inaccessible). The present is therefore experienced as emancipation or enclosure, and the perspective of the future is no longer reassuring, since it is perceived not as a promise, but as a threat. Hartog's resonant readings show us how the motor of history(-writing) has stalled and help us understand the contradictory qualities of our contemporary presentist relation to time.<br>

All resistance is in vain. For a society’s relations to time hardly seem open to discussion or negotiation. The term “order” implies at once succession and command: the times (in the plural)

The "opening" of different societies to new ideas, products, and forms of prosperity has introduced a persistent uncertainty, or disorder, into everyday life. Multinational corporations have weakened sovereignty. We no longer know who is in control or who is responsible. Economies can collapse without sufficient warning, and the effort to rebuild can drag on for years. Piracy is everywhere.

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Jens<br>
  Abstract: Richard Kearney explores these questions with a host of philosophers known for their inclusive, forward-thinking work on the intersection of secularism, politics, and religion. An interreligious dialogue that refuses to paper over religious difference, these conversations locate the sacred within secular society and affirm a positive role for religion in human reflection and action. Drawing on his own philosophical formulations, literary analysis, and personal interreligious experiences, Kearney develops through these engagements a basic gesture of hospitality for approaching the question of God. His work facilitates a fresh encounter with our best-known voices in continental philosophy and their views on issues of importance to all spiritually minded individuals and skeptics: how to reconcile God's goodness with human evil, how to believe in both God and natural science, how to talk about God without indulging in fundamentalist rhetoric, and how to balance God's sovereignty with God's love.<br>

  Abstract: This paper examines how the colonial administration was shaped in the specific context of Taiwan under Japanese rule. From the beginning of Japanese rule in Taiwan, the colonial government mapped, reworked, and created a series of organizations based on natural villages, and actively sought to integrate these colonial spaces, themselves structured and overlapping, into the hierarchy of the colonial administrative mechanism. The Japanese colonial bureaucracy imposed a discipline of order on Taiwan, and by the 1930s wartime concerns reshaped this order, thus turning Taiwan into not only a disciplined but also a disciplinary society.<br>

  Abstract: Jiao Hong 焦竑 (1540–1620) was an important figure in late Ming intellectual history. In his own day, he was praised for his accomplishments in prose writing as much as for his active interest in Neo-Confucian and Buddhist metaphysics. Since the eighteenth century, however, he has been remembered as a bibliophile and as a pioneer of “evidential research” (

  Abstract: The word “sense,” as any thesaurus shows, is synonymous with (a) meaning, significance, logic; (b) intelligence, wisdom, common sense; and (c) feeling, sensation, awareness. It is the same word, yet it carries very different, even opposing, meanings. Characterizing the history of anthropological theory as a quest for finding the sense of the behaviors of fellow human beings, Michael Herzfeld argues (2001) that theories were engaged first in “making sense” of the behaviors of “exotic others”; then in studying the “common sense” or taken-for-granted realities of different groups within a society (including those of the anthropologist); and now are focusing on<br>

  Book Title: The Last Cannibals-A South American Oral History<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): BASSO ELLEN B.<br>
  Abstract: An especially comprehensive study of Brazilian Amazonian Indian history, The Last Cannibals is the first attempt to understand, through indigenous discourse, the emergence of Upper Xingú society. Drawing on oral documents recorded directly from the native language, Ellen Basso transcribes and analyzes nine traditional Kalapalo stories to offer important insights into Kalapalo historical knowledge and the performance of historical narratives within their nonliterate society. This engaging book challenges the familiar view of biography as a strictly Western literary form. Of special interest are biographies of powerful warriors whose actions led to the emergence of a more recent social order based on restrained behaviors from an earlier time when people were said to be fierce and violent. From these stories, Basso explores how the Kalapalo remember and understand their past and what specific linguistic, psychological, and ideological materials they employ to construct their historical consciousness. Her book will be important reading in anthropology, folklore, linguistics, and South American studies.<br>

  Abstract: There is no founding narrative of Upper Xingu society, nor should we expect any. Despite a strong conviction of shared values and practices, as well as certain mutual interests, people of the Alto Xingu see these as having been adopted piecemeal, and in some cases (most critically, peaceful behavior and maintaining a diet free of animal flesh) incompletely. Moreover, the idea of “society,” conceived in the abstract and independently of the actual ongoing relationships between people, is foreign to them. Kalapalo stories about ancestors associated particularly with present-day communities are very specific in describing relationships between individuals, the formation of<br>

His fortunes were intimately linked with the fate of his site: his capture or sacrifice, admittedly the probable result of military or economic misfortunes, was the symbolic collapse of what Stephen Houston and others have termed “moral authority.”²<br>

  Book Title: A Companion to the Works of Johann Gottfried Herder-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Koepke Wulf<br>
  Abstract: Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) is one of the great names of the classical age of German literature. One of the last universalists, he wrote on aesthetics, literary history and theory, historiography, anthropology, psychology, education, and theology; translated and adapted poetry from ancient Greek, English, Italian, even from Persian and Arabic; collected folk songs from around the world; and pioneered a better understanding of non-European cultures. A student of Kant's, he became Goethe's mentor in Strasbourg, and was a mastermind of the Sturm und Drang and a luminary of classical Weimar. But the wide range of Herder's interests and writings, along with his unorthodox ways of seeing things, seems to have prevented him being fully appreciated for any of them. His image has also been clouded by association with political ideologies, the proponents of which ignored the message of Humanität in his texts. So although Herder is acknowledged by scholars to be one of the great thinkers of European Enlightenment, there is no up-to-date, comprehensive introduction to his works in English, a lacuna this book fills with seventeen new, specially commissioned essays.

  Abstract: An important strategy in the method of early Franciscan preachers and poets was to evoke understanding of vice and virtue through concrete and visible examples. In sermons and catechetical texts, Franciscans used stories and poetry full of lively images to describe sin and show it in action; in this way, the Friars Minor provided literary performance of the vices and virtues for the purpose of correcting the sins of lay society.¹ Indeed our understanding today of what “sinful” behavior was for medieval people is greatly enhanced by the depiction and enactment of specific vices in Franciscan literature.

  Book Title: The Novels of Josefina Aldecoa-Women, Society and Cultural Memory in Contemporary Spain<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): KENNY NUALA<br>
  Abstract: Josefina Aldecoa, in her treatment of themes such as a woman's place in society under and after dictatorship, mother-daughter relationships, war, and memory, confirmed her unique role as a contemporary novelist concerned with women's identity in Spain and as a writer of the mid-century generation ('los niños de la guerra'). The first volume of her trilogy, Historia de una maestra, was one of the earliest narratives of historical memory to be produced in Spain. In this sense, Aldecoa's work anticipated new developments in gender studies, such as the intersection of feminist concerns and cultural memory. This book offers a comprehensive examination of Aldecoa's trajectory as a novelist, from La enredadera to Hermanas, centring on her primary preoccupations of gender and memory, arguing that Aldecoa's fiction offers a new, more complex understanding of women's identity than previously understood. The work combines the two dominating theoretical components of feminism and cultural memory with close textual analysis of Aldecoa's narratives. Her novels highlight the importance of the details of women's daily experiences and struggles throughout the twentieth century, a period of significant socio-political upheaval and change in Spain's history.

  Book Title: Cultural Capital, Language and National Identity in Imperial Spain-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): BINOTTI LUCIA<br>
  Abstract: This innovative study examines the cultural mechanisms in early modern Spain that led to the translation, imitation and selective adoption of the values embodied by the Italian Renaissance. These mechanisms served to delineate a national tradition that addressed the needs of a changing society and gave a "Spanish" physiognomy to the Italian experience, which ultimately led to the Golden Age. By examining such important texts as the sentimental fictions of Diego de San Pedro and Juan de Flores, the Spanish translation of Orlando Furioso, Don Quixote, and the Polifemo, Binotti first describes the conditions imposed on book production by both the expectations of an elite audience and the limitations of the printing market while outlining the process of the creation of an expressive poetic language and the quest for literary models. She then looks at Ambrosio de Morales' chronicles and Bernardo de Aldrete's Del Origen, showing how a cultural discourse founded on foreign scholarship paved the way for the establishment of innovative-and autochtonous-methods of historical and scientific analysis in the early seventeenth-century.

For some, Germany’s destruction, misery, and shame was so complete that a tabula rasa situation existed in the aftermath of the Third Reich, one in which a completely new set of institutions and values that could not in any way be rooted in the Nazi past had to be developed for German society.<br>

  Abstract: In his seminal work, 
                  The Past is a Foreign Country, David Lowenthal not only captures the inseparable nature of past and present, but also advocates that we embrace the production of a useable past in a shifting present. Today, few archaeologists would dispute that our understandings of the past are a product of the present. Moreover, most accept that archaeology is a public concern with political, ethical and social implications in wider society. Indeed, as this volume demonstrates, they actively seek to produce an engaged and engaging past. Yet this has not always been the case. For much of the<br>

  Abstract: Two of the works that Goethe wrote in 1774 end with a 
                  Liebestod. Clavigo, an enduringly popular play, does not actually celebrate the blending of the lovers in a death-transcending union: Its horizon is more social than existential and revolves around Clavigo’s difficulty in choosing between love and ambition, between ascendancy in society and government on the one hand and marriage to the declassé Marie Beaumarchais on the other. The dilemma is resolved by the thrust of a dagger from Marie’s brother, the mortally wounded Clavigo falling on the coffin of the woman he has wronged. He grasps her cold<br>

  Abstract: The 1960s and 1970s were a time of radical cultural, ideological, and political change for French Canada. In 1960 the liberal politician Jean Lesage became prime minister of Quebec. With the slogan “Maîtres chez nous” French Canadians claimed their cultural and economic independence from English-Canadian and American dominance. Authorities that had gone unchallenged for centuries were now questioned: Women began to emancipate themselves from patriarchal power structures, and society freed itself from the clerical system of education.

  Abstract: The ‘Goethe Yearbook’ is a publication of the Goethe Society of North America, encouraging North American Goethe scholarship by publishing original English-language contributions to the understanding of Goethe and other authors of the ‘Goethezeit’ while also welcoming contributions from scholars around the world. Volume 19 of the ‘Goethe Yearbook’ continues to investigate the connection between Goethe's scientific theories and his aesthetics, with essays on his optics and his plant morphology. A special section examines the central role that Goethe philology has had in establishing practices that shaped the history of ‘Germanistik’ as a whole. The yearbook also includes essays on legal history and the novella, Goethe ‘Lieder’, esoteric mysticism in ‘Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre’, and Werther's sexual pathology. The volume also includes three essays re-examining Goethe's aesthetics in the context of the history of deconstruction, as well as the customary book review section.

  Abstract: In this article I examine the place of religious beliefs, and the interrelation between religion and gender, in a selection of twenty-first-century German-language prose fiction written by women. In line with the widespread recognition of a “ religious turn”¹ or “(re)sacralization”² that is transforming political and cultural discourse in the “post-secular society”³ in which we live, the role of religion in contemporary German-language literature is subject to increasing scrutiny. In German literary studies the depiction of Islam in Germanic culture and the history of German-Jewish identity currently receive much more explicit attention than the place of Christian faith.⁴ Julian Preece<br>

  Book Title: Fighting For Time-Shifting Boundaries of Work and Social Life<br>
  Publisher: Russell Sage Foundation<br>
  Author(s): Kalleberg Arne L.<br>
  Abstract: Though there are still just twenty-four hours in a day, society’s idea of who should be doing what and when has shifted. Time, the ultimate scarce resource, has become an increasingly contested battle zone in American life, with work, family, and personal obligations pulling individuals in conflicting directions. In Fighting for Time, editors Cynthia Fuchs Epstein and Arne Kalleberg bring together a team of distinguished sociologists and management analysts to examine the social construction of time and its importance in American culture. Fighting for Time opens with an exploration of changes in time spent at work—both when people are on the job and the number of hours they spend there—and the consequences of those changes for individuals and families. Contributors Jerry Jacobs and Kathleen Gerson find that the relative constancy of the average workweek in America over the last thirty years hides the fact that blue-collar workers are putting in fewer hours while more educated white-collar workers are putting in more. Rudy Fenwick and Mark Tausig look at the effect of nonstandard schedules on workers’ health and family life. They find that working unconventional hours can increase family stress, but that control over one’s work schedule improves family, social, and health outcomes for workers. The book then turns to an examination of how time influences the organization and control of work. The British insurance company studied by David Collinson and Margaret Collinson is an example of a culture where employees are judged on the number of hours they work rather than on their productivity. There, managers are under intense pressure not to take legally guaranteed parental leave, and clocks are banned from the office walls so that employees will work without regard to the time. In the book’s final section, the contributors examine how time can have different meanings for men and women. Cynthia Fuchs Epstein points out that professional women and stay-at-home fathers fac~<br>

  Abstract: The W. I. Thomas and Florian Znaniecki Memorial Conference on Social Theory, held at the University of Chicago, brought together an outstanding array of scholars representing a variety of contending approaches to social theory. In panels, presentations, and general discussions, these scholars confronted one another in the context of an entire range of approaches. But as readers of this deftly edited collection will discover, the conference was more than a forum for abstract theoretical debate. These papers and discussions represent original scholarly contributions that exemplify orientations to social theory by examining real problems in the functioning of society-from large-scale economic growth and decline to the dynamics of interpersonal interaction.<br>

  Book Title: Promises of 1968-Crisis, Illusion and Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): TISMANEANU VLADIMIR<br>
  Abstract: This book is a state of the art reassessment of the significance and consequences of the events associated with the year 1968 in Europe and in North America. Since 1998, there hasn’t been any collective, comparative and interdisciplinary effort to discuss 1968 in the light of both contemporary headways of scholarship and new evidence on this historical period. A significant departure from earlier approaches lies in the fact that the manuscript is constructed in unitary fashion, as it goes beyond the East–West divide, trying to identify the common features of the sixties. The latter are analyzed as simultaneously global and local developments. The main problems addressed by the contributors of this volume are: the sixties as a generational clash; the redefinition of the political as a consequence of the ideological challenges posed to the status-quo by the sixty-eighters; the role of Utopia and the de-radicalization of intellectuals; the challenges to imperialism (Soviet/American); the cultural revolution of the sixties; the crisis of ‘really existing socialism’ and the failure of “socialism with a human face”; the gradual departure from the Yalta-system; the development of a culture of human rights and the project of a global civil society; the situation of 1968 within the general evolution of European history (esp. the relationship of 1968 with 1989). In contrast to existing books, the book provides a fundamental and unique synthesis of approaches on 1968: first, it contains critical (vs. nostalgic) re-evaluations of the events from the part of significant sixty-eighters; second, it includes historical analyses based on new archival research; third, it gathers important theoretical re-assessments of the intellectual history of the 1968; and fourth, it bridges 1968 with its aftermath and its pre-history, thus avoiding an over-contextualization of the topics in question.<br>

  Abstract: The sixties, with the year 1968 serving as their symbolic high point, are best understood in a broader historical context, as one of a sequence of three periods of heightened idealism since World War II. These periods can be dated roughly: 1943–1950 (between World War II and the Cold War), 1960–1972 (the sixties), and 1988–1994 (usually identified with the year 1989). We can trace through all these periods, despite their obvious discontinuities, the development of a project of a global civic awakening (now taking the form of a global civic society) in opposition to what we might<br>

  Abstract: Social dramas, as Victor Turner describes them, are “in large measure political processes, that is, they involve competition for scarce ends—power, dignity, prestige, honor, purity—by particular means and by the utilization of resources that are also scarce—goods, territory, money, men and women. Ends, means, and resources are caught up in an interdependent feedback process.”
                  12What is significant is Turner’s insistence that social dramas are not merely a representation (oral or written) of discord or conflict in society, and as such only a story with its “discernible inaugural, transitional, and terminal motifs” to use Hayden White’s terminology.13For<br>

The administration of the state was divided among a state chancellery, a state council, and the

He also views it as something new, in stark contrast to the representative public sphere of premodern society, in which hierarchical power presented itself to the people in what was to all intents and purposes one-way communication.¹ In recent decades, however, Habermas’s ideas have been challenged, not least by historians studying popular<br>

  Book Title: Where Currents Meet-Frontiers of Memory in Post-Soviet Fiction of Kharkiv, Ukraine<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zaharchenko Tanya<br>
  Abstract: Where Currents Meet treats the Ukrainian and Russian components of cultural experience in Ukraine’s East as elements of a complex continuum. This study of cultural memory in post-Soviet space shows how its inhabitants negotiate the historical legacy they have inherited. Tanya Zaharchenko approaches contemporary Ukrainian literature at the intersection of memory studies and border studies, and her analysis adds a new voice to an ongoing exploration of cultural and historical discourses in Ukraine. This scholarly journey through storylines explores the ways in which younger writers in Kharkiv (Kharkov in Russian), a diverse, dynamic, but understudied border city in east Ukraine today come to grips with a traumatized post-Soviet cultural landscape. Zaharchenko’s book examines the works of Serhiy Zhadan, Andrei Krasniashchikh, Yuri Tsaplin, Oleh Kotsarev and others, introducing them as a “doubletake" generation who came of age during the Soviet Union’s collapse and as adults revisited this experience in their novels. Filling the space between society and the state, local literary texts have turned into forms of historical memory and agents of political life.<br>

As they are by definition seeking to present a social vision of a human community organized along significantly different rules and conventions than the author’s contemporary society, they implicitly or explicitly challenge the norms and habits of existing societies, including the moral code and spiritual goals, which are predominantly influenced by the majority religion of that particular community. In other words, utopias have an inherent heterodox tendency, which renders them suspect in the eyes of religious authorities.

The thesis can be seen as comprising six components: 1) the creation of different institutional apparati that separate religion from politics, 2) the depoliticization and privatization of religion, 3) the decline in religious belief, 4) the development of cultural identity, 5) the rise of the state as governmental form, and 6) the production of capitalist markets.¹ Together these components describe the new phenomenon that constitutes modernity as different from religious and traditional cultures.

  Abstract: I will begin directly with this chapter’s thesis, leaving my conclusions to the end, along with some explanations as to how this helps the whole argument of the present book. My thesis is that over a large area of Central Europe—roughly covering what is now Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, the former Yugoslavia, Romania—society was pervaded by a common ethos, one that differed in many key points from the “Protestant work ethic.” The latter had been indispensable in the formation of modern capitalism and liberal democracy in Anglo-Saxon lands, and in Northwestern Europe in general.

Abstract: The necessity of both solidarity and proceduralism thus holds for both distributive and criminal justice. In the end, Ricoeur remains committed to notions that ground the just polity in community and mutual sharing without thinking that these notions require us to dispense with the formalism of procedures of justice. While the latter are not sufficient on their own to create or sustain a just society, while, indeed, formal procedures always presuppose some conception of the good, procedural conceptions allow us to recognize each other as subjects of rights. Although it is not always clear that Ricoeur succeeds in reconciling Rawls and Walzer or Habermas and Gadamer, he does provide a fresh perspective on current debates within his own interesting account of the structure of moral action.<br>

Abstract: This remark is inspired by Jérôme Baschet’s emphasis on the “spiritual body” as a duality characterized by the domination of the soul over the body and by the body’s elevation through submission to the soul. As a model for the authority of the clergy over secular society, such a hierarchical and dynamic union appears as a fundamental ideological and social matrix in Medieval Latin Christendom. See Jérôme Baschet, “Ame et corps dans l’occident médiéval: Une Dualité dynamique, entre pluralité et dualisme,”

Abstract: Finally, we can turn the tables back onto the “default setting” that Alexander and Smith (
         1993) portray. We began by saying that studies of binary codes hold the setting constant, keeping it focused on governmental settings. But even governments do not always have the same relations to the wider world. Appropriate speech in different governmental bodies varies from teeth‐clenching but polite disagreement in the U.S. Senate ( … “the gentleman from Louisiana …” ), to shouting, booing, and jeering (in, e.g., the British House of Commons; see Merelman1991); and bonds between legislators vary. One could study differences between state institutions, not just as formal institutional differences, and not just as differences in the “discourses of civil society” of the sort Alexander and Smith (1993) describe, but also as differences in group styles.<br>

Abstract: Linguistic anthropology is not a unified field, but it does have some commonly held theoretical views and practices. Many have been consistent over time. Two obvious ones are the importance of learning a field language and the importance of collecting language data, understood broadly as anything from eliciting text to recording naturally occurring speech, for a variety of research aims. As for a general model of language as culture, there is a clear shared sense that language is structured and structuringthat it is a cultural practice both deriving from and helping to constitute society and culture. Linguistic phenomena have unconscious character (as Boas argued) as well as regularities of communicative practice and certain persistent features of reference (Sapir
         1949:104) that function in the production of shared meaning or some approximation of it. Well before the linguistic anthropologists of Durantis third paradigm started thinking about practice theory and performativity, Sapir articulated this view: While we often speak of society as though it were a static structure defined by tradition it is only apparently a static sum of social institutions; actually it is being reanimated or creatively reaffirmed from day to day by particular acts of a communicative nature which obtain among the individuals participating in it.b[1931]<br>

Abstract: If you would really like to know what makes us think, you will not get the answer by reading this book—the title is just a misnomer. The volume is a good after‐hours read on the views and exchanges of two prominent researchers, Jean‐Pierre Changeux, a neuroscientist, and Paul Ricoeur, a philosopher. They argue about a lot of issues, from evolution to brain to ethics, rarely reaching an agreement on the role of modern‐age neuroscience in shaping human values and experience. Changeux envisions an overarching role of neuroscience on human affairs. He writes, “[t]he knowledge that we are now in the process of piecing together about the human brain ought to allow us to have a clearer idea—I am perhaps overly optimistic—of the direction in which we wish to see human society develop” (p 27). Ricoeur holds steadfastly to every millimeter occupied by the totality of human experience and its unique value, seeing no special role in it for neuroscience
      qua neuroscience. For example, the authors engage in the following exchange: “Changeux: … Today … I think that observational methods make it possible to obtain physical facts about subjective psychological states. A physics of introspection may even be possible. Are we in agreement on this point? Ricoeur: In humans a function is not reducible to an observable behavior.… There is a hermeneutics of daily life that gives introspection the dimension of an interpersonal practice.… This is what I find expressed in the phrasefor intérieur,one’s heart of hearts—literally, a ‘forum’ in which one speaks to oneself. This heart of hearts has its own particular status that it would appear you will never succeed in explaining in your science. And so my answer to your question is no” (pp 67–69).<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: The God‐term in Luhmann’s universe is “autopoesis,” essentially the self‐direction of the systems of society, including that of art, toward greater autonomy and complexity. Although Luhmann was a student of Talcott Parsons and his work bears the evolutionary interest of the functionalist paradigm, it is what many partisans of the older version might consider to be a mutant functionalism. As Luhmann avers, he considers “system differentiation” as “the heart of Parsons’s theory” (p. 350, n. 4) yet unlike Parsons’s optimistic sense that differentiation was undergirded by functional imperatives such as adaptive upgrading, Luhmann’s own sense is that the process of societal evolution “does not presuppose central norms, no matter how generalized” (p. 2). Essentially what this means is that society is composed of a set of systems (economy, politics, law, and art, among others) that evolve and complexify but not toward any unified state, such as Parsons’s “societal community.” Rather, each system tends toward its own independence and standards, and thus much of Luhmann’s book explores what he calls “the autonomy of art,” that is, the ability of the art system to develop its own “self‐description.”<br>

Abstract: Daix (n. 2 above), pp. 137–38, quotes Braudel’s memories of 1937, his last year in Brazil: “Le Brésil, c’est la mème civilisation, mais pas au mème âge. C’est vraiment le Brésil qui m’a permis d’arriver à une certaine conception de l’histoire que je n’aurais pas eue si j’étais resté autour de la Méditerranée.” Daix, pp. 109–23, provides a chapter on Brazil with the opening quotation, “C’est au Brésil que je suis devenu intelligent” (p. 109); he compares Braudel’s understanding of French colonial society in Algeria as placed on top of an indigenous society, whereas “the Brazilian social hierarchy [presented itself] less a local than an international economic” phenomenon (p. 111). See also the interview by François Ewald and Jean‐Jacques Brohier, “Un vie pour l’histoire,”
            Magazine littéraire212 (November 1984): 18: “Au Brésil, j’ai d’couvert ce que je ne connaissais pas, et avec une certaine violence: quelque chose qui ressemble à une haute société privilégiée d’autrefois, quelque chose, au bas de la société, qui ressemble au début de la vie industrielle française, etc. En tout cas, c’est au Brésil que je suis devenu ce que je suis aujourd’hui.”<br>

Abstract: Why the history of reading? What historical difference does this casual activity make? By now, historians have become accustomed to scholarly accounts of seemingly incidental matters, such as pet ownership and melodrama, which at first blush may seem rather removed from dynamics of historical change like war, revolution, and industrialization. But in the hands of historians like Roger Chartier and Robert Darnton, the history of reading has become a significant field in the social history of ideas. It has far‐reaching implications, especially in the early modern period, for the development of individual and group consciousness, of new religious beliefs and related institutions, and of the state and its bases in society, culture, and the economy. The Enlightenment, for instance, looks very different from the perspective of the consumers of printed matter. In the eighteenth century, readers took very selectively to heart the ideas of the philosophes for a host of reasons we now know: with a few exceptions—for instance, Jean‐Jacques Rousseau’s
      La nouvelle Héloïse(1761) and J. W. von Goethe’sThe Sorrows of Young Werther(1774)—the major publications of the century’s great intellectuals were much less well circulated than those by the period’s hack writers. And readers received these texts with other things in mind than the philosophes’ challenge to think rationally, deductively, and independently of established authority. Moreover, Jürgen Habermas’s notion of the public sphere (inThe Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere,trans. Thomas Burger and Frederick Lawrence [Cambridge, Mass., 1989]) makes sense only if there are engaged readers as well as engaged writers to create a bourgeois civil society on the eve of the French Revolution of 1789.<br>

Abstract: MacIntyre shows how narratives constitute social life: “I can only answer the question ‘What am I to do?’ if I can answer the prior question ‘Of what story or stories do I find myself a part?’ We enter human society, that is, with one or more imputed characters—roles into which we have been drafted” [
         13, p. 216]. While there continues to be argument over the claim that stories are lived before they are recounted and that life is stories being lived out, the work of Carr shows that this is so, for the overall temporal structure of action is narrative in character; life is an inchoate narrative [24]. Human reality is not just a sequence because it can be demonstrated that narrative coherence inheres in “even the most elementary experience or action” [24, p. 88]. Narrative coherence is “an essential structural feature of the very fact ofhavingan experience orperformingan action” [24, p. 88]. Hence, order is present in events even before a narrative is imposed on them, and “the real difference between ‘art’ and ‘life’ is not organization versus chaos, but rather the absence in life of that point of view which transforms events into a story bytellingthem” [24, p. 59]. This emphasis on activity is also found in MacIntyre: “Narrative is not the work of poets, dramatists and novelists reflecting upon events which had no narrative order before one was imposed by the singer or the writer; narrative form is neither disguise nor decoration” [13, p. 211]. For MacIntyre, human actions are themselves enacted narratives; for Carr, it is in living out a life that we achieve a “grasp” at the level of attempting to make meaning or sense of relationships [24]. According to Gare, following this line of thought shows us the following:
               
         Actions are lived stories. The more complex the action, the longer its duration and the more people involved, the more obviously this is the case. Actions such as building a community or developing our understanding of the~<br>

Abstract: What is a cyborg? Haraway provides different descriptions, all of which emphasize the cyborg’s partial, shifting, nontotalizing, and subversive nature:
         
               
            A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. (Haraway
            1991, 149)
               
            The cyborg is resolutely committed to partiality, irony, intimacy, and perversity. It is oppositional, utopian, and completely without innocence. (
            1991, 151)
               The cyborg is a resource for two major domains: the new computerized and globalized mode of production and the need for a broad though not totalizing feminist solidarity. The idea of the cyborg, derived from the human‐machine figures of science fiction, provides a resource, Haraway suggests, for combating the information‐based society of late capitalism, which has intensified domination in new ways. She argues that the preponderance of computer technology in creating antilabor household economies and globalization can be significantly challenged by embracing the breaching of the human‐machine border signified by the cyborg. For feminism, the cyborg promises possibilities other than those based on the maternal, the pre‐Oedipal, or the universalizing. The cyborg provides “pleasure in the confusion of boundaries” (Holistic politics depend on metaphors of birth and invariably call on the resources of reproductive sex. I would suggest that cyborgs have more to do with regeneration. … We require regeneration, not rebirth, and the possibility for our reconstitution includes the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous world without gender. (
            1991, 181)1991, 150) and critiques the imperialism of a common feminist language. Haraway’s aspiration is to provide an image for a politics that can “embrace partial, contradictory, permanently unclosed constructions of personal and collective selves and still be f~<br>

Abstract: Fraser’s notion of participatory parity claims that what requires recognition is not group‐specific identity but rather the status of group members as full partners in social interaction (Fraser, “Recognition,” 24). In her words, it means recognizing that “everyone has an equal right to pursue social esteem under fair conditions of equal opportunity” (28). In my reading, Hegel’s master‐slave dialectic is primarily about equal recognition of self‐determining rational agents and less about equal recognition of cultural identity or worth, as my discussion of Fanon makes clear. I agree with Axel Honneth that in order for there to be a sense of social solidarity, social esteem conferred by recognition of worth (of one another’s abilities, skills, and ways of life) is necessary.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: From this angle, the child may be viewed as contemporary morality’s greatest test. The work of the human sciences shows the diversity of ways in which children’s lives are disenfranchised but also deeply resilient. It can map the complex contours of problems like children’s persistent poverty or relations to mass media. But theological ethics must step in to help imagine how to make children a creative new response. To do to a child as you would have done to yourself is to respond to the profoundest possible depths of human otherness and marginality with a radically self‐transforming love and hope. It is to open oneself and one’s social world to reversing ingrained exclusions and oversimplifications through ever more other‐inclusive moral horizons. Responsibility for children in both families and society reveals the extent to which moral life is not just a fixed reality but also a transcending journey of creative response and renewal.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Abstract: These considerations may also help us reflect on the nature of ethics as a disciplinary inquiry. Somewhat like artists, novelists, and even social and physical scientists, ethicists should function, at least in part, as investigators and disrupters of accepted wisdom, imaginers of provocative new moral possibilities, transformers of shared social and cultural worlds, and contributors toward creating more inclusive human meaning. They should do this in creative and fruitful conversation and tension with other disciplines, transforming and being transformed in relation to them.
         39Ethicists can contribute to society in both theoretical and practical ways by challenging ingrained moral ideologies, naming and exposing real social tensions, and innovating new possibilities for social and relational worlds and practices—that is, by engaging their world creatively. This task is already part of the ongoing interpretive conversation of ordinary moral culture. Ethicists may raise social dynamics to higher levels of intentional reflection in the hope of helping humanity better respond to its own primordial poetic capability for “making” this a better world.<br>

Abstract: The concept of the good may apply particularly pointedly to professional codes of ethics. The codes are aimed at the positive right of free speech and also at professional responsibility. They attempt to articulate practical and normative standards of ethics. Both the ALA Code of Ethics and the American Society for Information Science and Technology Professional Guidelines speak in terms of responsibility to communities, to the profession, and to society as a whole. Public pronouncement of the codes does serve to affirm the existence of libraries as just institutions in a democracy. Related to the second scenario above, accuracy does fit with the good since it is in people’s interest to obtain accurate information that they can employ for their own well‐being. Advocacy is certainly not always and everywhere prohibited, but it is secondary to people’s right to information that is as accurate as it is possible to provide. Accuracy also embraces a commitment to truth, which recognizes a fundamental inequality of some information (the true and the false; refer again to the first scenario). It is generally taken to be responsible professionalism to check information sources against one another to corroborate information. This action, as Lynch observes, is not a substitute for truth; it is a means to truth (in the weak sense) [
         19, p. 81]. Toward the end of accuracy and truth, there are some closely related matters. For one thing, there have been some persistent challenges related to government information and its accessibility versus its effective suppression. This is an area in which advocacy and accuracy merge, with the common aim of presenting library users with the most authoritative information possible. Also, libraries’ access mechanisms, including subject headings, can benefit from advocacy directed toward language that encompasses the culture, linguistic distinctions, and other facets of the people who will search for information.<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: The building of Zion remains the “future project” of the LDS Church and is “intimately related to the ways in which it remembers itself.”
         93The promise of Zion still orders the experience of Smith’s faithful readers, providing them a beginning and an end between which they, as his readers—by means of their own heuristic powers of imagination—get their bearings to act. Their local ecclesiastical units are called “stakes,” symbolic of the stakes that anchor the tent of Zion, and are collectively referred to as “the stakes of Zion.” Thus, as with other myths that have founded a sense of peoplehood, Smith’s narrative history of human and divine interaction was ultimately oriented to a future time that served as a basis for acting in the present. It provided a world of meaning by which his believing readers understood themselves existentially, including their future and not merely their past. Most fundamentally, Smith’s writings give his believing readers a different sense of what was and what will be and, as a consequence, give significance to and a sense of what is real in the present. Just as the story of a realized messiah and the coming kingdom profoundly reoriented the Jews called “Christian,” Smith’s writings of the “fulness of times” provided a unique means by which the Latter‐day Saints’ alterity has been maintained, even as they integrated with contemporary society.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and~<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 589491<br>
2008<br>
Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: Yet the nagging fact remains, lodged right at the generic crux of ethics and epistemology. For there is no denying that the withheld truth would have had a decisive ethical charge, removing the unearned guilt of years, releasing the unloved son to a different autobiographic consciousness altogether. The promissory morality of soul mates as helpmates in the novel's last paragraph—they are returned to a society that has previously contributed to their exclusion, to perform what service they now can—is of course stationed to outbid all epistemological regret. Yet to the supposed selflessness of this social ethic, the self-knowledge of the hero has been entirely sacrificed. What might have done him good is subsumed to his doing good. A logic like this does have its own communal morality, of course, but only if articulated. Instead, we get, unadmitted, a sublimation of the sexual into the social subject. In this way the closural immanence of form within the compromises of Dickens's story is neither providential nor evidentiary but merely and remorselessly conventional. I say merely, because conjugal love has been unfleshed into duty by an ideology of the so-called work ethic; remorselessly, because the pace of closure excludes all talking back from within the plot; but not seamlessly, because the false notes remain, jangling, reverberant. They remain, that is, for the reader to read—and this as a certain lingering discord that outlasts plot itself. In what we've stumbled over in the novel's final paragraph the discrepancy between knowledge and desire takes the form of a verbal deviance writ small, a mere glitch or two at the level of agreement, a predication no longer justified in the linguistic sense nor in the ethical and the epistemological senses, given that it implies a not only vaguely morbid but a downright deceptive variant of the marital two-made-one.

Abstract: However, one has to ask a question. Given the condition of the global age, is either account of knowledge possible and pertinent? The German sociologist Niklas Luhmann notes, “Modern society is a polycentric, polycontextual system. It applies completely different codes, completely different ‘frames,' completely different principled distinctions according to whether it describes itself from the standpoint of religion or the standpoint of science, from the standpoint of law … from the standpoint of economics.”
         28Even if one does not agree with Luhmann’s stark claim about systemic social differentiation, it is still the case that contemporary high‐modern, global societies are not ordered around one center, whether divine or human or even the self/other dyad. We cannot grasp reality from just one frame of reference; there is no center to knowledge.<br>

Author(s): Eades Caroline<br>
Abstract: These methodological oversights are surprising since Eades is clearly familiar with research exploring the links between history, memory, and collective representations. She cites Jacques Le Goff, Marc Ferro, Pierre Nora, Michel de Certeau, Paul Ricoeur, and Henry Rousso alongside a wide range of colonial/postcolonial historians and theorists, including Robert Stam, Benjamin Stora, Edward Said, Homi Bhabha, and Dominick LaCapra. In the end, theory and formal analysis drown out contextual issues of production, distribution, and reception. Three of the book's four chapters deal primarily with theme and form; only the first examines historiographic issues in their own right. This imbalance is not necessarily a flaw, but it does illustrate the challenges of interdisciplinary research and writing. Many film scholars will welcome the author's extraordinarily detailed inventory of the strategies used in postcolonial cinema to critique imperialism, particularly the creative subversion (and to a lesser extent, perpetuation) of representational conventions inherited from colonial‐era painting, literature, and movies. On the other hand, cultural historians will likely be disappointed by the lack of attention paid to the life of these films in society, the multiple meanings attached to them by viewers, and their relation to competing discourses of the same era.<br>

Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: The tether to the vertical pole of theory having loosened in the 1980s, film studies spread out from its traditional center. Deleuze's and Bordwell's books may stand out from that era because their ideas took shape in and around a longstanding corpus—the art film and classical Hollywood—but that corpus was on the verge of exploding under the pressure of cultural studies. For anglophone film studies in that decade dove straight into this rising river, trying not to drown in the process. Not only were new modes and genres dredged up for discussion, films themselves were increasingly set aside in favor of other objects of study (audiences, television, advertising).
         59As for cinema studies, it has lost much of the vague definition it had, yet as an institution, a “society,” it swelled with new types of scholars, many of whom found movies and related phenomena to be a fine—even an exceptional—site to monitor social processes.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: This passage establishes a pattern that I feel can clarify Coleridge’s handling of the language of prayer. It is one also familiar in its structure from our torn relationship to the moral law: we are constituted as responsible wills because of our relationship to God, but our violation of the law means that we are fallen and finite, necessarily separate from God’s will. Similarly, according to the
         Opus, we are constituted as rational beings by the light of reason given to us by God, but we possess individual, finite rationality precisely because we are necessarily separate from God’s reason. Now, Coleridge definitely believed language was imbued with Logos and even lent it a divine origin given that it, like morality and rationality, marks us off from the animals: “The very conditions and materials of convention, a society of communicants, presupposes a language. … [It is] inconceivable that language should have been given to a mind that did not contain in itself the grounds and principles of language.”51However, just as our fallen individuality demands a necessary separation from God’s will and God’s reason, our speech would logically mark the same separation. When speaking of God or trying to orient ourselves to God, it is not surprising that human language fails to overcome its own determination by the fallen, alienated world from which it proximately springs—even if it may ultimately come from or reflect or echo the divine Word.<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Despite these oppositions, secularization and resacralization should be regarded as complementary phenomena that arose in response to the problem of a radically transcendent, hidden God. The studies under review, then, are of crucial importance, but their full significance requires a supplementary analysis. Novel conceptions of society, the nation, Scripture, and personhood followed from an intensification of divine transcendence, and, at the same time, necessitated a reworking of the immanent relations between worldly persons, institutions, and things. It was not merely that secularization, now understood by Bell and others as the translation of divine authority into a worldly register, entailed that the latter incorporate the properties and prerogatives once reserved for God alone. Enlightenment-era efforts to resacralize the self as an object of a totalizing force—situated either in the mystic divine or in a purely immanent, materialist conception of nature—suggest another dynamic at work: the closing of the chasm between the divine and terrestrial spheres and the identification of one with the other. Even if human effort was increasingly regarded as the source of one's understanding of the world, the humans undertaking this work had become newly alien to themselves, and in a manner that recalled the radical distance of the divine.<br>

Abstract: But the astonishing aspect of this oath is, of course, its binding unto death, joined to an apparent intention to die, when suicide is forbidden in the Quran (e.g., at 4:29). While suicide pledges are legendary in the history of warfare (e.g., the Zealots at Masada, the kamikaze of World War II) and understandably equated with a love greater than love of oneself, noble suicides have never been conventional in Islamic societies and planned deaths were not sanctioned during the society’s golden age.
            50Suicide operations are in fact a relatively new phenomenon in Islam,51with questionable etiologies.52Traditionally, death in battle was graded against a strenuous code that measured purity of fighting intention and determined the slain’s status as a potential martyr.53An implicit code such as this may explain why the bulk of the instructions, and indeed this very one, emphasize purifying oneself, even of the desire for vengeance against those who “fear death and follow Satan.”54Conceivably, only the purest ritual actor, transported onto a ritual stage, may transcend Islamic proscriptions on suicide and give his life as an offering to God. While the ritual actors do not outrightly endorse an oath to die—proscribed in Islamic theology—they certainly knew they would die.55Purification helps to sanctify a mission that, on its face, should be forbidden.<br>

Abstract: However, one could argue that there is a serious problem with his core theory. The problem is this: despite all the polemics and careful exegesis, finally he offers no substantive justification for adopting materialism as a position as opposed to any other position. So, whence comes his materialism? From politics and from political morality. In a critique of Deleuze’s approach he says it is “neither epistemologically fruitful nor politically strategic in contemporary society ” (164). Whether or not an approach is politically strategic in his sense, is a deeply misguided criterion for assessing a theory. Its presentist agenda renders it useless for evaluating theory as such. A theory of religion must be applicable to all forms of religion, not just the ones we encounter in our present. Ultimately, using such a criterion for choosing a theoretical framework makes such a choice subjective, even solipsistic. His criterion makes no sense for the study of ancient religions or for the study of textual traditions, both worthy pursuits. There may be good reasons to study angels and not human beings in the present.<br>

         Death and the Regeneration of Life, ed. M. Bloch and J. Parry (Cambridge, 1982), 155–86, esp. 158. It is interesting to note that the reentry of mourners into society is marked on the seventh day by a ceremony known as “putting on the red” (chʾuan hung), in which mourners exchange their white mourning garb with red, associated with life and luck (p. 165). The color symbolism here offers a suggestive parallel to the red heifer rite of Numbers 19, though we must keep in mind that color symbolism in general is much more pervasive and explicit in Cantonese culture than in ancient Israel.<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: Vincent Crapanzano adopts an aphoristic/interrogative style. He first asks whether it is possible to distinguish an anthropology of morality from the morality of anthropology. Insofar as we have not had a coherent anthropology of morality, I hope not—but I wonder if this implies a moral dimension of anthropology that goes beyond professional ethics. His second intervention suggests I fail to recognize that moral anthropology has often deflected ethnographic study of morality, though the newer studies to which I call attention do incorporate an ethnographic approach. He also wonders whether insistence by American anthropologists on egalitarian relationships in the field is an imposition of American values; one could extend this query to the well-intentioned but ironically nonegalitarian appropriation in the ethnographic aim of giving voice to the oppressed indigenous. Crapanzano’s third aphoristic query raises the relation among descriptive, normative, and universal morality while stopping short of asking how the rhetoric of the universal to which he refers might be related to the distinction between cultural and moral relativity. His fourth reflection is framed in terms of two distinctions (between political and moral, and between psychological and moral), but especially in the American society to which he refers it might be just as fruitful to put moral, political, and psychological idioms and attributions into a triangular relationship. Aphorism five is an injunction to consider the meta-moral, and I take this to mean both how morality is defined and where it fits into social discourse and ethnographic practice.<br>

Abstract: The connectedness that Novy envisions, however, is hard to see onstage. At the close of the play, the surviving characters remain painfully and awkwardly apart. Albany tries to establish some form of sociality, but his proposal to reconstitute the realm under the joint rule of Kent and Edgar falls flat. Kent is intent on suicide, while Edgar makes no answer at all. Who will rule the kingdom and what will become of it are left as open questions, muddled even more by the fact that the play’s final speech, which would customarily spoken by the royal successor, is inconsistently assigned to Albany in the Quarto and to Edgar in the Folio.
      
            In a certain sense, this incertitude is apt: the nomination of a new king is hardly relevant, for the kingdom he would inherit has disintegrated. No longer a society, Albion is now a number of atomistic individuals, aloof and embarrassed. Their dissociation is distressing, and it prods us to consider a number of difficult questions concerning ethics, sociality, and politics. Among other things, we are brought to wonder whether the ethical relation can coalesce into—or even coexist with—the political relation. In a play world that places such weight on intersubjectivity and individual responsibility, is politics even possible?52<br>

Abstract: In such a bridging use of history, Varro was no exception. Despite the production of much partisan narrative, there was a strong current in Roman historiography that aimed at creating a history common to the Roman families from all over Italy and different layers of society. Annalistic history, narrating Roman history year by year with ever changing protagonists, and the projection of a long line of military victories into the calendar by means of founding dates, offered the possibility to level out differences in individual or gentilician contributions, to write a history without hierarchy. Cato attempted a history without naming individuals. This option, however, was not followed by history of religion as attempted in Varro’s
      Antiquitates.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: That should remind us of the two religious dimensions that Bonhoeffer aimed to overcome for the sake of a worldly faith, namely other-worldliness (metaphysics) and inwardness (individualism). By making us servants of the “heavenly God,” who does not have the human face of Jesus, religion almost automatically establishes the sphere of the sacred and that of the profane, and in so doing makes us see ourselves as privileged or pure. In such a divided reality, those who do not confess our God sooner or later become our enemies. While narrowly comprehended, religious affiliation generates the distinctions that divide us into hostile camps, the Christ of the nonreligious faith “wants us to be in the midst of our enemies, just as she was.”
         
               The religion that Bonhoeffer seeks to deconstruct is the “habit of heart that allows us to approach the world without love, even while declaring that we are doing just the opposite.”160
            
               In this sense, Bonhoeffer’s holistic approach to life and his Christological radicalism can preclude the church from falling into totalitarianism, on the one hand, and becoming sectarian and xenophobic, on the other. Individualism also constitutes a constant threat to faith, yet in a different way: striving for my own salvation simply goes against the Christian ideal of participation in Jesus’s being for others and consequent solidarity with the world’s sufferings. Besides, the egocentric focus on one’s own salvation that compromises the common good can be easily manipulated into serving diverse political agendas. Indeed, when one’s salvation becomes a matter of saving one’s own culture, society, country or community, it shows that religion degenerates into what Bonhoeffer calls “pagan wisdom.”161

Abstract: William Paul Simmons and Edward Finley, in their respective essays, “Voegelin and Levinas” and “Politics, Metaphysics, and Anti-Foundationalism,” compare Voegelin's, Levinas', and Patočka's philosophies in the recovery of transcendence. For Simmons, both Voegelin and Levinas recognize transcendence as a guide instead of a foundation. For the former, politics and ethics are justified “from the individual's existential participation in the
         metaxy,” while for the latter, “Politics must answer to ethics” (139). Patočka and Voegelin also accept transcendence into their politics, but they approach transcendence in different ways: Patočka employs postmodern techniques, “negative Platoism,” to reject metaphysical thinking, while Voegelin adopts a classical approach for understanding Plato. Although both Simmons and Findley provide an excellent delineation of the differences among these thinkers, they leave open the question of which approach—Voegelin's, Levinas', or Patočka's—is the best way to recover a meaning of transcendence for society.<br>

Issue: ca.2006.25.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 2006<br>
Author(s): Moatti Claudia<br>
Abstract: AbstractThis paper isolates movement as a topic for analysis in Roman imperial history. Movement is regarded under three aspects: translation (of texts, practices, ideas), migration (of officials, merchants, students, etc.), and communication (i.e. the movement of written documents). Interrelationships among the three aspects of movement are identified and discussed, as are the shared impact of translation, migration, and communication on issues of cultural and social identity and political negotiation and control. The article argues that movement changes the role of the state as well as relations between individual and states, augments the use of writing in society, transforms identities, and gives impulse to internal and external regulations. The implications of movement are understood as both pragmatic and formal, altering relations to space and time and influencing ways of organizing and thinking. The author surveys current work in the field and identifies potential areas for future research. The paper draws heavily on both literary and documentary sources and discusses material from the late republic through late antiquity, paying particular attention to continuities and discontinuities between early and later periods of the Roman empire.<br>

Abstract: Examination of two texts generated by the student massacre at the Plaza de Tlatelolco in 1968:
            Postdataby Octavio Paz, andLa noche de Tlatelolcoby Elena Poniatowska. Paz's totalizing vision interprets the events as providing answers to the questions about the nation posed inEl laberinto de la soledad, and he insists on the need to rewrite Mexico's history under the aegis of a new genealogy. Poniatowska's book, instead, is ruled by fragmentation and plurality, to convey the often dissonant voices of civil society. The analysis scrutinizes literary form as it is made to represent relations between violence, justice and aesthetics.<br>

This article explores a diffierent dynamic, highlighting the ways in which a series of scandalous and transgressive events, associated with particular networks of metropolitan culture in London, played a significant role in reshaping sexual beliefs and attitudes within English society during the postwar period.<br>

Abstract: This paper analyzes J. Habermas's theory of “universal pragmatics” and examines the extent to which Habermas's ideal speech community is predicted upon a specific type of relationship between the individual and society. The ability of the theory of universal pragmatics to overcome the form of domination institutionalized by modern societies is questioned, and the argument is made that Habermas's radical program of emancipation is vitiated (1) by Habermas's conflation of “transcendental” and “situationally engaged” enlightenment and (2) by Habermas's inability to reintegrate practical-emancipatory and technical forms of reason. Habermas's idea of “communicative competence” replicates, rather than displaces, the “modern” solution to the problem of the relationship between the individual and society.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: si.2011.34.issue-1<br>
Date: 02 2011<br>
Author(s): Bernasconi Oriana<br>
Abstract: Sociology and neighboring disciplines have produced different analytic tools to examine the dialogical relationship between individuals and society ("narrative work," "identity work," "moral career," "moral breakdown"). However, the question of how individuals negotiate the interpretation of personal experience over their lifetimes in a changing cultural context remains unexplored. This article introduces narrative elasticity as a feature of narrative work and as a time-sensitive analytic tool for conducting inquiries into processes of temporal retraction and expansion of what storytellers conceive as the normal order of significance. The application of this tool to the analysis of mature and elderly Chileans' life stories shows how cultural change occurs at the individual level, considers factors that motivate and inhibit processes of reinterpretation of personal experience, and identifies different levels at which it operates.<br>

Abstract: Memoria Abierta's work responds to the need for a dialogue in Argentina among human rights organizations, the government, and civil society that will stimulate the formation of a collective memory about the history of State-led terrorism in the country. Processing documents, testimonies, and images related to the history of illegal repression in Argentina (c. 1974–1983), and creating a topographical reconstruction of the locations where State-led terrorism occurred poses diverse ethical, technical, and political problems regarding the recollection, description, transmission, and diffusion of the materials of memory. This article describes some of these challenges and how they affect and are shaped by the work of Memoria Abierta.<br>

Article Title: The Formation of Identity: The Importance of Ideals<br>
Publisher: Carfax Publishing<br>
Issue: i243292<br>
Date: 12 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Thompson Jim<br>
Abstract: In the formation and composition of what might be termed personal identity a key but often neglected aspect is ideal identity. While comprising aspirations rather than realities, it makes a major contribution to the definition of self-identity. It does this as a result of: (a) clarifying what kind of person the individual wishes to be; and (b) an interrogation of how she sets about achieving her ideal identity, intimating what kind of person she is at a particular moment by virtue of the way in which she strives to achieve her ideal. The article argues for a re-appraisal of the notion of ideals in education and for its reinstatement as a significant feature of education. Indeed, we argue, children cannot avoid ideals--they are presented to them everyday from a wide variety of sources. But these sources or the ideals that they promote are not necessarily good for the child's well-being or for her fellow citizens. Consequently, teachers as moral agents have an important role in assisting children to acquire ideals that do meet such a criterion of goodness in addition to helping them reflect critically on the range of ideals they may encounter in their communities and society.<br>

Publisher: John Wiley & Sons<br>
Issue: i250429<br>
Date: 12 1, 1968<br>
Author(s): Wittgenstein David<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz have been concerned with the notion of human action as text. This text, like all texts, has manifest and hidden meanings. The hidden meanings indicate a "semantic" function of social activities, in the sense that they provide members of a society with readings of their experience, by telling them about themselves, their values, beliefs, and cultures. Ricoeur's and Geertz's ideas are used to examine the notion of "education as text". Because Ricoeur and Geertz stress hidden meaning, their ideas lead us to an analysis of the "hidden curriculum". The hidden curriculum is a reading of an educational text, normally performed by students. However, as Ricoeur argues, texts can be read by anyone. The question then arises: which sort of hidden curriculum is read not only by the students, but by all members of society? What sort of reading of society's experience is provided when education is a text read by all? I propose the hypothesis that education then becomes a text about society's myths and sacred beliefs.<br>

Article Title: A Pedagogy to Expose and Critique Gendered Cultural Stereotypes Embedded in Art Interpretations<br>
Publisher: National Art Education Association<br>

Abstract: The feminist pedagogical approach introduced here can raise self-awareness about gender inscriptions that people bestow on what they perceive. Gender inscriptions are normative assumptions formed as abstract idealized perceptions of gender (Hayles, 1992). These inscriptions are embedded in society's signs and discourse and appear natural, yet they are often at odds with our lived-experiences. As we expose these "normative" stereotypes we recognize that these constructed perceptions are attitudes that prejudice art as noteworthy or insignificant. Stereotypes of females tend to be aligned with qualities not highly valued in this society and do not match prevalent definitions of art and artists. My goal in presenting this study is to encourage its use as a teaching approach that exposes gender stereotypes and the devaluation of women artists. In this interpretive content analysis, I studied viewer rationales used for inscribing an artist's gender when looking at art in order to render visible gendered cultural inscriptions. Responses suggest that gender inscription impacts how viewers interpret a work, and how men and women diverge in describing similar themes.<br>

Abstract: Longterm trends are examined for the population mass that occupied the central highlands of Palestine during the Iron Age. After 1200 B. C. the landscape of this sparsely populated "frontier" changed as newcomers established hilltop villages, cultivated intermontane valleys, and terraced the slopes. Spatial patterning within villages and certain toponyms were influenced by patrilineal kinship. Heads of household and their lineage mates exercised rights over inheritance and succession in landholding. Inequalities developed within "tribal" Israel long before the monarchy, probably through a process of "lineage capture;" and clientship, with its dyadic relationships between superiors and inferiors, became more common. Tensions developed within Israelite society from the interactions of kinship, clientship, and kingship. As the population grew under the monarchy, the highland frontier was effectively closed, and opportunities for acquiring new land diminished. Thus, many unmarried males had to look elsewhere for patrons and positions. From the ranks of these noble "youths" came recruits for the military, the government, and the priesthood.<br>

Author(s): Ito Botond<br>
Abstract: This essay investigates the roots of a growing impass in contemporary architecture vis a vis the economic, technological, social and political developments of our advanced or late-capitalist society. It focuses upon architecture's apparently diminishing capacity to address our present human condition, yet argues that the problems responsible for the "crisis" of architectural thought and design in general have evolved as the result of historic processes, and therefore the impass can only partially be explained with the short-comings of modern architecture or the 'short sighted' attitude of the architects themselves. Nevertheless, it also argues that architecture, in spite of its now rather limited transformative capacity, should persistently attempt to reveal, rather than mask or otherwise escape, its fundamental relatedness to material processes; that is, to the modes of production and consumption on which social and political power relations are predicated. To be able to do so, and thus to foster a more liberating "form" of human environment, the profession needs first of all a strong political self consciousness, while aiming at a practice of critical inquiry.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263714<br>
Date: 12 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Rauschenbusch Walter<br>
Abstract: Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis, viewed by many as the masterpiece of the social gospel movement, has been confined to the dusty shelves of the library. Can we catch no glimpse of what astounded its massive reading public, no glimmer of Rauschenbusch's own sense of the work as a "dangerous book" written in fear and trembling? This article suggests that a generic analysis of Christianity and the Social Crisis might lead to surprising disclosures. Any generic analysis involves the discussion of a group of texts. Consequently this study proceeds via a comparison of the structure of Christianity and the Social Crisis with those of other works of a similar type which were produced between 1890 and 1915. The genre is isolated by utilizing the techniques of Tzvetan Todorov. Certain negative traits are specified which separate the genre from its neighbors. The positive leitmotif of a dual crisis-a crisis affecting society as a whole and the ramifications of that crisis within the Christian churches-is specified as the decisive trait of the genre. To deal with this leitmotif a specific structure was generated by the works under consideration. They provided-to pirate the words of Clifford Geertz in his landmark essay on modern ideologies-"maps of problematic reality" and "matrices for the creation of collective conscience." In designing their maps of problematic reality our authors worked along two separate but related vectors. The first of these vectors was constituted by a historical analysis of the origins of the present crisis, while the second consisted of a systemic analysis of the present social order. Each of these elements of the genre is examined in turn. The mapping of problematic reality by means of a historical and a structural analysis was geared towards provoking as well as defining the crisis. Crisis, once defined, demanded decision. Nevertheless the "permanent basis for action" which Rauschenbusch and others sought could not be groun~<br>

Author(s): Zahan William G.<br>
Abstract: The very definition of myth is problematic today; here narrow, partial, "monomythic" definitions are rejected in favor of a complex, inclusive one, the seventeen items of which are then discussed. A mythological corpus consists of a network of myths, which are culturally-important imaginal stories conveying, by means of metaphor and symbol, graphic imagery, and emotional conviction and participation, the primal, foundational accounts of the real, experienced world, and humankind's roles and relative statuses within it. Mythologies may convey the political and moral values of a culture, and provide systems of interpreting individual experience within a universal perspective, which may include the intervention of suprahuman entities, as well as aspects of the natural and cultural orders. Myths may be enacted or reflected in rituals, ceremonies, and dramas, or provide materials for secondary elaborations. Only a polyphasic definition will provide appreciation of their manifold roles within a society.<br>

Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first mean~<br>

Abstract: This paper is an attempt to rethink the much-discussed topic of the so-called crisis of orientation among, or shift of, Egyptian intellectuals who turned to Islamic subjects in the 1930s. Those intellectuals who, during the 1920s, had adhered to the principles of Westernization and secularization were said to have abandoned these principles to embrace Islam and Arabism a decade later. The commonly ventured historical account of this shift attempted to describe and explain it from the "top down," that is, from the perspective of the intellectual producers, either on the basis of content analysis of their texts or through the reconstruction of authorial intentions. It was assumed that the impact of this shift on the culture and politics of contemporary society could be extracted from the meanings invested by the authors in their texts or from the context of the act of writing. This paper approaches the subject from a different perspective, namely, from the "bottom up." While not ignoring authorial intentions or the meanings with which authors invested their texts, I emphasize the ways in which readers reinterpreted intellectual literature on Islam as they consumed it and argue that a proper understanding of the social and political impact of literary products cannot be attained without also understanding the reception of these products. I concentrate especially on one of the major representative texts of this shift, Muhammad Husayn Haykal's biography of the Prophet, and reconstruct the different interpretations of this work's major communities of contemporary readers in the discursive context of their different "horizons of expectations." Through recontextualizing the "crisis of orientation" debate in the paradigm of reader-response criticism and reception theory, the paper is intended to show that each community of readers produces an autonomous interpretation, "another reading." Despite differences among the various reading communities, some common features emerge f~<br>

Abstract: Taylor, it has to be noted, would presumably quarrel
with this "either/or" formulation, either interpret the
classics or interpret the world. His Hegel book obvi-
ously falls within the genre of commentary on the tradi-
tion. Furthermore, in the preface to its condensation as
Hegel and Modern Society, he emphasizes the relevance
of Hegel's political philosophy to our time (1979, pp. xi-
xii)

Author(s): Smith Philip<br>
Abstract: Contemporary social theory has turned increasingly to concepts such as civil society, community, and the public sphere in order to theorize about the construction of vital, democratic, and solidaristic political cultures. The dominant prescriptions for attaining this end invoke the need for institutional and procedural reform, but overlook the autonomous role of culture in shaping and defining the forms of social solidarity. This article proposes a model of solidarity based on the two genres of Romance and Irony, and argues that these narrative forms offer useful vocabularies for organizing public discourse within and between civil society and its constituent communities. Whilst unable to sustain fully-inclusive and solidaristic political cultures on their own, in combination the genres of Romance and Irony allow for solidaristic forms built around tolerance, reflexivity, and intersubjectivity.<br>

Abstract: Drawing from research conducted on the personal, cultural, and moral significance of pain on the island of Yap (Waqab), Federated States of Micronesia, I argue in this article that one possible root to reincorporating empathy within the context of contemporary culture theory is to uncover the cultural and phenomenological ways that understandings of empathy and what constitutes authentic empathetic acts are shaped. After briefly examining foundational philosophical definitions of empathy, the article advances a number of differing cultural phenomenological orientations implicated in the experience and expression of empathy. These orientations are understood to help to foreground the place of empathy in what may otherwise be viewed as a general reluctance to engage in empathetic attunement in Yapese society.<br>

of the society outside of the mainstream. My work is neither removed nor distant —it starts out
as a search for something unknown and always seems to find a mirror. Even though it is diffi-
cult to divorce photography from the voyeurism implicit in it— it always seems a look through
a key hole— I prefer to think of it as a look through the back door into my own life. To make
the invisible visible —or to pretend to —is like carefully following an endless line of footprints,
prying into and recording a world that is unspeakably mine."<br>

Abstract: Across cultures, narrative emerges early in communicative development and is a fundamental means of making sense of experience. Narrative and self are inseparable in that narrative is simultaneously born out of experience and gives shape to experience. Narrative activity provides tellers with an opportunity to impose order on otherwise disconnected events, and to create continuity between past, present, and imagined worlds. Narrative also interfaces self and society, constituting a crucial resource for socializing emotions, attitudes, and identities, developing interpersonal relationships, and constituting membership in a community. Through various genres and modes; through discourse, grammar, lexicon, and prosody; and through the dynamics of collaborative authorship, narratives bring multiple, partial selves to life.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i211059<br>
Date: 11 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Verheggen Theo<br>
Abstract: By studying Durkheim through a Schopenhauerian lens, the one-sidedly cognitivist and functionalist reception of his social theory can be balanced. Durkheim explicitly rejected such monistic interpretations. His dialectical approach was always aimed at an essentially dualistic perception of man and society, wherein the lower pole, the individual, is central. In Durkheim's symbol theory, this position leads to two kinds of symbols: those that are bound to the human body, here called "this and that" symbols, and those people can choose freely, here called "this for that" symbols. This twofold symbol theory can already be found in medieval philosophy (e.g. Dante Alighieri) as well as in the work of Paul Ricoeur. For Durkheim the human person is the symbol par excellence. By implication the rituals in which the person is (re)constructed, that is the rites of passage, should be central. The interpretation here opens up new perspectives for a more psychological interpretation of Durkheim's sociology.<br>

Article Title: Revisiting the Notion of "Public" in Habermas's Theory-Toward a Theory of Politics of Public Credibility<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i211061<br>
Date: 7 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Ku Agnes S.<br>
Abstract: There exist around the notion of the public three different yet overlapping dichotomies posed on different levels of analysis: public (sphere) versus private (sphere), public versus mass, and publicness versus privacy/secrecy. Habermas's book ([1962]1989) incorporates all the three sets of dichotomy without resolving the contradictory meanings and bridging the gaps among them. As a result, his conception of the public sphere becomes paradoxical in terms, and it undertheorizes the cultural property of publicness. This article proposes an alternative conception of the public that may encompass the structural, institutional, and cultural levels of theorization in a more precise and coherent way. It is argued that the public is an imagined category about citizen membership that is attached to both institutions of state and civil society. In political practices, a symbolic "public" is institutionalized through an open communicative space where it is called upon, constructed, and contested as the central source of cultural references. In this connection, a notion of public credibility is introduced as an attempt to bring forth a richer and more dynamic conception about the role of culture in democratic struggles than that of critical rationality by Habermas.<br>

Abstract: The first part of the article discusses the usefulness of the biographical method in order to solve some epistemological crucial issues: the integration between comprehension and explanation, the possibility of an objective (or at least intersubjective) knowledge, the overcoming of the micro-macro dicothomy. The second part holds the utility of such a method in order to study the reflexive post-modern society and especially the contribution intellectuals can offer to the post-modern culture. Results from recent empirical research are discussed. The last part-though recognizing some methodological problems linked with life stories — stresses flexibility and openess as the main virtues of this method.<br>

Abstract: The article identifies a paradox in the concept of person and in its use. Modernity, and the liberation from the logic of status, should have brought about the ultimate consolidation of the idea of personal value. On the contrary it caused such a drastic functional differentiation within society that the individual has come to be defined by his/her function (citizen, economic actor, etc.) rather than as the single bearer of different roles. The concept of person has thus become an expression to identify only the communicative aspect of social life. That is the reason why in our complex society the concept of person cannot find a proper location and comes to the fore only when the other codes fail.<br>

Date: 3 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): CEREDA AMBROGIA<br>
Abstract: The article analyses the meaning of tattooing as a form of narration. Introducing the body as a text that can convey different forms of thought (derived both from philosophy and from sociology), the author maintains that the body modification is today as an open and living work whose interpretation has an influence on the individual identity and can be changed by means of the interaction with others. A thumbnail sketch of the history of the practice among traditional communities up to contemporary society is drawn to provide a series of fundamental usages for the inscription of the body. The concern here is to show tattooing as an expression of the whole individual (no longer divided into mind vs. body) and of his own perceived identity, underlying the relation of the chosen symbols (and of the symbolic ritual) with society, which remains the main source offering forms of representation and the main stage for the construction of identity. So that the whole final text can be read as the result of a process where the authorship is shattered among the society itself.<br>

Abstract: When analysing the concept of social relationship, the link between a person and an individual, who from a sociological perspective do not have the same semantic value, needs to be reconsidered as whole. As an individual is typically enclosed in a social dimension, it cannot have a self-referential character. Instead, it tends to half-reveal the authentic foundation of the civil society on the basis of a range of values which, after leading to the recognition of the self, activate relationships with the social other and the rest of the world including the transcendental one. In fact, within the opening relationship it's possible to find the conscience of own existence, to purchase the awareness of own identities and to become responsible of own world of life. Considering the aspects of sociological compromise and moral quality of the afore-going, it is clear that socio-cultural exchanges — where relationship skills come clearly into play — are the heuristic foundation of the complex relationship between individuals and society. Consequently, such exchanges become social dynamics through which affective similarities and legitimate differences interact to build an ethical balance for society as well as support a differentiated development of social bonds.<br>

Abstract: The article analyzes the theoretical reflection of religion throught Durkheim's production from the initial perspectives to The elementary forms of religious life. In his masterpiece particularly, Durkheim presents the most important factors founding a `religious society': the experience of the sacred, the emotional proprieties of rituals and the trascendental function of symbolism. The essay critically discusses, both in sociological and in philosophic terms, potentialities and limits of Durkheim's project.<br>

Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>
Issue: i23019993<br>

Author(s): Rothchild Jonathan<br>
Abstract: I argue that the aporetic character of clemency must be understood in terms of its unmerited and merited character to achieve the underlying purposes of justice within criminal justice: justice as fairness (punishment must be deserved and proportionate) and justice as restoration (repair of the harm to victims and society and the reintegration of offenders) are paramount goals. Rather than destabilizing political order, pardons can render productive potential tensions between justice as fairness and justice as restoration. Taking as my conceptual point of departure Paul Ricoeur's claims about the suprajuridical and supraethical character of pardon, I develop the argument through three central sections: an excursus into historical and contemporary practices of clemency in the United States; a critical analysis of the merited and unmerited aspects of clemency with respect to remorse and atonement theories within theological and legal discourse; and a normative engagement with pardons and felony disenfranchisement.<br>

Publisher: Department of Sociology, University of Kansas<br>
Issue: i23250013<br>
Date: 1 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Chriss James J.<br>
Abstract: Alvin Gouldner's life and work is considered within the framework of his own attempt to fashion a reflexive sociology during the second half of his career. In the first half, Gouldner was a functionalist and dutifully contributed insights and theoretical innovations to the paradigm, even while remaining critical of Talcott Parsons' own version of structural-functionalism. Later, by 1962, Gouldner broke from the dominant tradition to become an outspoken critique of establishment sociology, in the process becoming more sympathetic to competing theories, especially Marxism. Eventually, Marxism, too, was found to be inadequate because of its lack of reflexivity, and Gouldner became further alienated from both traditions of sociology. Concomitantly, Gouldner was battling on personal and professional fronts in his role of social critic. He became increasingly hostile toward others for their willing compliance with prevailing cultural prescriptions, which he believed were robbing human beings of their agency, vitality, and will to power. Lacking authentic knowledge of oneself, one could not hope to create social theories which benefited society and contributed to the liberation of the human spirit. Gouldner was a tragic hero, for although he came to an understanding of the limitations of human strivings in creating socially beneficial social theory, and fought valiantly to establish a program to fill this lacuna, he ultimately failed to deliver upon the promise of these insights because of his own hubris (on the personal front) and the internal paradoxes of reflexive sociology (on the professional front).<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

Abstract: Dans le sillage de la critique heideggérienne de Husserl, une telle carac-
térisation a été proposée, entre autres, par Friedrich-Wilhelm von Hermann dans
Hermeneutik und Reflexion (Francfort, Klostermann, 2000), qui oppose la phé-
noménologie heideggérienne — phénoménologie herméneutique ou phénoméno-
logie du Dasein — à la phénoménologie husserlienne — phénoménologie de la
conscience ou phénoménologie réflexive. Pour une mise à l'épreuve assez précoce
de cette image de la philosophie de Husserl, nous renvoyons à l'étude de Thomas
M. Seebohm, « Reflexion and Totality in the Philosophy of E. Husserl », Journal
of the British Society for Phenomenology, 1/1973, pp. 20-30, p. 26 en particulier.

Abstract: In the complex field of agricultural biotechnology, is there an approach that Christian ethicists can use to evaluate competing claims, multiple goods, and human rights issues in this important arena where humans and natures are intertwined? This paper is an attempt to apply Gibson Winter's three root metaphors (organic, mechanistic and artistic) as an ethical analysis that describes key socio-historical patterns in Western society and deciphers moral landscapes that undergird different forms of agricultural biotechnology. The paper also explores five key principles of the emerging "artistic" root metaphor that could guide more appropriate application and use of agricultural biotechnology.<br>

Abstract: What is the direction of South African theological ethics as that country moves out of the apartheid era into a new democratic future? Following its struggle against apartheid, how will theology respond to the new challenge of making clear its distinctive stance in a democratic, multi-faith society with a secular constitution? A danger, similar to that previously discussed in the United States, exists in South Africa as theology evolves from a mode of resistance to that of compliance and accommodation, especially under the guise of "nation-building." The essay plots a trajectory by means of a consideration of four works representing nonracial liberationist theology which emerged at key points in the past fifteen years—the Kairos Document (1985), and works by Albert Nolan (1988), Charles Villla-Vicencio (1992), and James Cochrane (1999). For all their contextual sensitivity and strength, these works appear to offer little of a distinctively theological nature, and little of Christian substance to church and society. The way lies open for the development of an African Christian ethics.<br>

Abstract: In this essay, I consider the rival liberal and communitarian accounts of justice emerging in complex, pluralist societies. I argue that we err in posing the question of human rights as a Hobson's choice between a formal, universal metanarrative, as envisioned in philosophical liberalism, or as a merely local, ethnocentric narrative of the western bourgeoisie, as in the communitarian critique. For human rights are best viewed rhetorically, as establishing the possibility of rationally persuasive argument across our varied narrative traditions. The essay concludes by attending to the role of religious belief in the public reason of a postmodern society.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of interpreting the concepts of tradition and traditionalism with specific reference to the tradition of the Anatolian house and the recent erosion of place quality in Turkish towns. The Anatolian house provides a remarkable example of cultural diffusion and transformation. During the reign of the late Ottoman, a variety of cultures impinged on one another, giving rise to autochthonous traditions that were shared by different religious and ethnic groups. But during the Republican Period the process of Westernization interrupted the continuity of historic traditions, resulting in the emergence of a peculiar contemporary tradition. The majority of Turkish housing today displays characteristics of a "vernacular modernism" conditioned by the moral and technical orders of a market economy. The worldwide spread of such cultural mediocrity has often been attributed to the corrosive influence of a single world civilization. A number of recent attempts have been made to search for a national idiom in Turkey. But these attempts, often promoting a "vernacular historicism," have yet to account for any distinct revision of urban house-form. Argument today revolves around an old rhetorical opposition between universal civilization and national culture. Should a post-traditional society sustain its cultural tradition to attain universal values, or vice-versa? The conservative in this debate is more involved in the revival than in the preservation of tradition. The progressive, though an ardent defender of preservation, resists revivalism because of its chauvinistic connotations and pastiche effects. This paper attempts to resolve this argument by suggesting a simultaneous unfolding of the historical problems of the Anatolian house tradition and the theoretical problems of presumed dichotomies such as "traditional vs. modern." Finally, the paper advocates the development of research strategies to facilitate correct readings of cultural tradition and~<br>

Abstract: Cette contribution s'intéresse à ce que peut signifier construire la paix dans des sociétés où des crimes de masse ont été commis. Elle souligne les difficultés spécifiques que posent ces situations au chercheur comme au praticien. Ils doivent s'efforcer d'une part de « comprendre » comment de tels massacres ont pu être commis, par-delà bon nombre d'idées reçues en la matière et, d'autre part, d'identifier les ressources à partir desquelles la paix pourra être construite dans la société considérée. Pour ce faire, il leur faudra plonger au cœur de situations hautement paradoxales, une aventure pour laquelle la première partie de l'article avance plusieurs propositions méthodologiques. This contribution is concerned with what it may mean to « construct » peace, in societies that have been subjected to mass crimes. It underlines the specific difficulties that researchers are confronted with in practical situations. On the one hand, they have to understand how such massacres could be committed beyond common beliefs on the subject; on the other, they have to identify resources from which peace may be built in the given society. In so doing, they have to delve deeply into highly paradoxical situations. Such is the adventure for which the first part of this article advances several methodological propositions.<br>

Abstract: This article critically revisits the Foucauldian perspective on modernity by exploring the constitutive importance of limits of transparency in relations of power and knowledge. It differentiates between Foucault's Panopticon as a model for modernity, which posits a total visibility of subject under modern gaze, and what I call cybernetic ways of knowing that posit the 'black box' of the inner self that is blocked from visibility. The case in point is a comparative study of two anthropologies — two groups of anthropological cadres — the American anthropologists who in the 1940s were involved in emerging Soviet studies, and Soviet anthropologists of the 1920s and 1930s who took part in Soviet reforms. The article draws attention to similarities in their perspective of images and notions of the enemy: the 'enemy of the people' within Soviet society and the Soviet society as the West's Cold War enemy. In doing so, the aim of this article is to develop an ethnographic perspective on state socialism that does not depend on a foundational dualist distinction between 'Soviet' and 'Western' or 'socialist' and 'capitalist' modernity as a starting point.<br>

Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23653923<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Taylor Betsy<br>
Abstract: The global justice movement reveals a diverse array of emergent publics striving politically for a sustainable world. Working partly from John Dewey, we try to illuminate democratic grounds for knowledge and action in these endeavors. We begin by situating Dewey's ideas in the politics of American history, especially historian John Diggins' countervailing approach to issues of authority, knowledge and opinion. Diggins, against Robert Westbrook and others, contends that Dewey's philosophy of politics chased radical democratic illusions, whereas he might have learned from Charles S. Peirce to uphold the boundary between professional communities and other entities including democratic publics. Dewey saw no democratic alternative to harness the political energy of ordinary people. We argue that Dewey had come to understand that a corporate state system of political economy had come to engulf both the liberal democratic polity and the professions. Dewey's political challenge to the professions and his illumination of the aesthetic ecology of democratic publics prefigure a democratic republican alternative that opens up a new basis for participation in the global justice movement confronting, among other obstacles, a transnational corporate state based in the USA. A Marxist-progressivist notion of the ongoing socialization of markets by corporate capitalism too often reinforces an anti-Populist intellectual sensibility that is coupled with, whether wittingly or not, either a social-democratic elitism or a revolutionary vanguardism. Globalization struggles need, on the contrary, a pragmatic vision of democratic publics instituting a true diversity of policies assuring a world-in-common. The fight for public spaces in the treacherous politics of civil society and global consumerism is a struggle against subjectivization. The fact that corporate state elitism, in the U.S. context, feeds on a rightist version of nationaism does not mean we can junk the history of democratic s~<br>

Abstract: Tolerance is a concept fundamental to the order of a pluralistic society. The concept, however, contains within it various dimensions and is therefore subject to misunderstanding (I). This article will first examine the ways in which tolerance as a social behavioural virtue differs from the duty of neutrality required of the public authorities (II). Furthermore, it will discuss whether and to what extend the public authorities are authorised to educate society in tolerance (III). Finally, a distinction will be drawn between the expectation of tolerance and the more far-reaching principle of recognition (IV).<br>

Author(s): Schmitz Heinz-Gerd<br>
Abstract: Discussing some aspects of Carl Schmitt's, Chantal Mouffe's, Paul Ricœur's, and Jacques Rancière's political theories the paper tries to determine the proper subject of political and social philosophy. To that end the author constructs two terminological oppositions: ‚the social‘ versus 'the society', 'the political' versus 'politics'. These four nouns form a terminological square which marks the social and the political difference. The social appears when underprivileged people demand a redistribution of wealth and influence, i.e. a reconstruction of a given society. The political emerges when the hidden normative framework of politics comes into vie. Confronting the social and the political difference in this way makes it possible to determine: politics are the matter of the political sciences, the difference between politics and the political, conversely, is the theme of political philosophy; society is the subject of sociology, the difference between the social and any form of society, however, is the issue of social philosophy.<br>

Abstract: The law is, on the one hand, always to some extent an expression of the dominant political power and ideology, while on the other hand it is relatively autonomous towards politics and other value-normative social phenomena, such as morality, customs, and religion. Despite the fact that from the deepest ontological perspective the separate existence of law and politics is an illusion, this separation must be acknowledged and maintained in our social life. The more autonomous the law, the more it develops its specific ideology. The latter can either serve as an appropriate counterbalance to the excessive tendencies of politics, or it can be abused for different political purposes. In the first case, we can speak about the constructive role of the law vs. politics, while in the second case its role is (self)destructive. In the first case different checks and balances between law and politics serve democratic society, while in the second case the differences between both phenomena are blurred, which leads to authoritarianism or totalitarianism.<br>

Publisher: Franz Steiner Verlag<br>
Issue: i23676311<br>
Date: 1 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Dédeyan Daniel<br>
Abstract: Departing from the disconcerting tact that the only passage where Kant mentions court practice is in a chapter on art, the essay undertakes a reconstruction of Kant's esthetics. As to beauty, the judgment of taste appears as a judgment on the ability to judge, and it is universally valid not because it is true, but because it is communicable. Kant's notion of art turns out to be the autonomous discourse of taste as his notion of morality stands for autonomy of man and his notion of law for autonomy of civil society. However, Kant's esthetical experience of the sublime as appearance of what neither mind nor senses grasp breaks up harmony and autonomy and unjudges judgment. At this point, the essay uncovers an intrinsically destabilizing force of Kant's ‚reason‘, traces the consequences for the judicial judgment and gives a perspective to philosophy of law within a differentiated society.<br>

Abstract: O filme Diamante de Sangue [Blood Diamond] de Edward Zwick oferece a possibilidade de uma reflexão à volta de três aspetos da noção de testemunho no âmbito da Filosofia da Religião: 1) a ideia de que o testemunho (absoluto), enquanto matriz das culturas humanas, sustenta a atividade jornalística e a sociedade da informação possibilitando não apenas a sua desconstrução como também a (re-)atualização de uma dimensão testemunhal do jornalismo; 2) as condições de possibilidade da conversão da consciência, isto é, da rutura com o estado de má-fé (auto-engano) necessária à consciência testemunhal e religiosa; 3) a indissociabilidade da experiência testemunhal e da doação, correlativas da experiência religiosa entendida como "fundação mútua" do divino e da testemunha (constituinte), experiência religiosa da qual surge o testemunho. Acrescentaremos ainda a ideia de que a experiência testemunhal ganha sentido à luz da metafísica do tempo do projeto. The film Blood Diamond from Edward Zwick offers the possibility of a reflection concerning three aspects of the concept of testimony within the Philosophy of Religion: 1) the idea that the testimony (absolute), while source of human cultures, supports the journalistic activity and gives information to the society; not only in its deconstruction but also in (re-)updating the testimonial dimension of journalism, 2) the conditions of possibility of the consciousness conversion, meaning, the rupture with the state of bad faith (self-deception) will required to the testimonial and religious consciousness, 3) the inseparability of the testimonial experience and donation, correlates in the religious experience, understood as “mutual foundation” of the divine and the witness (constituent), religious experience from which comes the testimony. We add further the idea that the testimonial experience makes sense in light of the metaphysics of time of project.<br>

Abstract: The city is a key location of the modern social world, a home of rootlessness and transient everyday encounters between individuals. This essay explores the idea of 'the sanctuary' as a way in which people look for anchorage, and create and re-create images of a society, to cope with and negotiate life in the city. It mainly draws on Durkheim's work on ritual, symbolism and the sacred, together with his account of individual and collective representations. But it also discusses these concerns though other writers, notably Freud and Ricœur, and it draws on Kant's theory of art to introduce how Durkheim sees ritual —especially sacred drama — as at once a symbolism and an aesthetics, complete with the energies of a free creative 'surplus'. Even if in the end 'the sanctuary' is unequal to the marketplace, it is a necessary refuge of the transformative social imagination and a realm, not of everyday economics, but of civitas.<br>

Abstract: Many contemporary liberals increasingly accept that plural societies must aspire to far more expansive and inclusive ideals of justice and citizenship than liberal doctrine would suggest. The dominant perception is that extending the set of rights is the most effective way to implement a just and stable multicultural society. In fact, this is not a very plausible description of what people seek in demanding greater respect for diversity. Nor does it offer a compelling vision of how things ought to be. First, social expectations regarding recognition are not uniquely linked to rights; they encompass intractable struggles over values, as well as ways of living and evaluating. For example, a central feature of feminist, black and multicultural politics is the attempt to change social culture into a medium through which personal integrity and self-esteem may be acquired. Second, liberalism cannot easily accommodate this type of struggle, since it takes for granted a narrowly constricted conception of politics that is based on instituting public laws that harmonize the freedom of everyone. Anyone who takes seriously the idea that recognition surpasses legal relations of respect will then surely wish to consider whether liberalism must not be corrected and extended to reveal the political significance of the social conditions that enable individuals to experience themselves as both autonomous and individuated.<br>

Abstract: The mobile and other new communication technologies such as the Internet are having unprecedented effects on society and culture worldwide. While some of the claims for these new communication technologies are wildly exaggerated, there is little doubt that they are changing our world significantly. This paper addresses some of the theoretical issues associated with the new communication technology and assesses their impact for the Philippines. Just as Durkheim and other early theorists responded to the changes resulting from the Industrial Revolution, one may expect a similar theoretical renewal to address contemporary transformations. The social sciences, in particular Sociology, will have to reconsider its basic paradigms to accommodate these transformations.<br>

scharfe politische und soziologische Kritiken an Fowlers Theorie machen auch darauf auf-
merksam, daß das sich entwickelnde Individuum in der Theorieperspektive Fowlers seinem
sozialen, lebensweltlichen Zusammenhang entnommen, enthoben scheint. Der Lebenswelt-
bezug scheint besonders für die höheren, post-konventionellen Stufen - auch der Oser-
schen Theorie - problematisch. Aber bereits für die unteren Stufen ist unverkennbar, daß
die religiösen Stile sich auch dem Bezug auf das jeweilige religiöse Milieu verdanken. Fow-
ler (1987) hat dies, wenn auch eher am Rande, notiert, wenn er von den Entwicklungsni-
veaus der Kirchengemeinden und von deren Einfluß auf die religiöse Entwicklung der Ein-
zelnen spricht.<br>

Abstract: Language and judicial activities are both signs of the existence of a society. There is, therefore, good reason for a dialogue between the science of language and the science of law. This article applies a linguistic theory of the Paris School (semiotics) to the examination of a legal text, namely a contract. The author points to some elements shared by legal and other texts, and demonstrates how a semiotic interpretation can provide interesting and unexpected insights into the deeper levels of a legal text. He concludes that a similar approach could fruitfully be used with other types of legal text.<br>

Abstract: The article deals with different procedures of taking to court and call to account the mass of perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide of 1994 and to doing justice to the few surviving victims and to international humanitarian law. The first section outlines the fundamental differences between vengeance and forgiveness on the one hand and redistributive and restorative justice on the other. The second section sketches the preconditions and the course of the genocide itself. Section three deals with the pitfalls and accomplishments of the International Criminal Court for Rwanda, section four with those of the Rwandan criminal courts in applying criminal law to mass violence. Section five presents and analyses the modernized Rwandan gacaca courts as a possible means to overcome the (partial) inadequacies of redistributive justice and to reconcile the Rwandan society. It is argued that although the gacaca courts do not work in a truly restorative manner and sometimes even counteract the idea of restoration, they still do bear the potential of democratizing and civilizing the war-torn and violence-ridden country of Rwanda. Section six finally discusses the restrictions, implications and limitations the Rwandan government was and is facing in choosing between redistributive and restorative approaches.<br>

Abstract: Finke, p. 41: "Mystics took disciplines designed to regulate and subject the body and turned
them into what Michael [sic] Foucault has called 'technologies of the self,' methods of
consolidating spiritual power and authority, perhaps the only ones avalaible to women. Foucault
argues that individuals often effect by their own means a certain number of operations on their
bodies, souls, thoughts, and conduct-all to transform themselves and to attain a certain state of
perfection, happiness, purity, and supernatural power. Although he is describing the medieval
Catholic discipline of confession, he might just as well be describing the lives of many medieval
mystics. Michel de Certeau takes Foucault's argument about technologies of the self even further,
and argues that these mechanisms, which he calls "poaching," enable those subjected to
disciplinary technologies to manipulate and evade them, or even shape them to their own ends, by
seeming to conform to them. To understand how self-torture could become a technology of the
self, a means of empowerment we must understand the place of torture in medieval society."<br>

Abstract: The article discusses the theoretical and methodological considerations as well as the practical application of two incarnations of the rhetorical turn in socio-cultural anthropology. Rhetorical turn is understood as a linguistie and constructivist turn, which marks a substantial part of contemporary thinking in the social sciences and humanities. Reflection about the relation between anthropology and rhetoric shows that the rhetorical turn is oriented on analyzing the rhetoric of anthropological texts, in their persuasive and figurative dimension. On the other hand, rhetorical turn refers to the research perspective in anthropology which is focused on the interpretation of society and culture in which an important role is played by the tools and concepts of rhetoric. Článek je věnován teoretickým a metodologickým úvahám, stejně jako praktické aplikaci dvou aspektů rétorického obratu v sociokulturní antropologii. Spojení „rétorický obrat” je zde použito pro lingvistický a konstruktivistický obrat, který významnou měrou poznamenal současný stav společenských a humanitních věd. Zaměříme-li se na vztah antropologie a rétoriky, zjistíme, že rétorický obrat s sebou přinesl úvahy o rétorice antropologických textů, o jejich přesvědčovacím a obrazném rozměru. Na druhé straně se rétorický obrat vztahuje k výzkumné perspektivě v antropologii, soustředěné na interpretaci společnosti a kultury, v níž hrají významnou roli nástroje a koncepty rétoriky.<br>

Abstract: The „petite éthique“ which Ricœur develops in Soi-même comme un autre is distinctive in its way of paying attention to the individual, the other and the society all at the same time. For this very reason the problem of the distribution of social goods is fundamental. Ricœur tries to solve this problem through a synthesis of teleological and deontological considerations, and here the approach of Rawls occupies a central place. On the one hand, the attempt to solve this problem in the framework of a teleological approach draws on principles of justice which Rawls establishes through formal procedure; on the other hand, Rawls‘ position depends on a number of teleological presuppositions which are not compatible with his deontological approach. Ricœur does not only attempt to refute Rawls, but to interpret his principles of justice as the result of a rationalisation of a sense of justice which is simply presupposed.<br>

Abstract: In ethics, when discussing problems of justice and a just social existence one question arises obviously: What is the normal case of the relation between I and you we start from? In moral philosophy, each position includes basic socio–anthropological convictions in that we understand the other, for example, primarily as competitor in the fight for essential resources or as a partner in communication. Thus, it is not the human being as isolated individual, or as specimen of the human species or socialised member of a historical society what needs to be understood. Instead, the individual in its relation to the other or others has been studied in phenomenology and the philosophy of dialogue of the twentieth century. In the following essay I focus on Martin Buber's and Jean–Paul Sartre's theories of intersubjectivity which I use in order to explore the meaning of recognition and disrespect for an individual. They offer a valuable contribution to questions of practical philosophy and the socio–philosophical diagnosis of our time.<br>

Abstract: Im Laufe der „nationalen Sattelzeit“ (Ute Planert) wurden Nationskonzepte zunehmend naturalisiert. Die Literaturgeschichte spielt dabei eine wesentliche Rolle. In drei Schritten verfolgt der Aufsatz den Transformationsprozess des nationalen Denkens im Kontext des sich wandelnden Naturbegriffs: Zum einen wird die nationale Wettkampfrhetorik im sog. deutsch-schweizerischen Literaturstreit skizziert, um demgegenüber die vormerklich funktionale Bedeutung des Nationalen und Nationalcharakteristischen in den Poetiken Gottscheds, Bodmers, Breitingers und Schlegels gewahr zu werden. Ein Blick auf die ‚Nationalidyllen‘ der aufgeklärten Hermannsdichtung zeigt, wie Natur und Nation trotz eines rationalen Naturbegriffs und in den Grenzen aufgeklärter Poetik als Einheit dargestellt wurden und so das Bildreservoir für spätere Generationen entstand. Die Wendung zu einem organologisch-dynamischen Naturdenken um die Mitte des 18. Jahrhunderts ermöglichte eine weit intensivere und scheinbar substantialisierte Verbindung von Natur und Nation, die sich schließlich auch in den Gärten und Parkanlagen der höfischen Gesellschaft niederzuschlagen begann. In the course of „nationale Sattelzeit“ (Ute Planert) concepts of nation were increasingly naturalized – a development in which the history of literature plays an important role. This essay traces the process of transformation of national thinking in the context of the changing concept of nature in three steps: Firstly, it sketches the national rhetoric of competition of the so-called German-Swiss controversy, in order to highlight the mainly functional meaning of the national and the nationally characteristic in the poetics of Gottsched, Bodmer, Breitinger and Schlegel. Secondly, a closer examination of the national idylls of enlighted Hermann literature shows how – despite a rational concept of nature and within the limits of enlighted poetics – nation and nature were depicted as a unity and created a common reservoir of images for later ~<br>

Abstract: Merleau-Ponty war die Geschichte dieses Theorems v. a. vermittelt durch die Schriften
Alains und Lagneaus gegenwärtig (s. Anm.15), auf die die Phänomenologie der Wahrnehmung
immer wieder anspielt. (Vgl. besonders die ausdrückliche Bezugnahme in § 11). Alain verweist
weiter auf Helmholtz' Handbuch der physiologischen Optik, die „die Konstanzannahme bestän-
dig stillschweigend voraussetzt und sich auf das Urteil nur beruft, um die in der physiologischen
Erklärung [der Wahrnehmung] verbliebenen Lücken auszufüllen" (Phänomenologie der Wahr-
nehmung, S. 54, Anm. 17). Die Konstanzannahme, die eine strikte physikalische Korrespondenz
zwischen externen Reizen und Empfindungen impliziert, verbindet sich im Rahmen einer duali-
stisch-intellektualistischen Theorie der Wahrnehmung mit einer psychologischen Theorie des
Urteilens, die erklären soll, wie aus (gemäß der Konstanzannahme rein hypothetisch vorauszuset-
zenden) Empfindungen Wahrnehmungen werden. Dementsprechend verbindet sich die Kritik der
Konstanzannahme (im Umfeld der Gestaltpsychologie) regelmäßig mit einer Zurückweisung des
Theorems vom unbewußten Schluß. Die innere Notwendigkeit dieses Zusammenhangs hat v. a.
Aron Gurwitsch begründet. So ζ. B. in dem 1933/4 im Institut d'Histoire des Sciences in Paris
gehaltenen Vortrag Die geschichtliche Entwicklung der Gestaltpsychologie, der in den von Mer-
leau-Ponty redigierten Artikel: Quelques aspects et quelques développements de la psychologie
de la forme. In: Journal de Psychologie 33 (Paris 1936) mündete (vgl. S. 414 ff). Zum Einfluß
Gurwitschs auf Merleau-Ponty in dieser Hinsicht vgl. auch James M. EdiE: Phenomenology in
the United States. In: Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology 5 (1973/74), S. 207. Ab-
gesehen von Gur witsch und den Gestaltpsychologen, die seit Köhler (1910) die Konstanzan-
nahme kritisieren, konnte Merleau-Ponty eine mit phänomenologischen Motiven sich verknüp-
fende Kritik mit ihr einhergehender Wahrnehmungstheorien freilich auch schon~<br>

Abstract: Cet article analyse les expériences de mobilité interne de femmes atteintes par le VIH résidant au moment des enquêtes ethnographiques dans la ville de Gondar, dans le nord-ouest de l'Éthiopie. Les expériences biographiques de cinq femmes séropositives, vivant dans des conditions de marginalité sociale et originaires de zones rurales, seront étudiées plus largement dans les principales configurations que la mobilité féminine interne prend en fonction de l'âge et de l'origine sociale des sujets migrants. L'article mettra au jour le caractère multiforme et la condition permanente d'instabilité de ces parcours migratoires. Initiés depuis un premier projet de départ, ils se sont poursuivis au fil des opportunités et des contraintes que les femmes migrantes ont rencontrées tout au long de leur parcours de migration dans une tension constante vers un avenir que les expériences biographiques cristallisent comme le temps du changement. Nous démontrerons que l'état de séropositivité au VIH, avec ses manifestations et ses conséquences, apparaît comme un facteur de conditionnement prééminent sans pour autant constituer une « rupture biographique ». Il participe au processus d'« assujettissement » d'individus se situant en marge de la société et des espaces d'action des pouvoirs établis. Plus particulièrement, l'analyse de la relation subjective de ces femmes aux normes et aux catégories du discours dominant présidant à la construction de leur « identité sociale virtuelle », mettra en exergue que le VIH représente à la fois une opportunité et une contrainte dans la détermination de leur relation subjective à l'avenir. This article analyses the experiences of internal mobility of HIV-positive women who at the moment of the ethnographic surveys lived in the city of Gondar, in North Western Ethiopia. The "biographical experiences" of five women who migrated from rural areas and used to live in conditions of social marginality will be placed in the context of a wider analysis of th~<br>

Abstract: Cet article interroge les modes de production et de reproduction des récits de migration. Les histoires seront traitées non seulement comme sources de recherche ethnographique et comme enquête journalistique, mais aussi comme des moyens spécifiques de comprendre et de façonner l'expérience de la migration. De cette façon, nous viserons moins à alimenter un débat méthodologique sur l'usage des matériaux biographiques dans une recherche qualitative, qu'à mettre en lumière les multiples effets de ce phénomène sur la société, en termes de création d'une demande d'histoires de migration et, par conséquence, d'un véritable « marché de mots » où les migrants, qui ont acquis une solide maîtrise narrative, peuvent troquer leurs récits de vie contre une reconnaissance sociale, du prestige ou même de l'argent. This article studies the ways migration narratives are being produced and reproduced. Such stories shall be treated not only as sources of the ethnographical research and journalistic enquiry, but also as specific ways of understanding and shaping the experience of migration. This way I intend—more than feeding the methodological debate of how to use the biographical materials in a research—to highlight the multiple effects of this phenomenon over society, in terms of creation of a market of migrational stories. In this market, migrants, acting as true narrative experts, can exchange their stories for social recognition, prestige, or even money.<br>

Abstract: Since their arrival in France in the early 1960s, former settlers of Algeria have developed an array of private and public "sites of memory" projects that have remained unnoticed in wider French society or have been interpreted uncharitably. This article offers a new perspective on these projects. Informed by Maurice Halbwachs' concern with the material supports for collective memory and Sigmund Freud's insights on loss, I reinterpret them as stages in a work of mourning, and offer new insights on the wider question of France's relationship to its colonial past.<br>

Abstract: In Colombia, society has come to be organized in terms of a division between those with and those without links to narcotrafficking. This moral boundary recently experienced a symbolic disturbance with the entrance on the country's cultural scene of Andrés López López, a former Colombian drug trafficker, and his El cartel de los sapos (2008). An examination of the discursive and political strategies employed in this book, in which drug trafficking is referred to through the metaphor "bacteria," allows us to understand the construction of a narrator who calls attention to the hypocrisy of the government and society regarding the reincorporation of narcotraffickers into civilian life while provoking a national debate on the difference between history and fiction. En Colombia, la sociedad ha llegado a organizarse en términos de una división entre aquellos que tienen y no vínculos con el narcotráfico. Este límite moral experimentó un reciente disturbio simbólico con la entrada de Andrés López López, un ex-narcotraficante colombiano, y su libro El cartel de los sapos (2008) en la escena cultural del país. Un análisis de las estrategias discursivas y políticas empleadas en este libro, en el que el tráfico de drogas se define a través de la metáfora de la "bacteria," nos permite entender la construcción de un narrador que devela la hipocresía gubernamental y social con respecto a la reincorporación de los narcotraficantes en la vida civil al mismo tiempo que provoca un debate nacional sobre la diferencia entre historia y ficción.<br>

Abstract: Indeed, another is that rather than growing on trees, such designs are trees. I
have in mind here Frits Staal's discussion of "trees" as designs within Vedic ritual;
see his Ritual and Mantras: Rules without Meaning (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass,
[1990] 1996, 105-8), and wish to imply that the epic's design has these ritual designs
as a familiar model. Although the discussion is of "embeddedness" (Staal, ibid.)
rather than specifically of "trees," the point is anticipated by Christopher Z. Min-
kowski, "Janamejaya's saltra and Ritual Structure," Journal of the American Orien-
tal Society 109,3 (1989): 401-20 and his "Snakes, sattras and the Mahäbhärata," in
Arvind Sharma, ed., Essays on the Mahäbhärata (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1991), 384-
400; by Michael Witzel, "JB paulpulanl: The Structure of a Brähmana Tale," in M.
D. Balasubrahmaniam, ed., Dr. B.R. Sharma Felicitation Volume (Tirupati: Ken-
driya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, 1986), 189-216; and, with acknowledgment to both
them and Staal, in Hiltebeitel, Rethinking, 93-94 and nn. 9 and 10.<br>

Abstract: See for example the following remark by R. C. Kwant: 'Foucault doubts
whether the 'ordre du discours' established and thrust upon us by our society is
the true one, the really décisive one. His thesis is that there is a more essential,
more determing 'ordre du discours' which détermines our speaking, and so our
knowing, without our being conscious of it.' (Structuralisten en Structuralisme

Abstract: 'The seminal neo-Calvinist insight at stake here is that the authority of the state is
"universal" yet not "exhaustive" or "omnicompetent".... We might say that the scope of the
state's competence is extensive — it in principle can touch any area of society — but not
intensive — it may not compromise the irreducible, non-transferrable authority of a social
institution arising from its "sphere sovereignty".' (Chaplin 2004, 6)<br>

Abstract: The main aim of this article is to offer a critical reflection on the need of rethinking the teachers' professional skills and their academic pathway, given the changes and current transformations (crisis, in its etymological sense). In fact, a series of changes, transformations, are identified and affect directly the educator's comprehension. Amongst others: the transformation of work bound up with the processes of the economic globalization, and the transformation of the learning environments imbued by the TICs; the population growth, a demographic transformation with geopolitics relevance, and finally, as a result from the previous ones, the raise in the migratory flows. Under this context, this paper tries to reconceptualize teachers' training and their depiction as professionals from the view of Gustav Mahler in his statement Tradition is the spreading of fire and not the veneration of ashes. Thereupon, some categories that help in the teaching update, are proposed and explained; such as authority (as reputation or moral authority, role model and, hence, less so as bare exercise of power), the personalization of education, the importance of home community (society), and, lastly, the alternation within school-society and work-study. El objetivo de este trabajo es ofrecer una reflexión acerca de la necesidad de re-pensar la profesionalidad de los docentes y de su itinerario formativo, a la luz los cambios y transformaciones actuales (crisis, en sentido etimológico). En efecto, se identifican una serie de cambios, de transformaciones, que afectan directamente a la comprensión del docente, del enseñante. Entre otros: la transformación del trabajo vinculada a los procesos de la globalización económica y la transformación de los entornos de aprendizaje imbuidos en las TICs; el aumento de la población, la transformación demográfica con trascendencia geopolítica; y por último, y como confluencia de las dos anteriores, el aumento de los flujos migratorios.

Abstract: Auch wenn vielerorts von der Vernachlässigung der Kirchengeschichte im Religionsunterricht gesprochen und ein mangelndes Geschichtsbewusstsein beklagt wird, sind Schülerinnen und Schüler durchaus für Geschichte und auch Kirchengeschichte ansprechbar. Die Herausforderung besteht heute jedoch darin, sie dazu zu befähigen, mit dem Wissen über Geschichte umzugehen, ihr Leben mit Geschichte sinnbringend und verantwortungsvoll zu gestalten. Gerade hierfür stellt die jüdisch-christliche Tradition wertvolle Ressourcen bereit. Ausgehend von der jüdisch-christlichen Tradition und im Diskurs mit der Geschichtsphilosophie möchte ich dazu anregen, mit Schülerinnen und Schülern im Religionsunterricht eine Form des Eingedenkens in der Perspektive der Hoffung zu entwickeln. Hierbei wird eine Gedächtnishaltung intendiert, die nicht in der Idee einer reinen Fortschrittsgeschichte aufgeht, sondern zurückblickt, sich den Tiefen und Ambivalenzen vergangenen Leids stellt und die Toten in die Vision einer besseren Gesellschaft einbezieht. Dabei bleibt das Gedächtnis stets dem Leben und der Zukunft zugewandt und gibt ethische Impulse für die Gegenwart. Gerade im Religionsunterricht können Schülerinnen und Schüler befähigt werden, zu „Redenden und Handelnden“ der Geschichte zu werden, auch indem der Frage Raum gegeben wird, woraus Kraft für Erinnerungsarbeit geschöpft werden kann und welche Hoffnungsperspektiven bestehen. Even if neglect of Church History in Religious Education is widely criticised and complaints are heard about a lack of historical consciousness, pupils -female and male – are often found to be quite open to history and church history. The challenge today consists in helping them to deal with their knowledge of history, to create a relationship, or life, with history in a way that makes sense and is actually responsible. For this purpose the Jewish-Christian tradition offers valuable resources. Based on the Jewish-Christian tradition, and in discourse with the philosophy of~<br>

Abstract: En este ensayo el autor propone una narrativa para su trayectoria intelectual, que cubre medio siglo de reflexión e investigación en ciencias humanas. Lo hace desde una perspectiva interpretativa, historicista y comunitaria. Entiende el impulso inicial y la evolución ulterior como respuestas (con su mezcla de compromiso y de distancia) a una serie de retos y conversaciones en diferentes comunidades de debate, situadas en diversos marcos históricos (España, Francia, Estados Unidos). Sugiere un argumento y un rumbo, en torno a la tensión entre una teoría de la sociedad civil entendida en sentido amplio y los límites del horizonte (y la huida hacia adelante) de la modernidad avanzada. In this essay the author provides a narrative of his intellectual journey, covering half a century of reflection and research in the human sciences. He does so from an interpretive, historicist and communitarian perspective. He sees his initial intellectual interests and later evolution as responses (with their mix of committment and distace) to a series of challenges and conversations in different communities of debate and situated in different historical frameworks (primarily Spain, France and the United States). He suggests an argument and a path for addressing the tension between a theory of civil society understood in a broad sense and the limits on the horizon (and the flight forward) of advanced modernity.<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de François Laplanche prend délibérément pour objet la longue durée : l'exégèse biblique entretient un rapport constant au Texte originel et l'historien ne peut s'exonérer de connaître les interprétations patristiques et médiévales de la Bible. L'histoire d'une pratique de lecture savante est ici réintégrée à l'intérieur de l'ensemble de la culture, de la société et des événements d'une période donnée. Prenant pour centre d'analyse les théologiens calvinistes de Saumur vers 1620-1670, François Laplanche montre que, tandis que leur système demeure arrimé à l'orthodoxie réformée, ils la minent et conduisent à une désacralisation de l'Écriture par un double éloignement : éloignement de l'origine puisque la disqualification de l'Ancien Testament le transforme en objet d'histoire; éloignement de la fin des temps par la récusation catégorique du prophétisme et du millénarisme. The work of François Laplanche deliberately deals with long duration: biblical exegesis maintains a constant relationship to the original Text and the historian cannot exempt himself from knowing the patristic and medieval interpretations of the Bible. The history of scholarly reading is here reinstated within the culture, society and events of a given period. Taking as the center of his analysis the Calvinist theologians of Saumur around 1620-1670, François Laplanche shows that, while their system remains linked to reformed orthodoxy, they are undermining it and go towards a desecration of Scripture via a double remoteness: remoteness from the origin since the disqualification of the Old Testament transforms it into an historical object; remoteness from the end of time via the adamant disqualification of prophecy and millenarianism. La obra de François Laplanche toma deliberadamente como objeto la larga duración: la exégesis bíblica establece una relación constante con el Texto original y el historiador no puede eximirse de conocer las interpretaciones patrísticas y medievales de la Biblia.~<br>

Abstract: This article presents the results of empirical research regarding Siberian regional identity with a particular focus on regional identity formation and transformation. Based on biographical interviews with residents of three Siberian cities, it analyzes the processes of regional identity formation in a "resettlement" society and identity (re)construction under conditions of social crisis. In order to capture the individual dimension of such (trans)formation in a resettlement society the authors introduce and use a methodology combining the so-called "actionist" version of the social constructionist approach to identity studies and narrative analysis. The final section of this article offers a detailed analysis of the life stories of three Soviet-generation women, demonstrating different scenarios of regional identity transformation on the level of the individual. The results suggest that the effect of dramatic social change on personal identity depends upon the core identity of an individual. Those whose identity was rooted in the Soviet privileging of Siberian economic development face the hardest challenge. Those who have multiculturalism or such values as work or family at the core of their identities handle the crisis more easily, and the consequences of social transformation for their identities are less severe.<br>

Abstract: Societies, like individuals, strive to have positive self-concepts. They endow stories of their origin and associate their course through history with ethical principles that attest to who they are and how they want to be seen. Such principles define the society for its members and for the world at large. But all societies must at some time confront evidence of actions undertaken in their name that violate their fundamental principles and conflict with their desired self-image. Following a glance at the basic elements of the politics of history and identity, the author suggests two sources of the tensions between "bad acts" and positive self-concepts. Both relate to shifts in developmental time. First, actions not considered wrong when they were undertaken in the past are inconsistent with current expectation. Second, transsocietal differences in normative frameworks lead to cross-boundary criticisms of behavior in which the critics' societies likely engaged at an earlier time. Accusations or criticisms generally meet with defensive, often hostile responses. Hypocrisy tends to rule in most cases, with little or no normative learning.<br>

Abstract: De nombreux textes, à commencer par l'étude de Max Weber, ont déjà défriché le champ d'une sociologie de la musique et précisé à quels objets elle pouvait s'intéresser et comment elle pouvait les aborder. Le domaine, et l'appellation même, des musiques " populaires " demeurent toutefois problématiques. L'enseignement tiré de travaux des historiens de la culture conduit à les envisager comme " musiques de masse ". Pour les étudier, la sociologie peut les considérer comme un " fait sociomusical total " et y rechercher des représentations sociales, à la fois déchiffrement de la société par ses membres et moyens d'action sur elle. Une analyse tripartite modifiée, s'inspirant de la méthode proposée par Jean Molino et Jean-Jacques Nattiez et tenant compte des leçons de l'ethnomusicologie, peut fournir un cadre d'analyse général à partir duquel un très grand nombre de domaines s'ouvrent à l'exploration du chercheur qui y découvrira des mélanges infinis et, refusant de juger esthétiquement, s'attachera plutôt à expliquer le jugement esthétique des acteurs de ce " phénomène social total ". /// Several writings, starting with Max Weber's, have done pioneering work in the sociology of music. They have formulated the subjects to be studied and suggested how they can be approached. Many problems, however, remain. The lessons drawn from studies by cultural historians lead us to see it as " mass music ", which sociology can take to be a " total sociomusical fact ". The search can then be undertaken for the underlying " social representations ", which are both an interpretation of society by its members and a means of action on society. Modeled on the method proposed by Jean Molino and Jean-Jacques Nattiez, a modified threefold analysis taking into account the teachings of ethnomusicology, can help devise a general analytical framework that opens a large number of fields where sociologists will discover infinite mixtures. Refusing to make aesthetic judgements, they will seek to exp~<br>

Article Title: In Search of a Postcolonial Theory of Normative Integration: Reflections on A.C. Cairns' Theory of "Citizens Plus"<br>

Abstract: The focus of this article is the theory of integration advanced by Alan Cairns in his book, "Citizens Plus: Aboriginal peoples and the Canadian State". Cairns' theory has had a mixed reception since its publication. Like much scholarship and public policy in the Aboriginal rights field, "Citizens Plus" has attracted strong proponents and opponents. At present "Citizens Plus" remains one of the primary competitors vying for influence in guiding the postcolonial reconfiguration of the relationship between Aboriginal peoples, the Canadian state and civil society on terms of justice that may be perceived as legitimate by both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples. The prime alternative, as conceived by both Cairns and his critics, is the nation-to-nation constitutional vision of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. The author provides a political theoretical reading of "Citizens Plus". She seeks to disclose the normative and conceptual structure of Cairns' argument and to situate Cairns' theory in the context of debates concerning the future of Aboriginal peoples and the constitution of Canada. This reading foregrounds an alternative interpretation of the relationship between "Citizens Plus" and the constitutional vision of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, which makes it possible to see them as complementary rather than opposed constitutional visions. The author also raises broader questions concerning the reasons for continuing the search, at the heart of Cairns' work, for a post-colonial theory and praxis of normative integration in diverse societies, and the conditions of the possibility of such a theory and praxis. Ultimately the author argues that whether one agrees or disagrees with Cairns' prescription, at a minimum "Citizens Plus" should be understood as raising a fundamental question to which multinational constitutional theory must respond. /// Le présent article a pour objet d'examiner la théorie avancée par Alan Cairns dans son ouvrage, "Ci~<br>

Abstract: Oneness refers to the convention of recognizing a single individual's performance and ignoring others, including those who may have performed as well. Although oneness is an adaptation to cognitive deficits, it cannot be explained by them. If long-term and working memory were more capacious, society's need for ideals to establish realm-specific standards and meanings would tend to limit recognition and renown to one individual. The apotheosis of Rosa Parks is a case in point. Her celebrity and the obscurity of others who risked and accomplished more than she are two aspects of the same social process. Revealing oneness to be a social imperative, this case study leads to a broader understanding of collective forgetting.<br>

Abstract: El ensayo explora la dimensión cultural de la experiencia misionera de los jesuitas en China durante la primera edad moderna y analiza en particular la relación entre evangelización y escritura. Es a nivel de la cultural civility que el misionero jesuita logra identificarse con el "hombre de letras" chino. Es a nivel de la bibliofilia, del coleccionismo, de la exégesis y del bricolaje como jesuitas italianos y literatos chinos podrán entrar en diálogo. Los primeros, adoptando la definición de "letrados europeos", resaltan la intrínseca afinidad con los otros, los wenren 文人. Los libros representan el aspecto más significativo del encuentro entre estos dos grupos humanos. Interactuando con la élite política e intelectual china, los jesuitas intentaron poner en práctica un programa educativo basado en el modelo de los collegia de la Compañía en Europa. El proyecto nunca fue puesto en marcha, pero mediante la producción de libros para y sobre China, los jesuitas contribuyeron a insertarla en un proyecto universal de circulación de saberes. /// This essay explores the cultural dimension of the Jesuit missionary experience in China during the early modern period while focusing on the particular relationship between evangelization and writing.

Abstract: Este artículo es un análisis de la novela Una casa vacía (1996) del escritor chileno Carlos Cerda, basado en la identificación de elementos de imaginería gótica en distintos niveles de la obra. Se estudia el funcionamiento de estos elementos dentro del macro esencialmente realista de la obra, para intentar establecer los límites cruzados entre el testimonio, la historia oficial y sus metaforizaciones. La alegoría final que la obra novelesca construye en relación con la antigua casa de tortura y sus habitantes, se corresponde con el período final de la Dictadura Militar (1973-1989) y las prácticas de tortura realizadas por organismos de gobierno contra civiles. Sin embargo, también se trata de mostrar la dificultad del realismo testimonial para escribir una novela sobre la degradación y el sufrimiento de la sociedad chilena del período, sin caer en una ideología maniquea de la narración. This article is an analysis of Una casa vacía (1996), a novel written by the Chilean author Carlos Cerda. This analysis is based upon the identification of elements of the Gothic imaginery at different levels of this narrative. The functioning of these elements is studied within the basically realistic frame of the novel, in order to establish the permeable boundaries between testimonial narrative, the official history and its metaphorizations. The ultimate allegory that the novel builds around a former torture house and its inhabitants finds its correspondence with the final period of the Military Dictatorship (1973-1989) and the torture practices carried by Government Organizations against civilians. Nevertheless, this article tries to show the difficulty of testimonial realism in order to write a novel about the suffering and decadence of the Chilean society of the period, without succumbing to a Manichean concept of the narrative function.<br>

Author(s): Nielsen Richard P.<br>
Abstract: In this updated and revised version of his 2008 Society for Business Ethics presidential address, Richard Nielsen documents the characteristics and extent of the 2007–2009 economic crisis and analyzes how the ethics issues of the economic crisis are structurally related to a relatively new form of capitalism, high-leverage finance capitalism. Four types of high-leverage finance capitalism are considered: hedge funds; private equity-leveraged buyouts; high-leverage, subprime mortgage banking; and high-leverage banking. The structurally related problems with the four types of high-leverage finance capitalism converged in something of a perfect economic storm. Explanations for the crisis are offered in the context of the type of the high-leverage finance capitalism system that permitted and facilitated the economic crisis. Ethics issues and potential reforms are considered that may be able to mitigate the destructive effects of what Schumpeter referred to as the "creative destructive" effects of evolutionary forms of capitalism while realizing the Aristotelian economic ideal of creating wealth in such a way as to make us better people and the world a better place.<br>

Abstract: Historians today frequently feel torn between the requirements of basic research (which implies scientific method and independent scholarship) and the demands of a society asking for relevance and readability. Two trends have developed within the craft since the nineteenth century: one, positivist and professional, oriented towards the sole production and transmission of knowledge; the other trying to broaden the historian's aims and to make history socially useful (hence the introduction of the notion of "applied history"). After analysing the assets as well as the perils of both approaches, the article argues that are conciliation between them appears possible provided a number of methodological requisites are met. Modern historians should not be afraid of new functions and new tasks in society.<br>

Publisher: Butterworth Publishers<br>
Issue: i324420<br>
Date: 9 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): George Jim<br>
Abstract: Recent debates in International Relations have seen some of the characteristic dichotomies of the discipline under severe and sophisticated challenge. The proposition, for example, that the study of International Relations, is somehow "independent" of mainstream debates on theory and practice in the social sciences is now widely rejected. The disciplines change in attitude on this issue owes much, in the 1980s, to the influences of an as yet small group of scholars who have infused the "third debate" in International Relations with an appreciation for previously "alien" approaches to knowledge and society, drawn from interdisciplinary sources, which repudiate (meta) theoretical dualism in all its forms. Utilizing the sponge term "postpositivism" Yosef Lapid has concentrated on an important aspect of the "third debate," one which has seen positivist based perspectives repudiated in favor of critical perspectives derived, primarily, from debates on the philosophy of science. This paper takes a broader view of the "third debate" in focusing on some of the broader patterns of dissent in social theory that are now evident in its literature. It argues that for all the differences associated with the new critical social theory approaches, theirs is critique with common purpose. Its purpose: to help us understand more about contemporary global life by opening up for questioning dimensions of inquiry which have been previously closed off and supressed; by listening closely to voices previously unheard; by examining "realities" excluded from consideration under a traditional (realist) regime of unity and singularity. Its purpose, reiterated: the search for "thinking space" within an International Relations discipline produced by and articulated through Western modernist discourse.<br>

Abstract: Frank, Underdevelopment of Revolution, p. xii. Frank writes: "Dialectically integrated society and economy which today obliges the bourgeoisie—including its most nationalist sectors—to pursue policies which, however much development they may generate for the minority, condemn the majority of Latin Americans to ever-deeper underdevelopment, and the bourgeoisie itself to increasing dependence on and absorption into the metropolitan bourgeoisie of the neo-imperialist system." In his more recent work, Frank attempts to understand economic systems from a global rather than Eurocentric perspective, and argues that the modern rise of Europe may be seen as a mere blip on a world economic landscape dominated by Asia. See hisReOrient: Global Economy in an Asian Age (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998andFrank and B.K. Gills, eds. The World System: Five Hundred Years or Five Thousand? (London and New York: Routledge, 1993).). Interestingly, Frank also argues that his world systems theory has not taken adequate account of questions of "ecology and cosmology," and thus are perhaps too "humanocentric" as some critics claim (ReOrient, xxvi).<br>

Abstract: Twelve years after the genocide, nothing has been forgotten in Rwanda. The country resembles a multiplicity of experiences, words and silences. The aim of the article is to reflect on the representations – or absence of representations – of the past. The approach is based on the ambivalence of any reference to the past. It is not a question of making a judgement in the abstract about the more or less legitimate character of the attitudes observed, but to understand the dynamics at work. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first part recalls the specific aspects of the case under study. The second examines the silences that weigh upon Rwandan society. The third notes the main accounts of the past.<br>

Abstract: Si le débat qu'a suscité l'esthétique de la réception au sein des disciplines littéraires, s'est cantonné, à de rares exceptions près, au domaine des concepts et des esquisses théoriques, la nouvelle histoire sociale de la lecture a entrepris de rendre raison des variations des appropriations d'un même texte ou d'un même ensemble de textes d'un pôle à l'autre de l'espace social, d'une époque à une autre ou encore d'une société à l'autre. Quant aux résultats des enquêtes accumulées depuis le début des années soixante-dix, l'hypothèse d'une triple homologie entre division du travail – entre «monde des choses matérielles» et «monde des choses humaines» – division scolaire – entre filières scientifiques et filières littéraires – et division entre les sexes, permet de rendre compte des exceptions apparentes à la relation très étroite qui unit les pratiques de lecture et le capital culturel détenu. While the debate generated within literary disciplines concerning the aesthetics of reception has, with few exceptions, been confined to domain of concepts and theoretical outlines, the new social history of reading has attempted to account for the varied ways in which a single text or even a group of texts is appropriated from one end of society to the other of society, from one historical period to another or from one society to the next. As for the results of surveys accumulated since the early 1970s, the hypothesis of a threefold equivalence of the division of labour – between a "world of material things" and a "world of human things" – the academic division between scientific and literary paths – and division of the sexes, accounts for the apparent exceptions to the very close relationship linking reading practices and the possession of cultural assets.<br>

Abstract: The search for better, not wholly instrumental, readings of reason has recently become
more popular, even among analytical theorists, for example Jon Elster. See, amongst many
other works, Jon Elster, The Cement of Society (Cambridge, 1984). Onora O'Neill is
perhaps the philosopher who has done most to explore these issues. See O. O'Neill,
Constructions of Reason: Explorations in Kantian Practical Philosophy (Cambridge,
1989).<br>

Abstract: According to Philip Rieff, Freud affirms the distance of the individual from the com-
munity, and in this sense psychoanalysis agrees with liberalism. The Freudian individual is
aloof from politics and learns not to seek radical changes in society, avers Rieff. That individ-
ual adapts to society in a calculated way which suits his or her needs: 'a rationally alienated
person learns how to guard against social over-investments, and how to make them when
necessary' (Philip Rieff, Freud: The Mind of a Moralist (Garden City, NY, 1961), p. 278).
Freud, then, teaches that the individual's attachment to society should be dependent on a
rational, economic exercise—on the conscious distribution of instinctual energy. Moreover,
once psychoanalytic therapy becomes a way of life, it contributes to detachment from others
by enhancing self-absorption. 'While enjoining a person to be less severe with himself,
observes Rieff, 'Freudian analysis may also develop in the patient new qualities of self-
suspicion... The therapy manufactures a new sort of conscience, one which demands a more
accurate and yet more scrupulous self-centeredness' (ibid., pp. 106-7).<br>

Abstract: This expression constitutes a catch-phrase often used by contemporary authors. One
example is found in Shûmon no ishin 宗門之維新(The Restoration of Our Denomination,1897)
by Tanaka Chigaku 田中智学（1861-1939)，the founder of Nichirenism. Tanaka uses it in a
context where he justifies the role of the Nichiren tradition as a solution to avoid the disinte-
gration of Japanese society (Yoshida 1965，p. 181). On this figure, see Chapter 8 in Jaffe 2001.<br>

Abstract: Edward X. Gu charts the changing and complex relationship existing between intellectuals and party/state in China during the "culture fever" era of 1979 to 1989. He draws on theoretical insights from the "new institutionalism" literature to problematize the "civil society" approach and to interrogate earlier scholarship emphasizing the anti-establishment character of intellectuals. His detailed investigation of three intellectual groups reveals that intellectuals attained some measure of autonomy and independence but only by developing collaborative and cooperative relations with the party-state. Thus, the author defines the boundaries of the "cultural public space" that emerged in Deng's China.<br>

Abstract: This essay reconceptualizes President Theodore Roosevelt's "anti-trust" image within a "pro-business" framework. Critics who have measured Roosevelt's success by the number of anti-trust suits he brought or won miss the essentially rhetorical purposes of his involvement with corporate America. Specifically, this essay contends that his primary emphasis involved the promotion of the proper attitude in corporate leaders and the general public regarding the role of big business in American society. This Roosevelt did in two ways. First, he argued metaphorically for the necessity of corporations and the restraint of muckraking journalists. Second, along with employing metaphors to chastise big business, Roosevelt assumed the role of moral guardian and preached to corporate leaders to adhere to an ethical standard in business. For Roosevelt, corporate America could be effectively regulated only by its leaders' sense of morality and spirit of public service.<br>

Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i27643230<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Doja Albert<br>
Abstract: The system of beliefs and practices related to Bektashism seems to have corresponded to a kind of liberation theology, whereas the structure of Bektashi groups corresponded more or less to the type of religious organization conventionally known as charismatic groups. It becomes understandable therefore that their spiritual tendency could at times connect with and meet social, cultural and national perspectives. In turn, when members of the previously persecuted religious minority will acquire a degree of religious and political respectability within society at large, the doctrines of heterodoxy and liberation theology fade into the background. In the end, the heirs of the heterodox promoters of spiritual reform and social movement turn into followers and faithful defenders of a legitimate authority. They become the spokespeople for an institutionalized orthodoxy whose support is sought by the political regime.<br>

Abstract: Este ensaio pretende estabelecer correlações entre Literatura, História e História da Literatura do ângulo da Estética Expectacional. Essa posição desloca o tradicional enfoque da literatura da perspectiva da produção para a da recepção, extraindo da obra literária uma abundância de sentimentos em harmonia com as expectativas de cada período, de cada grupo social, de cada nível cultural, tornando-a, assim, uma estrutura móvel, capaz de valer em diferentes contextos e de dar respostas diversas, conforme a demanda de verdade estética. Com isto, a História da Literatura tem condições de incorporar a marcha das ondas inovadoras no percurso da prática textual em dada sociedade, assim como reter, para cada época, as qualificações do horizonte de expectativa, que tornam instantâneas todas as épocas pregressas do fazer literário. /// This essay tries to establish correlations between Literature, History and History of Literature as viewed by Expectational aesthetics. Such a view shifts the traditional approach of literature from production to reception, extracting from the literary work a profusion of feelings in harmony with the prospect of each period, of each social group, of each cultural level. This makes it a movable structure capable of functioning in different contexts and of providing several answers, according to the demand of aesthetic truth. Thanks to this, the History of Literature is capable of incorporating the shifts of innovative waves in the trend to textual practice in a certain society, as well as retain, for each age, the qualifications of the horizon of expectation. This turns all the previous ages of literary making momentary.<br>

Publisher: El Colegio de México<br>
Issue: i27738655<br>
Date: 9 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Duque Sonia<br>
Abstract: La autora se interroga acerca del significado de la expresión construir la paz en situaciones posteriores a la comisión de crímenes masivos. Subraya las dificultades específicas que plantea este tipo de circunstancias tanto a los analistas como a los profesionales que participan del proceso, y hace una serie de propuestas metodológicas que atañen al impacto de los crímenes masivos sobre la reconstrucción de las relaciones sociales y políticas en sociedades desgarradas por la guerra. Además, pone énfasis en la importancia de una mejor comprensión de estos procesos, con el fin de destacar los programas de asistencia más eficaces, ya que aquéllos surgen en situaciones sociopolíticas particulares. Al intentar una aproximación a este delicado tema, analistas y profesionales enfrentan dos retos. Primero, deben entender cómo pudo haberse llevado a cabo el crimen masivo. Segundo, deben identificar las posibilidades de paz existentes dentro de la sociedad afectada. Indudablemente, para que las reglas del juego social y político funcionen o, en otras palabras, para que todos los actores se interesen en unirse al juego colectivo, tales posibilidades no pueden ser ignoradas. La construcción de la paz debe incluir métodos locales que, en la mayoría de los casos, se han ido construyendo con el tiempo y han adoptado diferentes métodos provenientes de otras latitudes. /// The author questions the meaning of the expression "peace-building" in circumstances following the perpetration of massive crimes. She stresses the specific difficulties raised by these kind of situations to both analysts and professionals involved in the process, and puts forward a series of methodological proposals concerning the impact of massive crimes on social and political relations' reconstruction within societies torn by war. Also, the author underlines the relevance of having a better understanding of these processes in order to identify which assistance programs may be more effective, as those processes~<br>

Abstract: Desde este punto de vista, los ajustes estratégicos de los actores y de los partidos políti-
cos de la izquierda son particularmente notables, como lo mostró en su estudio Kenneth Ro-
berts, "From the Barricades to the Ballot Box: Redemocratization and Political Realigment in
the Chilean Left", Politics &amp; Society, vol. 23, núm. 4, 1995, pp. 495-519. En un estudio compa-
rado dedicado a Chile y España, Patricia Hipsher muestra que el abandono de las estrategias
de movilización contra la dictadura, es decir de las estrategias frontales, no sólo se da en Chi-
le sino también en España, Uruguay, Polonia y Rusia. En todos estos países, a una fase de mo-
vilizaciones intensas sucede una fase de desmovilización correspondiente al momento
"transicional". Los procesos de democratización pueden, en este sentido, ser interpretados
también como procesos de aprendizaje de la moderación y de dique ante la violencia política.

Abstract: The author positions himself in social anthropology's logical crisis stemming from the radical relativism caused by its field acquisitions. He questions the operativeness of such concepts as "logos" and "strategy" for the current socioanthropological theory. Consequently, for the study of society he suggests recovering the "alea" logical role as opposed to that of teleologically oriented strategy. Finally he finds it apposite to recover the notion of concreteness as a figure capable of illuminating certainties, for which he emphasizes the possibility of reorienting this discipline towards "graphos". Nevertheless, he shuns anthropological poetics, which he considers the postmoderns' escape.<br>

Author(s): Wolseley Ronald N.<br>
Abstract: Narrative methods are used to analyze the cultural dynamics of civil society through a comparison of African-American and "main-stream" newspaper coverage of the Rodney King crisis in Los Angeles. The newspapers' different narrative constructions affected the selection and interpretation of significant crisis events, shaped social expectations about how the crisis would be resolved, and constrained the range of symbolic strategies available to local political elites. Through and application of narrative methods, this case demonstrates how the analysis of plot, character, and genre can help explain the interplay between the analytic and concrete forms of culture and the dynamics of social problems and social change more broadly.<br>

Abstract: En este artículo se abordan algunas de las cuestiones metodológicas que plantea el análisis de la violencia de los hombres contra las mujeres en la historia, como contrapunto a la existencia de este tipo de violencia en nuestra sociedad. En primer lugar se exponen las diferentes fórmulas que se utilizan para nombrarla —«violencia de género», «violencia sexista», «violencia sexual», «violencia doméstica o familiar», «violencia de pareja», «violencia machista»...—, sus significados y connotaciones políticas, y su validez conceptual para la investigación histórica; a continuación se tratan algunos de los problemas que surgen al estudiar la violencia contra las mujeres a partir de las fuentes documentales históricas, y, finalmente, se analiza cómo puede repercutir en el presente el análisis histórico de la violencia de los hombres contra las mujeres. This essay considers some of the methodological issues raised by the analysis of male violence against women in the past, as a counterpoint to the persistence of this kind of violence in our society. In the first place, the author examines the different expressions used to name this kind of violence —«gender violence», «sexist violence»,«sexual violence», «domestic violence or violence in the family», «partner violence in couples», «macho violence»...—,their meaning and political connotations. Some of the problems posed by the study of violence against women based on historical documentary sources are considered thereafter, to finish analyzing the possible effects on the present situation of an historical analysis of male violence against women.<br>

Issue: i330152<br>
Date: 6 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Evens T. M. S.<br>
Abstract: It is argued that, contrary to the received view, there is not one but at least two significant conceptions of society as a moral system in the structural functionalist tradition. They express a weak and a strong sense of `morality' respectively. This conceptual equivocation is a pregnant construction of Durkheim's sociology and is dramatically brought forth by Evans-Pritchard's notorious recommendation to turn away from orthodox functionalism to semantic analysis. As the equivocation implies that social anthropology is bound by a stultifying analytical dualism, profound change of presuppositions seems a prescribed therapy.<br>

Publisher: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland<br>
Issue: i330173<br>
Date: 9 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Morton John<br>
Abstract: Central Australian Aboriginal `increase ritual' has often been seen exclusively as an attempt to control environmental forces. Following Durkheim's early arguments against this view, and expanding them to encompass a psychoanalytic perspective, it is argued that the direct effect of so-called `increase ritual' is psychological, but that this effect has consequences for the maintenance of resources in a hunter-gatherer society. `Increase ritual', as Durkheim suggested, is structured as a form of sacrifice. It is also, as Freud suggested, linked to the death of the father. It is argued here that these symbolic themes relate practically to the control which mature men exercise over the reproduction of the social and natural orders.<br>

Abstract: Ce texte est une réaction contre la racialisation croissante des phénomènes sociaux qui est opérée aujourd'hui dans la société française en général et dans les sciences sociales en particulier. Une tendance dont l'émergence d'une « question noire » et d'un des principaux corollaires de celle-ci (au moins pour ce qui est des populations des départements d'Outre-mer), l'activation d'une mémoire de l'esclavage des « nègres », sont ici considérées comme un exemple des plus significatifs. Cette tendance se développe au risque que soient occultés ou, pour le moins, travestis les enjeux, les stratégies et les mécanismes proprement sociaux qui sont au fondement des discriminations racistes qu'affrontent effectivement les « Noirs » en France et que soient finalement brisées — sous le poids de la concurrence de victimes de l'histoire exigeant réparation — les solidarités transcommunautaires de diverses sortes qui, seules, peuvent enrayer ces discriminations et les dynamiques les déterminant. Elle a pour un de ses principaux moteurs des stratégies d'élites qui, toutes, consistent à constituer le racialisme en un moyen d'ascension sociale. Des stratégies dans lesquelles et pour lesquelles des groupes d'individus — convenablement dotés en capitaux de différentes sortes (économique, culturel et « racial ») — se révèlent donc particulièrement aptes à capter à leur seul profit les mobilisations identitaires ou mémorielles qu'ils ont souvent contribué à déclencher mais dont d'autres, moins bien dotés, forment la grande masse des fantassins. Concernant les populations des départements d'Outre-mer, les stratégies en question sont portées par des élites nationalistes ou indigénistes en mal de reconnaissance et renvoient à une même logique argumentative qui, sous couvert d'une dénonciation de l'aliénation coloniale (sous les espèces de « l'aveuglement à la couleur » ou de « l'oubli généralisé de l'esclavage »), est opposée à tous ceux qui, désireux de construire une citoyenneté français~<br>

Abstract: L'Église Universelle du Royaume de Dieu du Cap-Vert, avec près de 20000 fidèles, sur 475000 habitants (soit 4%), connaît, depuis une décennie, un réel succès, dans ce pays-archipel, catholique à plus de 93%. La modernisation rapide du pays (devenu depuis janvier 2008, un Pays de Développement Moyen) renvoie à un moment particulièrement instable. L'embellie économique conduit à une réforme importante de la culture capverdienne et une augmentation des inégalités sociales, ressenties pour certains comme une forme de souffrance. L'Église Universelle répond à l'inquiétude et au doute engendrés par cette situation et ressentis plus fortement par certains groupes de population, par la promotion d'une identitt positive, qualifiée de "gagnante". En tant qu'entreprise religieuse, l'Église pousse ses membres à s'approprier du changement comme d'un fait inéluctable de société. Par la promotion d'une morale de la conviction liée à un procès de la responsabilisation, l'Universelle met en avant la réussite individuelle qui devrait, dans la foulée, libérer le croyant des anciennes formes de la solidarité, notamment celles liées à la "vieille société capverdienne" et toujours louée par de nombreux poètes et chanteurs. /// The Universal Church of the Realm of the God of Cape Verde, with about 20000 believers, on 475000 inhabitants (around 4%), has been, for a decade, a real success, in this country-archipelago which counts about 93% Catholics. The fast modernization of the country (since January 2008, a Country of Average Development) sends at a particularly unstable moment. The economics' taking off leads to an important reform of the capeverdean culture and an increase in the social disparities, understood for some as way of suffering. The Universal Church answers the anxiety and the doubt engendered by this situation, and more strongly felt by certain groups of population, by the promotion of a positive identity, qualified as "winning". As religious company, the Church urges its m~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.<br>
Issue: i360633<br>
Date: 7 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Blades David<br>
Abstract: Against the backdrop of Blades's analysis in Foucauldian terms of the failure of a particular science-technology-society reform, this review addresses four questions: (1) the problem of postmodern writing as a language of rupture; (2) the justification of science-technology-society approaches to science teaching; (3) the fruitfulness of Foucault's explanatory framework for understanding educational change; (4) the fruitfulness of Foucault's framework for education theory in general. It is argued that Foucault's notion of authors who are "founders of discursivity" can form the basis of both a productive theory of educational change and also of an educational vision in which a school strives to become a community of such founders of discursivity.<br>

Article Title: Peasant Politics and Secret Societies: The Discourse of Secrecy<br>
Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
Issue: i274773<br>
Date: 1 1, 1969<br>
Author(s): Wolf Robert C.<br>
Abstract: Many contemporary sources, including anthropological, define politics as the vying for power that occurs in the public domain, the goverance of the body politic, or strategies for advancing particular interests as general. While not inaccurate in terms of reflecting politics in the modern state, the instrumental notion often excludes a sense of politics that involves a struggle for mutual recognition or consensus through the medium of discourse. Discourse becomes the central concept in grasping the relation between politics and secret societies among the peasantry. It is argued in this essay that politics displayed through discourse goes a long way towards defining the public in peasant societies. In terms of augmented repression, either from a centralized state or local elites, the sense of public submerges itself in the hidden discourse or code of the secret society. This theme is examined with respect to the Mau Mau of Kenya and late nineteenth and twentieth-century Chinese secret societies.<br>

Article Title: The Development of Religious Research in the United States: Retrospect and Prospect<br>
Publisher: Religious Research Association<br>
Issue: i284834<br>
Date: 10 1, 1968<br>
Author(s): Zuck W. Widick<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the professionalization of religious research in the United States and related topics. Because professional societies illumine value orientations and practices among workers in a given field, the nature of the American Catholic Sociological Society, the American Society of Christian Ethics, the Religious Research Association, and the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion are briefly considered. The differential appropriation of religious research in various ecclesiastical bodies, the problem of funding religious research in the American situation, and the shift in emphasis from a pragmatic problem-solving approach focused on institutional survival to a more theoretical approach to the understanding of religious phenomena are discussed. The bifurcation between persons interested in religious research trained under theological faculties and those trained under social science faculties is noted. Likely future lines of development in theory and research are projected.<br>

Author(s): Ryan Marie Augusta<br>
Abstract: When religious orders are compared on differences in belief described as Pre-Vatican and Post-Vatican they also differ significantly in their preference for certain theologians and their preferences for types of works. Although age also explains this difference, even with age held constant the difference remains. Those with Post-Vatican beliefs express reading preferences and choice of works which affirm action to transform society as distinct from action to adjust to existing patterns.<br>

Publisher: Maney Publishing<br>
Issue: i288901<br>
Date: 4 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): FreudAbstract: Although the depiction of a Neanderthal people in "The Inheritors" by William Golding is based mainly on the author's imagination and is thus anthropologically untenable, the author's treatment of Oa the earth goddess, worshipped by this tribe, is of unique value and justly represents his key concept. The reciprocity between the symbolic system and the symbol-dissolving element, both inherent in Oa, is very significant regarding cultural, religious, and psychological aspects in relation to the human beings in this novel. This reciprocity helps in the rediscovery of human potentialities that might be repressed and buried under the power structure of a given society.<br>

Publisher: Presses de la Fondation nationale des sciences politiques<br>
Issue: i290761<br>
Date: 6 1, 1851<br>
Author(s): Carbonnier Jean<br>
Abstract: A la veille de la commémoration religieuse, civile et savante de la révocation de l'Edit de Nantes, quelle est la situation du protestantisme français? Inquiétante ou prometteuse, c'est selon, nous dit Jean Baubérot. Ce groupe carrefour, qui a tant fait pour imposer le pluralisme culturel et démocratique en France, semble n'avoir plus d'autre stratégie qu'un œcuménisme déçu, d'autre logique que la déstructuration de ses communautés. Et pourtant, d'évangélismes en ferveurs tziganes, l'Esprit souffle encore. Timides et provocants, voici, trois siècles après, les fils du Désert et du Refuge. /// The Fall of 1985 will see the commemoration of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The author takes this occasion to describe the situation of French Protestantism. In the 19th century, the Protestants had accepted as inevitable the secularization of post-1789 society, and they were instrumental in making it come about. In the 20th century, they adopted an oecumenical strategy, with the Vatican Council II coming as a "divine surprise". Today, they are hesitating between a timid withdrawal and a new evangelical offensive, particularly important in these times of religious disaffection. Three centuries have gone by since the Revocation, but the memory of it is still a help for innovation and a test of vitality for this minority to which the cultural and democratic pluralism of France is so beholden.<br>

Publisher: Carnegie-Mellon University<br>
Issue: i292585<br>
Date: 7 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Mazet Patricia<br>
Abstract: How did men seduce in seventeenth-century Spanish society? To answer that question this article interweaves the classic seventeenth-century tale "The Playboy [Deceiver] of Seville" with the love letters written by Spanish men subsequently identified as seducers in breach of promise suits in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Mexico. It defines seduction's central psychological dynamic as men's open declarations of emotional vulnerability to women. By acknowledging their subservience to and dependence upon women from the very outset, men reversed the classic gender hierarchy of Spanish society. This reversal also openly expressed itself in men's inversion of racial, social, generational categories for themselves. The cultural construct of seduction in Spanish society is also shown to be more complex than it appears on the surface, and more susceptible to manipulation by both men and women.<br>

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i291342<br>
Date: 4 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Žižek Sergei<br>
Abstract: The literary epic Lāčplēsis, written in the nineteenth century, was a conscious attempt to create a cultural frame of reference for the emerging Latvian nation. In this article, which examines how poet Andrejs Pumpurs imagined his community, Kruks compares the Latvian epic hero with his Estonian counterpart, Kalevipoeg, who was invented at the same time under similar conditions of domination by Russians and Baltic Germans. Kruks's narrative analysis demonstrates the different frameworks through which social bonds are constructed for the heroes. Kalevipoeg is a pragmatic actor with an explicitly formulated duty; he errs, but he recognizes his personal responsibility. The Latvian hero Lāčplēsis, on the other hand, is not given a clearly formulated duty; he is simply a hero by destiny and definition. As a resource of symbols that feed contemporary discourses, the epic impedes the construction of a modern national identity capable of engendering a civic society through active pragmatic participation. For past generations, Lāčplēsis explained unjust foreign domination. Kruks argues that contemporary Latvian society now seeks a new frame of cultural reference that will permit the construction of a future-oriented national identity.<br>

Publisher: Palgrave Macmillan<br>
Issue: i371629<br>
Date: 1 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Vindhya Srila<br>
Abstract: Marriage practices, the dynamics of interpersonal relationships and the politics of sexuality are relatively under-researched themes in the study of Bengali communism. Historical scholarship on the revolutionary politics of the extreme left Naxalbari andoian of the late 1960s-1970s, the object of this piece of study, is no exception. The article engages with women and men's narratives on the practice of 'revolutionary' marriage in the movement through the prism of contemporary popular memory studies and narrative analysis. Drawing on field interviews with middle-class male and female activists, the article draws attention to the contestatory nature of marriage in the collective memory of the movement. Narrative contestations over marriage in the Naxalite movement underscore, I argue, a tension between a Utopian ideal of transgressive interpersonal relations and dominant middle-class codes of sexual morality. At the same time, individual attempts to 'compose' (in storytelling) socially recognizable and acceptable subject positions are grounded upon the silencing and abjection of more risky memories. Given the discrepancies and contradictions within the narrative repertoire from which individuals construct their identities, these 'marriage stories' are a tremendous resource for investigating the politics of love, sexuality and subject-formation in middle-class Bengali society.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i371785<br>
Date: 10 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Vianna Jonathon<br>
Abstract: Popular music plays important roles in two related films portraying Brazilian slum life. Based on a 1953 play by Vinícius de Morais, Marcel Camus's 1959 film Orfeu Negro, and a 1999 feature by Brazilian director Carlos Diegues titled Orfeu, augment traditional samba styles with bossa nova and rap, respectively. Interpreting musical style as allegorical texts within fictive landscapes, this paper examines conflation and conflict among musical meanings, Brazilian social histories, and discursive identities marking the twentieth century. Broad aspects of Brazilian political and socio-cultural development are implicated, such as authoritarianism, the politics and sociology of race, technological advances, mass media, and modes of modernisation. Here, bossa nova and rap engage society through reflexive and generative interpretations within a narrative designed to illustrate connections between processes of innovative, trans-national cultural production, myths of national identity, social change, and the powerful role of popular music in film.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000757<br>
Date: 6 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Krondorfer Björn<br>
Abstract: "Forgetting" plays an important role in the lives of individuals and communities. Although a few Holocaust scholars have begun to take forgetting more seriously in relation to the task of remembering--in popular parlance as well as in academic discourse on the Holocaust--forgetting is usually perceived as a negative force. In the decades following 1945, the terms remembering and forgetting have often been used antithetically, with the communities of victims insisting on the duty to remember and a society of perpetrators desiring to forget. Thus, the discourse on Holocaust memory has become entrenched on this issue. This essay counters the swift rejection of forgetting and its labeling as a reprehensible act. It calls attention to two issues: first, it offers a critical argument for different forms of forgetting; second, it concludes with suggestions of how deliberate performative practices of forgetting might benefit communities affected by a genocidal past. Is it possible to conceive of forgetting not as the ugly twin of remembering but as its necessary companion?<br>

Abstract: Accepting MacIntyre's teleological argument that the notion of individual rights is an invention or fiction, the article argues, against MacIntyre, that such a fiction may be interpreted as a creative response to the social requirements of modernity. Such rights language discloses the essential features of modernity but also the underlying teleological and moral structure of all human association. But whether rights language is perceived as a fall from morality or as a creative differentiation of moral language depends on a reading of history and especially on the interpretation of the Enlightenment project. Jürgen Habermas is used for an alternative reading of the Enlightenment and the relation of rights to the normative teleology of language itself. But both readings of history turn out to be theodicies, dependent upon hidden theological assumptions. Whether a society centered on a notion of rights can be governed by teleology can only be answered theologically.<br>

Abstract: Aun cuando el pormenor de este ensayo se centra principalmente en los cambios de acento que experimenta la obra de Karl Mannheim en los años veinte, cuando éste se consagró resueltamente a la sociología, el autor quiere contribuir a explicitar las razones que justifican la plena actualidad de su figura intelectual y de su obra. Sostiene que la obra de Mannheim está vertebrada con inequívoca unidad de intención y procura fijar el sentido preciso de la misma. Mannheim fue un pensador del cambio y del conflicto que consagró toda su energía intelectual a interpretar y a afrontar la crisis de orientación y participación que mina la organización de las sociedades de nuestro tiempo. Concebía la sociología como la ciencia de integración necesaria para orientar la convivencia humana en una situación cultural disgregada y altamente polarizada y compleja. Su visión de la misma apela con claridad a la condición interdependiente e intersubjetiva de la existencia y es congruente con el empeño de quienes, para superar la crisis de la ciencia de la sociedad, tratan de armonizar la sociología equilibrando los excesos estructuralistas con un adecuado tratamiento de la dimensión comunicativa de la vida social. /// Althought this essay focuses mainly on the variations in emphasis suffered by Karl Mannheim's works 1920's, when he devoted himself determinaly to Sociology, it is the author's propose to help highlight the reasons justifying the absolute topicality of both his intellectual dimention and thought. It is defended that Mannheim's works are organized with a clear oneness of intention and an attemp is made to explain its meaning. Mannheim was a thinker of change and conflicit who dedicated his entire intellectual energy to interpreting and facing the crisis of orientation and participation undermining contemporary societies. Sociology was for him considered to be the science of integration, needed for orientation of human coexistence in a desintegrated, complex and highly polariz~<br>

Abstract: El cambio social, ¿es realizado por actores/agentes (=sujetos, individuales y supraindividuales), o bien por determinismos colectivos (como estructuras y sistemas)?, ¿o tal vez por una combinación cualquiera entre actores y mecanismos sociales? Las teorías sociológicas, desde el Ochocientos hasta hoy, se han dividido en dos grandes campos: a) Por un lado, han habido teorías que han adoptado un "paradigma olístico". b) Por otro, han emergido teorías que, juzgando las primeras como infectadas de determinismo, han elaborado un "paradigma accionista". Muchos autores han mezclado o combinado juntos ora una, ora otra de estas posturas sin lograr encontrar un punto de vista capaz de integrarlas o trascenderlas. El resultado es que, hoy, la mayor parte de las teorías oscilan entre el primer y el segundo paradigma, o bien tratan de comprender el cambio social a través de mezclas o "fórmulas combinatorias" entre las dos. La tesis del autor es que ni las teorías sistémicas (olísticas) ni las accionísticas (individualistas) ni sus combinaciones pueden encontrar una "comprensión adecuada" del cambio social. Ofrecen visiones parciales de la historia, que son insuficientes en tanto que comparten una carencia común: la idea de que la relación social sea un resultado (un efecto) de "otras" variables en juego, como las estructuras sociales o --por el contrario-- la subjetividad individual, o bien un determinismo en sí misma. Para comprender el cambio social se precisa de una teoría adecuada al carácter relacional de la realidad social, como realidad sui generis "hecha de" relaciones sociales. Se propone aquí un paradigma, denominado "relacional", según el cual el cambio social consiste en la "emergencia" de realidades sociales movidas por sujetos (individuales y colectivos) queestán en relación entre ellos en un determinado sentido. "Comprender" signifìca "relacionarse" con todo lo que tal relación (¡social!) significa y comporta. En la parte final se trata de ejemplificar las potenc~<br>

Abstract: El presente estudio revisa los presupuestos teóricos de los estudios culturales y el área de la cultura popular en Gran Bretaña a partir de 1950. Esta esfera de lo popular fue definida por la sociedad de masas mediado el siglo xx, y por quienes como Theodor W. Adorno y Max Horkheimer teorizaron sobre la cultura que le es propia. Los artistas modernos y sus críticos abrieron entonces una brecha insalvable entre el arte y los objetos comerciales de dicha cultura. El primero se reservó la esfera del saber y del arte, mientras que los segundos pasaban a engrosar la esfera del mercado social. La noción moderna de cultura de masas estableció el precedente de las consideraciones del británico Raymond Williams y de los estudios culturales posteriores a él. La corriente británica trató de superar esta comprensión moderna de la cultura. /// This study is a conceptual revisión of the background of cultural studies and the popular culture field in Great Britain in the 1950s. This academic domain was defined by mass society in the middle of the 20th century, and by those who, like Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer, spoke about mass culture. Modern artists and their critics then created an insuperable divide between art and the commercial objects of popular culture. The former claimed the sphere of art and knowledge, whereas popular culture belonged to the social market. Based on this división, the modern notion of mass culture set the precedent of Raymond Williams' popular culture concept, and the theoretical formulation of other authors who developed the British cultural perspective. It was a project which tried to overeóme this modern vision of culture.<br>

Abstract: From the moment it began to engage with time in a considered way, human geography has employed a variety of analytical and conceptual approaches to it. Recent work especially has greatly extended the range of these different approaches by stressing the innate variability of time, leading some to talk of 'multiple temporalities' and to pronounce time as 'uneven' even within the same society. Fractured by such differences over how time may be used and interpreted, the possibility of an overarching concept of time in human geography has long gone. However, this does not prevent us from asking whether it is still possible to produce a coherent review of the differences involved. This paper offers such a review, arguing that setting these differences down within a structured framework can provide a clearer sense of how diverse the debate among human geographers has become and the trends of thought that have underpinned this growing diversity. Among the trends identified, it places particular stress on the shift from objectified interpretations to those dealing with relational forms of lived and experiential time and on how the separation of early discussions of space from those on time, their dimensional stand-off from each other, has slowly given way to a view in which space and time are treated as sticky concepts that are difficult to separate from each other.<br>

Abstract: This article aims to explore aspects of the construction by scientific practice of historical-cultural differences. It aims as well to suggest ways to approach ethnic phenomena considering the need to place them historically, and to focus the cultural and political dimensions in new terms; in the challenge that ethnicity represents to today's world. The confrontation with humanity as 'the others' that is talked about, is partial. It is not with all 'humanity' but only with a part of it—substantial indeed—, a 'humanity' with specifities placed in a world divided in ethnocentric and unequal modes. This is the world that Geertz embraces what is 'not properly ours.' We can ask ourselves what is exactly 'properly ours' for those who say it. I add some obvious but forgotten dimensions: the place of the observer, the characteristics of the society where the perceptions and construction of otherness originate and are reproduced. Nowadays the idea of the importance of the 'racial factor', is newly again reinforced. Like in the United States and now in Europe. These differences, more than having a physical or cultural referent, have to do with the dimension of power and with social differences. Ethnicity has never been translated in only one discourse. Therefore, ethnicity should be seen as a process whose meanings can only be understood in context, evolving in the course of history in the specific social circumstances of a given people. Even more, the development of ethnic and class processes in the same social formation adds to the complexity of ethnic processual nature. The articulation of these two processes—ethnicity and class— and their contradictions can only be aprehended by observing the historical dimension in which these take place. By underlining the temporal depth of social processes, the 'ethnographic present' is displaced from this centre of analysis to be come 'a moment' in this processual flow. From this perspective ethnic phenomena are not anymore mere 'acci~<br>

Começa como teoria cognitiva, expande-se para uma metafísica e uma ética, e avança para uma concepção e uma afirmação de Deus, para ser finalmente confrontada com o problema do mal que exige a transformação da inteligência auto-confiante no intellectus quaerens fidem. Ao cumprir estes objectivos, Inteligência tornou-se uma das mais importantes obras de filosofia do século XX, aqui sucintamente elucidada em cinco das suas principais vertentes: a relação entre conhecimento e realidade, conhecimento científico e cosmologia, a acção humana e a ética, as questões de interpretação, a relação entre natureza de Deus e filosofia. O artigo conclui com uma avaliação da cosmopolis lonerganiana, ou seja, o poder da comunidade de espírito na sociedade. /// Bernard Lonergan s opus magnum, Insight: A Study of human understanding, handles the heterogeneous fields of knowledge as given in science, philosophy, common sense and theology according to a transcendental method. The work aims at the self-appropriation of human intellectual and rational self-conscience as based in the conscious experience of insight. Lonergan s work starts as a cognitive theory, and advances, through metaphysics and ethics, to a conception and affirmation of God, one that is confronted with the problem of evil and therefore requires a transformation of self-confident intelligence into the intellectus quaerens fidem. Handling these goals, Insight became one of the most important works of philosophy in the 20 th century. The present article deals with five of the main issues in Lonergan s work: the relation between knowledge~<br>

Publisher: University of Sydney<br>
Issue: i40017228<br>

Author(s): Ballard Chris<br>
Abstract: The role of narrative in explanation has received considerable attention in most of the disciplines concerned with questions of historical process, including history, geology, psychoanalysis and palaeo-anthropology. Archaeologists, however, have been curiously reluctant to consider the proposition that their reconstructions of the past are fundamentally narrative in character. An argument is put forward for the serious study of narrative in archaeology, and three case studies from the prehistory of the New Guinea Highlands are presented in support: a brief review of the debate over the impact of sweet potato on Highland society; an analysis of the changing interpretations of the Kuk Swamp agricultural site by Jack Golson; and a summary of the role of indigenous narratives in accounting for the history of wetland drainage amongst Huli speakers in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea.<br>

Publisher: Guilford Publications<br>
Issue: i40018666<br>
Date: 10 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Öncü Ahmet<br>
Abstract: Analysis of the Turkish state in the 20th century both draws upon and supports Gramsci's definition of the state as "dictatorship + hegemony." Both the form of the capitalist state and its activities rest upon the hegemony of the dominant class. The importance of society and class conflicts in understanding the capitalist state suggests a critical position vis-à-vis the state autonomy tradition. The history of the Turkish state provides support for the argument that the dominant class must have established hegemony in the state in the first place, since without this there is no guarantee of successful use of the coercive power of the state on behalf of the sectional interests of the dominant class.<br>

Abstract: Jürgen Habermas postulates an ideal archaic society as the starting point for his theory of social development, which involves subsequent loss of communicative rationality in a society as it grows into an industrial nation. The western Caroline Islands, an historical archaic society, exhibited a concern with a spirit-world and with the manipulation of the nonmaterial, inherited life-world; both of these features are ignored by Habermas. Western Carolinians had also usurped the ideal speech situation and turned it into a means toward strategic action that resulted in instrumental rationality.<br>

Author(s): Kosmicki Guillaume<br>
Abstract: Cet article se propose de comprendre le sens musical d'une production de techno dite underground. Au travers de l'analyse de « Let's play » de Crystal Distortion, un artiste réputé de la mouvance free party (ou techno clandestine), on examine principalement la coexistence douloureuse des valeurs utopiques de ce mouvement, aujourd'hui considérablement affaiblies, avec le statut inévitablement commercial du disque sur lequel figure la composition. L'opposition pourrait être frontale, une de ces valeurs premières étant justement le refus de la société marchande, mais on décèle au travers de différentes analyses de nombreuses stratégies pour cacher au mieux l'aspect commercial attelé au morceau. En effet, tout ce qui met une œuvre en situation contribue à son sens, et c'est pourquoi nous consacrons du temps à exposer certains aspects du mouvement acquis par un long travail de terrain et de nombreuses observations participantes : la présentation des valeurs de la free party ; son historique ; la manière dont est considéré Crystal Distortion par les acteurs du mouvement ; ainsi que le fait qu'il vende cette production sur CD (la plupart des productions étant normalement tirées uniquement sur vinyle car destinées au mix par des DJs). Puis nous passons à l'examen des éléments composant la jaquette du CD pour en arriver enfin à l'analyse interne de la production, en relation avec les précédentes strates de l'analyse. The purpose of this paper is to understand the musical meaning of a production of so-called underground techno music. Through the analysis of "Let's play" by Crystal Distortion, a famous artist from the free party trend (or underground techno trend), one examines the painful coexistence of the Utopian values of the movement, tremendously weakened today, with the unavoidable commercial status of the record in which the composition appears. The confrontation could be frontal, as one of these essential values precisely is the refusal of consumer society; but one de~<br>

Publisher: éditions tierce<br>
Issue: i40027126<br>
Date: 2 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Caraglio Martine<br>
Abstract: Le sujet est la construction identitaire des lesbiennes qui se perçoivent elles-mêmes comme masculines et qui sont ainsi perçues par leur entourage: par les lesbiennes aussi bien que par les autres personnes. Le "masculin" est envisagé comme une création dans et par la hiérarchie de genre.L'au teure a mené pendant un an une enquête dans une discothèque; 19 histoires de vie apportent leur témoignage. Au terme de ses recherches, la masculinité en question apparaît: 1) comme une manière supportable d'être une femme pour celles qui ne sereconnaissent pas dans le stéréotype féminin; 2) comme un "paysage", c'est-àdire comme quelque chose dontlalesbienne trouve les traits dans le système de genres de la société et dont elle s'empare, faute de mieux ou d'autre chose, pour manifester son refus de la position genrée à quoi la société l'assigne. This article is about the construction of identity among lesbians who perceive themselves and are perceived as "masculine" by others, including other lesbians. The "masculine" is seen by the author as a construction of the gender hierarchy. The author has conducted interviews for a year in a bar and has collected 19 life-stories.Her findings show that the masculinity attributed to lesbians is: 1) a way of making tolerable the fact of being a woman for those women who do not accept the feminine stereotypes; 2) a landscape: an environment made up by lesbians with elements they find in society's gender system, for lack of alternative models, and which they use to express their refusal of the gendered position society wants to assign them.<br>

Abstract: While concepts of a postinternational politics properly highlight the constant variance of entities in play in international relations, the approach lacks an ontology that shows how such an unstable variety of types of players can coexist in a common field in the first place. This article draws upon Deleuze's philosophy to set out an ontology in which the continual reformulation of entities in play in "postinternational" society can be grasped.This entails a strategic shift from speaking about the "borders" between sovereign states to referring instead to the "margins" between a plethora of entities that are ever open to modifications of identity. The concept of the margin possesses a much wider reach than borders, and focuses continual attention on the meetings and interactions between a range of indeterminate entities whose interactions may determine both themselves and the types of entity that are in play.<br>

Author(s): Durand Gilbert<br>
Abstract: La sociologie, née au XIXe siècle, fut trop contaminée par les métaphores biologiques ou mécanistes, alors que la psychologie, depuis Freud, constituait son objet spécifique. Jung, parachevant les topiques célèbres, leur ajoutait les couches profondes de l'Inconscient collectif. Dans le sillage de l'épistémè, et de ses logiques, de la fin du XX e siècle, la sociologie se doit à son tour d'élaborer sa topique propre, où le mythe se découvre comme l'uliime « implicant » (implicate), à partir duquel s'explicitent les rôles, les idéologies, les axiologies et les codes d'une société. Sociology, emerging in the XlXth century, was too contaminated by biological or mechanistic metaphors; psychology however, from Freud's time on, formed its own specific subject. Jung, in amplifying and perfecting the crucial topics, added to them the deep-seated strata of the Collective Unconscious. Following in the wake of epistemy and of its logic, sociology must in turn, by the end of the XXlh century, develop its own subject, in which myth is revealed as the ultimate « implicant » (implicator), on the basis of which the roles, ideologies, axiologies and codes of a society are expounded.<br>

Author(s): Ladrière Paul<br>
Abstract: La première partie de l'article recueille, comme préalable nécessaire à une sociologie de l'éthique, les notions élaborées pour rendre compte de l'expérience éthique. La seconde partie traite de la reprise de ces notions dans les sociologies de Weber et de Habermas. Weber fait intervenir l'éthique dans le cadre de son explication de l'émergence de la société moderne. Habermas remodèle la théorie wébérienne en introduisant le concept d'activité communicationnelle et c'est à partir de là qu'il introduit l'éthique de la discussion. As a necessary preliminary to a sociology of ethics, the first part of this article is reviewing the various notions drawn up in giving an account of the developments in the field of ethics. The second part is devoted to the further examination of these notions in the sociological research studies carried out by Weber and Habermas. Weber is including ethics in the framework of his explanation of the way in which modern society has emerged. Habermas is adding a new element to Weber's theory through bringing in the concept of communicative process, which leads him to introduce the notion of an ethics of discussion.<br>

Date: 6 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Gosselin Gabriel<br>
Abstract: Expliciter les fondements d'une éthique des sciences sociales engage hors d'une sociologie de l'éthique. C'est une recherche peu pratiquée dans ces disciplines qui conduit nécessairement à des affirmations en première personne, et entraîne des présuppositions épislémologiques. Trois postulats sont ici dégagés : 1 / Reconnaître en tout autre un sujet, c'est admettre que le sujet est seul porteur de sens ; 2 / L'affirmation d'une commune humanité introduit une universalité en valeur et une relativité épistémologique, dans une démarche interprétative et une éthique des limites ; 3 / Dire que ce n'est pas l'ordre qui nous constitue, mais nous qui le constituons, c'est dire le risque éthique de nous concevoir comme les éléments d'un Tout, et c'est supposer un individualisme d'ordre épistemologique. Accurately defining the basis of an ethic of social sciences requires an approach which is outside the sociology of ethics. The little amount of research which has been conducted in these fields has necessarily led the author to present personal assertions and has also resulted in epistemological presuppositions. Three assumptions are presented here : 1 / To consider that any one else is a subject amounts in effect to admitting that only the subject carries a real meaning ; 2 / The assertion that mankind is a common whole is introducing both the concept of universality and an epistemological relativity, through an approach based on interpretation and an ethical understanding of limits ; 3 / To state that society does not legitimate ourselves, but that ourselves legitimate society amounts to drawing attention to the ethical risk of considering ourselves as lhe components of a whole, which is presupposing an individualism of an espistemological nature.<br>

Abstract: A partir des réflexions de Paul Ricœur sur la temporalité et la narrativité, l'auteur envisage les processus discursifs de construction identitaire chez les jeunes gens en fin de scolarité obligatoire. L'identité en construction est appréhendée à travers le récit qu'ils donnent de leurs projets d'avenir et de leur histoire familiale. La présentation de soi, perçue dans cette double dimension, est soumise à un ensemble de schemes ou de modèles narratifs culturellement ancrés et socialement véhiculés. Elle prend forme et se constitue en une totalité cohérente et intelligible par une « mise en intrigue » de la diversité des péripéties vécues ou imaginées. The discursive processes that form young people's identities at the age when they leave school are discussed in reference to Paul Ricœur's notions of temporality and narrativity. The identities in formation are observed through these young people's accounts of their future plans and family histories. The presentation of the self — perceived in this two-dimensional way — fits into a set of schémas or nanative models rooted in culture, conveyed by society and forms a coherent, intelligible whole by « bringing into the plot » the diversity of imagined or actually experienced events.<br>

Abstract: The article investigates social and cultural conditions of the institutionalization of pet cemeteries in modern Western societies. After a brief description of their characteristics and their historical origins, such as urbanization, it is shown that (a) the trend of institutionalization is in the long run sociostructurally based on changes of the private lifeworld—especially of the family —, and on processes of individualization in society. In a further step (b), the increasing relevance of the pets' death is related to the contemporary conditions of the dying of human beings, particularly to the so-called "rarely dying". In regard to the cultural context (c), it is argued that pet burials may be considered as a ritual expression of a new totemism, which is grounded on the zoosemantics of the "betwixt-and-between"-position of the athropomorphically experienced pet. Finally, the corresponding tendency to a "numinosic" view of the pet animal is briefly exemplified with two different types of modern pet graves.<br>

Abstract: Sowohl Ethnologie wie Soziologie werden durch die Globalisierung herausgefordert. Die vermeintlich abgeschlossenen fremden „Völker“ verschwinden; „Gesellschaft“ nationalstaatlich zu konzipieren, wird immer unplausibler. Eine (Wieder) Annäherung der beiden im neunzehnten Jahrhundert ausdifferenzierten Fächer tut Not. Taugt „Kultur“ dafür als Brückenbegriff? Soziologen wie Andreas Reckwitz werben für eine praxis-oder diskurstheoretische Reformulierung des Kulturkonzepts, tragen dabei aber auch zu einer problematischen, weil zu umfassenden „Kulturalisierung“ des Sozialen bei. Dagegen halten Ethnologen wie Adam Kuper oder Chris Hann den Kulturbegriff für so unrettbar reifiziert, diffus und machtblind, dass sie ihn lieber abschaffen oder doch umfassend „soziologisieren“ und durch eine präzisere Benennung der jeweils gemeinten symbolischen Codes oder sozialen Praktiken ersetzen wollen. Der vorliegende Artikel schließt sich eher den Skeptikern an und zeichnet aus dieser Perspektive die wichtigsten Stationen der „Entsoziologisierung“ des klassischen ethnologischen Kulturbegriffs und die neuere Kritik in der Ethnologie sowie Ansätze nach, Kultur als Arena von machtförmigen Aushandlungsprozessen zu begreifen. Anthropology and sociology are both challenged by globalisation. Supposedly self-sustaining peoples are rapidly disappearing, and attempts to conceptualize "society" within the parameters of the nation-state have proven themselves unfeasible. It is time to (re) consider the two disciplines that both took shape in the nineteenth century. Can 'culture' still serve as a bridge concept? Sociologists like Andreas Reckwitz have argued in favour of a discourse-and practise-oriented conception of culture, one, however, that entails difficulties of its own, as it leads to the complete culturalization of the social. Anthropologists such as Adam Kuper or Chris Hann, on the other hand, believe the concept of culture to be so reified, diffuse and blind to power relations that they wo~<br>

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: In his hauntology or 'ghost theory', Derrida both subscribes to and rejects Marx's famous exposition on commodities fetishism. He subscribes to Marx's analysis of the world of merchandise as a shadowy world which covers up how exactly society produces this merchandise. His rejection pertains to the invariant structure typical of all discussions of fetishism. This structure, in which the fetish is determined as a substitute for the real item, presupposes a determinable distinction between substitute and the real item. It will be shown that Marx's concept of fetish does indeed rest on this presupposition, because it assumes that the utility value of the commodity can be dissociated fromits market value. Derrida's hauntology wants to retain the critical dimension of Marx'sexposition on fetishism, without incorporating its intrinsic ontology.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i378715<br>
Date: 9 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Zizek Tyler<br>
Abstract: "Always historicize": Frederic Jameson's imperative today exerts a powerful influence on the study of religion. It informs a wide range of methods and, perhaps more important, it shapes influential definitions of religion and religious subjectivity and agency. This article examines this influence and argues for the necessity of thinking the limits of historicism. Building on Robert Orsi's efforts to identify a space for academic exploration in-between religious testimony/narrative and social-scientific diagnosis/ explanation, I turn to recent efforts by Eric Santner and Slavoj Zizek to articulate a concept of subjectivity-tied closely to Franz Rosenzweig's concept of "revelation"-in "excess" of history and ideology. Santner and Zizek do not argue for a new, extra-historical foundation for agency and for religious claims but rather theorize and intervene in the "syntax" by which we are bound to history and society. This approach to historicism allows the scholar of religion to enrich accounts of creative religious agency at the same time that it forces them to rethink their relation to religious phenomena and religious subjects in terms of what the anthropologist Michael Jackson calls "encounter."<br>

Publisher: Armand Colin<br>
Issue: i40044534<br>
Date: 3 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Fellous Michèle<br>
Abstract: Le Quilt possède une double dimension, singulière et militante : chaque panneau, chaque nom énoncé lors du déploiement signifie l'unicité de chaque disparu ; mais l'assemblage des patchworks, leur abandon à l'association qui va les recueillir, les assembler et les utiliser pour porter à l'attention du monde entier l'énormité de la catastrophe renvoie à la dimension sociale inhérente au décès de chaque individu mort du sida. Le développement fulgurant du rite du patchwork aux États-Unis s'explique par ce double enjeu et par la réappropriation de symboles fondateurs de l'imaginaire américain. En se réappropriant un symbole commun, le Quilt légitime et réintègre la communauté gay porteuse du projet dans cette société qui l'a niée. The Quilt has from the outset both a singular and militant dimension : each panel, each name mentioned during the unfolding means the uniqueness of each dead ; but the assembled patchworks, their donation to the association which will conserve, assemble and use them to draw worldwide attention to this dreadful disaster refer to the social dimension inherent to each individual having died of AIDS. The extremely rapid development of the patchwork rite in the United States can be explained by these two functions and within the reappropriation of founding symbols of the Americans'world of imagination. By reappropriating a common symbol the Quilt legitimates and reintegrates the gay community, bearer of the project, into a society from which it was rejected. Von Anfang an hat der Quilt eine eigenartige und zugleich militante Dimension. Jeder Teil des Patchworks, jeder Name, der während der Entfaltung ausgesprochen wird, besagt die Eigenartigkeit jedes Gestorbenen. Doch verweisen das Zusammenfügen der Patchworkwerke und ihre Überlassung dem Verein, der sie bewahren, zusammenfügen und verwenden wird, um die Aufmerksamkeit der ganzen Welt auf diese schreckliche Katastrophe zu lenken, auf die dem Tode jedes AIDSkranken inhärente soziale Dimension.

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40044587<br>

Author(s): Saillant Francine<br>
Abstract: Au Brésil, le récit officiel concernant la mémoire de l'esclavage différe nettement de la vision des leaders du mouvement noir contemporain, notamment à propos de la situation et des conditions de vie des Afro-Brésiliens à Rio de Janeiro. Ce mouvement demande à l'État et à la société brésilienne de reconnaître les conditions misérables dans lesquelles les esclaves ont été laissés après l'abolition de l'esclavage, mais aussi la contribution des esclaves à la construction de la société, de l'économie et de la culture brésiliennes et enfin le racisme dont les Afro-Brésiliens sont encore l'objet. Aujourd'hui, des décisions juridiques tendent à favoriser une égalité effective, permettant ainsi l'émergence d'une image positive de la culture afro-brésilienne. This article discusses the difference between the official account on the memory of slavery in Brazil and how contemporary black movement's leaders, notably in Rio de Janeiro, see the Afro-Brazilians' situation and living conditions. This movement, which seeks to reveal in public space the memory of slavery and its consequences, claims Brazilian State and society to recognize not only the miserable conditions under which former slaves were left after the abolition of slavery, but the contribution of the slaves to the construction of Brazilian society, economy and culture and also that Afro-Brazilians are still the object of racism. If in today's Brazil, the public debate on reparations comprises a legal aspect of rectification, by creating measures aiming to provide effective equality, this discussion also takes the form of symbolic fight, in which one of the objectives is to build a positive image of the Afro-Brazilian culture. In Brasilien weicht die offizielle Berichterstattung über die Wahrnehmung der Sklaverei vor allem in Bezug auf die Situation und Lebensbedingungen der Afro-Brasilianer in Rio de Janeiro stark ab von der Sichtweise der Führer der zeitgenössischen « Schwarzen-Bewegung ». Die Bürgerbewegung forde~<br>

Abstract: Um dos maiores riscos que ameaçam as nossas sociedades contemporâneas é a «etnicização» das relações sociais. Este artigo examina, a partir do caso francês, o papel da escola no agravamento dos processos de segregação étnica e da banalização da violência. Dando conta do logro do modelo republicano, este artigo tenta desenhar os contornos de uma escola da modernidade, apta a assumir uma missão política e moral: a de formar os cidadãos de um mundo pluralista. Un des risques majeurs qui menacent nos sociétés contemporaines est celui de l'ethnicisation des rapports sociaux. Cet article examine, à partir du cas français, le rôle de l'école dans l'aggravation des processus de ségrégation ethnique et d'essentialisation de la violence. Il prend acte de l'échec du modèle républicain et tente de dessiner les contours d'une école de la modernité, apte à assumer une mission politique et morale, celle de former les citoyens d'un monde pluraliste. One of the greatest risks facing modern society is the «ethnicization» of social relations. This article uses the French example to examine the role of school in aggravating ethnic segregation and making violence an everyday affair. In giving an account of the failure of the republican model, this article seeks to provide an outline of a school for modernity, fit to take on a political and moral assignment: that of educating the citizens of a pluralist world.<br>

Abstract: L'expansion de l'agnosticisme et de l'athéisme semble devoir faire de la société occidentale une société sans religion. Mais la religion n'est pas forcément liée à une métaphysique ni à unefoi. Le judéo-christianisme fut aussi une « mise en scène » de l'aveu du péché en vue de la Rédemption. Il pourrait se perpétuer sous sa forme purement théâtrale dans un monde sans foi ni métaphysique. The expansion of both agnosticism and atheism seems to turn the Western society into a society without religion. But religion is not necessarily linked with either a metaphysics or a faith. Judeo-Christianity was also a « staging » of the confession of Sin linked to Redemption. It might be carried on according to its purely theatrical way in a world without either faith or metaphysics.<br>

Abstract: Europe is grounded, from all sides, in traces of old inter-state and ethnic conflicts. Experience has proved that they can still be re-activated in spite of various forms of resolution in the past. History is welcome in the present, and we can observe mobilisation among agents, populations of victims, or despoiled groups, which have been forgotten or forced into silence through post-conflictual issues. Various interest groups, political parties, or states, build up memorial resources that they incorporate in their actions list of historicist strategies, with the aim of 'recycling' the representations of the symbolic pasts into contemporary political games. These mobilisations meet the reconciliation trends coming from society (for example, informal groups, NGOs, and so on), or are taken in charge by national and international institutions – which are becoming more and more routine - especially under the influence of the circulation of 'good' models of the pacification of resentments, containing a highly normative tone. The question is to know whether, in spite of the apparent heterogeneity of this phenomenon, the historicist games do constitute a common indicator of the state of political regimes, especially democracies, and also of the strength of that supranational construction called the EU. This question necessitates the revisiting of the dominant concepts in the field of the political sociology of memory. The international circulation of reconciliation grammars, and the fact that memory issues are being torn out of their national frameworks and exploited in several arenas, both internal and external, in order to increase their yield of political resources, are further evidence that the paradigms heretofore dominant in the social sciences are now at an impasse.<br>

Abstract: La tentative de rapprochement entre littérature et éducation est en train de trouver — et pas seulement en France — de nouveaux adhérents. Cela semble signaler l'émergence d'un nouveau logos pédagogique qui essaye, peut-être, de dépasser les frontières de réflexion imposés par les sciences de l'éducation. Quelques-unes de ces tentatives, cependant, non seulement présentent certaines (et compréhensibles) limites, comme l'absence d'une « théorie de la réception » des textes fictionnels, mals elles ont aussi, dans d'autres cas, l'ambition de révolutionner le discours pédagogique à travers la littérature, où la pédagogie elle-même se transforme en projet d' « esthétisation de l'existence » . En prenant Philippe Meirieu et Jorge Larrosa comme illustrations des « limites » et de l' « ambition révolutionnaire » , respectivement, l'article cherche à montrer comment romantisme et nietzscheisme essayent de constituer un nouveau discours qui prétend, encore une fois, nous sauver de la « société administrée » . The attempt to approximate literature and education is beginning to find, not only in France, numerous supporters. This may indicate the emergence of a new pedagogical logos, which tries, little by little, to overcome the limits of thought set up by the Educational Sciences. Some of these attempts, however, not only show some (understandable) insufficiencies (such as the absence of a "reception theory" for fictional texts), but also, in other cases, the ambition of a complete revolution of the pedagogical discourse through literature (where pedagogy itself becomes a "self-stylistics" or aims at the "aesthetization of existence"). Taking Philippe Meirieu and Jorge Larrosa as respective examples of "insufficiencies" and "revolutionary ambition", the article tries to show how romanticism and Nietzscheanism can constitute a new pedagogical discourse that pretends, once again, to save us from "administerea society".<br>

Publisher: JAI Press Inc.<br>

Author(s): Zeitlin M.<br>
Abstract: The issue of foundationalism and the growing irrelvance of sociological meta-theorizing to the understanding of contemporary society is considered from the perspective of postmodernism. Foundationalism is treated as a form of ideology. Changes in the analysis of ideology are discussed briefly and the postmodern approach to the critique of grand narratives, or logocentrism, is introduced. Two meta-narratives, neofunctionalism and conflict theory, are criticized as illustrative examples of logocentrism. The postmodern critique is then applied to the issue of foundationalism as recently articulated in the "Seidman controversy," which is exposed as containing hidden foundationalist implications of its own. The critique of foundationalism raises three issues that are discussed: the possibility of a deontological social theory, narrative as social inquiry, and the social role of academics as intellectuals.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i383702<br>
Date: 2 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): ZizekAbstract: Arguing that without a differentiated and relational notion of the cultural, the social sciences would he crippled, reducing social action to notions of pure instrumentality, in this article, I trace the growth of cultural analysis from the beginnings of modern anthropology to the present as a layered set of experimental systems whose differential lenses create epistemic objects with increasing precision and differential focus and resolution. Arguing that culture is not a variable-culture is relational, it is elsewhere or in passage, it is where meaning is woven and renewed, often through gaps and silences, and forces beyond the conscious control of individuals, and yet the space where individual and institutional social responsibility and ethical struggle take place-I name culture as a set of central anthropological forms of knowledge grounding human beings' self-understandings. The challenge of cultural analysis is to develop translation and mediation tools for helping make visible the differences of interests, access, power, needs, desires, and philosophical perspective. In particular, as we begin to face new kinds of ethical dilemmas stemming from developments in biotechnologies, expansive information and image databases, and ecological interactions, we are challenged to develop differentiated cultural analyses that can help articulate new social institutions for an evolving civil society.<br>

Publisher: The Polish Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i40057457<br>

Author(s): HAŁAS ELŻBIETA<br>
Abstract: Robert Morrison Maclver — Franklin Giddings' successor at the Columbia University was a leading opponent of positivism (George Lundberg), empricism (William Ogburn) and antitheoretical praxism (Robert Lynd). Maclver developed sociological theorizing along the Weberian tradition. The paper focuses on the temporality concerns of Maclver: 1) the question of distinct qualitative times, 2) the question of various temporal modes of being in the sociocultural realm, 3) temporality in social action. Maclver, unrecognized by today's symbolic interactionists, sought the implications of George H. Mead's work on time for analysis of activity as dynamic remaking of the present. The unity of the meaningful or symbolic and the temporal aspects of social pheomena was evident in the Maclver's theorizing. In consonance with the Bergsonian criticism of scientific mechanism Maclver was critical of variable-centered methodology. He analyzed the temporal modes of being of events, processes and cultural objects and focused on different ways society, history and culture enter the time process. Maclver made the temporality of actions the key issue. He should be classified as symbolic interactionist along with Florian Znaniecki and Pitirim Sorokin.<br>

Publisher: The Polish Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i40057469<br>
Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): MORAWSKI WITOLD<br>
Abstract: On the assumption that harmonization of the allocative efficiency of market, state redistributionism and the social values of solidarity and social justice is the key to successful systemic transformation, the author analyzes systemic change from the institutional perspective. Thus he is able to interpret the new systemic rules in their interaction with the environment and to interpret change in evolutionary terms. The analytic design has seven components: new rules, their intrinsic domestic sources, the need to adjust structurally to the West, environmental contingencies (values, actors and their methods of operation, public or private space, time and circumstances), the mechanisms of emergence of the new system (via establishment of new institutions, deinstitutionalization, reinstitutionalization etc.), impact of the heritage of the past, and, finally, the effectiveness of the new institutions (the state, the economy and civil society). Both in the analysis of universal challenges and the analysis of Polish problems, the author emphasizes the need to develop adaptive rationality, which he views as a superior, synthetic form of overcoming the dilemmas posed by the systemic transformation.<br>

Abstract: Multiculturalism is a term spreading in the West during the 1960s to indicate respect, tolerance and defence of cultural minorities. The idea of multiculturalism has become a collective imaginary ("all different, all equals"). It has generated a political ideology supporting an inclusive citizenship towards "different" cultures. After being adopted as official policy in many Countries, multiculturalism has generated more negative than positive effects (fragmenting the society, separating the minorities and fostering cultural relativism). As a political doctrine, it seems harder and harder to be put into practice. At its place, today we talk of interculturality. But this expression too seems quite vague and uncertain. This essay discusses on the possible alternatives to multiculturalism, asking itself whether the way of interculturality can be a solution or not. The Author's thesis is that the theory of interculturality has the advantage to stress the inter, namely what lies in between different cultures. But it does not possess yet the conceptual and effective means to understand and handle the problems of the public sphere, when the different cultures express cultural values radically conflictual between them. The troubles of interculturality result from two lacks: an insufficient reflexivity inside the single cultures, and the lack of a relational interface between the different cultures (between the carrier subjects). Modern western Reason created a societal structure (lib-lab) promoting neither the first nor the second one. In fact, it neutralizes them, because it faces the dilemmas of values inside the cultural diversities through criteria of ethical indifference. Such criteria set reflexivity to zero, preventing individuals to understand the deepest reasons of the vital experience of the others. Reason is emptied of its meaning and of its understanding capability. To go over the failures of multiculturalism and the fragilities of interculturality, a lay approa~<br>

This discussion importantly draws upon the thinking of Hobbes, Locke, and Kant. It thereafter examines the suitability of the Lisbon Treaty in meeting the challenge of the global financial crisis, and its impact on civil society across Europe.<br>

Author(s): VarineAbstract: This ethnographic study of the creation of a museum in Le Creusot (France) provides an analysis of the heritage industry that emerged in the wake of the demise of a family company around which the town was built. This museum was a reaction to the passing of an age when industrial and urban environments were intrinsically linked. Through this description of how the past is collected and recollected in a museum, this article attempts to determine if this duty of remembrance is not, to a certain extent, a strategy of forgetfulness. Is cultural regeneration-the staging of history fading into oblivion-our society's sole response to industrial regeneration?<br>

Article Title: SOCIAL MEMORIES IN (POST)COLONIAL FRANCE: REMEMBERING THE FRANCO-ALGERIAN WAR<br>
Publisher: George Mason University<br>

Abstract: This article examines social memories in France over the last 10 years. There has been a significant amount of 'memory work' during this period, concerning various aspects of French history, including the World Wars, but predominantly postcolonial issues: the Algerian War, the legacy of slavery, memories of Empire and memories of Immigration in particular. The 'devoir de mémoire' (duty to remember) and 'work of memory' (Paul Ricœur) have taken on greater, and controversial, proportions. While President Jacques Chirac was for some the 'président du devoir de mémoire' (President who championed the duty to remember), President Nicolas Sarkozy seems intent on ending what he sees as the trend towards 'repentance'. After a discussion of the wider memory culture in France, this article focuses on collective and social memories of the Franco-Algerian War (1954-62) Through an analysis of various 'vectors of memory' (Henry Rousso) it argues that the recent upsurge in 'memory work' in France is very much anchored in the present postcolonial social context in France. That memory work is however largely symbolic and in some ways unsatisfactory. It shows that much of the recent work of memory has been only belatedly and partially undertaken by the State, and with civil society in some ways yet to follow.<br>

Author(s): Lebel Udi<br>
Abstract: Individual behaviors, such as loss-coping and “grief work” are affected in organizational contexts. In everything pertaining to coping with trauma in general, and loss more particularly, the individual is “trapped” within a political psychology that enforces the habitus and expectations of institutional dominance on the ostensibly intimate and private response. Regimes have perceived bereavement over battlefield deaths as a form of social capital that can be mobilized to enhance national loyalty and political support. Employing both existential/hermeneutic and institutional analysis, this study examines three diachronic models of bereavement — hegemonic, political and civil — and their political ramifications in the Israeli context.Drawing on changing parental conceptual orientations towards fallen sons and their role as cultural and ideological agents in public sphere, the article traces the movement of bereavement from its capture by the hegemonic state institutions to its creations under the domination of others institutions: political and civic and ultimate use in critiquing the political and military echelon. The article indicates the powerful impact of the social institutional-organizational context on the intimate-psychological context of coping with loss, by illustrating this phenomenon in the Israeli society.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i387664<br>
Date: 3 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Wilcox John<br>
Abstract: This essay argues for a new religious ethical approach to fatherhood centered on children and their expanding capabilities for participation in society. Under the notion of "childism"-in analogy to feminism, womanism, humanism, and the like-it takes the perspective of the experiences and concerns of childhood as such. In contrast with a soft patriarchal argument for fatherhood that dominates much religious discourse today, it argues for a larger and more hopeful vision of fatherhood as directed toward the human social good. This requires, methodologically, a richer hermeneutical circle between religion and the social sciences. Substantively, it calls for Christian and other religious ethicists to re-imagine fatherhood as an integrated public-private responsibility that aims to cultivate children's fully human social creativity as images of their Creator.<br>

Abstract: Looking at the trajectories of people of Muslim origin in Egypt who express religious doubts, I argue in this article that doubt and nonreligiosity are not necessarily a child of a Christian genealogy of the secular and definitely not alien to Muslims. Instead, we have to understand them as an intimate moral discontent with the contemporary age of Islamic revival, even if their shape and some of their positive claims are borrowed from notions of Western origin and global currency—most notably, human rights and feminism. There are reasons and ways to become a nonbeliever in a society profoundly affected by a religious revival, and these reasons and ways can be telling about the nature of doubt and certainty in general. They also offer a perspective on the problematic of secularism that focuses on issues of belief and existential trust rather than governmentality and discursive power.<br>

Author(s): Adams Julia<br>
Abstract: How did cultural dynamics help bring about the societies we now recognize as modern? This article constructs seven distinct models for how structures of signification and social meaning participated in the transitions to modernity in the West and, in some of the models, across the globe. Our models address: (1) the spread, via imitation, of modern institutions around the world (memetic replication); (2) the construal, by socio-cultural forces and by state organizations, of the modern citizensubject (social subjectification); (3) the continual search for new meanings to replace traditional religious meaning-systems (compensatory reenchantment); (4) repeated attempts, in modern revolutions, to remake society completely, according to a Utopian vision (ideological totalization); (5) the cultural origins and social consequences of scientific and humanistic worldviews (epistemic rift); (6) the gendered politics of state formation (patriarchal supercession); (7) the invention and production of race in the colonial encounter (racial recognition). We explicate the models in reverse chronological order, because in our synthesis, we argue that the original modern break results from a dynamic combination of racial recognition, patriarchal supercession, and epistemic rift; these changes set the stage for the four other processes we theorize. In addition to our synthesis, we also consider, from a more neutral perspective, the kinds of causal arguments upon which these models tend to rely, and thus explicate the analytical undergirding for the application of any of these models to empirical research on transitions to modernity. Throughout the article, we consider how these models might, and might not, mesh with other families of explanation, such as the politico-economic.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo propõe uma interpretação do fenômeno Chico Xavier na cultura e na sociedade brasileira. A partir do reconhecimento da importância cruciai de seu modelo mítico de espírita exemplar, o lugar de absolute destaque ocupado pelo médium mineiro na história do kardecismo brasileiro será interpretado à luz de urn código cultural articulado em sua biografia, que busca sintetizar os personagens paradigmáticos do "santo" e do "caxias". Desdobrado na unidade de sua obra mediúnica e trajetória pública, o tipo de espiritismo construído em Chico Xavier evidencia a proposta kardecista dominante ao longo do século XX, enquanto modelo de cidadania, prática religiosa e projeto nacional. The present article is a reading of the place of the phenomenon Chico Xavier in the Brazilian culture and society. Starting from the recognition of his crucial importance as a mythical model of exemplary spiritualist, the absolute prominence of the medium in the history of the Brazilian spiritualism will be interpreted in the light of a cultural code articulated in his biography, that synthesizes the Brazilian mythical characters of the "saint" and of the "caxias". Unfolded from his life and works the model of spiritualism built by Chico Xavier evidences the kardecismo's dominant religious point of view along the 20th Century, while citizenship model, religious practice and national project.<br>

Abstract: Can one speak of Israelitism in the case of Poland? By asking this question, one runs into the classic difficulty of the universalisation of concepts and to what extent they can be transposed. As a specific method of individualistic integration, French Israelitism pre-supposes a particular organisation of citizenship and society, a dissociation of political and religious categories, as well as a specific articulation of the universal and the particular. This article shows that Israelitism as an idea and a theoretical model entered Judeo-Polish society in the 19th century. Nevertheless, the sociological and political context was radically different from the institutions and public space of the Third Republic and thus limits to the importation of the model were soon reached. All the while drawing its political references from western cultures, the troubled history of Eastern Europe was not structured by the same variables nor by the same historical ruptures. The same words (nation, State, religion) do not have the same meaning; the modes of national and political constructions, particularly between religion and politics, has very little in common with what made French Israelitism possible in the 19th century. In Poland, the paradigm of the Israelite was merely an impossible dream.<br>

Abstract: The analysis of narrative processes and metaphorical language are the topics generally focused on by business ethics researchers interested in the work of Paul Ricœur. Yet his work on political questions also applies to the ethical issues associated with organizations. Ricœur's ethical enterprise can be expressed as a triad composed of ideological, deontological, and sapiential levels, associating ostensibly opposing positions of Aristotelian and Kantian origin. In this study, I examine politics, economics, and ethics in their dialectic relation as established by Ricœur. Against a vertical, mechanistic, and axiologically neutral vision of management, he opposes the two conceptual pairs of conviction/imagination and ideology/utopia as well as a superior definition of justice associating reciprocal indebtedness and mutual disinterestedness. Through this analysis, it becomes clear that the vertical, hierarchical nature of politics tends to undermine the horizontal interactions necessary to procure just institutions in society. And any business ethic that does not acknowledge political tensions will be mute. What is needed instead is practical wisdom that is developed through interaction, and often through conflict, involving all the different players.<br>

Publisher: Tsehai Publishers<br>

Abstract: The paper proposes a critical reappraisal of Abba Bahrey's Zenahu leGalla, the controversial 16th century text. Some scholars criticize it as harbouring anti-Oromo sentiments while others praise it as an important source on the organization of Oromo society The paper argues that, while Zenahu leGalla does provide useful historical information on the Oromo, its lasting value lies elsewhere: in the critical reflection it initiates on the issues of power, freedom, social change, violence, and the public use of reason. To unpack these issues, occluded by current interpretations of Zenahu leGalla, the paper undertakes a critical hermeneutical reading of the text. The reading shows that Bahrey's text incubates emancipatory surplus meanings that transcend his epoch and speak to the concerns of contemporary Ethiopia. In the concluding sections, the paper discusses the issues of democracy and development in light of these surplus meanings.<br>

Abstract: In the quest for a more sustainable environment, there appears to be a need to confront issues of tradition vs. modernity and culture vs. technology in a world where boundaries once dividing these issues are collapsing, and differences once separating them are disappearing. This study demonstrates, through examination of a series of built examples, the successful integration of tradition and modernity as they are reflected in Muslim cultures. In practice, the notion of culture and technology is addressed through the built context, ultimately establishing the identity of a society through its architecture. This paper argues for the preservation of a culture through understanding the level of symbolism established in its built environment: the higher the level of symbolism, the further detached an artifact becomes from its place of origin. This research focuses on possible scenarios involving the conscious application of past and present typologies of form and technology in search of a recognizable cultural identity.<br>

Article Title: A Critical Dialogue Between Fifteenth and Twenty First Century Ethiopia<br>
Publisher: Tsehai Publishers<br>
Issue: i40081947<br>
Date: 7 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Mennasemay Maimire<br>
Abstract: The paper proposes a symptomatic reading of the writings of a fifteenth century heretical movement—the Dekike Estifanos—to throw light on the modernization predicament of twenty–first century Ethiopia. Based on the assumption that all serious thinking about a society needs to be mediated by its intellectual tradition, the paper enucleates critiques of power, institutions and knowledge that are immanent in the teachings of the Dekike Estifanos and that throw a new light on how Ethiopians could approach the tasks they face in the twenty-first century. It shows that such a critical dialogue with Ethiopia's intellectual traditions discloses questions, ideas and ideals that could provide historically-rooted intellectual resources for developing an Ethiopian critical theory capable of illuminating the possible routes to a modernization productive of freedom, equality, justice, and prosperity.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40085908<br>
Date: 9 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Pestre Dominique<br>
Abstract: What I consider in this paper are various forms of government, various technologies and discursive regimes of government that are in common use today. What interests me are the categories and tools, practical dispositifs and languages that developed over the last decades 'to constitute, define, organize, and instrumentalize the strategies that individuals, acting freely, may use to deal with one another' (Foucault). The paper considers first the neo-liberal wish to reassert the individual as alone in responsibility for his/her own life after the unfortunate digression into Welfare Statism and Keynesian economics, source of all ills. It then focuses on some material and social technologies that encourage people to accept full and complete 'self-sovereignty'. This section leads to a discussion on the new demands (and resistance) society imposed on this liberal normative ideal. It notably considers the growing demands to 'participate' in decision processes and to be environmentally friendly. In section "Les Mots et Les Choses: A New Discursive Regime", it considers the discursive regime that progressively took shape and which currently permeates international governance bodies of all stripes—from the World Bank to the Conference of Parties for Climate Change. In the final section, it comes back to the initial question and considers what these changes actually mean for the democratic order as constituted over the past 250 years.<br>

Abstract: Le but de notre article est d'essayer de montrer en quoi l'expérience rédactionnelle et éditoriale de l'Histoire socialiste de la Révolution française fut pour Jaurès, hormis le prétexte pédagogique évident pour préparer les dirigeants à l'unité du mouvement socialiste encore divisé et pour éduquer politiquement les militants et le prolétariat, l'occasion d'affiner sa réflexion sur une future « méthode socialiste », à la veille de l'unité de 1905. Parce que « la Révolution française contient le socialisme tout entier », quels sont donc les événements que Jaurès juge les plus pertinents et les plus féconds pour l'avenir socialiste de la société et de l'État ? Rappelant le contexte et les conditions de cette grande entreprise, nous nous sommes attachés à retrouver ce qui fonde philosophiquement sa démarche et ses analyses historiques - spécialement au cours du « moment thermidorien » - à partir de sa méthode philosophique adossée à sa métaphysique de l'unité de l'être. Une esquisse, en somme, de l'analyse critique jaurésienne de la « dictature jacobine » et de l'esprit révolutionnaire de Robespierre conditionnant le socialisme réformiste gradualiste de Jaurès. The article attempts to show how the writing and editing of the Socialist History of the French Revolution was for Jaurès not merely a self-evident pretext to enlighten others, unify the still divided leaders of the socialist movement and educate politically the party faithful and the proletariat, but also an opportunity to finetune his reflections on a future « socialist methodology » on the eve of the union of 1905. Given that « the French Revolution contains socialism in its entirety », what then were the events that Jaurès thought most relevant and fruitful for the socialist future of society and state ? While recalling the context and conditions of this great venture, our aim has been to retrieve the philosophical essence of his historical approach and analysis, especially during the « moment of Thermidor »~<br>

Abstract: The goal of this article is to review the possibilities and limitations of applying Aleida and Jan Assmann's concept to the study of local memory, using as an example the memory of inhabitants of the Polish town of Olsztyn. The author first briefly presents selected key premises of Aleida and Jan Assmann's concept of cultural memory. She then addresses the question of how the Assmanns' concept is received and interpreted in Poland. Discussion of these issues leads to an analysis of the advantages and difficulties of applying the two German scholars' theoretical proposals to the study of memory in local communities. The author refers to the case of a moderately aggregated, urban society with a complicated multiethnic past. Her conclusions concern the challenges scholars face in adopting Aleida and Jan Assmann's theoretical perspective for studying memory and local communities in this part of Europe.<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to foster the regeneration and reorientation of peace research in the United States through its internationalization and radicalization. The authors locate the possible sources of this 'post-modern' redirection of American peace studies in the traditions of critical theory and phenomenology and in convergent work by contemporary West European scholars in Scandinavia and the Federal Republic of Germany. The main lines of this reorientation for American peace research are limned through an exploration of three substantive themes: power, violence, and hegemony; international society as totality; and the critical peace researcher as knower and actor.<br>

Author(s): TUPAS T. RUANNI F.<br>
Abstract: This article explores the nature of historical forgetting in the Philippines through the lens of Pierre Bourdieu's notion of forgetting as misrecognition, which is invested with power and struggle. The notion is concretized in the context of Reynaldo Ileto's discussion of the Schurman Commission, which was tasked to gather information about the Philippines as part of the United States' pacification campaign. Because historical forgetting is rooted in the structure of society itself, policies concerning language and education are imbued with power and class dimensions. The necessity of change in consciousness is enmeshed in the broader politics of social change, which is thus the context of the debate on the critical role of English in the Philippines. The political imperative to forget is inherent in—and partly sustains—the fundamental structure of social relations in the Philippines.<br>

Abstract: This study is concerned with the method and results of an empirical research project called’ Regional Topics and the Understanding of Region: Research into Reception of Literature in Silesia and North Moravia’, which took place in May 1998. The starting point was an attempt to summarize the predominant approaches to regionalism, the particular nature of a region, and the predominant forms of Communication in regional Communication in the arts and in society in general. The chosen method of asking the questions and the results of the quantitative analysis have been received with a certain degree of scepticism, though a comparison with some of the signs and features discovered in similar research in 1982-4 is not without interest. The entire matter, however, has taken on a new form and cannot be looked at in isolation.<br>

Author(s): CORSETTI RITA<br>
Abstract: The article analyses the idea of Europe elaborated by the German philosopher Karl Jaspers. During the Twenties and the Thirties Jaspers criticized the supremacy of modern technology on society. After the Second World War he was interested in studying the development of European civilization and the foundation of a world order based on peace, freedom, democracy and mutual respect. With the partition of the world between Us and Russia, during the Cold War Jaspers proposed to build a confederation of the West against Russian totalitarianism. Making a first step toward an universal order, Europe had the important role of giving the fundamental values to it. L'article analyse l'idée d'Europe élaborée par le philosophe allemand Karl Jaspers. Au centre des réflexions politiques de Jaspers dans les années Vingt et Trente il y avait la crise de l'Europe et la critique de l'ère de la technique. À partir de l'après-guerre la pensée politique du philosophe s'était tournée vers l'étude de la civilisation européenne et la recherche d'un ordre mondial basé sur la paix, la liberté, la démocratie et le respect mutuel. Après le partage du monde entre l'Amérique et la Russie lors de la guerre froide Jaspers a proposé la confédération de l'Occident libre contre la menace totalitaire russe comme premier pas vers un ordre universel. Dans un tel processus l'Europe avait un rôle décisif: caractérisée par la rationalité et la liberté dialectique, la civilisation européenne était porteuse de valeurs fondamentales pour un futur ordre mondial.<br>

Author(s): Giroux Henry A.<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between teacher education and the ideology of social control. It does this by looking at the dialectical tension that exists between teacher-education programs and the dominant society through a set of concepts that link as well as demonstrate the interplay of power, ideology, biography, and history. It further illuminates this interplay by analyzing the rationality that presently dominates these programs. Finally, the paper not only examines the implications of this rationality for teacher-education programs, it also points to ways in which it can be overcome.<br>

Abstract: Dans l'article qu'on va lire, Ludivine Bantigny retrace la généalogie du concept d'historicité, ses différentes déclinaisons et ses enjeux pour les sciences sociales en général et l'histoire en particulier. Ce texte propose d'examiner les definitions de la notion d'«historicités», d'explorer les usages qui en sont faits ou pourraient en être faits par les sciences sociales en général et par l'histoire en particulier, et de réfléchir à ce qui a été nommé le «présentisme». Si la définition est loin d'être figée, on peut entendre par historicité la capacité qu'ont les acteurs d'une société ou d'une communauté donnée à inscrire leur présent dans une histoire, à le penser comme situé dans un temps non pas neutre mais signifiant, par la conception qu'ils s'en font, les interprétations qu'ils s'en donnent et les récits qu'ils en forgent. L'historicité suppose une conscience mouvante et changeante du passé et du futur, façonnée à l'aune du présent. Il est dès lors important d'insister sur la pluralité des modes d'historicités et done sur leur coexistence. Par là, il s'agit de considérer les formes d'historicités dominantes et les résistances qui peuvent aussi lui être opposées. This text analyzes the definitions of the notion "historicities", explores how the social sciences in general and history in particular uses or could use it and considers what has been called "presentism". While the definition is not at all fixed, historicity can be understood as how the players of a society or a community fit their present into a history, how they think it as situated in a time that is not neutral but signifying, by the conception they have of it, the interpretations they give and the accounts they make of it. Historicity implies a moving and changing consciousness of the past and the future, shaped by the present. It is thus important to emphasize the plurality of types of historicities and thus of their coexistence. The forms of dominant historicities and the resistance that can b~<br>

Abstract: In societies coming to terms with historical injustices, public apology has recently emerged as a potent trend. This is particularly true of France, where the state served as a catalyst for a wave of public apologies for acts of intolerance committed during the Second World War. Following Jacques Chirac's 1995 official apology for Vichy's anti-Semitic policies, various groups in civil society publicly atoned for their particular Vichy roles in discrimination against Jews: the medical profession, the law bar, the Catholic Church, and the police. How does public apology, as distinct from court trials, historical commissions, and reparations, affect contemporary France's reconciliation with its past? This article also analyzes how apologizing for Vichy has created demand for an official French apology for the Algerian War. By 2006, the politics of memory in French society decidedly shifted attention from Vichy to post-colonialism: in both cases, the apology turn imposes new dynamics of remembering and forgetting.<br>

Author(s): AUBENQUE Pierre<br>
Abstract: Le structuralisme est défini ici comme le transfert du modèle structural, qui a fait ses preuves en linguistique depuis F. de Saussure, à d'autres domaines de la vie humaine. L'auteur s'interroge moins sur la légitimité d'un tel transfert, qui, dans certaines limites, peut toujours être épistémologiquement justifié, que sur les raisons philosophiques et sociologiques qui ont pu conduire à sa généralisation. Le structuralisme, qui a tendance à ramener les conflits historiques réels à un système d'oppositions signifiantes, n'est pas seulement incompatible avec le marxisme ; forme à peine plus subtile du positivisme, il est à ranger aussi bien parmi les produits idéologiques de la société industrielle avancée que parmi les symptômes de l'oubli de l'être. Structuralism transfers the structural pattern, which has proved successful in Linguistics since F. de Saussure, into other fields of human life. What is questioned here is less the legitimacy of that transfer which, within limits, may always be epistemologically justified, than the philosophical and sociological grounds of such a generalization. Structuralism, prone to reduce real historical conflicts to a system of signifying oppositions, is not only incompatible with Marxism, but, as a slightly more subtile form of positivism, is both an ideological product of advanced industrial society and a symptom of forgiveness of being.<br>

Abstract: Une théorie de la justice peut-elle être métaphysiquement neutre? John Rawls, aussi bien dans l'article de 1985 « La théorie de la justice comme équité: une théorie politique et non pas métaphysique » que dans son Libéralisme politique (1995) a soutenu qu'une théorie de la justice qui s'applique à une société libérale démocratique ne doit s'appuyer sur aucune doctrine comprehensive, mais doit au contraire s'en tenir à des règles de la vie politique et de la répartition des biens qui soient métaphysiquement neutres. Prenant le contre-pied de la position de Rawls, cet article tente de montrer non seulement qu'une telle neutralité ne se vérifie pas dans la construction rawlsienne, lorsqu'il s'agit notamment de justifier les droits de l'homme, mais encore que cet « échec » est ce qui conserve à la théorie de Rawls toute sa force critique par rapport aux doctrines rivales comme l'utilitarisme. Is it possible for a theory of justice to be metaphysically neutral? John Rawls, in his paper published in 1985 and titled "Justice as Fairness: Political, not Metaphysical", as well as in his book Political Liberalism published in 1995, defended the thesis that a theory of justice which is supposed to be applied to a liberal and democratic society should not be rooted in a comprehensive doctrine, but, on the contrary, must be confined to a formulation of rules of political conduct and repartition of goods which is metaphysically neutral. From an alternative standpoint, this paper is an attempt to show that such neutrality is not verified in Rawls' argumentation, especially when human rights' justification is concerned, and that this failure in implementing neutrality is what helps to preserve all the critical strength of Rawls' theory as compared to other doctrines as utilitarianism.<br>

Abstract: The present-day global culture challenges First-World theologians to coalesce with Third-World theologians. Such an enterprise is conditioned by the identification of commonalities in theological inquiry. Hermeneutics of the Bible, and especially of the New Testament, is an important common ground for 'traditional theology' and 'contextual theology' alike. This paper, however, argues that there is a foundational reason why the historical Jesus and not the canon should be seen as the common ground for the engagement by First-World as well as Third-World theologians. This argument relates to the epistemic status of the canon in liberation theology. The canon originated during the time when the horticultural society shifted to an agrarian one. This shift was accompanied by, among other things, the process of urbanisation and the increase of inequality and of the scarcity of resources. Our memory of the historical Jesus tradition keeps us in touch with Jesus' emancipatory living during these circumstances—an emancipatory living that unmasks the hegemony that could be embedded in the canon.<br>

Abstract: Objectivistic philosophy and reductionist theories have contributed to a malaise in society and the church. On the one hand, the fruits of modernity and deconstructive postmodernism have led to a situtation where the observable and the empirical are considered the true index of reality. There is a loss of purpose and meaning in life. The church finds itself in a situation of crisis, and needs to admit its own shortcomings in order to be a leaven for society. At the same time, there is an 'outbreak' of interest in issues of spirituality and mysticism throughout the world as the end of the millennium draws near. Mysticism, particularly scriptural mysticism, is an ecclesial charism, and when understood and appropriated can be a source of renewal for the church and society.<br>

Abstract: This article proposes some guidelines for relevant Indian interpretations of the Bible. It examines the traditional Western methods and perspectives as well as the challenges to these methods in Biblical hermeneutics in India. Shifting trends in Western methods of biblical interpretation and their inability to meet the needs of the context could give the motivation to develop methods and principles for authentic Indian biblical interpretations. Drawing on insights from the biblical interpretation in Latin America, Asia and South Africa, Indian Biblical hermeneutics must move towards discovering critical tools that are helpful in the Indian context. Such an endeavour needs to take seriously both the inner and the outer reality of India and develop a proper perspective for Indian Biblical interpretations. Judicious use of the critical tools and resources available in the context, commitment to the poor and the oppressed and faith-response to God are imperative for evolving effective Indian biblical interpretations. The complex Indian context demands a plurality of critical biblical readings with the people in pluri-religious community, open to the dynamic activity of the Spirit with a goal to transform our society and promote communal harmony.<br>

Abstract: This contribution looks at the issue of how to present history by taking a look at one of the most cited countries for exemplifying a multicultural society. The author adopts a careful, even critical, stance when it comes to the pluralistic discourse and illustrates how, in the case of Canada, the problem of deciding whether to opt for a blanket discourse (a one-sided view of a country, stretching from one ocean to the next) or an atomising approach (allowing for as many historical interpretations as there are views) does not arise. The focus is more on establishing a factual as well as narrative discourse which allows for a representation of Canada in all its dissonances, changing equilibria, and stormy interdependence.The term "canadianité" would seem fitting, since it refers to the essence of how Canada has formed an historical identity. It could promote a way of relating history which offers an escape from the ostensibly dead-end situations found in the great narratives of Canada which are currently dominating our collective imaginations. Der Autor dieses Aufsatzes geht auf die Frage der Geschichtsschreibung in einem der als Beispiel für eine multikulturelle Gesellschaft meist zitierten Staaten ein. Er nimmt eine behutsame, ja kritische Position gegenüber dem pluralistischen Diskurs ein und zeigt auf, dass im Falle Kanadas das Dilemma nicht in der Entscheidung für einen unitaristischen Diskurs (einheitliche Sicht des Landes von einem Ozean zum anderen) oder einen atomisierenden (so viele Geschichten des Landes wie Sichtweisen) besteht. Vielmehr geht es darum, eine histori(ographi) sche Artikulationsebene faktischer und narrativer Art zu finden, die die Konzeptualisierung und Repräsentation Kanadas in all seinen Dissonanzen, wechselnden Gleichgewichten, stürmischen Interdependenzen ermöglicht. Hierzu könnte der Begriff der „ canadianité" beitragen, der auf den Kern der historischen Identitätsbildung Kanadas verweist. Er könnte Träger einer Geschichtserzählung sei~<br>

Abstract: The tradition-historical method emerged at the turn of the century. It is used to understand biblical texts not only as products of the final author or redactor, but as documents which evolved over a period of time within a particular society. Consequently it grapples with the problems of how such texts refers to historical events, how one relates individual and collective religious experience and what authority these texts have in the lives of Christians today. Luke 12:35-48 is used to investigate the application of these ideas to practical exegesis.<br>

Abstract: Giuseppe Capograssi (1889-1956) was an important legal philosopher and had a lively influence on the development of legal studies. The centre of his reflections lay in his many investigations into the concept of experience, which aimed to supersede the prevalent orientation in Italy, focussed on vertexes, emphasizing instead the importance of practices, both on the theoretical level and in the analysis of legal activity and political reality. Capograssi therefore paid great attention to the relationship between state and society viewed in a dynamic and pluralist perspective. No less illuminating are Capograssi's investigations into the value of the constitution and the principle of legality. During the Fascist period, Capograssi upheld the values of individual liberty and democratic principles, seeing as indispensable the continual involvement of citizens in the development of political action. This perspective played a further, particularly important role in the "ideas of Capograssi", after the war and the advent of the republican legal order. According to Capograssi, more space needed to be given to social life and to the spiritual links on which political community is based. In this sense, Capograssi found the teachings of Catholicism fundamental. His Catholicism placed great emphasis on freedom and solidarity and contained a lively, underlying sense of the cultural and spiritual, inspired by the ideal of "charity".<br>

Abstract: Que veut-on dire lorsqu'on parle aujourd'hui de valeur de travail ? Une libre réflexion de philosophie économique sur la notion de valeur et sur sa famille - valeur absolue, valeur relative, valeur d'usage, valeur d'échange, évaluation, valorisation, etc. tente d'apporter ici une réponse. Avec, pour exemple privilégié, la doctrine de Marx sur le travail dans le capitalisme et dans la société communiste. What do we mean when we speak about the value of work? This article tries to provide an answer to this question by analysing the notions of value and its different forms: absolute and relative value, use value and exchange value, evaluation and the creation of value. It draws especially on Marx's doctrine of work in capitalism and the communist society.<br>

Abstract: Quelle forme de pluralisme permet une démocratie viable ? Y a-t-il compatibilité entre deux types de principes et de pratiques ? Après avoir éclairci les concepts de pluralisme, pluralisme culturel, pluralisme moral et démocratie, l'article analyse les dilemmes auxquels conduisent les visions abstraites du pluralisme culturel et de la démocratie dans le contexte contemporain en montrant la symétrie du dilemme de l'homme démocratique et du dilemme du croyant. L'examen des racines sociologiques du nouveau pluralisme culturel dans la « société inconnue » conduit à l'analyse des difficultés rencontrées par la constitution d'un « nous » politique qui ne peut pas seulement dépendre d'un code « fin » et procédural. Le rejet du pluralisme radical n'est pas le résultat d'un diktat philosophique ou sociologique mais d'une analyse contextuelle et d'une démarche prudentielle tenant compte des situations historiques et politiques concrètes. What kind of pluralism allows a viable democracy ? Are the two types of principles and practices compatible? After clarifying the concepts of pluralism, cultural pluralism, moral pluralism and democracy, the article analyzes the dilemmas posed by the abstract visions of cultural pluralism and democracy in the contemporary world, showing the symmetry between the dilemmas of the democrat and those of the believer. The examination of the sociological roots of the new cultural pluralism in the « unknown society » leads to an analysis of the difficulties of creating a political « us » which does not depend only on some teleological and procedural code. The rejection of radical pluralism is not the result of some philosophical or sociological dictum ; it emerges from a contextual analysis and a careful procedure which takes account of historical situations and concrete policies.<br>

Author(s): ARY ANTÓNIO<br>
Abstract: O presente texto surge do desejo de pensar a relação entre direito e ética. O diálogo entre estas duas áreas, sentido como um desafio premente para os dias de hoje, coloca em cena a relação da própria ciência jurídica com a sociedade onde se insere. A teoria da argumentação apresentada por autores como Jürgen Habermas, Chaïm Perelman e Paul Ricoeur permite iluminar de modo renovado esta temática clássica, superando a actual dificuldade em estabelecer uma ligação entre os domínios da ética e do direito. A reflexão parte de um primeiro enquadramento teórico, analisando o confronto histórico entre ética e direito e apontando caminhos de conciliação para a actualidade. Em seguida, apresentam-se algumas concretizações do papel da ética na prática jurídica, pelo seu contributo para a elaboração e aplicação do direito. Por último, o texto aborda possíveis contribuições do direito para a uma construção ética. This paper aims to discuss the relationship between law and ethics. The dialogue between both areas is a pressing and current challenge, which puts into play the relationship of legal science with the society. The theory of argumentation presented by authors such as Jürgen Habermas, Chaim Perelman and Paul Ricoeur, illuminates in a new way this classic issue, overcoming the present difficulties in establishing a link between the fields of ethics and law. The reflection starts with a theoretical framework, which analyzes the historical clash between the two approaches and points out a possible path of reconciliation. Then, it presents some embodiments of the role of ethics in legal practice, for its contribution to the elaboration and application of law. Finally, it discusses some possible contributions of law for the moral discourse.<br>

Abstract: O plural e conflituoso entendimento da legitimação da pena no Direito, tem origem nas diversas intencionalidades que lhe conferem sentido. Neste artigo são analisadas as intencionalidades mais relevantes, destacando os seus modelos justificativos: retribuição, reparação, prevenção, expiação, reabilitação e restauração (precedidas pela vingança, extrajudiríca). Para melhor análise destes são também consideradas a variável da temporalidade (passado, presente, futuro) e a variável dos sujeitos, que protagonizam a dinâmica do castigo (infractor, víctima, Estado, sociedade). Depois, num momento comparativo, destacam-se criticamente as confluencias e as oposições. Assim será possível concluir que a intencionalidade restauradora e a sua firme relativização do castigo é aquela que melhor consegue articular as variáveis de sentido-com os seus valores-, a temporalidade e os sujeitos, pelo que se mostra ser a referência mais positiva para a legitimização. Contudo, dada a sua precaridade, devido ao seu surgimento recente, impõe-se reforçá-la reflexivamente e prácticamente. The plural and conflictual understanding of the legitimacy of penalty in law stems from diverse intentionalities that constitute their respective meanings. This article analyzes the most relevant intentionalities. It seeks to highlight the models that justifies them: retribution, reparation, prevention, atonement, rehabilitation and restoration (preceded by vengeance, extrajudirical). To better analyze these models, the variable of temporality (past, present, future) and the variable of the subjects are also considered in view of the fact that they operate in the dynamics of punishment (offender, victim, State, society). Then, establishing comparisons, the confluences and oppositions are critically highlighted. In order to conclude that the restorative intentionality and its strong relativization of punishment is the one who can best articulate the variables of meaning -with their values, involving temporalit~<br>

Abstract: This article considers the changing relationship between Balzac and theory from the 1970s onwards when Balzac was a favoured, if disparaged, object of theorization, as in Barthes s S/Z. More recent critics, however, see the multi-layered énunciations of/in his texts as evidence of their ability to theorize their own relationship to history, society, sexuality — and literature. In the same way, moreover, as texts such as Sarrasine and Une passion dans le désert critique their own relation to literature, ostensibly theoretical Balzac texts such as Une théorie de la démarche turn theory into a form of fiction. Whether moving from literature to theory or from theory to literature, Balzac — or 'Balzac'/Balzac — is thus shown to be (at) a nexus of literature, theory and literary theory.<br>

Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and t~<br>

Abstract: The article explores how, given the absence of a proper public sphere, twentieth-century Hungarian social research began to use the notion of "reality" in populist socio-reports, the documentary films of the 1970s, and sociological debates. These discussions all shared the assumption that contemporary political elites ignored the "real" conditions of society. Thus it was the duty of social research (socio-reports or sociology proper) to reveal these facts in a manner that was free of ideology. Whereas in North America and Western Europe during the 1960s and 1970s the notion of a directly accessible "reality" had been thrown into question, in Hungary scholarship insisted on this kind of cognitive realism because of social and political reasons. As they argued, "reality" was to be interpreted not as a universal epistemological category, but according to particular terms of the sociology of knowledge. This article explores how the detection of "reality" and "facts" became an ethical vocation within these interrogatory frameworks.<br>

Abstract: Serge Lifar built his career during the 1930s, a decade crucial to understanding his 'années noires'-or 'black years', as the French historian Henry Rousso called the period of the German occupation of Paris (1940—1944). Lifar's powerful and respected position at the Paris Opéra, the social connections he had built and maintained and the psychological impact of exile: all these elements help clarify Lifar's accommodating attitude towards the German occupants of his adopted city. During the 1930s Lifar came to be accepted in French intellectual society as the 'heir' of Serge Diaghilev. Through his publications he made a powerful contribution to the process by which Diaghilev's Ballets Russes assumed its paramount position in the development of modern ballet, a process set in motion by the impresario himself. Lifar played this role chiefly in France. In the English-speaking world, where relatively few of his books appeared in translation, other writers served to canonise the Diaghilev endeavour, albeit for somewhat different ends. A list of Lifar's publications in Russian and other languages (French above all) displays the growing influence of his actions and authority, the power of his connections (inherited primarily from Diaghilev), and his relentless will to overcome the problems of emigration as he secured not only success as a dancer and choreograph but also a public reputation as an intellectual. The recent discovery of new evidence has led to the identification of the respected Pushkin authority Modeste Hofmann as the writer whose unacknowledged work enabled Lifar to establish himself as an historian. This evidence, provided by Hofmann's grandsons André and Vladimir Hofmann, raises serious questions about the authority of Lifar's books. An interplay of subjective relationships is woven into the texture of these narratives in which survival and ambition, a paternal attitude and filial respect, exist in constant tension. Neither the making of these books nor the~<br>

Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138215<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Voelz Johannes<br>
Abstract: Combining a historical with a theoretical perspective, this essay begins by reconstructing Ralph Waldo Emerson's evolving theory of recognition and the central role it played for his concept of 'self-reliance.' Initially having adopted the theorizations of recognition developed by Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, Emerson came to articulate the idea of self-reliance by way of developing an alternative approach to recognition, in which the source allocating recognition is neither society nor an inborn moral sense, but rather the transcendentally conceptualized self. Emerson's shift towards self-recognition poses questions seldom asked in the contemporary debate on recognition. Moving beyond a reconstructive aim, one such question is considered in the article's second part: What role does recognition come to play in the act of reading? Taking Emerson's own essays as a case in point, the author argues that the aesthetic experience afforded by non-fictional texts can be understood as a facilitator of self-recognition—as a continuous process of imaginarily experiencing the enlargement of the self. This process intersects with dynamics of social recognition, producing a 'dual economy of recognition.' The article concludes by challenging the assumption found in currently dominant paradigms of recognition which assumes that recognition can come to successful completion. Conceived as a dual economy, the article argues, recognition is to the contrary constitutively open-ended.<br>

Abstract: This paper is an attempt to explore the continuing relevance of Nietzsche's genealogical analysis of Western rationality to the sociology of knowledge. While Nietzsche is often neglected in classical sociological theory textbooks, this paper argues that Nietzsche has a very significant contribution to sociological theory especially in the field of knowledge production. Recent sociologists are now acknowledging this tradition. Hence this paper discusses how the basic tenets of Nietzsche's critique of Western metaphysics and positivism can be harnessed to create a powerful critique of contemporary sociological understanding of knowledge construction and its legitimation in society. Some of these themes are discussed at the end of the paper especially in relation to Philippine sociology.<br>

Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138275<br>
Date: 1 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): de Marco Alessandra<br>
Abstract: The present paper investigates Don DeLillo's 1972 End Zone, arguing that football is a metaphor for war and that DeLillo's analysis of football and its culture effectively constitutes a critique of the war mentality undergirding American society. In this novel DeLillo meditates on the historical process that historian Michael S. Sherry calls the "militarization" (xi) of the USA and that, since the 1930s, turned the country into a military and economic superpower allowing a war mentality to enter deep into the grain of American culture. The essay will read DeLillo's focus on language against Nicholas Abraham and Maria Torok's psychoanalytical theories on demetaphorization as the linguistic counterpart of melancholia and against Herbert Marcuse's notion of functional language as a linguistic behavior that facilitates the annihilation of critical thinking. Both functional language and demetaphorization allow militarization to enforce its own discourse. Suffering from melancholia, the novel's protagonists fall prey to incorporation, a process whereby they disavow death as the product of war and, with it, pain, suffering, and destruction. As a result, the novel offers a cautionary tale about the consequences arising from an excessive exaltation of war as a means through which a nation seeks to affirm its "apotheosis" (End Zone 162).<br>

Publisher: Becker Associates<br>
Issue: i40141579<br>
Date: 10 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Zembrzycki Stacey<br>
Abstract: Thousands of child Holocaust survivors arrived in Montreal, Quebec, between 1947 and 1952, looking to remake their lives, rebuild their families, and recreate their communities. Integration was not seamless. As survivors struggled to carve spaces for themselves within the established Canadian Jewish community, their difficult wartime stories were neither easily received nor understood. When remembering this period, survivors tend to speak about employment, education, dating, integration into both the pre-war Jewish community and the larger society, and, perhaps most importantly, the creation of their own social worlds within existing and new frameworks. Forged in a transitional and tumultuous period in Quebec's history, these social worlds, as this article demonstrates, are an important example of survivor agency. Although survivors recall the ways in which Canadian Jews helped them adjust to their new setting, by organizing a number of programs and clubs within various spaces—Jeanne Mance House, the Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association, and the Jewish Public Library—they also speak about how they forged their own paths upon arriving in this postwar city. For instance, survivors created the New World Club, an informal and grassroots social organization where they could prioritize their own needs and begin to be understood as people, and not just survivors. Establishing the interconnections between these formal and informal social worlds, and specifically, how survivors navigated them, is central to understanding the process through which they were able to move beyond their traumatic pasts and start over. Nightmares and parties are parts of the same story, and here the focus is on the memories of young survivors who prioritized their social worlds. Des milliers d'enfants survivants de l'Holocauste sont arrivés à Montréal, au Québec, entre 1947 et 1952, cherchant à refaire leurs vies, reconstruire leurs familles et recréer leurs communautés.

Abstract: Cet article commence par definir ce qu'est un « protestant » et ce qu'est un « intellectuel ». Puis il s'ttache à retracer la démarche d'un certain nombre d'intellectuels protestants en deux temps, avant et après 1914. Pour chacune de ces periodes il présente les lieux d'expression des intellectuels protestants, les principales figures et, enfin, il retrace leurs thèmes de réflexions. Cela lui permet de proposer une sorte de « type idéal » de l'intellectuel protestant durant les années 1870-1914; pour les annees 1914-1940 l'image de ces intellectuels est plus éclatée puisqu'ils se voient dans l'obligation de repenser leur place dans une société française déstabilisée par la guerre. The article begins with definitions of « Protestant » and of « intellectual ». It then traces the activities of a certain number of Protestant intellectuals in two periods, before and after 1914. For each of these periods, the channels of communication used by Protestant intellectuals, the leading figures and, finally, the major intellectual preoccupations are presented. What emerges is a sort of « ideal type » of Protestant intellectual during the period 1870-1914; for the Years 1914-1940 the image of the intellectuals is more diversified, since they find themselves obliged to rethink their place within a French society destabilized by the war. Dieser Beitrag wird mit einer Begriffsbestimmung eröffnet : Was ist ein « Protestant », was ist ein « Intellektueller ». Sodann wird der Entwicklung einiger protestantischer Intellektueller im Zeitraum vor und nach 1914 nachgegangen. Für beide werden die Orte und die Personen, die wichtige Rolle gespielt haben, und schließlich die Themen ihres Nachdenkens beschrieben. So gelingt es, eine Art Idealtyp des protestantischen Intellektuellen während der Zeit von 1870-1914 vorzustellen, während dies für die Jahre von 1914-1940 erheblich schwieriger ist : Das Bild der Intellektuellen ist in dieser Periode erheblich vielfaltiger, da sie ihre Stellung in e~<br>

Publisher: Sameeksha Trust<br>
Issue: i402288<br>
Date: 4 26, 1968<br>
Author(s): Cohn Lata<br>
Abstract: Several debates arose in the nineteenth century on the status of women in India in the context of determining an appropriate colonial policy on such matters as "sati" which were seen to mark the depressed position of women in society. The reform of these practices was held to be part of the regenerating mission of colonisation. The most sensational and the first of these debates concerned the outlawing of "sati". The literature on "sati" (and on social reform) of the period has largely adopted the framework of modernisation theory. The paper argues that the characterisation of the official debate as one between 'preservationists' and impatient westerners obscures a number of important issues. For instance, rather than argue for the outlawing of "sati" as a cruel and barbarous act, officials in favour of abolition were at pains to illustrate that the abolition would be consonant with the principle of upholding tradition. By treating the debates on "sati" as a discourse and examining its production the article contests the conclusions on "sati" drawn by colonial officials.<br>

Author(s): Ray Sudhir<br>
Abstract: Seeking to understand the manifest in relation to the implicit and the unstated-the unconscious of the conscious-this paper focuses on the elusiveness of social consciousness in a transitional colonial society with a rich heritage of its own. The issue chosen for examination is that of widow marriage and the period is confined to the last three decades of the nineteenth century. Progressively convulsing the upper caste, mainly middle class, Hindu society, the issue was one that epitomised the interplay of conflicting emotions, values and ideas that characterised men's consciousness about women during this seminal phase of Indian history.<br>

Abstract: Psychology has uncritically adopted the individual person as its object of study without examining the concept and role of personhood within contemporary society and Western culture more generally. We examine three perspectives that challenge this familiar and unexamined object of our disciplinary inquiry: (1 ) Critical Theory's concept of the bourgeois individual as psychology's subject of ideology; (2) Poststructuralism's challenge to the concept of personhood as an integrated and self-present center of consciousness and action; (3) System Theory's alternative epistemology in which relations rather than entities have primacy. Each perspective introduces a concept of personhood that significantly differs from our present understanding of psychology's subject and that lays the foundation for a new subject of psychological inquiry: a multicentered, multidimensional subject.<br>

Abstract: O traballio da cineasta Tereza Trautman foi perpassado pela emergencia das reivindicacóes de emancipação e igualdade para as mulheres, principalmente na década de 1970. Enquanto a sociedade e monter as mulheres em seus papéis privados, tradicionalmente estabelecidos, Tereza Trautman pegou a càmera e buscou criar novas representações para elas no cinema. De maneira radicai, seu trabalho adquiriu agenciamento, questionando de modo irreversível o lugar das mulheres, na proposta de uma nova sociedade. A tesoura da censura atravessou definitivamente sua carreira e a cineasta viu, um após o outro, seus projetos profissionais naufragarem. Os homens que eu tive, seu filme mais polèmico, está no centro do interesse desta entrevista, que abre espaço para uma narrativa, que é também um desabafo de urna geracóo de mulheres que buscaram estrategias de sobrevivencia profissionai e de expressào durante os anos de ditadura. Filmmaker Tereza Trautman's work was crossed by the emergency of emancipation and equality for women vindications, mainly in the 70's. While Brazilian military government and its censorship organism tried to moralize society and to keep women in their private role traditionally established, Tereza Trautman took the camera and sought to create new representations for them into the cinema. In a radical way, her work acquired agency, questioning in an irreversible way women's place, in the purpose of a new society. The censorship scissor crossed definitely her carrier and the director saw, one by one, her professional projects sinking down. Os homens que eu tive, her more polemic film, is in the main stream of this interview, which opens a space to a narrative that is also an outflow of a women's generation which looked for professional survival and expression strategies during the Brazilian dictatorship years.<br>

Publisher: Society for Applied Anthropology<br>
Issue: i40172767<br>
Date: 4 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): BAHR HOWARD M.<br>
Abstract: Disciplinary specialties and boundaries may impede as well as facilitate understanding. Standard scholarly orientations to the study of Navajos and other ethnic populations manifest many biases of ethnocentrism and a general tendency to stereotype. Specific observer-related tendencies to distort are noted, among them tendencies to understate social dynamics and the degree to which Navajos are functioning parts of wider social systems. The literature on Navajos is a product of changing tools in the hands of changing observers applied to changing communities in the context of ongoing change in the wider societies of both observer and observed. It is argued that "multiplying glimpses," or increasing the number and types of observers and the variety of disciplines and paradigms represented, may reduce observer and position biases that distort existing views of Navajo society. An overview of the massive literature on the Navajo leads to the identification of 21 distinct genres. These genres and other Navajo texts may profitably be viewed in the perspective of textual analysis, broadly defined. Issues of meaning and interpretation are considered, including the reality-language-text nexus, construction of texts, text-context patterns, and the interaction of text, situation, and analyst in interpretation. Appropriate use of existing texts is socially responsible "green research" and should not be professionally stigmatized. It substitutes resource-efficient recycling of discarded and underanalyzed texts for the old expensive, obtrusive colonial patterns of work.<br>

Publisher: SAGE<br>
Issue: i40178171<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Johnson Nuala C<br>
Abstract: Drawing on the theoretical insights of Paul Ricoeur this paper investigates the geographies of public remembrance in a post-conflict society. In Northern Ireland, where political divisions have found expression through acts of extreme violence over the past 30 years, questions of memory and an amnesty for forgetting have particular resonance both at the individual and societal level, and render Ricoeur's framework particularly prescient. Since the signing of the Belfast Agreement in 1998, initiating the Peace Process through consociational structures, discovering a nomenclature and set of practices which would aid in the rapprochement of a deeply divided society has presented a complex array of issues. In this paper I examine the various practices of public remembrance of the 1998 bombing of Omagh as a means of understanding how memory-spaces evolve in a post-conflict context. In Omagh there were a variety of commemorative practices instituted and each, in turn, adopted a different contour towards achieving reconciliation with the violence and grief of the bombing. In particular the Garden of Light project is analysed as a collective monument which, with light as its metaphysical centre, invited the populace to reflect backward on the pain of the bombing while at the same time enabling the society to look forward toward a peaceful future where a politics of hope might eclipse a politics of despair.<br>

Author(s): Davies Oliver<br>
Abstract: In this paper I set out a phenomenology of social transformation, based on an analysis of the distinctively religious form of communication which underlies the trans-generational and trans-cultural transmission of world traditions, taking Confucianism and Christianity as their representatives. A phenomenological analysis of their communicative structure allows the possibility of a better understanding of what can be learnt from them in the context of contemporary debates in both China and the West on the relations between religion, ethics and politics. This analysis suggests that the ethical consistency of belief and act, which is the necessary condition for the engendering of long-term solidarity in religious community, has significant implications for ethics in politics, and especially for the legitimacy of representational leadership as a focal point for change in society. The paper concludes that the historical experience of world religions can offer new insights into the nature of political leadership and representation in today's globalised world and that the appropriate locus for this inquiry is the present negotiation and re-negotiation of relations between China and the West.<br>

Author(s): Gruenler Curtis<br>
Abstract: The works of Lewis and Girard share several central interests but seem divided by opposite views of myth. Lewis' novelistic retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, however, provides a bridge: it depicts an ancient society organized around sacrifice and myth as understood in Girard's cultural theory and tells a Girardian story of conversion, in which the narrator discovers the imitative and rivalrous nature of her desire. Her rivalry and reconciliation with the story's true god carries the novel beyond Girardian myth to a contrary kind of narrative identified with fairy stories, which can extend Girard's approach to Christian conversion.<br>

Author(s): Lake Christina Bieber<br>
Abstract: In this essay I argue that Carvers story "A Small, Good Thing" can be read as an illustration of Albert Borgmann's argument that contemporary technological society conceals grace by encouraging the illusion than an individual can exert total control over her environment. The story shows how radical contingency punctures this illusion and offers potential for grace-filled communion with others through humble acts of hospitality. These humble acts—the small, good things of life together—parallel the giving and receiving of grace that takes place during the Eucharist.<br>

Abstract: Cet article se propose de lire l'Ancien Testament comme littérature de crise à partir d'un paradigme fourni par la sociologie moderne. Trois attitudes principales caractérisent les réactions intellectuelles face à la situation de crise: l'attitude «utopique», l'attitude «nostalgique» et l'attitude «scientifique». Ces trois attitudes permettent de décrire les grands courants idéologiques du peuple hébreu face au drame national de l'exil babylonien. Pour les prophètes, l'exil apparaît comme un temps intermédiaire annonçant une ère de salut. Les milieux sacerdotaux présentent le retour aux institutions religieuses passées comme la seule solution à la crise. Les intellectuels de l'école deutéronomiste cherchent à comprendre les raisons du drame de l'exil sans immédiatement proposer de solutions pour le futur. La société juive de l'époque exilique, puis post-exilique est caractérisée par la cohabitation et le dialogue de ces différentes perspectives. Cette cohabitation peut être proposée comme paradigme pour une approche de la crise en société moderne. This article proposes the reading of the Old Testament as crisis literature according to a paradigm of modern sociology. Three principle attitudes typify intellectual reactions to crisis: the "utopic", the "nostalgic" and the "scientific". These can help us describe the main ideological currents of the Hebrew nation faced with the drama of the Babylonian exile. For the prophets, the exile is an interim announcing a time of salvation. For the priestly circle, the return to former religious institutions is the only solution to the crisis. The intellectual Deuteronomists seek to understand the reasons for the tragedy of the exile without proposing immediate solutions. Jewish society at the time of the exile and after it is distinguished by the cohabitation and dialogue between these different perspectives. This cohabitation may serve as a paradigm for an approach to crises in modern society.<br>

Author(s): Schafer Cyril<br>
Abstract: This article elucidates the personalized, life-centered funeral by analyzing the development of specialized funeral functionaries and their construction of celebratory post-mortem rituals in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Drawing on participant observation and ethnographic interviews, this essay argues that secular celebrants accentuate the significance of individuality and narrative identity, but also link components of the life-centered funeral to memorialization and mourner identity. Celebrants emphasized a need to re-discover ritual in contemporary society and grounded this rediscovery in a late-modern context that not only amalgamated authenticity, intuition, and emotional empression, but incorporated central elements of Pakeha (non-Maori) New Zealand indentity.<br>

Issue: i40183934<br>

Author(s): LANGUE Frédérique<br>
Abstract: Le Venezuela de la fin de la période coloniale se distingue sur bien des points des autres régions d'Amérique espagnole: une prospérité économique flatteuse fondée sur le commerce du cacao et que confirment les réformes bourboniennes de la fin du siècle; une configuration sociale contrastée mais extrêmement fluide et une aristocratie créole, les mantuanos, dont le discours et les généalogies sociales sont repris à leur compte par les autres groupes sociaux émergents, notamment par le monde des pardos (métis); mais également l'une des révolutions d'Indépendance les plus violentes du continent. Les sensibilités métisses vont de pair avec une mémoire partagée, au quotidien ou lors d'événements bien particuliers tels que visitas ou procès. D'autant qu'un autre élément contribue à faire de cette société métisse une société en mouvement: les femmes, quel que soit leur statut social ou ethnique. Transgressions des normes sociales et morales par les aristocrates mantuanas, revendications des pardas se voulant nobles et défendant leur « honneur »: se situant dans la perspective de l'histoire des sensibilités, cette étude tentera de faire le point sur ce métissage des représentations, ainsi que sur la subversion du modèle culturel hispanique qui en découle dans les pratiques effectives. At the end of the colonial period, Venezuela is quite different from any other regions of Spanish America: first an economic prosperity which benefits from the cacao trade and strengthened by the Bourbon reforms at the very end of the century; a very contrasted but fluid social configuration; a creole aristocracy, the mantuanos, whose words and social genealogies are retrieved by other emergent social groups, such as the pardos (mestizos, half-caste); one of the most violent revolutions of Independence in the mainland. Hybrid sensibilities emerged along with a shared memory at the everyday level or at specific events such as visitas or trials. In this half-caste society, women, whatever their ~<br>

Article Title: 'Not to be riten': The Mormon Temple Rite as Oral Canon<br>
Publisher: Department of Religious Studies, University of Pittsburgh<br>
Issue: i40184391<br>
Date: 7 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: The manner in which the LDS Church administers its temple rite constitutes a strategic use of the conventions of an oral tradition in a modern, literate society. Three effects of this strategy are considered. First, refusing to make a text of the rite available and insisting that its specific content not be revealed or otherwise subjected to discursive thought sustains the rite's canonical authority as immutable truth, notwithstanding its periodic mutation. Secondly, the conventions of oral tradition structure the relationships created by the ritual and constitute a principal means by which the Church's historic separatism is maintained. Finally, these conventions when applied to the temple rite maximize ritual's capacity to adapt the canon to the needs of successive generations of the faithful while minimizing skepticism and schism.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur se propose de vérifier l'affirmation de Lavelle selon laquelle l'ouvrage de 1937, De l'Acte, se serait progressivement développé comme une synthèse complète de sa philosophie. Or il existe, à l'état dactylographié, une version antérieure de ce livre, qui permet de comprendre combien l'aisance presque trop grande des analyses de 1937 cache en fait une élaboration lente et un effort continu. La version inédite insiste sur l'intemporalité transcendantale de l'acte, et sur l'impersonnalité de l'acte fondateur de toutes les existences personnelles. Ces thèses seront abandonnées en 1937. On analyse ensuite l'article « Être et Acte » et la conférence de la société française de philosophie sur « Acte créateur et acte réflexif », où est discutée la position de Jean Nabert. Les thèses de De l'Acte montrent une progression de l'identité de l'être et de l'acte (dans l'acte d'être) jusqu'à l'acte en sa forme la plus haute, l'acte d'amour. Situer cette œuvre capitale implique qu'on ait bien compris l'interprétation du sensible comme de la donnée matérielle qui doit être spiritualisée. L'expérience extérieure du sensible s'oppose à l'expérience intérieure de l'esprit. Et l'acte est l'œuvre de l'être spirituel. L'ontologie dynamique de Lavelle est une affirmation de la liberté humaine comme participation à l'acte créateur divin. Divin ou humain, l'être est subjectif parce que libre. Ainsi Lavelle s'inscrit dans la tradition platonicienne moderne, celle d'Avicenne d'abord, celle de Hegel ensuite. The author proposes to verify Lavelle's assertion that the 1937 work, De l'Acte, would be progressively developed as a complete synthesis of his philosophy. Now there exists in typewritten state an earlier version of this book, which allows us to see the extent to which the almost excessive facility of analyses of 1937 in fact conceals a slow development and a continuous effort. The unedited version insists upon the transcendental atemporality of act, and upon the impersonality of ~<br>

Author(s): Williams Wai Chee<br>
Abstract: Does a literary text remain the same object across time? This essay answers no and bases a defense of literature on that answer. Temporal extension, a phenomenon neglected in contemporary literary studies, makes some meanings unrecoverable and others newly possible. A text endures as a nonintegral survivor, an echo of what it was and of what it might become, its resonance changing with shifts in interpretive contexts. Since this resonance cannot be addressed by synchronic historicism, I propose an alternative, diachronic historicism, inspired especially by scientific theories on background noise, by Einstein's account of the relativity of simultaneity, and by critiques of the visual bias in Western epistemology. I try to theorize the text as a temporal continuum, thick with receding and incipient nuances, exercising the ears of readers in divergent ways and yielding its words to contrary claims. Literature thus encourages a semantic democracy that honors disagreement as a crucial fact of civil society.<br>

Abstract: This paper challenges the common assumption that the attention which modern literary theory pays to the textual aspects of literature is achieved at the expense of humanistic and moral concerns. It starts by outlining how modern literary theory differs epistemologically from the traditional critical approaches to literature. Traditional critical theory was developed in the defense of poetry against Plato's accusations, real or imagined, and this informed both its critical practice and its concept of man. It established its epistemology on an aesthetic, moral, social, philosophical or scientific basis in a manner that encumbered literature with the concepts of man inherent in them. In contrast, modern literary theory started from a different premise: instead of seeking to justify literature and its moral relevance, it strove to identify its literariness and the dynamics of its structure by using the disciplines of semiotics and linguistics. It posited the text as an autonomous entity and a complete structure aware of its existence in a society of texts with which it conducts a profoundly intertextual dialogue. As an autonomous structure, the literary work is independent of other social or philosophical constructs and thus capable of conducting a meaningful dialogue with them. The paper elaborates the various conceptual frameworks of Russian formalism, intertextuality, structuralism and deconstruction in order to examine their implicit assumptions about man. It shows how the autonomous and dialogical nature of the literary work in its Bakhtinian sense are relevant to the concept of man inherent in modern literary theory. In its elaboration of this concept, the paper shows how it was developed in conflict with the hierarchical nature of traditional, ethical and philosophical values. It illustrates also the relevance of autonomy, self-regulation, free-play and fair representation inherent in many concepts of modern literary theory to the question of human rights. The qu~<br>

Abstract: Shikhat are female performers in Moroccan society whose singing and dancing are central to all festivity, including rites of passage like marriage ceremonies and birth and circumcision celebrations. Despite their centrality, however, shikhat are socially marginal due to the license that they exhibit both in performance and in their "off-stage" lives. This article examines the artistic and bodily competencies of the shikhat as they articulate some of the more powerful metaphors of Moroccan identity, extending ultimately from embodiments of shame to embodiments of the one heterogeneous nation.<br>

Abstract: This paper is an advocacy for the employment of psychoanalytical concepts within sociological theorizing about the individual. Through an exposition of Freud's views on the development of intra-psychic structure and a critique of Parson's reduction of psychoanalysis to a branch of learning theory, I attempt to show that the sociological approach to the individual is implicitly behavioural and imprisoned in a series of assumptions which, among other things, treats subjectivity as epiphenomenal and identity as an unmediated reflection of some external reality. In contrast, psychoanalysis presents to us a picture of the individual as flawed and ambivalent in his relation to society, formed by but at odds with the demands of culture. In particular, the psychoanalytic concept of identification reveals that the acquisition of identity is a hard-won achievement marked by the renunciation of lost and forbidden objects. I argue, following Freud and Lacan, that the ego, far from being an agency of reason, somehow directly 'plugged into' reality, constitutes itself in the fantasied image of another and that the quality of this identification crucially affects the way the world is experienced and believed by the individual. This argument is elaborated through a discussion of Peter Berger's remarks on the social causes of identity crisis which, when set against the work of object-relations theorists on those suffering from disturbances of identity such as, for example, schizoid personalities, are shown to be both superficial and misleading. I conclude the paper by arguing that while psychoanalysis can enhance our understanding of the way in which the individual is formed by and through culture it also cautions us against making simple generalizations about the impact of culture upon the person, showing that the individual never submits himself unequivocally to its demands and interdicts.<br>

Article Title: Strangers to Themselves: How Interactants Are other than They Are<br>
Publisher: Routledge Journals for the London School of Economics and Political Science<br>
Issue: i225019<br>
Date: 12 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Travers Andrew<br>
Abstract: Analysis of a sequence of literary frames suggests that a heightened experience of interactional reality is also anomically constructive of the frame. In each of 16 frames, Durkheimian anomie neither destroys the frame's integrity nor renders its routine grounds unintelligible, as Goffman and Garfinkel would claim it must. Paradoxically, anomie ritually intensifies the frame. The selves in the paper's sequence of highly ritualized frames are not routine selves, however. They are 'strangers to themselves'. The analysis shows how Mead's 'I' can re-emerge from Goffman's ritual thinking - where the 'I' is collapsed into an interactionally-bound 'me' - as an original manifestation of great importance to interactants, and therefore to society as well. (Parenthetically it is also argued that selves need an element of rituality in order to be selflike and that it is interactional rituality which guarantees the evolution of social life beyond given frames, corpora, cultural repertoires, and collective representations.) The idea that interactants can be strangers to themselves is an advance on Goffman's and Garfinkel's accounts of interactional selfhood, but one that problematizes the prosecution of the interaction sociology that Goffman and Garfinkel pioneer, since strangers to themselves disappear in normal sociological appearances.<br>

Author(s): Gregory Gregory J.<br>
Abstract: Geography of religion is an important subfield of cultural geography yet its theoretical foundations remain undebated. Geographers should become more aware of other approaches to the study of religion. Whereas phenomenological awareness of the deepness of the religious quest in the human psyche is important, geographers are primarily concerned with religion's societal expression and hence will gain valuable insights through the adoption of an historical materialist approach to the study of religious institutions in class society.<br>

Author(s): Zoetmulder J. Joseph<br>
Abstract: Most students of Javanese culture and society have used a few crucial native terms and concepts to analyze aspects of traditional etiquette, statecraft, and mysticism. A unitary approach to priyayi ethics, aesthetics, and power is developed here by synthesizing themes common to earlier treatments. Several points of disagreement with Geertz's (1960, 1973) descriptions are discussed in conclusion as a way of drawing out lexicographic aspects of the methodology of interpretive anthropology.

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i226373<br>
Date: 8 1, 1972<br>
Author(s): Yates Ellen<br>
Abstract: Adopting a reflexive approach, this article interprets a recently created healing ritual in Brittany that integrates local 19th-century notions about the curative powers of prehistoric monuments with diverse elements from non-Breton sources. Parallels are noted between this New Age therapy and witchcraft, an older explanatory framework for illness and misfortune in Brittany. The therapeutic discourse associated with the ritual draws on the past and on exotic cultures to construct a meaningful cosmology. Therefore, this discourse--like the New Age movement as a whole--has much in common with anthropology, which, it is suggested, provides Western society with an ordered vision of the world.

Abstract: Using a form of narrative analysis, I explore how marriage in contemporary China influences people's identity formation as "men with disabilities." In particular, I examine how local practices of marriage exclusion shape the definition, marginalization, and experience of men who have trouble walking. This discussion is more phenomenological than most previous accounts of men's experiences of marriage in Chinese Society. [marriage, disability, identity, body, manhood, narrative, China]<br>

Abstract: 'Positivism,' it seems, is a movement that cultural anthropology can do without. But what is positivism, who are these positivists, and what precisely are their sins? Notwithstanding appearances to the contrary, the image of positivism in cultural anthropology is comparatively coherent and the criticism directed at it relatively well founded. What is dubious is the conclusion to which many critics think it leads: that the methods of the natural sciences are inappropriate to the study of human culture and society.<br>

Author(s): Yee Pamela M.<br>
Abstract: Pamela M. Yee is a doctoral candidate and Provost's Fellow in the English department at the University of Rochester. Her research interests include late-medieval romance and dream-visions, confessional narratives, medieval medicine, cognition, psychology, affect theory, trauma studies, and the medical humanities; a secondary strand of her scholarship includes all things Arthurian and a nascent interest in medievalism within pop culture. Her dissertation explores confessional tropes as narrative, dialogic, and patient-centered healing in late Middle English secular literature. She has recently published articles in
            ArthurianaandThe Once and Future Classroom, and has a forthcoming review inMedievally Speaking. In summer 2013, she curated an exhibit titled “Eugène Vinaver's MagnificentMalory” for the Rossell Hope Robbins Library. Her budding interest in Gower studies has resulted in a recent flurry of activity: her co-organizing of the 3rdInternational Congress of the John Gower Society in summer 2014 and her selection by JGS as the graduate student representative for the 2016 John Hurt Fisher Prize Committee. At her home institution, she serves as Assistant Editor of the TEAMS Middle English Texts Series, works as a library assistant for the Robbins Library, contributes to theCamelot Project, and teaches in the Writing, Speaking, and Argument Program.

Abstract: Public history sites like the West Indian Museum of Panama and the Miraflores Visitors Center have different approaches to narrating the Panama Canal story, ranging from tales of man’s triumph over nature and celebratory discourses of nationalist victories, to testimonies of the racial histories silenced by official renderings of the past. Given the important role of museums as educational institutions, sites that inform public opinion, and representational platforms for national tourism, this article explores the relationship these institutions forge between visitors and canal history. Through a comparative analysis of the narratives and experiential strategies at each site, I evaluate the degree to which Panamanians are cast as spectators in grandiose histories of triumph, or as agents, responsible for shaping the past, present and future. In contrast to these physical sites, I consider how The Society of Friends of the West Indian Museum of Panama constructs a living past through memory practices that challenge the petrified histories traditionally found in museums.<br>

Abstract: The literary field in Africa came into emergence as a result of a collective yearning for lesser dependency on the symbolic constraints the Western center is forcing on its margins. Granted that a work sets itself up by setting up its own context, and that the African context stands out as one where oral literature is still alive in society, the manifestation of expressive forms associated with traditional literature in a novel must carry heavy weight in an interpretation of African works. For that reason, this essay will argue that, through her “smuggling” of narrative forms drawn from oral literature, Aminata Sow Fall's fiction testifies to an oral discursivity at work in the novel. The archi-textual approach focuses on various strategies the Senegalese woman writer resorts to in order to inscribe, deep within her creative work in French, a traditional universe hitherto conveyed through oral forms of expression.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>

Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: It is not new for poets to renovate the language of poetry by appropriating or sending up enervated, devalued language as a way to critique discourses of power. It may even be one of the oldest methods of literary innovation, considering the Roman appropriation of Greek literature. But some contemporary, experimental poets explicitly link mass production of capitalist consumer products and the logic of the copy
         
               to the production of art in a Benjaminian vein. De la Torre refers to the age of mechanical reproduction in an epigraph to “Photos While U Wait,” which she borrows from Jacques Barzun's introduction to Gustave Flaubert's110
            Dictionary of Accepted Ideas: “The cliché, as its name indicates, is the metal plate that reproduces the same image mechanically without end.”
               Poems written under constraint and composed of recombined, appropriated text at times thematize the activity of appropriation itself as endemic to capitalism. The supermarket is a popular trope for the destruction of authenticity, disenfranchisement, and advertising's interpellation of the subject. A discursive tone dotted with imperatives mark these poems, as they echo the language of consumerism. African American poet Harryette Mullen's111
            S*PeRM**K*T, included in herRecyclopedia, is structured according to the logic of supermarket aisles (“sort of like your shopping list”), and the missing letters in its title spell outu are, as in, “you are what you eat,” as Mullen explains in an author's note. “I was thinking about domestication, about the role of women, women as consumers, women having supposed power as consumers but also being disempowered in other ways…. You can't necessarily buy who you really want to be. You have to buy the available images,” she writes in an accompanying statement.
               Mullen, like Hayes, also connects her poetics to that of a woman poet predecessor. Her books112

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Over the years SPEP outgrew campus meetings and moved into convention hotels, just as it seemed to outgrow phenomenology and existentialism, leading to a big discussion, sometime in the eighties I believe, over whether to rename it the Society for Continental Philosophy. This, of course, was the second dispute about the naming of the society. Bob Scharff tells us about the first dispute in his paper, when the original title could have resulted in SEPP rather than SPEP. The second proposal could have changed us from SPEP to SCP. I was involved in those discussions, I believe, as a member of the Executive Committee, but I don't remember why the original name was retained. Maybe because SCP would have been too hard to pronounce. Certainly phenomenology and existentialism never disappeared from the scene, so maybe it was thought that we would have to adopt an acronym like SPEPPMCTHF. Our society got much bigger as well as more complex compared with its humble origins, in an incremental growth and transformation we didn't always notice if we attended every year.<br>

Abstract: Yet, as much as the people I met, it was the intellectual atmosphere of those early SPEP conferences that made perhaps the deepest impression on me. As I still remember them now, those meetings were filled with a sense of experiential enthusiasm and theoretical disorder. A few of us recall, as a highlight of the second business meeting, an impassioned plea from Gurwitsch explaining why our new gathering could not be called the Society for Existential Philosophy and Phenomenology.
      
            Concocted in haste in order to have a label to use for the original meeting invitations, this title had innocently committed a cosmic mistake. It permitted the adjective2
         existentialto modify not just “philosophy” but “phenomenology” as well. Factical Dasein was thus allowed to encroach upon the transcendental ego, and this simply would not do. And so, after much animated discussion, we officially became SPEP instead of SEPP. “Phenomenology” was mercifully liberated from the taint of historicism, psychologism, and the anthropological pull of the natural attitude, and “existential philosophy” now stood properly alone but trailing after what some saw as the truest and deepest of all the sciences—but at least still called “existential philosophy” instead of “existentialism,” as Gurwitsch had initially suggested.<br>

Abstract: The Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP), as a fifty-year-old movement of both phenomenologically and existentially disposed philosophers, may regard Franz Brentano (1838–1917) as at least a grandfather. For many SPEP members, including myself until very recently, Brentano has been known in a rather vague and inauthentic empty intention merely as the teacher of Husserl, foremost in regard to some aspects of the doctrine of intentionality. Upon closer inspection this is pitifully shortsighted, and I have come to believe that the phenomenologist's lineage to the grandfather is not to be forgotten and that retrieving it may bring out not only differences but surprising enrichments that will emerge through wrestling with the differences.
         
                  As merely one example, I want to discuss Brentanian propositions regarding the individuality of the I.1<br>

Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Finally, we come to the
            now, the fourth phase of critical theory. September 11, the resurgence of religion, the clash of civilizations, globalization—these are the issues not only confronting the world but also confronting critical theory. Although some might argue with this assumption, it appears to me that critical theory, given its origins in the German enlightenment, has a vested interest in a certain theory of modernity. Whether one uses the Kantian model fromWhat Is Enlightenment?the Hegelian model based on a certain philosophy of history, Marx's idea of the social evolution of society, Weber's idea of the disenchantment of the world, or Horkheimer's classic distinction between traditional and critical theory, critical theory manifests a distinct orientation to modernity that links modernization with secularization. My guess is that the great challenge to critical theory that has to deal with the rise of religion, on the one hand, and globalization, on the other, will be whether or not it can keep a critical perspective alive or whether in the future we will look back at critical theory as just another theory of modernity.<br>

Abstract: I believe that in its twenty-fifth year SPEP brought to fruition a movement of incremental postmodern developments and made a full turn out of the modern orientation of its origin. That turn opened a new era for SPEP. Its origin had given SPEP life and vision and played a large role in transforming professional philosophy in the United States as it also transformed into a society that no one could have imagined in 1961.<br>

Abstract: I want to conclude with one more argument from my own work. I have very often argued that philosophers of technology, regarding the expectations of society and their own traditions and habits, may come “too late” to technologies. They too often undertake their reflections
            afterthe technologies are in place. Rather, I argue, they should reposition themselves at what I call the “R&D” position where technologies are taking developmental shape, in think tanks, in incubator facilities, in research centers. Only then can truly “new” and emerging technologies be fully philosophically engaged.<br>

Abstract: Aaron Gurwitsch and the group of Jewish phenomenologists and thinkers who had assembled in exile at the New School were not part of the first Executive Committee, but they had established the first beachhead of Continental philosophy in the United States, and their pure Husserlian brand of phenomenology was an important part of SPEP early on. The first debate to break out in the nascent society took place between pure Husserlian “phenomenologists” and the “existentialists.” Still, the New School philosophers showed very little interest in Jewish theology or religion. So even here, we must go back to John Wild, whose role in advancing the current interest in Levinas has been documented by Richard Sugarman, then a young Jewish student of Wild's at Yale and Florida in the 1960s, who was first introduced to the work of Levinas by Wild.
            
                     According to Sugarman, Wild wrote a commentary on15
                  Totality and Infinitythat “keenly anticipated” the changes Levinas would introduce inOtherwise than Being.
                     Edith Wyschogrod, who took her first course in philosophy under Wild at the Harvard Summer School, was the first theologically and religiously sensitive philosophical Jewish presence to gain prominence in SPEP.16

Abstract: This volume of articles contains highlights from the fifty-second annual meeting of the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP). The University of Oregon hosted our conference on October 24–26, 2013. All three of the plenary sessions for this conference constituted reflections on limits of various kinds: the limits of conceptual thinking, the limits of continental philosophy understood as a kind of post-Kantian quasi-transcendental enterprise, and the idea that SPEP's guiding orientation is an openness to experience that requires the Society to push against its own limits continually, to edge beyond itself. This common thread of reflection on limits has inspired the title of this volume: “Philosophy at/of the Limit.”<br>

Abstract: The concept of public memory has brought with it the idea that human agency permeates the entire process of historical interpretation, representation, and appropriation. For good or ill, the emergence of memory as an analytical category has extended the right to participate in this process of representation beyond the professional historian. As Carl Becker presciently noted in a 1932 American Historical Society address, every person has become a historian. Agents contributing to the process of public memory include historical personages (e.g., George Washington, Harriet Tubman, or your suffragist great-great-grandmother), the contemporaries that produced and preserved their historical records, historians who fix and “objectify” the historical record, teachers who use historical texts in their classrooms, politicians and activists who advocate for inclusion of certain versions of history, community leaders who critique faulty historical representations, children who learn and read about individuals from long ago, and many more. Each of these agents contributes to the process of public memory creation and circulation in a different way, sometimes performing various roles simultaneously. It is clear that these many agents are related through their involvement in this process. But how, precisely, are they connected? I have suggested that the agential spiral may help us begin to answer that question.<br>

Abstract: Alice McEwan, in “The ‘Plumber-Philosopher’: Shaw's Discourse on Domestic Sanitation,” synthesizes Shaw's chronic difficulties with the plumbing at Shaw's Corner, the Shaws' country home in the village of Ayot St. Lawrence, with his reformist views on public health and the “wider implications of how sanitation might link civilization and hygiene to aesthetics.” While connections can be drawn between the playwright and the avant-garde theories of modernist architects, Shaw (as usual) emerges in McEwan's essay with a distinctive vision in which “modern sanitary arrangements … have the power to operate as a cultural trope, revealing truths about how we attempt to organize ‘health’ and manage our bodies in modern society.”<br>

Abstract: Yes, regrettably, the species is fallen and the will is impaired. Nevertheless, these deficiencies are remediable for Shaw and Ricoeur. The two place unwavering faith in the ineradicable goodness of creation and lodge unflagging hope in the inextirpable capacity of humans to repair the damage they have done to themselves and the planet that houses them. Things can be different. Lives need not be beggared. Tomorrow can be better than today. This is the inspiriting wager Shaw and Ricoeur make, with eyes fully open to the countless maladies that mar existence. Through the maelstroms that swirled around them, they stayed the course, undaunted: they remained faithful, hopeful, spiritual, creative, and humane; they lived long, active, and productive lives of notable achievement; they made uplifting the least advantaged the locus of their ameliorative efforts; they sought justice, equality, and reconciliation for everyone; and the world is a much better place because of them. By such benchmarks, Shaw and Ricoeur epitomize wellness. For these kindred spirits, ever the intrepid circumnavigators of the entropic regions, one touch of the divine that permeates the universe makes us all brothers and sisters under the skin. Accordingly, as harried members of a single global family under siege, it follows in their thinking that we are responsible for one another's welfare, and that we cannot save our individual selves apart from saving humankind at large. Hence, we cannot injure someone unjustly, or allow another to suffer unnecessarily, without diminishing ourselves. In the inclusive society they envision, our shared humanity elicits shared responses to life's exigencies wherever they occur.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Meta-Utopian Metatext:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Jameson defines the meta-Utopian as including “both the Utopia and its generic adversary.”
         
               Tom Moylan identifies within a parallel mode of “self-critical utopian discourse” the potential for “a process that can tear apart the dominant ideological web.”152
            
               One might inquire, in this context, whether Thomas More's own apparent Utopianism does not immanently resolve itself, or fail to resolve itself, into a similar set of practices. More himself challenges the condition of his Utopian citizens by announcing “the grand absurdity on which their whole society was based.”153
            
               More's satire upon Utopia occupies precisely the same textual space (which is therefore a metatextual space, a paradoxical and impossible space, a no-place) as does the satire upon his own sociopolitical reality, which that Utopia/154
            Utopiarepresents. It is through this self-problematizing praxis (and its implicit and essential rejection of autarchy) that More offers the possibility of Moylan's critical Utopia: “a seditious expression of social change … in a permanently open process of envisaging what is not yet.”

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: While there can be no doubt that for architecture to have a credibly utopian dimension architects would “have to regain their sense of social responsibility, and their political sanity,” is voting en masse “for a world ruled by communitarian and socialist ethics and practices,” and against “a world ruled by the myth that the next technological discovery will provide a solution,” a prerequisite for Utopia? Or might the incremental, or piecemeal, achievement of Utopia be a real possibility? Is it inconceivable that Utopia could be achievable, even partially, on a building-by-building basis, to produce a condition of numerous Utopias in among the banal products of mainstream architecture and urban design practices? Might this not reasonably herald the possibility of alternatives amid more generally unpromising conditions (by making the first steps toward the realization of other possibilities)? Interestingly, Vidler's comments above almost paraphrase Frederick Engels's position in
         Socialism: Utopian and Scientific(1880), that because Utopia is out of step with history, it is impossible to imagine and realize until everything preceding has already changed (which would make it redundant anyway), not least our conceptualization of technology as panacea. Nevertheless, Vidler does offer a glimpse of an alternative condition: “In William Morris's “News from Nowhere” the society is served by technology that stays well in the background; technology ruled by community and not by investment and profit.”
               Although Morris is offered, Vidler does so absent of any pronounced conviction that the society described might be28
            a real possibility, rather than little more than one tentativepossible realityamong so many others.<br>

Abstract: Flush with the juices of adolescence, American philosophy declared independence from its European parentage in the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson and his generation. In 1837, Emerson addressed the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Society on the occasion of its inaugural meeting for the year, which he called a "holiday." Emerson began: I greet you on the recommencement of our literary year. Our anniversary is one of hope, and, perhaps, not enough of labor. We do not meet for games of strength or skill, for the recitation of histories, tragedies, and odes, like the ancient Greeks; for parliaments of love and poesy, like the Troubadours; nor for the advancement of science, like our contemporaries in the British and European capitals. Thus far, our holiday has been simply a friendly sign of the survival of the love of letters amongst a people too busy to give letters any more. Perhaps the time is already come when it ought to be, and will be something else; when the sluggard intellect of this continent will look from under its iron lids and fill the postponed expectations of the world with something better than the expectations of mechanical skill. Our day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close. The millions that around us are rushing into life, cannot always be fed on the sere remains of foreign harvests. Events, actions arise, that must be sung, that will sing themselves.<br>

Article Title: The Daily Grind at Tel Dor: A Trough and Basin from an Iron Age I Kitchen<br>

Issue: bullamerschoorie.issue-372<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of an Iron Age I dwelling at the Phoenician site of Dor, on Israel's Carmel coast. We provide a definition for the architectural mental template for this type of house—a Central Courtyard Hash-Plan House. By combining an analysis of the size and layout of the house, and the distribution of artifacts and ecofacts in it, we define rooms devoted to specialized economic activities such as food production and storage and also attempt to identify gendered spaces. We conclude that the house was a self-contained agrarian unit engaged in complex economic activity. The same conceptual plan, housing similar economic activities, can be identified in other dwellings in the southern Levant, from Late Bronze Age I to Late Iron Age IIA. The gradual disappearance of this house type, vis-à-vis the emergence, on the one hand, of smaller and simpler dwellings such as the ubiquitous Four-Room House and, on the other, that of public facilities for specialized economic tasks, signifies to our minds a fundamental ideological and economic transformation, a change in the
         habitusof Levantine society—namely, the gradual segregation between households and various aspects of economic life.<br>
