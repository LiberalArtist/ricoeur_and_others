  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnqs7">The Language of the Gods in the World of Men</a><br>

  Author(s) WAITE GEOFF<br>
  Abstract: In a book called
                     Reason in the Age of Science,Hans-Georg Gadamer asked the question: Can “philosophy” refer to anything nowadays except the theory of science?¹ His own answer to this question is affirmative. It may seem that the so-called “analytic” tradition in philosophy—the tradition that goes back to Frege and Russell and whose most prominent living representatives are Quine, Davidson, Dummett, and Putnam—must return a negative answer. For that tradition is often thought of as a sort of public relations agency for the natural sciences.<br>

  Author(s) Connors Catherine<br>
  Abstract: Aristotle says that metaphor is ‘the application of a word that belongs to another thing: either from genus to species, species to genus, species to species, or by analogy’.¹ Studies of metaphors in specific texts – such as those considered in the present volume – are, on the whole, served well by the sort of definition Aristotle offers. But that Aristotelian definition, in presupposing that proper names belong to their objects, raises some awkward questions about naming and essence. And those questions become more threatening if the metaphors to be considered are found in fiction. Ken Dowden’s chapter raises the<br>

  Abstract: The very notion of seductive ethics is likely to give us pause, to seem more error than paradox. Ethics is more often than not conceived as the very resistance to seduction, if not in fact to any sort of pleasure (or bliss, which seems to undermine the ethical subject).¹ It is dutiful, we think, a little bit ascetic (provided we don’t overly enjoy our asceticism), rule-bound or abstemiously virtuous. And if seduction is about sustaining the possible, then to prescribe, whether character or behavior, seems contradictory to it. But the prescriptions of ethics are not always a matter of foreclosure;<br>

  Author(s) MANOUSSAKIS JOHN PANTELEIMON<br>
  Abstract: For the past several decades, continental philosophy has exhibited an ongoing concern with what we might call liminal phenomena, among them friendship, the gift, mourning, responsibility, forgiveness, and hospitality. Of course, to call these “phenomena” already begs the question, or at least a question, the question of whether and to what extent these events actually take place. Thinking in the wake of Jacques Derrida it is impossible to ignore, for example, the excess of the call to forgiveness over the sort of forgiveness that actually takes place in concrete situations. In the case of hospitality, this excess is apparent in<br>

  Book Title: Styles of Piety: Practicing Philosophy after the Death of God-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>

  Abstract: The last half century has seen both attempts to demythologize the idea of God into purely secular forces and the resurgence of the language of Godas indispensable to otherwise secular philosophers for describing experience. This volume asks whether pietymight be a sort of irreducible human problematic: functioning both inside and outside religion.S. Clark Buckner works in San Francisco as an artist, critic, and curator.

  Abstract: Gabriel Marcel’s theistic philosophy traditionally has been labeled as a form of religious existentialism. While this is an accurate description of Marcel’s philosophy, I prefer to describe his philosophy as a sort of
                  reflective method. This way of describing his philosophy allows us to trace it back to its Kantian transcendentalist roots. Once we recognize the Kantian transcendentalist roots of his reflective method, we can better appreciate why he performs a detailed examination of the meaningfulness of human existence through such detrimental, life-affirming, or life-altering events as the death of a loved one, religious faith, despair, communion, hope, and love:<br>

  Abstract: This introductory framework should suffice to demonstrate that the very concept of “commandment,” when linked to the precepts of the Decalogue, requires a clarification that restates the authentic law. If we are to grasp the meanings of moral law in its actual cultural context, we cannot possibly trust some sort of common sense without immediately getting lost in a maze of multiple misunderstandings and contradictions. We will have to find ways to peel off the sedimented crust formed by the usual meanings and to strip ambiguity from the very debates that should have critically illuminated the problems.<br>

  Abstract: When we try to answer the question whether philosophy, feminism, and faith can be reconciled, we see that many people have attempted the reconciliation, and quite a few have done so to their own satisfaction. Despite the multitude of personally satisfying accounts, no universally accepted reconciliation has ever been constructed. To argue for the compatibility of philosophy, feminism, and faith, then, is not a mathematical sort of task—one that can be completed to the satisfaction of some professionally constituted public. Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that neither philosophy nor feminism is a unitary body of thought.<br>

  Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience today offers a novel approach to the study of human social cognition and culture. Such an approach can be viewed as a sort of “cognitive archaeology,” as it enables the empirical investigation of the neurophysiological brain mechanisms that make our interactions with the world possible, thereby allowing us to detect the possible functional antecedents of our cognitive skills and to measure the sociocultural influence exerted through human cultural evolution on that very same cognitive repertoire. Thanks to cognitive neuroscience we can deconstruct some of the concepts we normally use when referring to intersubjectivity or to aesthetics, art, and<br>

  Abstract: Over the last two decades several studies (Bonds, 1997, 2006; Brown, 1996; Sisman, 1993; Webster, 1997) have discussed the relationship between music and the sublime in pre-Romantic aesthetics, examining the evocation of the sublime in the music of the late 18

These writers have naturally focused on the two most influential conceptions of the sublime within that cultural context, those of Burke (A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful, 1757) and Kant (Critique of Judgment, 1790).

The particular kind of body humans have helps produce ways of thinking about the world that are specific to the human species.

  Book Title: Moments of Silence-Authenticity in the Cultural Expressions of the Iran-Iraq War, 1980-1988<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatanabadi Shouleh<br>
  Abstract: The Iran-Iraq War was the longest conventional war of the 20th century. The memory of it may have faded in the wake of more recent wars in the region, but the harrowing facts remain: over one million soldiers and civilians dead, millions more permanently displaced and disabled, and an entire generation marked by prosthetic implants and teenage martyrdom. These same facts have been instrumentalized by agendas both foreign and domestic, but also aestheticized, defamiliarized, readdressed and reconciled by artists, writers, and filmmakers across an array of identities: linguistic (Arabic, Persian, Kurdish), religious (Shiite, Sunni, atheist), and political (Iranian, Iraqi, internationalist). Official discourses have unsurprisingly tried to dominate the process of production and distribution of war narratives. In doing so, they have ignored and silenced other voices.Centering on novels, films, memoirs, and poster art that gave aesthetic expression to the Iran-Iraq War, the essays gathered in this volume present multiple perspectives on the war's most complex and underrepresented narratives. These scholars do not naively claim to represent an authenticity lacking in official discourses of the war, but rather, they call into question the notion of authenticity itself. Finding, deciding upon, and creating a language that can convey any sort of truth at all-collective, national, or private-is the major preoccupation of the texts and critiques in this diverse collection.<br>

  Book Title: On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy-A Guide for the Unruly<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.<br>

  Writing, Friendship, and the Ontology of the Work of Art in Maurice Blanchot’s Poetics from:

  Author(s) Bruns Gerald L.<br>
  Abstract: Poetry as Unhappy Consciousness. It is well known that in Maurice Blanchot’s early criticism writing appears to be less a productive activity than a self-reflexive movement. For example, at the outset of “Littérature et la à la mort” (1947– 48) he remarks that literature begins when it becomes a question for itself (PF. 293/WF. 300–301). What sort of question, exactly? Evidently not Jean-Paul Sartre’s “What is literature?’’ which like all “what is . . . ?” questions carries a demand for justification. Inquiring after the nature of a thing is a way of asking why there is such a<br>

  Author(s) Ansell Nik<br>
  Abstract: Universalism was a doctrine not widely espoused in seventeenth-century England. That hell is eternal was orthodox belief¹ and any suggestion to the contrary was viewed with grave suspicion as a “detestable and damnable” doctrine of the Arminians;² an opinion believed to give rise to ethical anarchy and antinomianism. If hell is finite, what sort of deterrent is it against misbehaving in this life? What use is Christ’s death if God can cancel the debt of human sin by will alone? Despite general denigration, however, arguments that God’s salvation has universal scope gradually gathered momentum throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<br>

His pastoral concern was for his audience to come to know God in personal and transformative ways. His focus was on the lived dimension of the Christian faith. The way he sought to minister to his Christian audience was through story.

Whether reading the local newspaper or the global online news, whether watching the latest film or listening to the newest music, violence of one sort or another seems omnipresent. The violence of our late-modern age, furthermore, seems embedded in competing claims about boundaries and identities and what some philosophers call our relationship to “The Other.” Some people cheerily claim that boundaries are (or soon will be) no more, since modern technologies are shrinking the walls and distances that separate us.

  Abstract: As stated in chapter 2, every religious symbol expresses, either explicitly or implicitly, a threefold referentiality: (1) reference to some notion of ultimate reality, the sacred, or God; (2) reference to a concept of the human; and (3) reference to a specific vision of the world. The Christian symbol of divine suffering naturally exhibits that threefold referentiality in both the explicit symbol and its twofold presupposition. Thus, in these two primary presuppositions, the human and God do not relate to one another in some sort of vacuum. The human (Ο άνθρωπος) and God (Ο θεός) relate to one another in<br>

My sense is that every hermeneutical situation has the structure of this quarrel, which is governed by a logic that is by turns exclusionary and allegorical.

  Abstract: In contemporary anthropology, much is made of the ways in which meaning is constructed by a culture’s members.

It seems therefore a particularly vital point at which to observe a culture’s workings.

  Reanimating the Occasions for Rhetoric from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sn2">Norms of Rhetorical Culture</a><br>
  Abstract: Even earlier in the twentieth century, the public agenda seemed lost or abandoned. In an atmosphere of crisis, civic institutions could only repeat empty symbolic reassurances. The symbols were in fact empty, because there appeared to be no learned experience except failure for them to rest on. Resignation, cynicism, and hopelessness had become the order of the day. In the midst of this material and symbolic dispossession it seems almost fanciful to imagine a creative ethical option for speech. Around the world oratory flourished; but it was hardly the sort to revive hopes for participatory democracy. Imagine now a public<br>

  Book Title: The Superstitious Muse-Thinking Russian Literature Mythopoetically<br>
  Publisher: Academic Studies Press<br>
  Author(s): Bethea David M.<br>
  Abstract: For several decades David Bethea has written authoritatively on the “mythopoetic thinking" that lies at the heart of classical Russian literature, especially Russian poetry. His theoretically informed essays and books have made a point of turning back to issues of intentionality and biography at a time when authorial agency seems under threat of “erasure" and the question of how writers, and poets in particular, live their lives through their art is increasingly moot. The lichnost’ (personhood, psychic totality) of the given writer is all-important, argues Bethea, as it is that which combines the specifically biographical and the capaciously mythical in verbal units that speak simultaneously to different planes of being. Pushkin’s Evgeny can be one incarnation of the poet himself and an Everyman rising up to challenge Peter’s new world order; Brodsky can be, all at once, Dante and Mandelstam and himself, the exile paying an Orphic visit to Florence (and, by ghostly association, Leningrad).This sort of metempsychosis, where the stories that constitute the Ur-texts of Russian literature are constantly reworked in the biographical myths shaping individual writers’ lives, is Bethea’s primary focus. This collection contains a liberal sampling of Bethea’s most memorable previously published essays along with new studies prepared for this occasion.<br>

  Abstract: September 1944 was a relatively calm month for the remaining Jews of Dresden. The deportations had stopped, incidents of blatant violence had decreased, and Germany’s defeat seemed certain. On 14 September, Klemperer found the peace of mind to write a sort of reflective summary of past events. The entry begins with encouraging reports of the Allies’ progress on the various fronts. In this context, he describes how his friend and neighbor at the Jews’ House, Neumark, found a newspaper from 1943, in which a series of reports all point to the military and political collapse of Germany.

Furthermore, to many it suggests participation in a universal common ground of humanity transcending all particularities and differences. (It is, perhaps, this purported unifying ground that anchors us “at home” in any part of the world.)

  Book Title: The Uncertain Sciences-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mazlish Bruce<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging book one of the most esteemed cultural historians of our time turns his attention to major questions about human experience and the attempts to understand it "scientifically." Bruce Mazlish considers the achievements, failings, and possibilities of the human sciences-a domain that he broadly defines to include the social sciences, literature, psychology, and hermeneutic studies. In a rich and original synthesis built upon the work of earlier philosophers and historians, Mazlish constructs a new view of the nature and meaning of the human sciences.Starting with the remote human past and moving through the Age of Discovery to the present day, the author discusses what sort of knowledge the human sciences claim to offer. He looks closely at the positivistic aspirations of the human sciences, which are modeled after the natural sciences, and at their interpretive tendencies. In an analysis of scientific method and scientific community, he explores the roles they can or should assume in the human sciences. Mazlish's approach is genuinely interdisciplinary, and he draws on an array of topics, from civil society to globalization to the interactions of humans and machines, to inform his thought-provoking discussion of historical consciousness.<br>

In addition, invitations to decision makers to implement subjective ideas of evil are arguably invitations toward standardlessness, emotionally driven prosecutions, and other violations of basic guarantees of the rule of law.

  Abstract: During my conversations with the eight South Korean women I introduced in chapter 1, a particular world of words emerged, demanding that I take note of them. Over time I began to underline these words in my field notes, to anticipate them in my conversations, and to use them myself as prompts in conversations. In the earlier days of this project, I imagined that I would write a book with some sort of a glossary to serve as a guide to the women’s stories. Over the course of the research, however, it became clear to me that the hardest words<br>

  Abstract: Let me begin by recapitulating Nicholas Rescher’s theory of historical interpretation as he presents it in his valuable and thought-provoking summary, “The Interpretation of Philosophical Texts.”¹ Rescher distinguishes first between three approaches to a historical text. The first is
                  creative or imaginative,and it is in this way that many nonprofessional philosophers read philosophical texts, finding suggestive ideas and images that are experienced subjectively as fitting into a conceptual framework. This framework is relatively personal; the meaning derived is not the sort that could be or needs to be discussed and debated in a scholarly community, though there is a<br>

  Abstract: The traditional categories through which early Christian exegesis is often described—“literal,” “typological,” “allegorical”—are less helpful for analyzing “ascetic exegesis” than some scholars might imagine. Contrary to my own expectation, I have discovered that typology and allegory, however much they may dominate other types of patristic interpretation, were underutilized interpretive tools in the church fathers’ production of ascetic meaning from Biblical texts. Other interpretive strategies, to be detailed in chapter 5, particularly intertextual exegesis, proved on the whole far more useful. In some cases figurative interpretation of any sort seemed unnecessary to ascetically inclined exegetes because the unadorned—but<br>

Benjamin Haydon, for instance, said that though Wordsworth was a “great Being,” he could use his intense feelings only “as referring to himself.”² Coleridge, indeed, observed as early as 1799 that “Wordsworth appears to me to have hurtfully segregated & isolated his Being/Doubtless, his delights are more deep and sublime;/but he<br>

The view of the mind as essentially an interiority – something located entirely inside the skins of mental subjects – presents us with a stark choice when trying to understand the nature of value. Either value must derive from the inside – from the activities of the mind – or it must exist on the outside, objectively present in the world independently of those activities.

  Book Title: The Ethics of Deconstruction-Derrida and Levinas<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Critchley Simon<br>
  Abstract: The Ethics of Deconstruction, Simon Critchley's first book, was originally published to great acclaim in 1992. It was the first book to argue for the ethical turn in Derrida's work and to show as powerfully as possible how deconstruction has persuasive ethical consequences that are vital to our thinking through of questions of politics and democracy. Rather than being concerned with deconstruction in terms of the contradictions inherent in any text - an approach typical of the early Derrida and those in literary criticism aiming to extract a critical method for an application to literature - Critchley concerns himself with the philosophical context necessary for an understanding of the ethics of deconstructive reading. Far from being some sort of value-free nihilism or textual free-play, Critchley showed the ethical impetus that was driving Derrida's work. His claim was that Derrida's understanding of ethics has to be understood in relation to his engagement with the work of Levinas and the book lays out the details of their philosophical confrontation.<br>

  Abstract: Constructivism in political theory is opposed to both scepticism and foundationalism. Against the sceptic the constructivist hopes to defend the objectivity of at least some political principles. Against the foundationalist the constructivist hopes to show that the defence of objectivity need not appeal to any account of the necessary and unchanging foundations for moral reasoning. Evil has traditionally been seen in foundationalist terms, as a theological concept depending on the existence of God or as depending on some alternative scheme of absolute moral judgement, in order to mark out a special sort of wrongness.

  Author(s): Miller Sean<br>
  Abstract: In
      Strung Together: The Cultural Currency of String Theory as a Scientific Imaginary,Sean Miller examines the cultural currency of string theory, both as part of scientific discourse and beyond it. He demonstrates that the imaginative component of string theory is both integral and indispensable to it as a scientific discourse. While mathematical arguments provide precise prompts for physical intervention in the world, the imaginary that supplements mathematical argument within string theory technical discourse allows theorists to imagine themselves interacting with the cosmos as an abstract space in such a way that strings and branes as phenomena become substantiated and legitimized. And it is precisely this sort of imaginary-which Miller calls ascientific imaginary-duly substantiated and acculturated, that survives the move from string theory technical discourse to popularizations and ultimately to popular and literary discourses. In effect, a string theory imaginary legitimizes the science itself and helps to facilitate a virtual domestication of a cosmos that was heretofore remote, alien, and incomprehensible.<br>

In the nexus of Chinese domestic politics and foreign relations, such historical accounts are central to the internal and external legitimation of the nondemocratic state. By bestowing determined meanings upon the past, which is causally related to the present and future of the Chinese nation-state, this sort of strategic narrative defines the identity role of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in China’s sociopolitical development and projects<br>

These installations are spaces of the soul. They make the invisible visible. Yet in the meantime, life falls into pieces, and its elements, far from being put together, are carefully spread out. These spaces are alive, yet whichever of them I step into, I am filled with a deadly sort of numbness. They hit me right in the face.

  Abstract: TRADITIONAL PEOPLES’ first encounters with photography sometimes lead them to conclude that the camera is a dangerous, magical instrument capable of stealing some essential part of their being, causing illness or death. Generally such anecdotes are not explained but get filed away with other exotic superstitions held by curious primitives, leaving these people to sort out their own relationship to cameras, photographs, film, and now video. Traditional people sometimes follow through by taming the magical properties of recording media. For example, when missionaries and health workers banned the preservation and display of the bones of dead ancestors in Melanesian houses,<br>

  Abstract: Habermas’s endorsement of what he calls “postmetaphysical thinking” can easily be misleading. It is not intended as a rejection of the sort of inquiry pursued, for example, in the more recent revival of “analytic metaphysics” associated primarily with David Lewis and the “Australian metaphysicians.” Rather, at least in the first instance, it is directed against both the tradition of metaphysical thought that reached a culmination in the philosophy of Hegel and German idealism and in the various—and, ultimately, for Habermas, still “metaphysical”—attempts to escape that tradition in the writings of Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Derrida.

In his writings, Adorno often tries to draw a distinction between Berg and Wagner, but his explanations, while illuminating, only contribute to the problem. In his reevaluation of Berg, written about twenty years after Berg’s death, Adorno recognizes the “autonomy” of Berg’s works but points to a peculiar sort of metaphysics in which Berg’s music would emerge from underneath the music drama. In other words, Adorno draws a distinction<br>

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: This account of illocutionary force is particularly suited to illuminating struggles for recognition on the part of women who have often entered the public sphere only through the narrative form, in novels, biographies, and autobiographies. Lara is particularly interested in the way in which women take up each other’s lives to make moral claims and to fashion and refashion identities. Hannah Arendt looks at the life of Rahel Varnhagen in order to assume her own identity as a pariah, as a Jew, and as a woman; later, contemporary feminists take up Arendt’s identity as reflected in her biography of Varnhagen to fashion their own. Simone de Beauvoir creates a fictional self to sort through her lived relationship to Jean Paul Sartre, which then becomes the site for contemporary feminists to sort through their own identity and autonomy. This loop occurs repeatedly in what Lara, following Ricoeur, sees as a tripartite mimesis. In mimesis 2, Jane Austen takes up the limited life of the women of her time (mimesis 1) to construct an identity for women that is then taken up again by contemporary women in films of Jane Austen’s novels (mimesis 3) to continue to construct that identity. Moreover, what is told in these looping narratives is the way in which women are and become moral agents. Thus, while many commentators have associated Austen only with Aristotle, with an ethics of virtue, Lara is just as interested in the morality of principle that Austen’s heroines exhibit. Moreover, she emphasizes the extent to which the moral claims Austen raises are validated through the narrative structure of her novels. This is a relationship that Martha Nussbaum also articulates, as Lara notes. For both, it is through the structure of narrative and imaginative speech that moral claims become not only rationally justified but compelling as well.<br>

Abstract: Although his arguments could be tighter, Steffen makes some novel points. He suggests that crime, as an abuse of freedom, is appropriately punished by limitations on freedom—the greater the crime the greater (longer) the appropriate limitation. He also argues that implementation of the death penalty results in a focus on the criminal’s body, rather than on the person. This objectification, he argues, is inconsistent with the sort of respect for the criminal which is necessary for holding him responsible for his crime.<br>

Abstract: While Ricoeur suggests that recourse to solidarity can go too far in answering these questions, an appeal to the conditions of solidarity provides the basis for his criticism of Rawls. As his account of the subject of rights would suggest, and agreeing with many in the Anglo‐American world, Ricoeur denies that a procedural theory of justice can substitute for the bonds of an ethical community or replace a collective conception of the good. At the same time, he sees Rawls’s analysis as a brilliant articulation of the deontological level of the structure of moral action. For Ricoeur, Rawls’s revisions of his theory of justice in his later work mark his own recognition of the connection between the deontological and teleological levels of moral action since he now explicitly grounds the theory of justice in a particular sort of political community.<br>

Abstract: Saint Augustine asserted that the human intellectual soul cannot see God’s substance the way angels do and speculated that such inferiority results from the soul’s “natural appetite” to govern the body.
         Desideriumorinclinatio ad corpusprevents the soul from fully aspiring toward God as long as it is not in control of the body.5Is, then, a body necessary for the beatific vision, and what difference would it make? Following Augustine, Bernard of Clairvaux insisted that there is no perfect beatitude before resurrection; after death, souls remain “linked to the body”—not by animal life or sensation, but by a sort of natural attachment—to the point of neither willing nor being able to realize themselves without the body.6Aquinas, on the contrary, maintained that disembodied souls can enjoy the beatific vision and that such vision is as intense (that is, qualitatively the same) before as after the resurrection of the flesh. Yet, insofar as the soul desires its body, beatitude is extended (that is, quantitatively) after the reunion of soul and body.7Its plenitude, then, still requires the body, which is why the disembodied souls of Dante’sParadisedesire their dead bodies in the first place.<br>

Abstract: Finally, we can turn the tables back onto the “default setting” that Alexander and Smith (

But even governments do not always have the same relations to the wider world. Appropriate speech in different governmental bodies varies from teeth‐clenching but polite disagreement in the U.S. Senate ( … “the gentleman from Louisiana …” ), to shouting, booing, and jeering (in, e.g., the British House of Commons; see Merelman1991); and bonds between legislators vary. One could study differences between state institutions, not just as formal institutional differences, and not just as differences in the “discourses of civil society” of the sort Alexander and Smith (1993) describe, but also as differences in group styles.<br>

Abstract: We have thus followed a strange movement, a sort of coming and going between perceiving subjects and perceived objects, a zoom effect like that of a camera trying to set the right distance with its object in order to achieve a maximum degree of clarity—total transparency. On the one hand, we have seen how the tricky adjustment between the multiplicity of stabilized representations of Hawking and my face‐to‐face interaction with him has fragmented his identity. Like an impressionist painting, distance allows us to see what proximity causes us to lose. The layering of the multiplicity of narratives about Hawking reveals the stable identity of an individual that face‐to‐face contact does not allow. The closer we get to the object‐subject, the further we move from it. We no longer know who or where he is. All the categories we normally use in thinking about a person, a body, a machine, a mind, an interaction, a conversation, a text, and speech are blurred. In his presence, Hawking seems even more difficult to seize than we had imagined. The reason is, first, because, as we have shown, the depth of the social body (the one that talks of the other as much as of itself and allows the accumulation of self‐definitions), normally visible but unnoticed in any interaction, is absent in his case. Second, the internal functioning of the flesh‐and‐blood body, normally invisible, becomes visible and distributed here (the
      Iandlegsare mixed in the same discourse and are detached from the body; they are before him while his voice is next to him, and the flesh‐and‐blood body is collectively taken care of) and omnipresent (it appears at different moments during the interaction). Third, the machine, by the coordination of the actions it allows, disturbs the interaction as much as it creates it. This is where the confusion and fragmentation of identity is pursued by recomposition. Here we follow, step by step, how the machine to which this silent body is attached makes the component~<br>

Abstract: Neal‘s account of the origin and early history of the Quakers in
      The History of the Puritanssignals another set of boundaries within the ranks of eighteenth‐century Dssent. Fox’s father is described as a “poor weaver,” which he was not. It is implied that Fox abandoned his apprenticeship to a shoemaker, though in fact he completed it. The account of Fox’s subsequent actions makes no explicit judgment against him, but in its chill distance it adopts the perspective of the powers that be. “It cannot be expected that such an unsettled People should have an uniform System of rational Principles,” Neal haughtily pronounces, and represents the early Quakers as uneducated, devoid of coherent principles, antisocial in their public behavior, and inculcating no secure set of moral values.52Neal’s concluding remarks even endorse the punitive measures of the commonwealth authorities against his fellow Dissenters. He is also icily patronizing about contemporary Quakers: “the Disturbances they gave to the publick Religion for a Course of many Years was so insufferable, that the Magistrates could not avoid punishing them as Disturbers of the Peace; though of late Years they are become a more sober and inoffensive People; and by the Wisdom of their Managers, have formed themselves into a Sort of Body politick.”53<br>

Abstract: A psychological turning point in Braudel’s life came at age twenty‐five with his father’s death on January 27, 1927.
         111That summer Braudel returned to Paris to help sort out family affairs. He began his first serious archival research at the Archives Nationales and the Bibliotheque Nationale and changed the title of histhèseto “Philippe II et la politique espagnole en Méditerranée de 1559 à 1574” (i.e., from Cateau‐Cambrésis to the Turkish reconquest of Tunis). That fall his mother came to Algiers to keep house for him, which prompted him to undertake a first marriage with the daughter of the vice‐principal of his school on October 27, 1927, which ended in divorce five years later. Archival work in Simancas began in the following summers, 1928 through 1933.112His 1928 first article, “The Spaniards and North Africa,” was derived from his revisedthèsetopic, and it eventually made its way into Part III ofThe Mediterranean,in a discussion of the North African defense network. Neither this section nor a topic such as the battle of Alcázarquivir (August 4, 1578) constitute anything other than “potted” history derived from 1930s scholarship—nothing, in fact, to suggest his intimate contact with North African society and culture.113If the view of “the Mediterranean as seen from the opposite shore, upside down” revolutionized his vision, his geographic orientation tuned out any unique or original perspective in this section of what became Part III. In 1930 Braudel served as an assistant secretary at the Congress of Historical Sciences held in Algiers amid the celebrations of Algeria’s one‐hundredth anniversary as a French colony, and he appears to have been less on the outside than his memory or self‐image would like to admit. More than the place, it was what he did there, his role as a secondary school teacher, that shaped the young Braudel.<br>

Abstract: If it seems, however, that this is a crude principle to apply to every sort of communication, this is just what Spencer sets out to do. Later in his essay, he extends his theory even to poetry, the obvious counterexample. In an argument notably ingenious, if not persuasive, he asserts that poetry is in fact more economical than prose in its demand on the reader’s attention. The evidence for this point is the extreme compression of poetic language, particularly figurative language; but Spencer has confused compression, which might very well tax the reader’s attention by producing ambiguity, with a concept of brevity that would seem to resist ambiguity as an impediment to communication. Despite Spenser’s attempt to assimilate poetry to his economic theory, later composition theory would confine itself to prose as essentially governed by the norms of brevity and clarity.

Abstract: The seeds of religious pluralism in the contemporary theological situation have the potential to transform traditional Christian theology from within. According to Paul Knitter, the pluralistic situation demands a conception of the relations between the world’s faiths that is radically new. Knitter’s proposal of a “unitive pluralism of religions” suggests a sort of kaleidoscopic vision of religious interpenetration in which every religion is present in the self‐understanding of every other without, however, the religions becoming confused.
      4Our awareness of the sociology of knowledge, however, gives us reason to suspect that there are intrinsic limits to this kind of religious interpenetration. The dependence of religious ideas on specific social processes for their plausibility limits the flow of these ideas.5More often than is usually acknowledged, religious doctrines are formed in response to specific questions arising out of religious practice.6A tradition’s intellectual beliefs regarding the nature of reality are correlated to its particular way of life in such a way that the former make sense only in the context of the latter. A community’s cognitive beliefs are therefore apt to leave an outsider—one who does not share that community’s distinctive way of life—with an impression of otherness, even if the dependence of these beliefs on alien modes of social interaction is rarely so absolute as to render them unintelligible. The situation with respect to religious ideas stands in contrast to the propagation of scientific knowledge, which, by virtue of its relative independence from specific social/practical contexts,7has the ability to pass through sociological barriers with relative ease. For this reason, one would not expect the theological revisions called forth by the new pluralism, as substantial as these are likely to be, to be quite as thoroughgoing as those undergone by the tradition in meeting the challenge of modernity.<br>

Abstract: Subjectivity, agency, selfhood. These concepts, sometimes taken to be synonymous, continue to merit attention from feminist theorists. We may loosely divide feminist thinking on these topics into two threads: the concrete, based on experiential aspects of women’s agency, and the theoretical, aiming to sort out underlying metaphysical and political questions. Two recent works follow this informal divide: Diana Tietjens Meyers’s
      Gender in the Mirrorrepresents the former thread, while Lois McNay’sGender and Agencytakes up the latter. That is not to say that Meyers’s work is free of theoretical foundations or that McNay’s book has no practical application—on the contrary. The difference lies more in starting points, so that the two volumes will appeal to somewhat different audiences, though it is instructive to read them together. Both authors exhibit impatience with some treatments of subjectivity, and both can be read as attempting to set discourse about agency on a more practical path.<br>

Abstract: While mutual recognition of free participatory agency thus provides a minimum universal standard for mutual recognition of worth and precludes recognition on demand, the question remains whether that minimum condition can become more encompassing of the values and practices of individual religious communities—encompassing to the extent that there will emerge some kind of unifying narrative of identity constructing a cultural space within which a genuinely solidaristic acceptance of one another in friendship could blossom and an interreligiously coalitional politics of resistance could unfold. A positive answer to this question is not impossible, for the parochial yet universalized evaluative horizon of a religious community can become open to an increasing degree of convergence of a sort with that of another via self‐transformation and not necessarily devolve into an idolatry of the particular that is forgetful of the sociohistorical conditions of its own production. Although it may be the case, as postliberals claim, that religious communities constitute semiotic “worlds” irreducible to one another, that does not mean that their criteria of interpretation and evaluation are immune to change or that the boundaries of their horizons do not shift. Religions, like cultures, are not monolithic, fixed, and sui generis entities existing by themselves but rather thoroughly relational “concrete totalities” whose respective boundaries and internal configurations are constantly changing in accordance with alterations in their sociohistorical conditions.
         30Religious identity is not a stable and static set of commonly held beliefs, ideas, symbolic forms, and texts deposited in tradition and acting unilaterally as regulative grammar but a site of both regularity and contestation in which people as embodied carriers of tradition generate the sense of who they are religiously by skillfully negotiating and contesting various social and cultural identities coursing through ~<br>

Abstract: Ibid., 83. For Tesauro, the metaphor of the saint as shield is of great relevance. If in
            SympathyMaurice and the shroud are the shields of the Catholic Savoy family, inEdipo(Oedipus, 1661), Tesauro’s interpretation of Seneca’s tragedy, Oedipus is the shield that prevents the divinity from exerting his power of purification. In Tesauro’s tragedy, Oedipus holds a long monologue on the “voracious plague” that afflicts the city of Thebes. A praetor replies to the Oedipus that the heavens are merciful because “they oppose your [Oedipus’s] virtue like a shield against their own furor.” See Emanuele Tesauro,Edipo, ed. Carlo Ossola (Venice: Marsilio, 1987), 1.1, verse 4, 79, and verses 47–48, 80. We could thus say that, for Tesauro, Maurice is a sort of anti‐Oedipus who has made himself into a lucid mirror of the shroud (the shield reflecting divine will). The saint’s body is a transparent surface reflecting and “actualizing” the “symbol” of the shroud. By contrast, Oedipus’s ignorance of his sins is a darkened, blind shield that prevents the divinity from shining through.<br>

Abstract: Jewish writers were more apt to develop theological concerns when they were in strong contact, friendly or hostile, with other cultures and religions—for example, in the twelfth and nineteenth centuries—than at times when Judaism was more inwardly focused. One would have to ask if the sort of reflective energy, largely but not exclusively borne by an intellectual elite, that went into theology in most Christian groups, went into an equivalent but different activity in Judaism. Is Midrash the theology‐equivalent of Judaism? Or, vice versa, is theology the Midrash‐equivalent of Christianity? Suppose that were the case—both the parallel and the difference between the two might be instructive.<br>

      Critical Inquiryset out to determine whatCritical Inquiryauthors have read over the past thirty years. We set out to determine, first and most simply, who and what works are most often cited in our pages. Second, we wanted to track trends and fashions, as well as constants. Over the past thirty years, theory has seen any number of upheavals and innovations, so we wanted to see if certain writers remained touchstones for our authors. Third, we wanted to investigate a related question, the question of the status of the footnote in our pages. Elaborating upon Anthony Grafton’s bookThe Footnote: A Curious History,we sought to investigate how theory is transmitted through notes, what sorts of conversations are held below the main text, and to thus discover in a different sort of way the identity of our journal, a journal that has been identified with theory for so long. If we have not been, nor will be any time soon,Raritan—that is, an academic journal without footnotes and (or thus?) more literary than theoretical—then who are we? And, by extension, what is theory? Searching for definitions of theory andCritical Inquiryby defining the status and use of footnotes may seem like a risky venture—are the stakes really that high?—but we believe with Grafton, John Guillory, and others that the footnote illuminates larger concerns within the disciplines and thus helps us speculate on the future of theory.<br>

Abstract: To this end I reintroduce the distinction made earlier in this article between the participant and observer perspectives. I recall that the exclusivist and inclusivist models are approaches from a Christian participant perspective. This means that those who identify with Christianity view their tradition from their insider perspective and then examine and evaluate other religions from that same perspective. Pluralism proceeds differently. It examines all religions, including the one that the person identifies with (e.g., Christianity), from an observer perspective. One adopts the position of an outsider, also toward Christianity, and describes how individuals and groups in the various religions are inspired by divine manifestation with a veridical force that stimulates them to follow the way of (active and/or passive) salvation, individually and/or collectively, spiritually and/or materially.
            39That is what distinguishes pluralism from the other two models: one distances oneself and takes a sort of helicopter view of the diverse ways followed by people in different religions in their search for truth, oneness, and wholeness. In this they appear to be inspired by myths and rituals, which function as cognitive, affective, and enacted models of reality, and to be motivated by these myths and rituals as models for reality to attain reconciliation and peace in their own microcosm and macrocosm.40<br>

Abstract: One practical and normative standard according to which the profession can act publicly relates to political speech. If a work of any sort (book, video, or Web site) expresses a political opinion regarding anything of public concern, it can be included in a library’s collection. Furthermore, challenges to the presence of the work in the collection should be resisted on clear First Amendment grounds. This standard should be uncontroversial, but its application requires that we ourselves (i.e., every one of us who claims to be a professional) accept that it applies to all discourse. Whitney Davison‐Turley reports that her public expression of disagreement to some resolutions proposed at an ALA annual conference met with derision and insult [
         33, p. 33]. Her account, if accurate, points to some logically and ethically faulty reasoning used in response to her position. It is incumbent upon us as public professionals to adhere fully to any normative ethical position that has not been shown to be fallible; otherwise, any ethical argument we may make can be subject to refutation on the grounds of inconsistency and selective application. Another way to look at the proposed standard is that it is a positive right—the right of people to engage in free public political speech.<br>

Abstract: Too simply stated, the cosmologies of Israel’s neighbors were characterized by gods who either struggled to create order out of chaos (the Babylonians) or disrupted order by tempting and blinding humans (the Greeks). For the former, evil is primordial and salvation from it comes through a “final victory of order over chaos” in creation. For the latter, humans have a tragic fate and their salvation “consists in a sort of aesthetic deliverance issuing from the tragic spectacle itself” (ibid., 172–75). Of course, elements of each these types may be found in the Bible. For example, KJV Rev. 12:7 refers to a “war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels.” Similarly, the Book of Job depicts a kind of tragic spectacle precipitated by God’s wager with Satan. What is distinctive about the Genesis creation narrative is, however, its abjuring such notions of evil—as either primeval chaos or tragic existence—in order to establish absolutely God’s goodness notwithstanding the humanity’s universal experience of the “not good.”<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Date: 10 2008<br>
Author(s): Balsamo Gian<br>
Abstract: Now that the ramified circuitry of cultural influence has brought face‐to‐face Augustine’s and Proust’s respective mirrors of introspection, we may see more distinctly how Augustine’s and Marcel’s respective notions of soul share the presumption that self‐knowledge depends on self‐improvement. The more he strives to make his desire coincident with God’s love, the better Augustine knows himself; the better he knows himself, the more superfluous his introspection becomes, because his historical self converges better and better with his own destined‐for‐paradise self. As to Marcel, the more he rarefies his self‐centered self and adopts in its stead the altruistic self that coincides with his grandmother’s love, the less he feels estranged from himself. In Augustine’s scheme one finds the classical elements of metaphysical transcendence. The full convergence between actual and aimed‐at self, hence the full elimination of the mirror of introspection, will occur in the afterlife, in the metaphysical body that will be allotted to Augustine as a saint—a body that will embody all the scriptural figures of redemption and salvation, making any mediation of reflexivity redundant to truth. In Proust’s scheme one may detect instead the elements of a soft transcendence—grafted on the laws of the organism. When involuntary memory acts “the same way as love does,”
         65retrieving for Marcel his (forgotten or discarded) amorous self, he is encouraged to engage in an organismic sort of introspection; by dropping into a comatose sleep that paralyzes the self‐serving drives of his intellect and will, the two faculties that would otherwise work in concert toward the rejection of this altruistic self, Marcel is enabled to surrender unconditionally to the unconscious memory of it. Even in this case, any mediation of reflexivity becomes redundant; the self that past affections have deposited in Marcel’s unconscious memory is literally indistinguishable from his own organism—it just ne~<br>

Abstract: In one context Augustine uses
            benevolenceto describe the just warrior’s proper ordering of dispositions toward certain ends. In a letter to Marcellinus, Augustine writes that Christians “should always have perfect benevolence in case we return evil for evil.” Understood in that way, benevolence serves a negative, chastening function. For those who claim that Augustine understands war as an expression of beneficent care for the innocent, it is interesting to note that in this letter he understands acting benevolently to mean that “people are often to be helped, against their will, by being punished with a sort of kind harshness.” The beneficence involved, in other words, targets wrongdoers, not victims.

Abstract: Without trying any further to distinguish Bazin from his disciples, or
         Cahiers du cinémafrom other Parisian film groups, or even French film culture from that of other nations, in Florent Kirsch's characterization offilmologiewe can recognize the two nearly irreconcilable attitudes toward cinema and its study that have remained in tension in the academy. A few individuals have managed to bridge this opposition. Bazin should have been one of them, given his ENS education and his evident training in disciplines like geology, geography, entomology, botany, philosophy, rhetoric, theology, and psychology. Yet cinephilia won out in him, or rather films themselves won out as centers of attraction whose existence and value it was the duty and pleasure of the “disciplined” critic to articulate. Other polymaths who could bridge these approaches were Jean Mitry and Edgar Morin, both of whom were more closely allied to university life while always having been avid filmgoers, indeed occasional filmmakers. Mitry had assisted Abel Gance and had run ciné‐clubs in the 1920s and 1930s. He is listed as one of the founders of the Cinémathèque Française in 1935. After the war he taught at the brand new state‐sponsored film school, Institut des hautes études cinématographiques (IDHEC), largely because he had modest experience in production as an editor and assistant director. Later he would manage to teach classes in a university setting. Most tellingly, his massive publications (the two‐volumeEsthétique et psychologie du cinémaand the five‐volumeHistoire du cinéma) were published in the 1960s by Presses Univérsitaires de Paris, just as Cohen‐Séat's book had been. Mitry felt himself a legitimate rival offilmologie, and superior for having lived an entire life in the midst of the medium.24The tables of contents to his theoretical volumes presume the comprehensive and progressive exploration of a genuine discipline, as does the immense bibliography that draws on every sort of scie~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>

Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: The decisive question remains: what is promised? What offered gift can we take as the token‐as‐promise among the wealth of signs and givens that wash through the world? Owing to his view of prophetic criticism, Tillich claimed that yesterday’s prophetic act may be in need of revision and criticism today. This means that few or no signs may be taken as offered tokens. However, it would not be the case, he thinks, that Protestantism simply would carry out a sort of semiotic iconoclasm, wringing its hands, worried that every sign in the world is always a failing. Interestingly, at the end of his essay he turns to the congregation, and there we may find some ways to construe the prophetic as sign of the cross. Tillich does not develop what he calls the protestant form of grace, a chastened form that would dissent in his view from the objectification of what he calls Catholicism. Of course, this is a severely limited judgment on Tillich’s part, since there are many vibrant accounts of the Eucharist—Catholic and Protestant—together with their practical and political significance that are deeply marked by the same engagements and imperatives that Tillich raised.
         46These senses of Eucharist still would benefit from reflection on promise, and its local form in the congregation makes better sense when it is framed by the Eucharist as site of promise, gift, exchange, and free reciprocity. Eucharist, briefly, invokes the character of promise as the offering of Jesus’s testament as well as a mutual action that is both communion as exchange between God and creation as well as in and amid creation. It would not take much to think through the Eucharist as the liturgical action and embodiment of promise, to reconsider it and its practice toward being otherwise than sovereign, as I have written here. Suffice it to note that the Eucharist is a meal of betrayal, as theVerbaalways announce: “On the night in which he was betrayed.”<br>

Article Title: Literary Unrest: Blanchot, Lévinas, and the Proximity of Judaism<br>

Abstract: Blanchot suggests here that there is something about Judaism that reverses that logic. Proximity to Judaism would seem to undermine the dignity that accompanies self-avowal, the confession of belonging. Does this tell us something about Blanchot or about Judaism? It is striking that in the last three sentences of the passage the language becomes impersonal. There is an absence of personal pronouns to the point of awkwardness. It is as though Blanchot has subtly shifted from speaking about himself to offering general propositions about the relation of
         anyspeaker to Judaism. A note follows. It clearly turns our attention away from Blanchot and toward Judaism. He quotes Lévinas: “Judaism is an essential modality of every human being.” Lévinas makes such a statement in various contexts. He insists that Judasim—beyond its manifestation as the historical tradition of a particular people—is in fact also universalizable. Such statements would seem to enable Blanchot to make known his proximity to it, a proximity, given the halakhic definition of Judaism, that Blanchot, as an unconverted Catholic, would not be able to claim. But Blanchot responds to Lévinas: “an essential modality but most often unrecognized, buried or worse perverted and finally recused.”5Blanchot's reply to Lévinas does not discount Judaism's universality; rather it discounts only its ability to appear as recognizable. He suggests that Judaism is universalizable only insofar as it cannot be taken up, claimed, or inhabited as an identity. Thus we begin to get a sense of Blanchot's critique, although it may not appear as a critique just yet. For, of course, Blanchot's comment that Judaism is most often unrecognized, attacked, or buried appears first and foremost as a judgment on a world that responds to the prophetic Jewish voice by suppressing it. But this explanation does not explain why the comment is a note to Blanchot's statement about Judaism's proximity and unspeakablity. For this statement s~<br>

Abstract: Henry Turner's essay returns us to the very notion of “form” to underscore once again this key commonality that ties together literature and science, the literary scholar, the historian of science, and the scientist. In so doing, he works to dispel the text/action dichotomy, in part by noting that the “category of form” itself embraces “meaningful artifacts” of the sort that constitute the very material tools of the trade of the practices through which scientists make scientific knowledge: for example, “physical specimens, instrument readings, photographs, models.” Citing a range of examples that include Francis Bacon and Galileo, Turner importantly insists that form, while critical to making knowledge, is “never simply a tool of knowledge” but, rather, is always about the constitution of things, about “ontology.” Thus the forms utilized by scientists, whatever their particularity as “meaningful artifacts” may be in a given instance, also serve to gather together, to relate and draw into relation with one another, features of an experienced world that form associations as objects and as “enduring network[s]” of things. The final essay, by Colin Milburn, also highlights the dynamic nature of texts, particularly by drawing attention to their ability to constitute themselves as, and hence actively create, “assemblages.” His discussion of the relation of science to science fiction through processes collectively termed “modding” (processes of “reworking and transforming”) points to just this generative and dynamic property of texts that once again underscores the creative and pragmatic conjoining of text and action. By analyzing the specific forms that “mods” take in translating science fiction among “scientists as cultural consumers” into the work of the laboratory, Milburn provides testimony for one possible site where we may witness the continuing role that the fictive might play in science.<br>

Abstract: Although Larmore’s version of narrative identity is plausible, he leaves it unclear how different “strands” of action can form parts of a single life: given that they have distinct goals (175), why do they not form different selves, unless there is an underlying unity of consciousness not constituted by shared ends or reasons? Similarly, while Ricoeur is correct to say that the possibility of my coinciding with a future person depends on whether there is a “series of commitments” that could make sense of a development from my present orientations to this future configuration (174), it seems implausible that I retrace such developments “in a flash” when involuntarily recalling a very different weave of interests, concerns, beliefs, and ways of being that were mine in a far past (176). Larmore is more convincing in his argument that it may be a mistake to try to control the whole course of one’s life through a “life plan” since much of value in life depends on surprise (179–81). He raises interesting questions about the value of reflection on the whole course of one’s life, given the limits to our agendas and the need for openness to the unexpected (178–85). Yet some perspective on one’s life as a whole must be possible if the unity of practical identities over time has a narrative form. Larmore is surely correct that our affinities which interact with perceived objective goods to give us personal reasons “change over the course of our lives” (189), but that is at least partly because of acts of “will” or explicit resolves to follow certain norms (as Larmore admits: 173–74). Without this distinctive type of commitment, arguably we cannot explain narrative continuity across more dramatic changes in character traits or distinguish between narrative unity of the sort constitutive of selves in general and stronger forms of narrative unity associated with personal autonomy.<br>

Abstract: As in the models analyzed by Nemeroff and Rozin, the distinct characteristics of each image, and particularly the distinct means of purification for each, supports the assumption that they were taken as separate models, despite the fact that they were incorporated into a common category:
         ṭumʾtah. Although the relationship between these images and their role in the semantic development ofṭumʾtahrequires further study, it is possible, at least, to suggest a provisional assessment. I am inclined to view both the uncleanness and infection images as primary (i.e., not derived from one another), and subsequently merged under a single term.
               This convergence can be explained on the basis of the observation that contamination sensitivity is “elicitor neutral,” as explained by Daniel Kelly: “Any elicitor of disgust, regardless of the actual nature of the elicitor or which ‘domain’ of disgust it falls in (physical, social, moral), has contamination potency of the same basic sort.”96
            
               That is to say, the notion of contagion was sufficiently generic to warrant the usage of a common term to describe both uncleanness and infection.97
            
               However, as noted above, the stain-of-transgression image should probably be viewed as a secondary development, modeled after aspects of uncleanness and infection.98

Abstract: Among the multiple dimensions of social and cultural imagination, morality occupies a blurred place across social domains, being Religion, on the one hand, and Law, on the other, the traditional loci of the moral in classical anthropology. Tom Csordas’s article helps us think beyond tradition, pointing out a little addressed topic in the emerging subfield of the anthropology of morality: the notion of
         evil, which, by the way, was and still is of central concern in shamanic and witchcraft studies, and also in certain currents of contemporary philosophy. This article interrogates us about the possibility of defining morality “as a cultural system,” in Clifford Geertz’s sense. In doing so, the author seems to discard finally the idea of morality as a “cultural system” for a less systematic, dispersed set of moral meanings that traverse social life. In this undertaking he does not leave the central Geertzian concern on symbols and meaning. Ultimately, human action is mediated by symbols that condense and produce meaning. Here, meaning seems to be the master concept related to the anthropological study of morality. Among the cultural meanings that shape moralities, Csordas finds appropriate introducing cross-cultural notions of evil to enrich any anthropological approach to morality. In the multifarious realms of morality, evil appears as a complex idiom or code through which moral notions are expressed. And among cultural practices, witchcraft and sorcery are of central concern to understand how many societies build their moral frameworks. Regarded both as a human and a cosmological (or nonhuman) phenomenon, evil in Csordas’s view as a cross-cultural analytical category, might enlighten studies about what I may call the “moral installation in the world.” The latter is related with the existential approach to morality proposed in this article. But I consider that, in conceptual terms, morality is always hierarchically included in ontology (what is the nature of ~<br>

Abstract: Even the king is too constrained by the monarchial model, inasmuch as his royal office subsumes his self in such a way as to inure him to the “elevation” of
      autruiand impedes him from responding as a flesh-and-blood individual to the other before him. The king is not an “I” but a “we,” and the metaphysical plurality of his person inhibits him from assuming the ethical stance of the one-for-the-other. This difficulty is evident in the very first scene, as Lear slips in and out of the third person, recurrently using the royal “we” to make personal demands.
            His erratic usage is indicative of his inability to separate his self from his scepter, an inability that confuses his conversation and complicates his approach to the other. To truly address himself to the other, a king would have to extract himself from his office: he would have to speak in the first person. Henry V attempts something of the sort on the eve of the battle at Agincourt, but he butts up against political impossibility. To enter into relation, a king must do more than borrow a cloak. He must truly depose himself before the other, which would seem to leave us—at least in the case of53
         Lear—without a prince and without a polity.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 674410<br>
Date: 02 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Rüpke Jörg<br>
Abstract: Thus, the hypothesis at the start of this paragraph has been confirmed. Varro wrote historical accounts of religion within a universalistic framework. His intended readers were Roman and his focus was Roman, but his interest was in religion as a universal phenomenon, enabling Italian and imperial communication rather than strengthening mutually exclusive ethnic or urban identities. Intellectually, Varro is to be assigned to contemporaries like Diodorus Siculus or Pompeius Trogus, writers of universal histories.
         
               This was, of course, a minority position in the late republican practice of historiography, which was undoubtedly dominated by the highly individualized and “national” genre of historical epic. Within this context, Varro’s text may be understood as a polemical stance, of that sort that I postulated earlier for any historiography when I claimed that history is never written in the singular, but organizes memories in alternative form.66<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Finally, there is another (less obvious) aspect of Bonhoeffer’s nonreligious interpretation that may be applied to the threat of “religious commercialism.” While reflecting on the meaning of cult and prayer in religionless Christianity, Bonhoeffer directs our attention toward the “arcane discipline” of the early church. Here lies at least a partial answer to the question: “How the type of faith to live in the ‘world come of age’ might secure its boundaries within the world?”
         
               At first glance, prayer and worship seem to be the epitome of other-worldly religious ritual. However, Bonhoeffer finds them necessary to protect the mysteries of the Christian faith against profanation,163
            
               that is, against sliding into either other-worldliness or inwardness and thus becoming banal and shallow. This can be interpreted in terms of Bonhoeffer’s willingness to prevent the nonreligious interpretation from being flattened into a form of liberal humanism, pure anthropocentrism or some sort of prosocial ethical behavior. Despite the fact that in Christ’s incarnation God makes God’s own self radically available to the world—to the point of abuse, marginalization, and (in our times above all) irrelevance—the church is responsible for preventing the gospel from becoming too available, that is to say, too commercialized, too marketable, too self-evident, too easy to talk about, too amenable to the “evangelistic sales pitch.”164
            
               If being a Christian is not to be reduced to believing in certain metaphysical doctrines and practicing certain religious rituals, the church has to keep its rituals and its doctrines, so to speak, as a secret, as a mystery, and as a gift received through revelation—a gift that should be shared with others in such a way that those who accept it are aware of both the value and the cost of discipleship in Christ. All that the world should see on the outside, while observing Christians, is~<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673118<br>
Date: 09 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Huth Kimberly<br>
Abstract: For at least one audience member of
      King Lear, however, viewing the play in the theater is itself a traumatic event that inhibits the interpretation necessary for assimilating the pain and violence into a unified tragic vision. In his lectures on Shakespeare’s tragedies, A. C. Bradley, perhaps in spite of himself and his sensibilities, is particularly interested in tragic pain—or, more precisely, he is interested in tragic suffering and the way the physical pain depicted on stage gets in the way of this more lofty ideal. Bradley repeatedly comments on the excessive or intolerable nature of the pain represented in Shakespeare’s plays, but there are methods of analysis that make some instances of pain more “bearable”: “if we fully imagine the inward tragedy in the souls of the persons as we read, the more obvious and almost physical sensations of pain or horror do not appear in their own likeness, and only serve to intensify the tragic feelings in which they are absorbed.”
            Here Bradley shifts the audience’s imaginative focus to the “inward” rather than the physical pain of the characters, espousing a classic view of tragedy that places bodily pain in service to something else—a different, purer sort of “tragic feeling.” The means of accessing the tragedy makes a significant difference to Bradley, as is abundantly clear in his analysis of40
         King Lear. This play, he states, “is imperfectly dramatic, and there is something in its very essence which is at war with the senses, and demands a purely imaginative realization.”
            Watching and listening to41
         King Learin the theater is, for Bradley, counterproductive; the realization of the characters and their actions on stage actually inhibits the stirring of “tragic feelings” he takes to be Shakespeare’s goal.<br>

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak is concerned with the relation between philosophy and faith, more than any other topic, however. Following his phenomenology of philosophical conversation, he claims, “The encounter with God is somewhat comparable to a face-to-face relationship that stretches me when I look up to a human person who loves me. Since God is infinite, however, faith and love toward God encompass the universe of all that exists. … Faith thus mobilizes and orients the entirety of one’s existence from top to bottom” (120–21). Peperzak regards faith as a fundamental Desire that orients us in an encounter with the absolute. As such, there is no clean separation of faith and philosophy. All thinking emerges from some sort of faith, and while philosophy has a universality that can engender conversation across differences of faith orientation, its autonomy is a relative and limited one. Moreover, Peperzak associates the infinity of God encountered as Other with the Platonic Good that illuminates all thinking and being, while itself escaping thematization: “the
      phila(love) ofphilosophiareaches out toward a wisdom (sophia) that implies … a sense of the difference between this cosmos and the ultimately desired but ungiven Good. … By longing, Eros reaches further than any theory” (159).<br>

Issue: jpolitics.68.issue-2<br>
Date: 05 2004<br>
Author(s): Eubanks Cecil<br>
Abstract: This debate eventually focused on the nature of revelation (letters 35–39), with Strauss having written that “there is an essential distinction between the thinking of the Middle ages, based on revelation, and the thinking of classical antiquity, not based on revelation” (78). Voegelin responded that both revelation and reason are part of a universal human knowledge that is understood concretely and experientially. This prompted Strauss to write back that claims of a universal human knowledge must reside in the realm of philosophy and not in Christianity. To understand Plato properly, one should not impose “biblical concepts,” since they are separate from Greek philosophy. Although Strauss and Voegelin did not resolve this debate, it does clarify and present challenges to both thinkers' philosophies: for Voegelin, the claim that the experience of the divine is the foundation of a universal, human knowledge requires some sort of demonstration in order for him to escape what Strauss referred to as “the desert of Kierkegaard's subjectivism” (88); for Strauss, the tension between reason and revelation suggests a permanent condition of human incompleteness that is unable to point to a right way of life, leading one into nihilism.<br>

Abstract: This article was intentionally written as a sort of conversation with Luis González to whom it is dedicated. It is full of references to his writings and his ideas. Instead of providing a list of historical writings produced in Mexico since 1984, the essay examines the institutional framework in which Mexican historiography is produced and the relationship between institutions and the writing of history. Another goal is to consider the entry into the profession of new generations of historians and, with them, the enormous variety of historical subjects that constitute the new fields of historical research. Finally, the author considers the contrast between the new interpretations and the unwillingness of a public, molded by an official history, to accept them.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz have been concerned with the notion of human action as text. This text, like all texts, has manifest and hidden meanings. The hidden meanings indicate a "semantic" function of social activities, in the sense that they provide members of a society with readings of their experience, by telling them about themselves, their values, beliefs, and cultures. Ricoeur's and Geertz's ideas are used to examine the notion of "education as text". Because Ricoeur and Geertz stress hidden meaning, their ideas lead us to an analysis of the "hidden curriculum". The hidden curriculum is a reading of an educational text, normally performed by students. However, as Ricoeur argues, texts can be read by anyone. The question then arises: which sort of hidden curriculum is read not only by the students, but by all members of society? What sort of reading of society's experience is provided when education is a text read by all? I propose the hypothesis that education then becomes a text about society's myths and sacred beliefs.<br>

Article Title: The First Evil Will Must Be Incomprehensible: A Critique of Augustine<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263713<br>
Date: 9 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Teselle Robert F.<br>
Abstract: The thesis of this paper is that an absolute origin of evil, arising from the free will of a creature, must be incomprehensible. Although Augustine occasionally acknowledges this point, nevertheless in a number of better-known passages (chiefly in The City of God) he attempts to give a causal account of the fall of Adam and/or Satan. Much of the subsequent Christian tradition has unfortunately followed his lead, and major recent commentators routinely ignore or passively approve of his conceptual error. Augustine offers three unacceptable explanations of the fall, which conflict variously with his own doctrines of divine omnipotence, the goodness of creation, and creaturely free will and responsibility, as well as violating the canons of sound argumentation and explanation. First, his contention that free creatures made "out of nothing" inevitably fall makes the fall seem ontologically necessary (unfree) and thereby lays the ultimate responsibility for it on the Creator. Second, the appeal to pride as an explanation is a spurious causal account, for "pride" is only a synonym for "fallenness" itself and not a possible antecedent condition in a being created good and not yet fallen. Finally, his assertion that the first sin is intrinsically comprehensible, but not comprehensible to us because we are fallen, is an obfuscation masquerading as an explanation, for we have no warrant for supposing that this assertion is true or even meaningful. Instead of seeking causal explanation Augustine should have stayed with his own wiser observation that an evil will has no efficient cause. Theology of the Augustinian sort (which comprises much of the Christian tradition) ought to concede that the fall as a work of genuine freedom is an absurd "fact," an incomprehensible given which steadfastly and in principle resists causal explanation. The concluding section of the paper draws upon Ricoeur's insights to tell why the narrative structure of the "Adamic myth" (which has important p~<br>

Article Title: The Theory of International Politics? An Analysis of Neorealist Theory<br>
Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20011187<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Topper Keith<br>
Abstract: In recent years a number of writers have defended and attacked various features of structural, or neo-realist theories of international politics. Few, however, have quarrelled with one of the most foundational features of neorealist theory: its assumptions about the nature of science and scientific theories. In this essay I assess the views of science underlying much neorelist theory, especially as they are articulated in the work of Kenneth Waltz. I argue not only that neorealist theories rest on assumptions about science and theory that have been questioned by postpositivist philosophers and historians of science, but also that the failure to consider the work of these writers yields theories of international politics that are deficient in several respects: they are "weak" theories in the sense that they cannot illuminate crucial features of international politics, they presuppose and sustain a narrow view of power and power relations, they reify practices and relations in the international arena and they offer little promise of producing the sort of "Copernican Revolution" for which Waltz called (or, more modestly, even a minimally satisfactory theory of international politics). In light of these shortcomings, I sketch an alternative approach to the study of international affairs, one that has been termed "prototype studies." I contend that such an approach provides scholars with a rigorous way of studying international politics, without being a theoretical science.<br>

Abstract: The introduction to the symposium sets out a methodological framework for the apprehension of Southeast Asian rituals, languages, and literary texts so that they are at once open to cross-cultural comparative analysis and recorded in social and symbolic contextual detail. Philosopher Paul Ricoeur's use of the term "interpretation" is central here: he urges students of cultures to combine attention to structural features of language and culture (for example, grammatical patterns) with inquiries into social contextual features (for example, speech usage in real communities). Moving back and forth between the two sorts of analysis allows researchers to bring the insights of the one pole to the investigation of the other; the full hermeneutic process constitutes interpretation. This style of inquiry, a modification of the sort of interpretive social science developed by Geertz and Becker, allows Southeast Asianists to draw on careful ethnography to make crucial "course corrections" in anthropological and linguistic theory building in general.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur distills this point well: "When we discover that there are
several cultures instead of just one and consequently at the time when we acknowledge
the end of a sort of cultural monopoly, be it illusory or real, we are threatened with the
destruction of our own discovery. Suddenly it becomes possible that there are just
others, that we ourselves are an 'other' among others" (History and Truth [Evanston,
Ill., 1965], p. 278).

Abstract: Remonstrances (jian ﻿諫) reveal a great deal about the writing of history in China during the Eastern Zhou. As represented in the Zuozhuan and Guoyu, remonstrances, like other speeches, are normally delivered in court and address questions of official policy. They tend to test contemporary phenomena against the lessons of the past, especially as those lessons have been formulated in the Shijing, the Shangshu, aphorisms, and other forms of what I term "inherited speech." Remonstrances also have the support of the third-person historical narrative which surrounds them; the ruler who ignores a remonstrance always suffers for his obstinacy. After briefly discussing the importance of speeches in the Zuozhuan and Guoyu, I outline the structure of a remonstrance and examine four passages in which critical speech, including remonstrance, is said to have circulated freely in the courts of an idealized early period. Next I show how remonstrances match observed historical particulars with fragments of inherited speech. The famous remonstrance of Gong zhi Qi, an exemplary episode, shows how this application of inherited speech guides rhetorical choices and establishes Traditionalist or Confucian terms as the keys to historical intelligibility. Finally, I examine a set of remonstrances which are exceptional in that they do not include overt citations of inherited speech. Among these, military remonstrances can genuinely eschew explicit citation of lessons of the past, while others borrow the authority of inherited speech without seeming to do so. In one case, a brief remonstrance has apparently acquired the status of an aphorism, so that already when it is first uttered it qualifies as a sort of inherited speech. In another case, a precursor of the indirect remonstrances (fengjian ﻿諷諫) of later periods, remonstrators use a theatrical combination of actions and speech to criticize their superior's departure from correct ways. As texts in which the speakers (and behind them the aut~<br>

Abstract: The paper examines the process of figurative reading in the presence of a marker (like / as), namely the unique cognitive impact caused by shaping figurative expressions as similes. The solution is sought through theoretical discussion and analysis of relevant excerpts from Hebrew poetry. Recently Bethlehem argued that a simile does not necessarily indicate the presence of resemblance of some sort; the simile only presents itself as such via its marker, like/as, but actually it can bear a variety of figurative relations, of which metaphoric relations are only one possible option. Consequently, simile has only coincidental relations with metaphor, if any (Bethlehem, 1996: 1997) First I address this criticism, trying to reinforce the widespread view that a simile is indeed a sub-type of metaphor, and that there is no fundamental difference between them, that is, comprehension processes in metaphor and simile are basically similar. Next I distinguish the simile from the literal comparison in a new comprehensive way. Finally I try to identify and study the special impression a figurative expression might create as a result of being shaped as a simile. Despite this basic sameness of simile and metaphor, the marker's presence in a simile has its unique cognitive effects, accumulating to a distinctive impact. I analyze the unique cognitive effects potentially evolved during the construction process of the simile's meaning. In this analysis this paper reexamines central issues pertaining to similes, their essence, and the cognitive processes they trigger in readers. Among these I focus on a problem never thoroughly explored so far: the essential nature of the coexistence of similarity and dissimilarity (without working against each other) in both metaphor and simile.<br>

Abstract: No one owns the concept 'culture' Anthropology's long-standing proprietary claim on the concept rests on three sorts of contentions — none of which are convincing Anthropology's overwhelmingly interpretive approaches to cultural materials have led to a preoccupation with the details of cultural materials at the expense of formulating explanatory theories This has, among other things, rendered fieldwork experience sufficient for professional credentials However, if the details are all that matter, then comparative and cross-cultural research, as well as most of the social sciences, make no sense Contrary to this view, it is proposed here that theories reveal which details matter Cognitive accounts of the sort we advanced in Rethinking Religion (1990) offer a firm theoretical basis for cross-cultural study of religious materials Other types of research concerning non-human primates, early childhood development, and various social and cognitive impairments also offer insight into culture (without relying on fieldwork studies)<br>

Author(s): Scuccimarra Luca<br>
Abstract: Moving from Koselleck's most recent essays on Historik, the author explores the role played by historiography in the constitution of historicity as a peculiar experiential dimension of human existence. The essay focuses on the complex link between difference and repetition which, according to Koselleck's theory of experience, constitutes a "specific historical temporality" and its inner articulation. Actually, it is by exploring the "formal temporal structures" which constitute the horizon of historical intelligibility that Koselleck brings to light the decisive role that the point of view of historiography has for the constitution of man as the subject of historical knowledge and action. It is difficult to ignore the importance of this theory of historical temporalization in an age in which the End of History rhetoric tends to transform itself in a sort of media gospel.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Abstract: This article tries to give an outline of Christian ethics in a pluralistic world most clearly characterized by its Babel of moral languages. There is no longer any single valid moral language. The liberal solution to establish a neutral moral language – a moral Esperanto – to solve this crisis of modernity is not possible without turning into some sort of moral imperialism. To avoid, however, the other extreme – nihilism – this article follows to some degree "communitarian" thinkers like A. MacIntyre, J. Stout and M. Walzer. Every ethics must be rooted in a narrative tradition and needs a concrete community as its precondition. The second part of this article addresses the narrative structure of Christian ethics. At first it follows MacIntyre's insight that every ethics is based on myth. It differs, however, from MacIntyre's position by putting special emphasis on the substantial content of the Christian "myth". With the help of Girard's mimetic theory this article distinguishes between archaic myths that are the product of the scapegoat mechanism and identify with the view of the lynch mob and the Biblical history of salvation that consists of a story written from the perspective of the victims of collective persecution. In the center of Christian ethics we find the example of Jesus Christ – the victim of collective violence par excellence – and the example of those of his disciples who became aware of their own contribution to Jesus's death and converted to the side of the victim. The third part of this article addresses the question of the concrete community that makes Christian ethics possible. Again MacIntyre's communitarian emphasis on the connection between concrete communities and ethics is taken as a starting point. Whereas communitarians, however, tend to support patriotism the community necessitated by Christian ethics is the universal Church. Patriotism like the ancient Greek polis is essentially characterized by its enmity to outside communities, a frie~<br>

reconnu, un «continent inexploré». Encore fallait-il l'explorer! Je suis en ce sens frappée du
fait que les trente adultes avec lesquels j'ai mené des entretiens cliniques et qui - dans leur
immense majorité - ont été conçus dans le cadre des Cecos se sont tous plaints que l'institution
ne se soit jamais intéressée à leur sort pas plus qu'à celui de leurs parents... On connaît la rai-

Abstract: L'article aborde la problématique herméneutique africaine par le biais de la phénoménologie, un courant philosophique contemporain inauguré par Husserl. Sans discuter le rapport spécifique à l'Afrique, il développe partiellement un programme qui pourrait s'intituler « la crise de la conscience africaine et la phénoménologie » et qui bénéficie aujourd'hui des progrès des études scientifiques africaines, précisément celles de Abdou Touré, sociologue ivoirien et Goran Hyden. Dans un premier temps, l'auteur expose le fondement concret de la démarche critique : c'est la crise africaine articulée au concept phénoménologique du monde de la vie. Dans un second temps, les résultats de cette explication sont illustrés à partir des ouvrages de Abdou Touré et Goran Hyden. Le premier démontre le caractère schizophrénique de la culture officielle ivoirienne et le caractère endogène antagonique du travail populaire spontané. Le second met en cause l'économie politique africaine en proposant le concept d'« économie de l'affection ». Cependant, la perception théorique de celle-ci n'a pas empêché l'auteur suédois de retomber dans l'eurocentrisme. Si elle évite ce genre d'écueil, la phénoménologie peut enrichir considérablement de son radicalisme critique le programme herméneutique, auquel Kwamé Nkrumah et Cheikh Anta Diop ont contribué de façon décisive. This article takes a new approach to African hermeneutical problematics by way of phenomenology — the contemporary philosophical current initiated by Husserl. Without touching on the specific relationship to Africa, it partially develops a proposition which could be called « the crisis of phenomenology and the African conscience », a programme which profits nowadays from the progress in African scientific studies as exemplified by Abdou Touré (a sociologist from the Ivory Coast) and Goran Hyden. In the first part, the author presents the concrete basis for his method : the crisis in Africa articulated in terms of the phenomenological~<br>

Abstract: Comme le montre l'excellent article de E. Eliasson {art. cit.), il est par
ailleurs très intéressant de noter que, chez les médioplatoniciens, cette reprise
se fera à partir d'une double réception : celle du mythe d'Er, à partir duquel il
s'agit d'articuler les rôles respectifs de l'action humaine (le choix), de l'inter-
vention divine ou du destin (exécution de ce choix) et du tirage au sort
(hasard); et celle de la conception aristotélicienne du έφ' ήμίν, pensé à partir
de DI13 comme non-nécessaire et identifié à l'action humaine, dont la réalisa-
tion et les conséquences sont pour leur part assimilées au destin. Le destin, dès
lors, inclut tout, mais certaines choses à titre d'hypothèses (nos choix et actions
identifiées au έφ' ήμίν) et d'autres à titre de conséquences (leurs effets). Le
έφ ήμίν est donc inclus dans le destin, mais non soumis au destin, ce qui per-
met, comme le note E. Eliasson, d'éviter les « conséquences déterministes de
la théorie stoïcienne ». Sur ce point, voir également S. Bobzien (art. cit.), qui
montre la façon dont, à travers cette reprise, la notion de έφ ήμίν se trouvera
subordonnée au contingent et, plus précisément, à ce qui arrive non pas la plu-
part du temps ou rarement, mais à ce qui arrive « en part égale », que Némésius
(De la nature de l'homme, 104. 6.7; 114.21.2), comme Plutarque (Du destin,
571 c-d), identifient à ce que nous sommes capables de faire et son opposé.
Dans cette tradition, elle montre donc que le concept de έφ' ήμίν se trouve
pensé à partir de trois sources aristotéliciennes : la question du délibérable

Abstract: On this last point see my oration Relatieve autonomie als kruispunt van wegen
(Relative autonomy at the crossroads), given on the occasion of my taking up the
post of professor of the philosophy of the socio-cultural sciences at the Free
University, lOth October 1980. There I pointed out that marxists on the whole
gloss over this choice (esp. note 25). Peter Singer recently made a number of inter-
esting observations about this in the context of a review of several new publications
on Marx's view of history. See for example the following passages on William H.
Shaw's Marx's Theory of History (Stanford Univ. Press): 'Shaw has to admit that
the arguments Marx offers for the key idea of historical materialism — that material
production dominâtes social life — are "flimsy and perfunctory". How can this be,
if Marx considered himself a scientist and this was his great discovery? Shaw's
explanation is that Marx was so convinced that the primacy of production was
obvious that he did not see the need for more argument. But why was he so con-
vinced that it was obvious? Here Shaw uneasily confesses: "one senses that Marx
and Engels attached some sort of ontological primacy to material production, from
which its explanatory weight for social science follows". In short, Marx and Engels
simply regarded production as more "real" than politics, religion and ideas.' (Peter
Singer, New York Review of Books, 20 December 1979, p. 45).<br>

Abstract: Cf. George Steiner, A/ter Babel, Aspects of Language and Translation (Oxford Univer-
sity Press, 1975), for perhaps the best comparative analysis of state-of-the-art in translation
theory. George Steiner himself seems to prefer a special sort of interlinear literalist
option (but not 'a word-for-word' transference) that has the translator remain selflessly
submerged within the original tongue, producing a centaur idiom in which one's own
longue takes on a 'deliberate strangeness', and the product becomes virtually an unknown
tongue 'which can transcend the constraints of imprécise objective reference' (pp.307-33).
Steiner approves of Hölderlin's approach, and crédits Chesteron on Du Bellay and Leyris
on Hopkins as superb approximations of the true translation (pp.407-13).<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i24708868<br>
Date: 1 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Klapwijk Jacob<br>
Abstract: The process of positivization taken as an explication and application of normative
principles needs to be sharply distinguished from a supposed général process of disclosure of
norms, a sort of évolution and progression of the human spirit such as one finds in German
romanticism and to some extent still also in Kuyper and Dooyeweerd. See ]. Klapwijk,
"Verschuiving van normen en historistische filosofie," 36-40. Explication and application go
hand in hand. In the idea of progressive disclosure, however, the notion of contextualization
— the application of norms to spécifie situations — grows vague. Because the conditions of
human life undergo unremitting change, the process of positivization requires resumption
time and time again. Cf. S. Griffioen and J. Verhoogt in Norm and Context, 13; see also the
conclusion of the present essay.<br>

Abstract: The fact that the generation of both soul (supra-temporally) and body (temporally) derive
from the pre-existence of the already created whole man, understood as entirely contained in
the heart or soul as the radical religious root of personality, underscores the claims of those
who, following Vollenhoven's problem-historical method, find some sort of "priority theme"
or "monarchian" element in Dooyeweerd's thinking, along with some variety of "instru-
mentalism" and "impetus theory" (see, e.g., Vollenhoven's "De consequent probleem-
historische méthode," Philosophia reformata 26 (1961), 19-22, cited in Steen, Structure, p. 43, n.

Author(s): Glas Gerrit<br>
Abstract: An example may help to illustrate this point. The scientist who investigates the neuro-
hormonal regulation of mood should ask whether this inquiry concerns mostly the area of the
biotic substructure, for example in the case of molecular-biological study of receptor changes;
or whether the inquiry is in the area of the psychical substructure, for example in the case of
various types of mood changes due to (pharmacological) manipulation at receptor level. In the
first case the mood regulation comes into (anticipatory) view as psychical object function
within the biotic substructure. In the second case we are dealing with a biotic subject function
within the psychical substructure (or as biotic object in the psychical modal function). The
problem in this sort of research is that the two perspectives alternate, and so easily lead to a
short-circuit. Mood changes are then causally attributed to neuronal processes. In terms of
Dooyeweerd's system this attribution implies a double short-circuit: modal and in terms of
entities. The principle of (modal) sphere sovereignty does not allow causality between functio-
nal modes (it does allow coherence). The idea of foundational enkapsis allows no causality
between substructures. It does allow coherence and integration within a structural whole. Com-
pare Glas (1991, Chapter 6) and Glas (2001, Chapter 4).<br>

Abstract: Concerns about advertising take one of two forms. Some people are worried that advertising threatens autonomous choice. Others are worried not about autonomy but about the values spread by advertising as a powerful institution. I suggest that this bifurcation stems from misunderstanding autonomy. When one turns from autonomous choice to autonomy of persons, or what is often glossed as self-rule, then one has reason to think that advertising poses a moral problem of a sort so far unrecognized. I diagnose this problem using Charles Taylor's work on "strong evaluation". This problem turns out to have political ramifications that have been only dimly recognized in business ethics circles.<br>

Abstract: That Cassian should posit some sort of intrinsic connection between the
soul aflame with love of God and the filial adoption implied in the term "Our
Father" is interesting. It is evocative of a relatively common image in patristic

properties of fire. The doctrinal thèmes of synergy, divinization, adoption, cré-
ation, and rédemption all Cluster here.<br>

Abstract: There are, of course, discussions of this sort in a variety of modern moral and political
theories. For example Onora O'Neill has given accounts of this issue from a strongly
Kantian perspective, and the notion of reasonableness and what it leads to plays a central
role in John Finnis's influential rearticulation of Natural Law theory. See Onora O'Neill,
'Vindicating Reason', in The Cambridge Companion to Kant, ed. Paul Guyer (Cambridge,
1992); and John Finnis, Natural Law and Natural Rights (Oxford, 1980). The beginnings
of my own approach to this question can be found in Political Theory, Modernity and
Postmodernity, Chs. 3 and 4.<br>

Abstract: According to Philip Rieff, Freud affirms the distance of the individual from the com-
munity, and in this sense psychoanalysis agrees with liberalism. The Freudian individual is
aloof from politics and learns not to seek radical changes in society, avers Rieff. That individ-
ual adapts to society in a calculated way which suits his or her needs: 'a rationally alienated
person learns how to guard against social over-investments, and how to make them when
necessary' (Philip Rieff, Freud: The Mind of a Moralist (Garden City, NY, 1961), p. 278).
Freud, then, teaches that the individual's attachment to society should be dependent on a
rational, economic exercise—on the conscious distribution of instinctual energy. Moreover,
once psychoanalytic therapy becomes a way of life, it contributes to detachment from others
by enhancing self-absorption. 'While enjoining a person to be less severe with himself,
observes Rieff, 'Freudian analysis may also develop in the patient new qualities of self-
suspicion... The therapy manufactures a new sort of conscience, one which demands a more
accurate and yet more scrupulous self-centeredness' (ibid., pp. 106-7).<br>

Abstract: This paper aims to stress the anthropological relevance of
         La vendetta barbaricina come ordinamento giuridico(1959), the most famous Antonio Pigliaru’s book, by showing some methodological affinities with Mauss’sEssai sur le don. The author maintains that, exactly as it was affirmed by Alain Caillé in this latter case, it is possible to single out a sort of “third paradigm” operating in Pigliaru’s analysis ofvendettain traditional Sardinia. To emphasize this feature of Pigliaru’s book also allows us to throw a fresh look at the lasting but often unprofitable debate concerning the most appropriate label – Law or Anthropology – for defining the subject of his most important work.<br>

Issue: i27582855<br>
Date: 6 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Payen Pascal<br>
Abstract: The article proposes to analyse the fictional aspects in history writing. Indeed, history doesn't borrow from fiction its compositional techniques only; the discursive strategy which consists in narrating a story is in fact part of historical knowledge as such. A study of Cambysis's biography in Herodotus (II,l-III,66) leads us to grant a very specific function to Book II dealing with Egypt—nearly always considered as some sort of useless overgrowth—and to the "secondary remarks" concerning the Greek world (III,38, 39-60). Setting the Egyptian civilization as a foil enables Herodotus to establish a parallel between expansionist ideas and folly and he includes the Greeks in a plot itself critical of helleno-centric ideology. Our methodological approach owes as much to Ricœur's hermeneutics, as to H. R. Jauss's esthetics of reception and to the various streaks of narratology (narrative syntax and "mise en abîme"), with a view to showing that, once replaced in its "Erwarthunghorizonte", the form of the historical narrative makes full sense.<br>

Abstract: A presente análise do conto "Seqüência", do livro Primeiras estórias, de Guimarães Rosa, pretende demonstrar um recurso recorrente de estruturação das "estórias" do autor. Esses enredos mobilizam, de uma maneira geral, o motivo da viagem e, de uma maneira particular, o percurso do eterno retorno. Nesse trajeto estrutura-se a travessia por um rito de passagem, cujo desfecho dá-se, com uma espécie de sobrelevação lendária, numa paisagem mítica. Para perfazer esse processo, o autor parte de um motivo da cultura popular que acaba amalgamado ao universo da tradição erudita, por meio de referências à tradição da história do gênero da narrativa e de seus códigos míticos. /// This analysis of "Seqüência", a short story from the book Primeiras estórias, by Guimarães Rosa, aims at showing a recurrent device used in the author's stories. These plots have, in a general sense, the motif of travel and, in a strict sense, the journey of eternal return. In this path, the traverse is structured through a rite of passage, whose completion occurs at a mythical scenery as a sort of legendary lifting. In order to accomplish this process, the author's starting point is a motif of popular culture, which ends up by being amalgamated to the universe of the erudite tradition, through references to the narrative genre historical traditions and to its mythical codes.<br>

Abstract: Quels rapports peuvent se nouer entre travail et liberté, dès lors que le travail n'est plus essentiellement vécu comme la marque sociale de l'aliénation de la liberté dans l'économie? C'est Marx qui élabore pour la première fois et avec beaucoup de rigueur cette question, en formulant la théorie des deux règnes, celui de la nécessité et celui de la liberté dans le cadre de l'utopie communiste. Pour autant, sa position du problème n'est pas sans maintenir toute une série d'ambiguïtés. En nous appuyant sur les analyses contrastées de Simone Weil et d'André Gorz, nous montrons la dépendance de toute pensée de l'émancipation vis-à-vis d'une philosophie de la liberté qui assume (Gorz) ou qui n'assume pas (Weil) une certaine épaisseur irréductible de tout collectif humain, c'est-à-dire une indépassable hétéronomie de la condition humaine. What sort of connections can be formed between work and freedom, since the work is not essentially lived any more as the social mark of the alienation of the freedom in the economy? It is Marx who elaborates for the first time this problem by formulating the theory of both reigns, the reign of the necessity and the reign of the freedom, within the framework of the communist utopia. For all that, his position of the problem is not without maintaining a whole series of ambiguities. By pressing us on the analyses of Simone Weil and André Gorz, we show the dependence of any thought of emancipation towards a philosophy of the freedom which assumes (Gorz) or which does not assume (Weil) a certain inflexible thickness of any human collective.<br>

Abstract: Interpretation has been an issue in political theory for nearly two decades, but its influence for the most part has been limited to problems in the history of ideas. In this article, William Adams uses the methodological claims of the "new historians" of political thought as a point of departure to argue for an interpretive approach to contemporary theory. He contends that an important part of the task of political theory is to fashion critical interpretations of contemporary political culture. He claims further that many of the great works in the history of political thought pursue a strategy of this sort and might therefore be useful as models of political/cultural criticism. Adams elaborates his thesis with a brief analysis of Plato's critique of poetry in the Republic.<br>

Abstract: As religiões podem ser consideradas como sistemas simbólicos mediante os quais os seres humanos ao longo da sua história sempre procuraram encontrar sabedoria em ordem a enfrentar o mal Um olhar pela história das religiões oferece-nos dados que podem ser compreendidos a partir de três tipos ideais de atitude básica em relação ao problema: Ascese, Gnose, Praxis. O Budismo originário, o Maniqueísmo e a religião bí-blico-cristã são exemplificações disso mesmo. Mais do que uma opção pela exclusão, os membros da nossa cultura ocidental iluminada demonstram uma preferência pela atitude práxica. É a partir dela que nos cabe recuperar os valores das outras. Isso é também o que em muitos significa a presença de uma certa nostalgia pela "espiritualidade oriental". Ou ainda, como modesta gnose, a "teodiceia" (porquê tanto mal?): tão pouco prometedora enquanto resposta (teórica), como inevitável enquanto pergunta. /// Religions can be viewed as symbolic systems with which human beings have throughout history sought the wisdom which enables them to face evil. A survey through the history of religions exhibits features which may be brought to three ideal types of basic attitudes: the ascetic, the gnostic and the 'praxical'. Original Buddhism, Manichaeism and the biblical-Christian Religion exemplify them. Men and women of our occidental, enlightened culture need not to take an exclusive option thereabout. They show a preference for the praxical trend, even though at the same time they also retrieve some of the values of the other ones. Signs of this can be seen in the interest of many for 'oriental spirituality' as well as in that sort of modest gnosis which is "theodicee "(Why so much evil?): always unpromising as a theoretical answer and unavoidable as a question. /// Las religiones pueden ser consideradas como sistemas simbólicos con los que los seres humanos hemos buscado en nuestra historia una sabiduría para afrontar el mal.

Abstract: La fiction est en général considérée comme une notion univoque. Or, le terme renvoie selon les contextes à des faits très différents, voire incompatibles : illusion cognitive, leurre, postulat d'indétermination ontologique, expérience de pensée. La tendance actuelle qui consiste à interpréter les textes ethnographiques ou historiographiques comme relevant du régime fictionnel n'est pas faite pour clarifier la situation. L'hypothèse défendue ici est celle d'une spécificité irréductible de la fiction artistique fondée sur une détermination qui n'est pas d'ordre sémantique mais pragmatique : cristallisation culturelle d'une compétence mentale (la simulation) et interactionnelle (la feintise ludique) particulière, la fiction artistique se distingue à la fois des autres types de fiction (qui relèvent d'une définition sémantique) et des récits véridictionnels (pour lesquels la question de la référentialité est la pierre de touche). Fiction is usually considered to be an unequivocal concept. However this term refers to quite different, even incompatible, facts depending on the context: illusions, artifices, the postulate of ontologica! indétermination, and thought experiments. The current tendency of interpreting anthropological or historical texts as fiction does not clarify the situation. The hypothesis is defended that « artistic fiction » has an irreducible specificity, which is determined pragmatically instead of semantically : the cultural crystallization of a mental (simulation) and an interactional (pretending to play) competence. This sort of fiction thus stands apart from other types (which answer to a semantic definition) and from veridical narratives (where the question of referentiality is the touchstone).<br>

Abstract: II n'y a rien d'étonnant à ce que la religion soit au départ de la philosophie. Sicelle-ci poursuit la connaissance la plus ample et la plus approfondie de la réalité telle qu'elle nous est donnée, elle ne peut faire abstraction de la religion comme phénomène humain universel, c'est-à-dire comme un fait qui a un sens. Ce sens nous paraît être donné dans une expérience du rapport réel de l'homme qui prie, avec Dieu, soi-même, le prochain et le monde. Cet article se limite aux relations de l'homme qui prie avec soi-même, le dialogue ego-(Dieu)-ego. Ce dialogue est un effort de sincérité au sens d'authenticité. La sincérité de l'homme qui prie apporte, en premier lieu, de la clarté et de l'unité dans l'homme lui-même. Dans la prière une harmonie s'établit à un triple niveau : au plan extérieurintérieur : je me présente à Dieu tel que je suis ; au plan de la temporalité : une unité se fait dans ma vie à la suite de la compréhension du présent avec une rétention du passé et une protention vers l'avenir ; au plan du rapport moi-réel et moi-idéal se manifeste un mouvement vers l'honnêteté et la loyauté. La prière de contrition éclaire la formation de mon moi au point de départ ; l'impétration d'une vie morale au point d'arrivée. En cas d'accord du moi-extérieur avec le moi-profond, tout n'est pas encore dit. Il importe de savoir comment va s'orienter le moi-fondamental. Vais-je me replier orgueilleusement sur moi-même ou m'ouvrir humblement à Dieu ? Le choix ultime : Dieu / moi-même, déterminera la qualité de l'ego. Celui qui choisit Dieu entrera en une relation d'amour avec lui. Non seulement l'amour unit, mais il exige l'abandon de tout ce qui n'est pas la personne aimée. La vie de l'homme qui prie se présente comme un rapprochement de Dieu et un abandon toujours plus prononcé de tout le reste. C'est un processus d'abaissement qui commence, basé sur la collaboration de Dieu et de l'homme. Parfois l'initiative de l'homme prédomine, comme dans l'ascèse, parfois celle de Di~<br>

Article Title: Stanley Cavell on Modern Music: "Music Discomposed" and "A Matter of Meaning It" after Forty Years<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>

Abstract: Cavell's influential mid-1960s critique of the "new music" of the postwar era poses significant challenges for contemporary composers who value this music. As with postmodernist critics, he has ably identified shortcomings in justifications for recent modernist music. With the benefit of time, however, the distance between Cavell's and the postmodernists' views concerning subjectivity and the role of the arts in defining it have become increasingly clear. In Cavell's scenario, a contemporary listener or critic confronted with the new music faces a sort of existentialist crisis: he or she is unable to individually affirm the value of a music that conforms to no recognizable models for music yet accepts the fact that this music is, according to Cavell's model of modernism, the fruit of an inexorable historical development. Cavell's interest in this dilemma stems. from the wider aims of his philosophical project, particularly his focus on the perils of the nihilism he finds evident in deterministic and mechanistic theories of the arts. In this light, in both "Music Discomposed" and "A Matter of Meaning It," Cavell appears to be using new music primarily as a vehicle to articulate his concerns and to criticize formalist theories of artistic interpretation, such as that of Wimsatt and Beardsley. Unfortunately, there is little evidence of an effort on Cavell's part to engage this music with the same seriousness that is evident in his writings on modernist authors and visual artists. Toward the end of the article, attention is drawn to the ethical responsibility, given the situation Cavell has sketched, for a critic of the modern arts to make a commitment, either to an existing modern music or to a possible future music.<br>

Abstract: Since its first publication, A Costa dos Murmúrios has attracted the critics' attention to the paradox of the explicit denial of its own authority over the historical facts that are part of the narration and its implicit, if qualified, affirmation of the same authority. This article also focuses on the sort of subliminal tension but from the angle of the literary construction of emotions, rather than examining either the poetics of historiographic metafiction or the role of memory in the narration of the past. Analyzing various aspects of A Costa dos Murmúrios (such as the predominant points of view, the structure of the narrative, the disintegration of the characters' identities, the emotional impact of a few vivid scences, the personalization of national events), a case is made for reading this novel as an intimate chronicle of historical facts.<br>

Abstract: O objetivo deste artigo é apresentar os significados atribuídos pelos muçulmanos à matança do carneiro, que acontece todos os anos na Festa do Sacrifício (Eid Al-Adha), a segunda maior da religião islâmica. Para dar conta desses significados, lanço mão da teoria winnicottiana do não-eu, expressão esta também cunhada na forma de não não-eu por Richard Schechner para tratar da atuação do ator. O artigo explora a idéia de que o carneiro ocupa o lugar do fiel que se entrega a Deus, estabelecendo uma analogia entre o sacrifício do carneiro e o sacrifício daquele que é muçulmano. In this article I would like to explore the multiples senses that muslins attributes to the sacrificial goat at the Feast of Sacrifice, Eid Adhha, one of the most important celebrations of the Islamic calendar, second only to Ramadan. This sacrifice is here analyzed from the perspective of D.W. Winnicott's psychoanalytical theory, as a sort of transitional object, "not me" and "not not me", the latest also supported by Richard Schechner when focuses the actor's experience. The idea developed here is to demonstrate that the goat occupies the devotee's place and establish an analogy between the goat sacrifice and the sacrifice of the one that is a muslin.<br>

Abstract: On associe généralement la figure de Satan à une signification indigente ou mesquine. Dans la Philosophie de la révélation, Schelling tente au contraire d'en donner une interprétation différente, selon laquelle la « mauvaiseté positive » de Satan n'est pas seulement assumée, mais également revalorisée. Cependant, le rôle de Satan demeure ambigu, incarnant à la fois le tentateur universel et le maillon nécessaire à la révélation de Dieu lui-même. Dans cette étude, il s'agit donc de montrer à la fois la nature amphibolique du Diable, et de rendre compte des multiples endossements qu'il recouvre. Une tâche qui implique précisément la mise en évidence du rôle incontournable de Satan dans la victoire finale du bien, et qui se manifeste, en termes schellingiens, par l'incompatibilité de l'homme avec le feu dévorant du principe de lumière, laquelle nécessite un principe obscur qui hâte la séparation, pressent le mal et le provoque. One usually associates the figure of Satan with an impoverished, insufficient signification. On the contrary, in the Philosophy of Revelation Schelling tries to give a different interpretation, according to which Satan's potential for evil is not only accepted but embraced and given a positive valence, postulating a sort of "positivity of evil". However, Satan's role remains ambiguous, since he represents both the universal tempter and a necessary link in the process that reveals God's presence in the world. In this paper, I want to emphasize the Devil's twofold nature and to explore his multiple forms. This highlights Satan's necessary role in the final triumph of good, and how this role appears, in Schellingian terms, through the human inability to sound the depths of the consuming fire of divine light, which necessitates the existence of a dark principle that entails a separation, foreknows evil and thereby creates it.<br>

Abstract: La « Fédé » (Fédération française des associations chrétiennes d'étudiants) sort renforcée de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale. Influencé depuis le début des années 30 par la théologie de Karl Barth, le mouvement se tourne davantage après 1945 vers le monde et les problèmes politiques. Les étudiants protestants s'insèrent aussi dans la vie associative universitaire et sont partie prenante du développement de l'UNEF. Dans ces cinq années qui suivent la guerre, on voit poindre un certain nombre de tensions entre la jeunesse « fédérative » et les instances religieuses adultes. At the end of second World War, the "Fède" (French Student Christian Federation) has grown stronger. Influenced since early thirties by Karl Barth's theology, the movement shows after 1945 more interest in world affairs and political problems. The protestant studients also get involved in the university's associative life and take part in the development of the student's trade union, the « UNEF ». During these five years following War some tensions become perceptible between the federative youth and the religious adults' organisations. Mit dem Ende des zweiten Weltkriegs ist die « Fédé » (der französische Verband der christlichen Studentenvereine) noch stärker geworden. Ab 1945 interessiert sich die seit dem Anfang der 30er fahre von K. Barths Theologie beeinfluβte Bewegung immer mehr für die Welt und deren politische Probleme. Die protestantischen Studenten beteiligen sich auch häufig an dem Vereinsleben der Universität und wirken aktiv bei der Entwicklung der UNEF mit. Während der ersten fünf fahre nach Kriegsende treten einige Spannungen zwischen einer fugend, die sich für diese christlichen Vereine interessiert, und den religiösen Behörden der Erwachsenen auf.<br>

Abstract: Cet article commence par definir ce qu'est un « protestant » et ce qu'est un « intellectuel ». Puis il s'ttache à retracer la démarche d'un certain nombre d'intellectuels protestants en deux temps, avant et après 1914. Pour chacune de ces periodes il présente les lieux d'expression des intellectuels protestants, les principales figures et, enfin, il retrace leurs thèmes de réflexions. Cela lui permet de proposer une sorte de « type idéal » de l'intellectuel protestant durant les années 1870-1914; pour les annees 1914-1940 l'image de ces intellectuels est plus éclatée puisqu'ils se voient dans l'obligation de repenser leur place dans une société française déstabilisée par la guerre. The article begins with definitions of « Protestant » and of « intellectual ». It then traces the activities of a certain number of Protestant intellectuals in two periods, before and after 1914. For each of these periods, the channels of communication used by Protestant intellectuals, the leading figures and, finally, the major intellectual preoccupations are presented. What emerges is a sort of « ideal type » of Protestant intellectual during the period 1870-1914; for the Years 1914-1940 the image of the intellectuals is more diversified, since they find themselves obliged to rethink their place within a French society destabilized by the war. Dieser Beitrag wird mit einer Begriffsbestimmung eröffnet : Was ist ein « Protestant », was ist ein « Intellektueller ». Sodann wird der Entwicklung einiger protestantischer Intellektueller im Zeitraum vor und nach 1914 nachgegangen. Für beide werden die Orte und die Personen, die wichtige Rolle gespielt haben, und schließlich die Themen ihres Nachdenkens beschrieben. So gelingt es, eine Art Idealtyp des protestantischen Intellektuellen während der Zeit von 1870-1914 vorzustellen, während dies für die Jahre von 1914-1940 erheblich schwieriger ist : Das Bild der Intellektuellen ist in dieser Periode erheblich vielfaltiger, da sie ihre Stellung in e~<br>

Abstract: This is partly an allusion to Wittgenstein on language games but I am emphasising the sense of play to add to what he says of games, life and travel. On language games, see more in
         Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-religion/ (accessed 18 February 2010): Some properties of language-games can be noticed in Wittgenstein’s several examples and comments. They are, first, a part of a broader context termed by Wittgenstein a form of life (see below). Secondly, the concept of language-games points at the rule-governed character of language. This does not entail strict and definite systems of rules for each and every language-game, but points to the conventional nature of this sort of human activity. Finally, Wittgenstein’s choice of ‘game’ is based on the over-all analogy between language and game, assuming that we have a clearer perception of what games are. Still, just as we cannot give a final, essential definition of ‘game’, so we cannot find ‘what is common to all these activities and what makes them into language or parts of language.’<br>

Abstract: It is not new for poets to renovate the language of poetry by appropriating or sending up enervated, devalued language as a way to critique discourses of power. It may even be one of the oldest methods of literary innovation, considering the Roman appropriation of Greek literature. But some contemporary, experimental poets explicitly link mass production of capitalist consumer products and the logic of the copy
         
               to the production of art in a Benjaminian vein. De la Torre refers to the age of mechanical reproduction in an epigraph to “Photos While U Wait,” which she borrows from Jacques Barzun's introduction to Gustave Flaubert's110
            Dictionary of Accepted Ideas: “The cliché, as its name indicates, is the metal plate that reproduces the same image mechanically without end.”
               Poems written under constraint and composed of recombined, appropriated text at times thematize the activity of appropriation itself as endemic to capitalism. The supermarket is a popular trope for the destruction of authenticity, disenfranchisement, and advertising's interpellation of the subject. A discursive tone dotted with imperatives mark these poems, as they echo the language of consumerism. African American poet Harryette Mullen's111
            S*PeRM**K*T, included in herRecyclopedia, is structured according to the logic of supermarket aisles (“sort of like your shopping list”), and the missing letters in its title spell outu are, as in, “you are what you eat,” as Mullen explains in an author's note. “I was thinking about domestication, about the role of women, women as consumers, women having supposed power as consumers but also being disempowered in other ways…. You can't necessarily buy who you really want to be. You have to buy the available images,” she writes in an accompanying statement.
               Mullen, like Hayes, also connects her poetics to that of a woman poet predecessor. Her books112

Abstract: The inherent distance, boredom, and looming tragedy climax at Gatsby's last party. Nick depicts his feelings toward this party with sober sadness: “There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn't been there before” (104). As usual, Nick's emotions are suggested by the language. Words such as “harshness,” “desolate” and “crushed,” which phonetically sound unattractive, are not found in the first part of
         Gatsby. These words not only communicate emptiness and regret for the passing summer, but also convey a more symbolic meaning, the tragedy of life: today is tomorrow's past. The potent boats that “slit” the water in the beginning are replaced by “one small sail [that] crawled slowly toward the fresher sea” (118). And if the first parties revealed that those in attendance were exactly where they wanted to be, they seem restless now. Inspired by the pioneer spirit and “the moon … in the western sky,” they want to go west just like Wilson, who wants to take Myrtle with him (120).<br>

Abstract: By contrast, Jacques Maquet observes the separate status of North or European Africa but gives no reason for its omission from the cultural areas of the African continent. Maquet, however, makes a strong but speculative case for the cultural unity of sub-Saharan Africa. He begins by first stressing the great diversity that is present throughout the continent. But he also insists that there is cultural unity: “From Conakry to Mogadishu, from Khartoum to Durban, one may perceive a certain felt quality.” Maquet argues that while certain material cultural products such as sculpture are diverse, perhaps encompassing hundreds of different styles, “it is easy to perceive a certain relationship between African works of different origin, since one can pick them out from collection of traditional pieces from Oceania, America, and Asia.”
         
               Maquet does present empirical data as the basis for what may appear to be an assertive intuitive and speculative thesis. He divides the continent of Africa, excluding North Africa, into six civilizations: the civilizations of the bow, of the clearings, the granary, the spear, of cities, and of industry. Maquet is at pains to make sure that he does not account for this unity in terms of any sort of racial or biological essentialism. The unity seems to be a trait acquired through the adaptation to the ecology of the continent and through the various modes the inhabitants have created to maintain their existence.12<br>

Abstract: Is SPEP the city of God? This would be going too far. Not even the theological turn in French Phenomenology would make this claim. Dick Howard already threw in a troubling question: “diversification that perhaps gives more breadth than depth?” he asked. And there are plenty more troubling questions. SPEP is now a big operation. It has committees and subcommittees, multiple simultaneous sessions, blind review. All these developments are signs, perhaps inevitable ones, of its success, but all have familiar downsides: bureaucratization, diversification for its own sake, what Habermas would call
   Unübersichtlichkeit. This is what happens when outsiders become insiders, the antis become their own sort of establishment. You can't blame some of us for feeling nostalgic for our long-lost innocence, even though we all know—you don't have to be a philosopher of history to know this—that we can't go there. History has rendered a judgment, but Dick Howard said, “Historywilljudge.” That's one problem with history: It's always rendering judgments, but they are never final. You'd have to be at the end of history for that, and despite the claim of some philosophers, we aren't there yet. The slaughter bench of history looks very different today from the early 1960s, but it's still in some ways a slaughter bench. So how will the SPEP of the early twenty-first century look to the philosopher-historians of 2061—or is it 2062?<br>

Article Title: American Continental Philosophy in the Making:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Here is part of what I meant when I said that the early meetings were theoretically disorganized. There was no mainstream of American Continental philosophy, no orthodoxy, and on our side at least, no bright red line between what was philosophy and what was not. The pervasive mood was youthful and inclusive—and so, exactly the sort of atmosphere where novices could find their own voices. From this unsynthesizable disarray of speakers and attendees, I learned to assume that just about anything, even mathematical and logical things, can be treated phenomenologically—indeed perhaps especially when tradition tells us not to. Yet I also learned that no one can ever be entirely sure about the best way to address the things themselves, even when we have them in our sights. In one of the earliest meetings—I think it may have been the fourth—I remember attending an evening seminar on phenomenology and natural science, where the speakers were Theodore Kisiel, Patrick Heelan, and van Fraassen. Except for the fact that they are all white males, I retain an image of their discussion as modeling what the study of science as a human practice will eventually be, when traditionally trained epistemologists have stopped writing most of the textbooks and nobody reads the Leiter report. As Heidegger quips, we should always strive to treat phenomena phenomenologically. It seemed that for the most part, we understood this point without assuming we had already found the best way to do it. In this situation, hearing many disparate voices helped.

Abstract: But consider the referents when I say, “Come here, I want to show you a gorilla,” “Come here, I want to show you a human being,” “Here look at this beautiful woman,” “Look at this hunk of a man,” and so forth, all of which feature properties. Now consider a quite different display: “Come here, I want to show you a person.” What are we here looking for? How does it differ from an individual human being? Granted that we in fact use
            personas synonymous withhuman being, are we here merely displaying an individual human being or instance of the kind called “human”? Consider the resistance in saying, “Come here, I want to show you a Barak Obama.” We might, of course, have in mind a political style or character and thus refer to a constellation of properties. But we would not be referring to the person, Barak Obama, certainly not to what he refers to when he says “I,” but, for example, to a type, a certain sort of politician.

Abstract: 1976. Heidegger's death: he joins the mighty dead and remains today as “Heidegger's ghost.” Often cited as the founder of philosophy of technology, he remains almost the only figure of a cadre of European philosophers of the early twentieth century still discussed concerning technology. I use his death date as the watershed between the “Old” and “New” technologies. Heidegger divided his technologies in various ways, most often by contrasting old, largely handcraft technologies to “Modern” or industrial technologies. Stone bridges, jugs, peasant shoes, Greek temples, and his famous hammer stand out for the first; Rhine River dams, steel bridges, the atom bomb, death chambers, and modern agriculture are examples of the modern. Modern technologies are mass-produced, gigantic, and largely mechanical—in short, “industrial” of the sort so familiar early in the twentieth century. I stick to 1976 as my watershed, in spite of the fact that most of his late work on technology was done in the mid-1950s.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Journal Title: Shaw<br>
Article Title: Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: The aspects of Ricoeur's philosophical reflections on faith and hope that directly concern us address areas of inquiry pursued by Immanuel Kant: ethics, religion, epistemology, finitude (the notion of limits), and art. One of the main questions that intrigued Kant in the realm of ethics—the domain of practical thought that asks, what ought we to do?—is this: why does the will in its freedom so often choose as the maxim of its intended action a principle that cannot pass the test of universalization (the categorical imperative)? Why, he wanted to know, is the will bound? What holds the will captive to the extent that it cannot legislate the proper moral law? How, he wondered, can freedom be unfree? How can it be held in bondage? What force is so potent that it can render the free will servile? To this bewildering enigma, Kant offered a solution familiar to religious traditions in the West: radical evil. In his
         Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone, Kant argues that radical evil is the unfathomable phenomenon that prevents the actualization of human freedom. This sort of evil, says Kant, is real, irrational, and radical in the sense that it is always already there in experience. It precedes us; it is in our midst, and, to varying degrees, we contribute to it through our own behavior. Because radical evil is everywhere in history, this ubiquity places a limit on what we finite creatures can do in the world. It enslaves the will and thus far has nullified efforts to liberate it in a way that enables humans to achieve the good life—what Kant calls the kingdom of ends and we can call global wellness.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Twentieth-century modern architecture, particularly in association with city planning, has, at least since the 1950s, been derided for its utopian ambitions. Postmodern architecture emerged in the mid-1960s—both as a “new” style and as simply that architecture coming after modern architecture—ostensibly in response to revelations, writ in concrete, that the grand narratives of modern architecture were exaggerated and untenable. In all of its guises, postmodern architecture has mostly positioned itself as
         otherthan modern architecture, largely through articulations of its negative relationship to Utopia. More precisely, if modern architecture is conventionally characterized (no matter how questionably) as having been fundamentally utopian in its aims and delusions, postmodern architecture—in its many appearances, from stylistic historicism to a sort of hypermodernism—is normally self-consciously characterized by adherents as being intrinsically anti-utopian. Following on from this, postmodern practices—processes as much as results—are asserted as embodying wise resistance to the hazards of utopian dreaming. Having learned from the apparent utopian failures of the past, architects today like to imagine themselves as being immune to Utopia, ostensibly assuring that their work will also have overcome the utopian fiasco of twentieth-century architecture, particularly in its attempts to remake the city.<br>
