  Abstract: The narrator of
                  In Search of Lost Timeis beset by trauma. By his own admission, he locates suffering in two maternally marked experiences in his past. The event he cites first is that fateful evening when his “mother abdicated her authority,” in the young Marcel’s bedroom at Combray; the second encompasses the many months during which the narrator observed the slow death of his grandmother.¹ The narrator is anguished: not only did he inflict pain on his mother when he “traced in her soul a first wrinkle and caused a first white hair to appear,” but also he wounded<br>

  Abstract: A lexis de Tocqueville recalled reading a news story during his visit to the United States in the 1830s about a court in New York where a witness declared that he did not believe in the existence of God or the immortality of the soul. As a result of the witnessʹs confession, the judge refused ʺto accept his oath, given, he said, that the witness had destroyed in advance all the faith that could have been put in his words.ʺ Apparently astonished by the story, Tocqueville added to his report the fact that the newspaper offered no commentary about the<br>

  Abstract: Canto XXI is in many ways a canto of thresholds and surprises or, as William Stephany has emphasized, of conversions. These threshold crossings involve both poetic and religious issues, nor can the two ever be far apart for Dante. The canto, which introduces a major classical poet and discusses the influence of Virgil’s poetry, is also the first in which we meet a soul fully cleansed of sin and ready to ascend to Paradise. Beginning with the appearance of Statius and ending with his recognition of Virgil, this canto offers the last concentration on classical poetry before the series of<br>

  Abstract: This chapter focuses on the indispensable role that, as Homi K. Bhabha suggests, “forgetting” plays in the construction of national subjectivity: “Being obliged to forget becomes the basis for remembering the nation, peopling it anew, imagining the possibility of other contending and liberating forms of cultural identification.”¹ Most of the classical ideologues of nationalism assert that the nation is a form of collective identity grounded in a shared sense of the past. Ernest Renan, for example, maintains in his influential 1882 lecture, “
                  Qu’est-ce qu’une nation?” (the subject of Bhabha’s comments as well), that two things constitute the “soul or spirit”<br>

  Abstract: American anthropology opened up a Pandora’s box the moment it specified culture as its object, simultaneously setting itself at a distance from the natural sciences and defining itself in contradistinction to both American cognitivism and French structuralism. By the 1980s, the discipline was engaged in a soul-searching movement to critically assess its object, its principal method, and the most current form of the write-up of research results. In 1986, two books appeared seeking to provide a focus for this wide-ranging debate:

  Book Title: Sin Boldly!-Justifying Faith for Fragile and Broken Souls<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): MARTY MARTIN E.<br>
  Abstract: Can faith as trusting God make a difference? Absolutely—by relieving our anxiety over self-justification and the need to scapegoat others. When we discover we don't justify ourselves because God has justified us, we become free. What Sin Boldly! points to is the presence of the crucified and living Christ in the human soul, placed there by the Holy Spirit. And this becomes transformative. Sin Boldly! provides an experiential analysis of the contrast between self-justification and justification by God. Those among us with fragile souls are anxious, and we shore up our anxiety with walls of self-justification that victimize those whom we scapegoat. Those among us with broken souls have lost the very moral universe that makes any kind of justification possible, and this usually leads to anomie and suicide. We must pose the question: how can the gospel of grace provide transformation for both fragile and broken souls? After an exposition of the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, this book proposes the following answer: trusting in the God of grace relieves anxiety and provides a divine vocation that transcends our moral universe with the promise of forgiveness, renewal, and resurrection.<br>

Instead, animate movement effectively enables our minds to commune so that we can subsequently share the world in speech. In this chapter on metaphysics, I wish to clarify conceptually the resources involved in sharing the world.<br>

  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): PATTERSON DAVID<br>
  Abstract: "In the Holocaust novel, silence is always a character, and the word is always its subject matter." So writes David Patterson in this profound and original study of more than thirty important writers. Contrary to existing views, he argues, the Holocaust novel is not an attempt to depict an unimaginable reality or an ineffable horror. It is, rather, an endeavor to fetch the word from silence and restore it to meaning, to resurrect the human soul, to regenerate the relation between the self and God, the self and other, the self and itself.<br>

  Abstract: “Sie haben alle müde Münde / Und helle Seelen ohne Saum [they all have weary mouths / pure souls without a seam],” wrote Rilke longingly.¹ Humans in their mortality could not hope to attain the enviable purity of the awe-inspiring and mysterious angelic soul. The yearning for soul has become far more complex in postmodernity, in that “soul” has been rendered moot in modernity’s various accounts of mind-body dualism. In its Cartesian version, mind as the ground of certainty came to occupy the void left by the evacuation of soul. With the demise of the modern subject, famously described as<br>

  Abstract: Symeon the New Theologian (949–1022), arguably the most important Byzantine religious thinker between John of Damascus in the eighth century and Gregory Palamas in the fourteenth, often presents salvation as a heavenly marriage.¹ Scholars have long noted Symeon’s frequent use of erotic and nuptial imagery to explore the relationship between the monk and God.² What scholars have generally failed to notice or account for is that much of this imagery is homoerotic. In contrast to more common tendencies to celebrate the consummation of male divinity with a monk’s feminized soul, Symeon emphasizes the masculinity of the monk’s body. I<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenologies of the Stranger: Between Hostility and Hospitality-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: What is strange? Or better, who is strange? When do we encounter the strange? We encounter strangers when we are not at home: when we are in a foreign land or a foreign part of our own land. From Freud to Lacan to Kristeva to Heidegger, the feeling of strangeness-das Unheimlichkeit-has marked our encounter with the other, even the other within our self. Most philosophical attempts to understand the role of the Stranger, human or transcendent, have been limited to standard epistemological problems of other minds, metaphysical substances, body/soul dualism and related issues of consciousness and cognition. This volume endeavors to take the question of hosting the stranger to the deeper level of embodied imagination and the senses (in the Greek sense of aisthesis). This volume plays host to a number of encounters with the strange. It asks such questions as: How does the embodied imagination relate to the Stranger in terms of hospitality or hostility (given the common root of hostis as both host and enemy)? How do we distinguish between projections of fear or fascination, leading to either violence or welcome? How do humans sensethe dimension of the strange and alien in different religions, arts, and cultures? How do the five physical senses relate to the spiritual senses, especially the famous sixthsense, as portals to an encounter with the Other? Is there a carnal perception of alterity, which would operate at an affective, prereflective, preconscious level? What exactly do embodied imaginariesof hospitality and hostility entail, and how do they operate in language, psychology, and social interrelations (including racism, xenophobia, and scapegoating)? And what, finally, are the topical implications of these questions for an ethics and practice of tolerance and peace?<br>

Nor does genealogy seek to do so, as long as it is understood as the reflexive art of tracing implications, lineages, and inheritances, for such extirpation would at once neutralize the very possibility of genealogy, denying the lines of descent (

  Book Title: Mexico in Verse-A History of Music, Rhyme, and Power<br>

  Author(s): BEEZLEY WILLIAM H.<br>
  Abstract: The history of Mexico is spoken in the voice of ordinary people. In rhymed verse and mariachi song, in letters of romance and whispered words in the cantina, the heart and soul of a nation is revealed in all its intimacy and authenticity.
      Mexico in Verse, edited by Stephen Neufeld and Michael Matthews, examines Mexican history through its poetry and music, the spoken and the written word.Focusing on modern Mexico, from 1840 to the 1980s, this volume examines the cultural venues in which people articulated their understanding of the social, political, and economic change they witnessed taking place during times of tremendous upheaval, such as the Mexican-American War, the Porfiriato, and the Mexican Revolution. The words of diverse peoples-people of the street, of the field, of the cantinas-reveal the development of the modern nation. Neufeld and Matthews have chosen sources so far unexplored by Mexicanist scholars in order to investigate the ways that individuals interpreted-whether resisting or reinforcing-official narratives about formative historical moments.The contributors offer new research that reveals how different social groups interpreted and understood the Mexican experience. The collected essays cover a wide range of topics: military life, railroad accidents, religious upheaval, children's literature, alcohol consumption, and the 1985 earthquake. Each chapter provides a translated song or poem that encourages readers to participate in the interpretive practice of historical research and cultural scholarship. In this regard,Mexico in Verseserves both as a volume of collected essays and as a classroom-ready primary document reader.<br>

  Author(s) Kripal Jeffrey J.<br>
  Abstract: Within the long and varied tradition of medieval Christian commentaries on the Song of Songs, the yearning for the beloved, articulated from both masculine and feminine perspectives, becomes key to a hermeneutic construction illuminating the relation of the divine to the cosmos, the community of believers, and the individual soul. There are specific adumbrations of this tradition in which the virgin Mary is read into the story as the desiring bride. The liturgies for the Marian feast days drew upon the Song (as well as on other passages from the biblical Wisdom literature), and these Marian liturgies in turn necessitated<br>

Take the example of North America, where the evangelical movement has been influential not only in the Protestant church but society as a whole. From evangelicals’ balanced approach to soul-saving and social services, to the “Great Reversal” completed during the fundamentalist-modernist controversy of the 1920s and 1930s, to the re-emergence of the sense of social responsibility among evangelicals since the 1970s, the rise of American evangelicals’ social consciousness and commitment is quite dramatic.

They do so in order to state that the personal identity will endure in a different world, in a different kind of life.

  Book Title: The Philokalia and the Inner Life-On Passions and Prayer<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Cook Christopher C.H.<br>
  Abstract: The Philokalia was published in Venice in 1782. It is an anthology of patristic writings from the Eastern Church, spanning the 4th to the 15th Centuries, which has been the subsequent focus of a significant revival in Orthodox spirituality. It presents an understanding of psychopathology and mental life which is significantly different to that usually encountered in western Christianity. It also presents accounts of both mental well-being and the pathologies of the mind or soul that are radically different to contemporary secular accounts and yet also find remarkable points of similarity with contemporary psychotherapeutic approaches, such as cognitive therapy. The book provides an introduction to the history of the Philokalia and the philosophical, anthropological and theological influences that contributed to its information. It presents a critical account of the pathologies of the soul, the remedies for these pathologies, and the therapeutic goals as portrayed by the authors of the Philokalia. It then offers a critical engagement of this material with a contemporary understanding of psychotherapy. Finally, it raises important questions about the relationship between thoughts and prayer.<br>

  Book Title: The Resounding Soul-Reflections on the Metaphysics and Vivacity of the Human Person<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Kimbriel Samuel<br>
  Abstract: It is surely not coincidental that the term “soul" should mean not only the centre of a creature’s life and consciousness, but also a thing or action characterized by intense vivacity (“that bike’s got soul!"). It also seems far from coincidental that the same contemporary academic discussions that have largely cast aside the language of “soul" in their quest to define the character of human mental life should themselves be so – how to say it? – bloodless, so lacking in soul. This volume arises from the opposite premise, namely that the task of understanding human nature is bound up with and in important respects dependent upon the more critical task of learning to be fully human, of learning to have soul. The papers collected here are derived from a conference in Oxford sponsored by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy and together explore the often surprising landscape that emerges when human consciousness is approached from this angle. Drawing upon literary, philosophical, theological, historical, and musical modes of analysis, the essays of this volume vividly remind the reader of the power of the ancient language of soul over against contemporary impulses to reduce, fragment, and overly determine human selfhood.<br>

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

However, when it comes to describing human nature, all scientific, philosophical, and theological anthropologies speak in a variety of different ways of the different “components” that go to make up the human being, for the most part using terms such as “soul” (or “spirit”) and “body.” More recently it has become common to speak of the “mind” or the “brain.” Humans, we are told, are composed of two fundamental elements or aspects, more or less linked with one another, the body and<br>

  Book Title: The Vision of the Soul-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson James Matthew<br>
  Abstract: Ours is an age full of desires but impoverished in its understanding of where those desires lead-an age that claims mastery over the world but also claims to find the world as a whole absurd or unintelligible. In
      The Vision of the Soul, James Matthew Wilson seeks to conserve the great insights of the western tradition by giving us a new account of them responsive to modern discontents. The western- or Christian Platonist-tradition, he argues, tells us that man is an intellectual animal, born to pursue the good, to know the true, and to contemplate all things in beauty. Wilson begins by reconceiving the intellectual conservatism born of Edmund Burke's jeremiad against the French Revolution as an eff­ort to preserve the West's vision of man and the cosmos as ordered by and to beauty. After defining the achievement of that vision and its tradition, Wilson off­ers an extended study of the nature of beauty and the role of the fine arts in shaping a culture but above all in opening the human intellect to the perception of the form of reality. Through close studies of Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Maritain, he recovers the classical vision of beauty as a revelation of truth and being. Finally, he revisits the ancient distinction between reason and story-telling, between mythos and logos, in order to rejoin the two.Story-telling is foundational to the forms of the fine arts, but it is no less foundational to human reason. Human life in turn constitutes a specific kind of form-a story form. The ancient conception of human life as a pilgrimage to beauty itself is one that we can fully embrace only if we see the essential correlation between reason and story and the essential convertibility of truth, goodness and beauty in beauty. By turns a study in fundamental ontology, aesthetics, and political philosophy, Wilson's book invites its readers to a renewal of the West's intellectual tradition.<br>

The great philosophers of beauty in the eighteenth century, including Burke, Hume, and Kant, treated beauty as a matter of sensation or taste, as either a physiological experience or a spiritual one, but always a subjective one. The arts of the beautiful were thought “to gentrify” the soul, softening it, making it more sympathetic in itself and sociable as part of a culture.¹ They succeeded in providing to the<br>

Since divination seems not to have a place in the normal modes of thinking, they propose that some other form of insight dwells in the soul’s other parts, situated closely to our creaturely selves.

  Book Title: Antropologia-  Publisher: John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin, Faculty of Philosophy<br>
  Author(s): JANECZEK Ks. Stanisław<br>
  Abstract: Antropologia [Anthropology] is a gateway to the series of volumes devoted to particular disciplines of philosophy, taking into account their relationship with the Christian worldview and recognizing the need to include the philosophical and ideological diversity of contemporary culture. Antropologia covers Thomist tradition, enriching its achievements with other perspectives, especially Karol Wojtyla's personalism. Increasing influence of "third culture thinking", where the humanities are carried out in the context of the natural sciences, justifies the need to take up the difficult task of demonstrating complex problems of philosophical and natural anthropology. Anthropological considerations force us to realize the multifaceted nature of classical discussions on the nature of man, including theirs scientific and ideological facets, and to demonstrate them in a well-balanced manner. In this context, it enables readers to gain guidance in the debate on the philosophy of mind, providing ways of understanding and assessing the problem of the human soul (concerning the mind-body problem).<br>

As I argued, Westphal is almost always discussed alongside his friend Caputo as both represent different, opposing sides of various debates in Continental philosophy of religion in North America. On the one hand, Westphal argues for a ‘thick theology’—a hearty soup—that provides a theistic, religious appropriation of postmodern thought to nourish the believing soul. On the other hand, Caputo analyses theism through a radical critique of religion’s onto-theo-logico-centrism. Caputo’s postmodernism declares that religion must be rethought—even to the point<br>

In the enthusiasm surrounding populism, concrete categories within the population—professions, at times contradictory interests, class distinctions—tend to be elided over in favor of a fiction of an all encompassing, omnipresent, and omniscient people, who are believed to have a single soul and unified identity.

Rather (like Aristotle’s sensus communis), it gathers them up into one experience. “[T]he ‘real’ outness of parts in the body has no truth for the sentient soul.”² The feeling soul in the body is “one simple, omnipresent unity.”³<br>

  Book Title: Soul-Black Power, Politics, and Pleasure<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Green Richard C.<br>
  Abstract: No other word in the English language is more endemic to contemporary Black American culture and identity than "Soul". Since the 1960s Soul has been frequently used to market and sell music, food, and fashion. However, Soul also refers to a pervasive belief in the capacity of the Black body/spirit to endure the most trying of times in an ongoing struggle for freedom and equality. While some attention has been given to various genre manifestations of Soul-as in Soul music and food-no book has yet fully explored the discursive terrain signified by the term. In this broad-ranging, free-spirited book, a diverse group of writers, artists, and scholars reflect on the ubiquitous but elusive concept of Soul. Topics include: politics and fashion, Blaxploitation films, language, literature, dance, James Brown, and Schoolhouse Rock. Among the contributors are Angela Davis, Manning Marable, Paul Gilroy, Lyle Ashton Harris, Michelle Wallace, Ishmael Reed, Greg Tate, Manthia Diawara, and dream hampton.<br>

  Abstract: Analytical philosophers in the twentieth century have produced a rich literature that includes the philosophy of religious language and practice, analyses of divine attributes, arguments for and against the existence of God, and arguments over the significance of religious diversity, religious experience, and religious values. Theists, atheists, agnostics, and adherents to both Christian and nonChristian religions have engaged in a fruitful exchange on these topics with all the hallmarks of analytical philosophy: an emphasis on conceptual clarity, the use of analyses with examples and counter-examples, concentrated arguments about whether concepts of what exists (God, the soul, the afterlife) may be<br>

  Abstract: In the nineteenth century the natural sciences underwent a radical transformation. The paradigms of many of the disciplines that we know today, such as geology, chemistry, thermodynamics, cell biology or evolutionary biology, were established in this period. Prior to this period, knowledge of nature was a part of philosophy, as the examples of Leibniz or Descartes show. Moreover, the Kantian critique of metaphysics from the

Through oral narratives, communities have been able to pass on values, attitudes, knowledge and modes of practice to generations. Because ‘story telling occupies a natural role in many African cultures’ (Pillay 2003: 109), it has the potential of functioning as a key strategy for the promotion of health and well-being.

He argued that whereas it appeared that the soul moves the body to act, and injects it with animal spirits, in fact the body moves of its own accord, through various mechanical operations effected by the nerves, the muscles, and the brain; and that the soul, whose thoughts could be<br>

  Book Title: The Science of the Soul in Colonial New England-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): RIVETT SARAH<br>
  Abstract: The Science of the Soulchallenges long-standing notions of Puritan provincialism as antithetical to the Enlightenment. Sarah Rivett demonstrates that, instead, empiricism and natural philosophy combined with Puritanism to transform the scope of religious activity in colonial New England from the 1630s to the Great Awakening of the 1740s.In an unprecedented move, Puritan ministers from Thomas Shepard and John Eliot to Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards studied the human soul using the same systematic methods that philosophers applied to the study of nature. In particular, they considered the testimonies of tortured adolescent girls at the center of the Salem witch trials, Native American converts, and dying women as a source of material insight into the divine. Conversions and deathbed speeches were thus scrutinized for evidence of grace in a way that bridged the material and the spiritual, the visible and the invisible, the worldly and the divine.In this way, the "science of the soul" was as much a part of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century natural philosophy as it was part of post-Reformation theology. Rivett's account restores the unity of religion and science in the early modern world and highlights the role and importance of both to transatlantic circuits of knowledge formation.<br>

  Abstract: The dangers of misapplied science, fully realized in the Salem witchcraft trials and the events’ larger context in Royal Society debates, put tremendous pressure on the science of the soul. By the late-seventeenth century, Harvard-trained ministers and Royal Society natural philosophers continued to advance their practices, though with renewed caution, aware both of mechanical philosophy’s limitations and the parameters surrounding empirical inquiry—especially interdictions against studying preternatural phenomena. Yet neither New England ministers nor London natural philosophers abandoned efforts to apply empirical methods to advance knowledge of God.

  Abstract: “The most secret movements of the soul,” writes Friedrich Schiller in 1780, “are revealed on the exterior of the body”; each emotion has its own specific means of expression or, more precisely, “its peculiar dialect, by which one knows it.”¹ Accordingly, the “language” of the emotions is—in the opinion of Schiller and his contemporaries—a physical one. It follows that the dancer, whose means of expression is the body, has a virtually unparalleled command of this language. The philosopher Johann Georg Sulzer likewise observes in 1774 in his

  Abstract: From Yü Ying-shih's perspective, the Dao, or the Way, constitutes the inner core of Chinese civilization. His work explores the unique dynamics between Chinese intellectuals' discourse on the

Volume 1 ofChinese History and Cultureexplores how theDaowas reformulated, expanded, defended, and preserved by Chinese intellectuals up to the seventeenth century, guiding them through history's darkest turns. Essays incorporate the evolving conception of the soul and the afterlife in pre- and post-Buddhist China, the significance of eating practices and social etiquette, the move toward greater individualism, the rise of the Neo-Daoist movement, the spread of Confucian ethics, and the growth of merchant culture and capitalism. A true panorama of Chinese culture's continuities and transition, Yü Ying-shih's two-volume Chinese History and Culture gives readers of all backgrounds a unique education in the meaning of Chinese civilization.<br>

Abstract: This remark is inspired by Jérôme Baschet’s emphasis on the “spiritual body” as a duality characterized by the domination of the soul over the body and by the body’s elevation through submission to the soul.

Abstract: On the other hand, the computer also makes it possible to visualize all dysfunctioning in the mechanical body (the computer is reflexive or says something about itself), for example,
         chair‐in. Yet we have seen that dysfunctioning in Hawking’s human body does not preclude the activity of writing, whereas dysfunctioning in the mechanical body precludes all interaction. It therefore also precludes the possibility of mobilizing the assistants and allowing the human body or the mechanical body to be repaired, as well as all possibility of writing.53As I observe Hawking orchestrating the functioning of his extended body through the mediation of the computer, I cannot help but think of the materialization of the “pilot in his vessel,” a metaphor used by Descartes to describe the difficult union of body and soul:
               
         Nature likewise teaches me by these sensations of pain, hunger, thirst, etc., that I am not only lodged in my body as a pilot in a vessel, but that I am besides so intimately conjoined, and as it were intermixed with it, that my mind and body compose a certain unity. For if this were not the case, I should not feel pain when my body is hurt, seeing I am merely a thinking thing, but should perceive the wound by the understanding alone, just as a pilot perceives by sight when any part of his vessel is damaged; and when my body has need of food or drink, I should have a clear knowledge of this, and not be made aware of it by the confused sensations of hunger and thirst: for, in truth, all these sensations of hunger, thirst, pain, etc., are nothing more than certain confused modes of thinking, arising from the union and apparent fusion of mind and body.

Abstract: This was a proud list for Old England; and the account of their lives, their zeal, their eloquence and sufferings for conscience sake, is one of the most interesting chapters in the history of the human mind. How high it can soar in faith! How nobly it can arm itself with resolution and fortitude! How far it can surpass itself in cruelty and fraud! How incapable it seems to be of good, except as it is urged on by the contention of evil! The retired and inflexible descendants of the Two Thousand Ejected Ministers and their adherents are gone with the spirit of persecution that gave a body and soul to them; and with them, I am afraid, the spirit of liberty, of manly independence, and of inward self‐respect is nearly extinguished in England.

Abstract: Not only does man know that he does not know himself, even if this were only because within his most intimate depths he discovers an unfathomable memory: “Magna vis est memoriae, nescio quid horrendum, Deus meus, profunda et infinita multiplicitas. Et hoc animus est et hoc ego ipse sum. Quid ego sum Deus? Quae natura sum?” (“Great is the power of memory, an awe‐inspiring mystery, my God, a power of profound and infinite multiplicity. And this is mind, this is I myself. What then am I, my God? What is my nature?”).
         31But above all, man understands, within this impasse, that the one who is alone in knowing him remains for him another, namely, God: “Utrum ita sim, nescio. Minus mihi in hac re notus sum ipse quam tu. Obsecro te, Deus meus, et me ipsum mihi indica” (“Whether I am one or the other I do not know. In this matter I know myself less well than I know you. I beseech you, my God, show me myself”).32Under Augustine’s analysis, man’s incomprehensibility to himself thus takes on yet wider and vaster dimensions. To begin with, as in the Greek fathers, the analysis points out not only the image and likeness of God within man’s incomprehensibility but also a unique privilege held by the human being with regard to all other creatures (which only resemble theirgenus, which is to say, themselves). Next, this incomprehensibility tells man that he goes beyond and exceeds himself, in short that “l’homme passe infiniment l’homme” (“man transcends man”), following the formulation of an exemplary Augustinian: in a word, man passes beyond his own means, man lives above his means.33Finally and above all, according to a strict consequence, only the infinite and incomprehensible can comprehend man, and thus tell him of and show him to himself; only God can reveal man to man, because man only reveals himself by revealing, without knowing it, the one whose image he bears. Not only is it true that “Je est un autre” (I is another), but this other calls himself God within man,~<br>

Abstract: As a norm of modern writing, brevity is something other than the soul of wit. When new genres of writing emerged with the aim of transmitting information, new techniques of economizing transmission were called forth by that aim. These genres did not rely only on a method of using fewer words to do the same job. The standardized form, for example, discarded the connective tissue of sentences and paragraphs altogether in order to transmit information in a new way: by dividing up the page into fields, by offering boxes to fill or check rather than sentences to write.
            50The shift from continuous prose to a graphically organized page is just as much a feature of writing in modernity as its degeneration into prolixity. So the memo replaced elaborate salutations with fields: “To” and “From.” This also is brevity.<br>

Abstract: For some time now it seems to have been understood among feminist theorists, particularly white feminist theorists, that questions of race and colonialism are being suitably addressed within gender studies and that everyone is aware of the problems of approaching the questions of gender and sexuality from a seemingly unraced perspective, particularly since the very notions of race, gender, and sexuality have been thoroughly destabilized.
      1The consensus seems to be that the kinds of challenges posed by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak in her landmark1981essay “French Feminism in an International Frame” or even later by bell hooks in her bookFeminist Theory: From Margin to Center(1984) have now been met. At quick glance, the contemporary situation of gender studies seems promising. There has been a proliferation of critical works theorizing gender from the perspective of African American women, Latinas, Asian American women, and third‐world women, as well as those who identify with the larger constituency of women of color. Witness titles such as Hazel Carby’sReconstructing Womanhood: The Emergence of the Afro‐American Woman Novelist(1987) andRace Men(1998), Trinh T. Minh‐ha’sWoman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism(1989), Patricia Hill Collins’sBlack Feminist Thought(1990), and Carole Boyce Davies’sBlack Women, Writing and Identity: Migrations of the Subject(1994), as well as classic anthologies such asMaking Face, Making Soul/Haciendo Caras: Creative and Critical Perspectives by Feminists of Color(Anzaldúa1990) andThird World Women and The Politics of Feminism(Mohanty, Russo, and Torres1991). Of the multitude of recent works by white feminists and gender studies theorists, several have been particularly influential: Teresa de Lauretis’sTechnologies of Gender(1987); Judith Butler’sGender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity(1990),Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of “Sex”(1993), andAntigone’s Claim(2000); Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick~<br>

Abstract: Compare Marino,
            Dicerie sacre, “La pittura,” pt. 1, 119. Marino compares God to a mirror that reflects the soul’s truthful image. If God withdraws, the soul becomes unable to see itself. The image of mirrors reflecting mirrors is a topos of baroque love poetry. The innumerable sonnets written in seventeenth‐century Italy on this subject aim to create a sense of labyrinthine astonishment, an inner vertigo, the baroque “marvel.” For example, see Giovan Battista Marino,Rime amorose, ed. Ottavio Besomi and Alessandro Martini (Ferrara: Edizioni Panini, 1987), sonnets 11–13. This series of poems is entirely dedicated to the topos of the mirror. The most complex and accomplished is the third in which Marino imagines that the mirror reflecting his beloved’s image was made of the tears he had shed and that had become a lucid surface (sonnet 13, verse 2, 61). “The angelic splendor of this goddess” (i.e., his beloved) has turned the mirror into a small heaven, since it reflects the woman’s luminosity (verses 3–4). Love has allowed the metamorphosis of the poet’s tears into mirror, so that his “beautiful sun” (his woman, verse 6) can see what he hides “in the mirror of my heart” (verses 7–8) and detect her beauty in the surface of his visible sorrow. The external mirror is thus a reflection of the poet’s inner mirror in which the luminous woman reflects upon her own image.<br>

Abstract: Plato did not start this ancient quarrel, but he did draw its lines especially sharply and influentially. At least a seventh of his
         Republicaddresses why the poets—such as Homer, Hesiod, Aeschylus, and Sophocles—not only fail to articulate the essential “idea” (eidos) of goodness and justice but, as poets, distort it.1It is not the philosophers who corrupt the youth (as Plato’s teacher Socrates had been executed for) but the “makers” of pleasant and beguiling images and stories. According to Plato, “The imitative poet produces a bad regime in the soul of each private man by making phantasms that are very far from the truth and by gratifying the soul’s foolish part.”2Why? Because the activity of poetics (poiêsis) is by definition the “imitation” (mimêsis) of truth, making it able to grasp only the world’s changing visible appearances and not its eternal invisible depths. “The imitator, we say, understands nothing of whatisbut rather of what looks like itis.”3The very establishment of philosophy as the pursuit of truth and goodness, in fact, depends to a significant degree for Plato on overturning the mere poetic “making” of “images” (eikones) of truth and beginning to uncover truth as it actually “is,” Truth as invisible and unchanging Being.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, Derrida does not seem to have been familiar with the basic tenets of Patočka’s later phenomenology, in particular his reinterpretation of the Husserlian conception of the lifeworld. According to Patočka, the natural world is constituted by three movements that are fundamental for understanding his reference to the exceptional (the orgiastic, demonic, or sacred), the inauthenticity of everydayness, and, above all, the motif of the care of the soul. Nonetheless, Derrida’s reading of the essay in question is a very fine account of Patočka’s thought.<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: The JST narrative implies three reasons for God’s rejection of Lucifer’s alternative. Most obviously, it constituted rebellion in its antagonism to God’s plan and in its demand for “God’s own power.” There was also a third, more substantive problem, however. Lucifer’s proposed means of ensuring that “not one soul would be lost” was meant to “[destroy] the agency of man.” Since, in this cosmology, there is no existence without agency, Lucifer’s plan would have made God’s plan a nullity.
         49Thus, in Smith’s cosmology evil as the possibility of defection from God is present from the beginning and prior to the world’s creation. Of course, this means also that creation is not ex nihilo. As such, the myth recalibrates the created‐uncreated dichotomy fundamental to the Christian tradition’s definition of human unrelatedness to the divine. More will be said of this in a moment. For now, we return to the story.<br>

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: While the paucity of information about early Sāṃkhya and Vedānta rules out any firm conclusions regarding their historical relationship, the two schools most likely emerged out of a common tradition of brahmanical religious thought. An indication of this common origin is the fact that, as Edgerton demonstrated long ago in a still‐valuable article, the two main distinguishing doctrines of Sāṃkhya, namely, the denial of God and the plurality of souls, only appear in that tradition quite late.
         21The earliest sources for Sāṃkhya philosophy in the (late) Upaniṣadic and epic literature, most notably in the Mokṣadharma Parvan of theMahābhārata, contain little, if anything, to rule out a Vedāntic interpretation. Thanks to this common heritage in what Edgerton calls “epic brahmanism,” Sāṃkhya and Vedānta share, despite their mutual antagonism, a number of fundamental presuppositions.22Both presuppose the concepts of karma and samsara, as well as the understanding of salvation as liberation (mokṣa) from samsarric existence. Both schools advocate a kind of knowledge, as opposed to ritual or cultic activity, as the means of liberation.23Moreover, both understood the nature of this knowledge to consist in a discrimination (viveka) between the soul (ātmanfor the one;puruṣafor the other) and body.24Both affirmed, against schools like the Vaiśeṣika, the principle ofsatkāryatva, that is, the preexistence of the effect in its cause. Most important, both schools recognized the authority of the Upaniṣads.25We can readily understand the early Vedāntists’ antagonism toward the Sāṃkhya doctrines in terms of the sociological principle that proximity constitutes a threat to the distinctive identity of a school or tradition.26It is noteworthy that later, when the respective identities of the two schools were safely established, Indian thinkers like Vijñānabhikṣu were able to reconcile and synthesize the teachings of these two schools with relative ease.27<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: Yet the nagging fact remains, lodged right at the generic crux of ethics and epistemology. For there is no denying that the withheld truth would have had a decisive ethical charge, removing the unearned guilt of years, releasing the unloved son to a different autobiographic consciousness altogether. The promissory morality of soul mates as helpmates in the novel's last paragraph—they are returned to a society that has previously contributed to their exclusion, to perform what service they now can—is of course stationed to outbid all epistemological regret. Yet to the supposed selflessness of this social ethic, the self-knowledge of the hero has been entirely sacrificed. What might have done him good is subsumed to his doing good. A logic like this does have its own communal morality, of course, but only if articulated. Instead, we get, unadmitted, a sublimation of the sexual into the social subject. In this way the closural immanence of form within the compromises of Dickens's story is neither providential nor evidentiary but merely and remorselessly conventional. I say merely, because conjugal love has been unfleshed into duty by an ideology of the so-called work ethic; remorselessly, because the pace of closure excludes all talking back from within the plot; but not seamlessly, because the false notes remain, jangling, reverberant. They remain, that is, for the reader to read—and this as a certain lingering discord that outlasts plot itself. In what we've stumbled over in the novel's final paragraph the discrepancy between knowledge and desire takes the form of a verbal deviance writ small, a mere glitch or two at the level of agreement, a predication no longer justified in the linguistic sense nor in the ethical and the epistemological senses, given that it implies a not only vaguely morbid but a downright deceptive variant of the marital two-made-one. Dickens, that master vernacular syntactician of nineteenth-century prose, regularly flawless in the virtual subp~<br>

Abstract: In light of this discussion, we may now go back to the question that introduced the foregoing arguments. Where does the soul of Joseph Le Doux’s mother go when it leaves the body? My soft‐transcendental answer, Proustian in nature, is that it goes, or more exactly it remains, where it should be in the first place, namely, in the organismic memory that mourning “injects in [her son’s] blood stream.” It is the embodied token of his self’s altruistic identification in the loved one.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: We are, primordially, beings‐for‐God, even though this arche‐gift is occluded by sin. It is just a matter of recovering this being‐for‐God: as Douglas Hedley comments,
         Aids to Reflectionis ultimately “about the bending back of the soul to God.”21Yet, of course, prayer is precisely an act that (re)opens the for‐God in our being. This mirroring between prayer’s form and object allows Coleridge to argue that “the heart‐felt Prayer for Mercy is the commencement, the nascent quantity, of the Mercy, we are praying for.—For a will one with the Will of the Eternali am, is the essence ofFaith” (N6404). With similar logic, Coleridge notes that because the aim of the prayer “Thy kingdom come” is to bring human wills into accord with the divine and prayer is itself a phenomenological commitment to this, our prayers are “among the antecedentConditions” (N6095) of the kingdom itself. In this sense, Calvin’s comment that “we dig up by prayer the treasures that were pointed out by the Lord’s gospel” is highly appropriate to Coleridge’s theory.22Humanity “must act in order to receive” (N5554, fol. 11v). We are always (already) fundamentally for‐God, but prayer is the way of digging up, or receiving, this gift: “Ask, and it shall be given you” (Matt. 7:7).23<br>

Abstract: D'Holbach's caveat is essential for understanding the implications of his system for the relationship between person and nature, but also between the transcendent and the immanent. If nature is meant to assume the role once assigned to the divine in Christian theology, it does so in an entirely different manner—not as an all-knowing, all-powerful subject, but as a blind and will-less force. At the same time, the human person is both identified with and in large part reduced to an effect of this force. D'Holbach's abandonment of transcendence in his materialist system thus drastically altered the relationship between God and soul as it was understood in orthodox religion. What had been an exchange between two distinct, albeit unequal persons, was reduced to an arrangement between two objects. The meaning of immanence likewise changed. Once mainline Christian theology began to assert the self's inward transcendence vis-à-vis the world as “masters and possessors of nature” (to cite Descartes), atheist philosophes such as d'Holbach reacted by asserting the immanent power of things to dispossess the self in order to repudiate the concept of divinity that stood behind it. However, this was no mere reversion to the world of “enchantment.” While d'Holbach was momentarily willing to anthropomorphize nature for rhetorical effect, he and Spinoza persistently applied the mechanized organization of the universe to human beings as well. In lieu of the semitranscendent, personified objects of the enchanted universe, one was left with the prospect of a world inhabited by wholly immanent, objectified entities.<br>

Abstract: I agree with Ricoeur that this way of characterizing the present contains an enigmatic dynamism: “The soul ‘distends' itself as it ‘engages' itself.” What I criticize is Ricoeur's tendency, in a manner that goes almost unnoticed in his elaborations on this very dynamism, to split the present into something that is intent on staying, on the one hand, and a subjective and movable intention, on the other: “It [the present] is no longer a point, not even a point of passage, it is a ‘present intention' (
      praesens intentio) (27:36).”
            Of course, the dynamics of this intention asks for an assessment. In my view, however, this cannot and should not be done at the cost of diminishing the full force of the13
         praesens attentio. Ricoeur's phrasing of temporality somehow suggests an independent status for temporal existence, detached from conversion and vision and gift. The same obtains for the approximation of time and eternity in which “peregrination and narration are grounded.” To put it bluntly, the use of “approximation” might be misleading here. In my view, thepraesens attentiodoes not allow for such approximation, because it keeps any extension and distention, however dynamically governed byintentio, firmly within the bounds of that present. And so I am back at the criticism I leveled at Teske for breaking up and duplicating the present by introducing extension into it.<br>

Abstract: In this light it is worth considering the puzzlement of Meyer Fortes in his study of Tallensi religion and morality over why the Tallensi so deemphasize and marginalize the notion of witchcraft in their theory of human nature and causality. Fantasies of sexual aggression, soul cannibalism, and gross immorality that invert and repudiate normal humanity typical of African witchcraft beliefs are “quite alien to Tallensi ways of thought” (
         1987:213). Fortes resolves this puzzlement in a comparison between the Tallensi and Ashanti, among whom witchcraft is highly elaborated, tracing the difference to family and descent group organization. The Tallensi individual’s identity is given a firm anchorage in the complementarity of legal father-right and spontaneous mother love, the enclosed family, and localized lineage, creating a benign domestic environment guaranteed by a cult of ancestors. The Ashanti individual is pulled two ways between matrilineal uncle-right and supposedly spontaneous care from the father, leading to preoccupation with purity and pollution, personal sensitivity and vulnerability, and high personal autonomy combined with a divided sense of identity. The relative weakness of Tallensi witchcraft can be accounted for by the experiential ramifications of these differences: among the Tallensi the survival to adulthood of a developmentally early basic trust whereas the Ashanti culture enshrines basic mistrust; a Tallensi conscience externalized to parent surrogates and understood in affective terms aspu-teemor “stomach-thinking” that contrasts with Ashanti conscience rooted in personal responsibility and understood in intellectual terms asti-boaor “head creature”; and Tallensi wrongdoing being treated as an issue among the individual, his kin, and the ancestors, whereas Ashanti violation of taboos is a sacrilege attributed to individual wickedness and dangerous to the community that must be adjudicated by the chief and his council (216).<br>

Abstract: Janet Adelman sees in Lear’s actions “the rage of an abandoned infant.” G. Wilson Knight remarks that the king’s “tremendous soul” is “incongruously geared to a puerile intellect.” According to Knight, “Lear is mentally a child; in passion, a Titan.” For Jan Kott, both Lear and Gloucester are “too ridiculous” to be tragic: they are “clowns who do not yet know they are clowns.” Nowhere is this more apparent than in Gloucester’s attempt to end his life. The attempted suicide, Kott writes, “is merely a circus somersault on an empty stage…the classic expression of buffoonery.” See Janet Adelman,

Abstract: In Book XI of his
      Confessions, Augustine formulated the dialectic between historical time and eternity: “Some such different times [past, present, future] do exist in the mind, but nowhere else that I can see. The present of past things is the memory; the present of present things is direct perception; and the present of future things is expectation. If we speak in these terms, I can see three times and I admit that they exist.” According Mooij, “for Augustine … the dependence of time on the soul or mind was only partial” (pp. 68, 78).<br>

Author(s): Anderson Judith H<br>
Abstract: The final chapter, which considers the
      Lex Mercatoria(1622) of the merchant Gerrard de Malynes, can stand for what is most distinctive about Anderson’s book. Like all that precedes it, it is the product of equal parts intense close reading and deep research. (The endnotes, fully a third again of the book’s length and set in smaller type, are a rich mine both of reference and reflection.) She unfolds Malynes’s body-soul-and-spirit allegory of “the three Essentiall Parts of Trafficke” (177) — commodities, money, and exchange — in order to show how he argues for the overriding economic importance of monetary policy. Malynes has his critics, both on account of his metaphors (which were disparaged by contemporaries such as Thomas Mun) and his theory (Mun again, and most modern economists). What Anderson is ultimately concerned to show, however, is how, for all of the potential intricacy of the relations between body and exchange, Malynes’s conceit is sterile, never transforming or vitalizing what I. A. Richards would call its economic tenor. His book had little power to change the way his contemporaries talked about money. Critics mostly celebrate the discovery of metaphorical overplus: here is a valuable lesson in how metaphor might fail.<br>

Abstract: In chapter three, “Temporality,” Wu deploys Paul Ricoeur’s concepts of time as an analytical tool to great advantage.
      
            Wu writes that images within the tomb such as star maps and animals associated with the cardinal directions align the deceased with the underlying structure of the cosmos in what Ricoeur would call “cosmic time.” In contrast, personal objects buried with the dead represent a “lived time.” These embody two different forms of time: at the funeral they evoke the past life of the deceased, but once buried in a tomb they cater to the needs of the soul in the present and future. A third kind of time, “historical time,” represented by textual and pictorial biographies of the deceased and narratives of important historical figures, reconstructs his or her public persona. And finally, the frequent depiction of chariots on tomb walls represents a journey that enables the deceased to move through time within the tomb.1<br>

Abstract: Review of Robert D. Romanyshyn's The Wounded Researcher: Research with Soul in Mind, New Orleans, Louisiana: Spring Journal Books, 2007. Robert Romanyshyn has written a treatise on the question of understanding that brings together the fields of phenomenology and depth psychology. Following the thought of C. G. Jung, Romanyshyn has presented an archetypal view of the dilemma of psychological research that he sees as a story of loss, mourning, descent, re-search and homecoming expressed in the mythical image of Orpheus. Going deeper into the actual process of psychological research, Romanyshyn looks to the ancient art of alchemy as providing a model of the attitude and action of imagination that most closely suits psychological life.<br>

Language, Counter-Memory, Practice: "By humanism I mean the totality of discourse
through which Western man is told: 'Even though you don't exercise power, you can
still be a ruler. Better yet, the more you deny yourself the exercise of power, the more
you submit to those in power, then the more this increases your sovereignty,' Human-
ism invented a whole series of subjected sovereignties: the soul (ruling the body, but
subjected to God), consciousness (sovereign in a context ofjudgment, but subjected to
the necessities of truth), the individual (a titular control of personal rights subjected to
the laws of nature and society), basic freedom (sovereign within, but accepting the
demands of an outside world and 'aligned with destiny'). In short, humanism is
everything in Western civilization that restricts the desirefor power ..." (221 )<br>

Author(s): Chenavier Robert<br>
Abstract: Au cours d'une période qui voit Husserl livrer son testament philosophique, la Krisis, l'étudiante Simone Weil ouvre son Diplôme d'études supérieures, en 1930, par le constat du désarroi dans lequel se trouve l'époque et de l'incertitude dans laquelle nous laisse la science. Il faut opérer un retour à Descartes, dans une automéditation proche de celle que recommandait Husserl. Cependant Simone Weil ne s'oriente pas vers une phénoménologie. Loin d'explorer la sphère d'être du cogito, elle cherche à en sortir, plus rapidement encore que Descartes, pour rencontrer la réalité du monde, et inventer une sagesse pour notre condition d'être percevant, ce qui signifie, avant tout, d'être qui travaille. Seul le travail permet d'éprouver la nécessité réelle, et de retrouver « l'union de l'âme et du monde », dans les conditions créées par l'industrie. C'est dans la ligne de la vocation mondaine de la philosophie de Descartes, que Simone Weil amorce sa réflexion sur le rôle du travail comme fondement d'une sagesse, dans ces nouvelles conditions d'existence déterminées par la forme collective de la production. À partir de 1935, elle verra dans la crise un signe de la « faillite de Descartes ». During the period that Husserl was declaring his philosophical testament, Die Krisis, Simone Weil was a student starting her Diplôme d'études supérieures in 1930, mindful of the utter confusion of the times and of the atmosphere of uncertainty generated by science. One must return to Descartes, in a self-meditation similar to the one recommended by Husserl. But Simone Weil did not move toward a phenomenology. Far from exploring the sphere of being through the cogito principle, she sought to escape from that sphere, even more rapidly than did Descartes, in order to confront the reality of the world and to invent a wisdom for the condition of a conscious being, which means, above all, a being who works. Only work makes it possible to experience real necessity and to reestablish « the union of~<br>

Author(s): Nagy Piroska<br>
Abstract: This essay focuses on a strange medieval phenomenon, the so-called gift of tears—religious weeping that brings beatitude. This internal purifying process, which was embedded in the specific conditions of historical Christianity, was described and understood as a procedure in which God himself acts and, therefore, as a process that humankind cannot learn, formalize, or ritualize. However, the author analyzes religious weeping as a peculiar, 'intimate ritual' in which the formalized process took place in the soul or spirituality of the weeping person. This essay aims to describe and analyze this practice while examining the historical conditions that enabled such a cultural elaboration to develop.<br>

Abstract: This Study is divided in three parts. The first treats the problem of the relation between Scripture and reason considered as Springs of Moral Theology. Why a recourse to Bible should be necessary if conscience is already a Spring of moral knowledge? What kind of Priority has, for christian conscience, the Authority of the Gospel? The answer is that the light of the Gospel and the light of Reason are not two independant possibilities: there is interaction and complementarity between them: both Scripture and human Reason can be said to be, together, the soul of Moral Theology. The second part is about Hermeneutics. How can we apply the written Gospel to every day's reality? Exegesis tells me what the biblical text is saying: the text speaks. Hermeneutics tells me what the biblical text is saying to the modern man: the text speaks today. Hermeneutics try to liberate the actual meaning of the biblical text. In the third Part, the dialectic between faith and reason is applied to the moral of S. Paul. What was Paul's Filter in front of hellenism? How did he manage to borrow some principles of morality from the current morality and to refuse some others? What was his originality? How did he use Faith and Reason in building up his moral doctrine?<br>

Abstract: Rav H̱isday Crescas (1340-1410/11), Rabbi of Aragonese Jewry in Christian Spain and a major figure in medieval Jewish philosophy, is unique in positing an all-embracing thesis of Love. This thesis permeates his theories of cosmogony, metaphysics and theology and generates far-reaching didactic implications. This article examines Crescas' rather bold description of Love as a positive Divine attribute, an anthropopathism meant to convey ontological meaning about the Divine Nature via an analogous construct. Themes such as Infinite Goodness, Joy and Kindness enable Rav H̱isday to structure a new conception of the Creator and Providence. After postulating Divine Love as the Cosmic Force sustaining creation, Crescas explains the purpose of Torah and mitzvot in terms of evoking love for God thus drawing the soul to link up to the Divine Overflow of Love. Even spiritual existence after death is explicated in terms of the soul's love for its Divine Source. To understand Crescas' unique theory of Love, we compare it with the views of his predecessors and analyze his use of philosophic sources such as the 5th century BCE pre-Socratic scientist-mystic Empedocles. We examine educational aspects of Crescas' teachings on love and view them in context of the mass conversions to Christianity resulting from the 1391 riots. Finally, Crescas' ideas are read as pedagogical messages relevant to both Jews and conversos in the twenty traumatic years after 1391 when he served as chief rabbi and political leader in Saragossa.<br>

Abstract: The philosopher as the tormented individual trying to grasp the truth is the topic of Giordano Bruno's Eroici furori. This paper offers a reading that assumes that Ignatius of Loyola's Spiritual Exercises were part of its cultural background. Both texts have some features in common: the individual struggles for contemplation of the absolute; the strife is a circular movement within the human condition; Ignatius and Bruno suggest to employ the lower realms of reality and the lower faculties of the soul for the sake of their overcoming in truth. Consequently, dialogue, imagery, and emblematic contraptions of multiple senses are specifically apt to educate the individual. Bruno addresses systematically the epistemological and metaphysical problems that accompany the Exercises.<br>

Abstract: The article refers to the hermeneutic methods of psychoanalysis. It scrutinizes Freud's strategy in transforming traditional myths of the devil into a theory of evil which reveals the dark side of the human soul. Relating to Freud's epistemic construction of metapsychology, it is argued that his hermeneutic system fashions its specific principles of causality, which are stipulated by the theory of libido, in order to reinterpretate the mythology of the devil as a relic left by the unconscious. Freud's argumentation, exemplified in his studies on religious superstition, demonstrates the interconnection between mythology and the unconscious. As the devil figures dirt and darkness, he represents distressing thoughts which are repressed and rejected by consciousness. The article is completed by a view on C. G. Jung's theory of the archetypes, which considers the evil as part of the preconscious thoughts beyond individual experience. Thus the fundamental difference between Freud's metapsychology and Jung's archetypes is reflected in the interpretation of the devil as a figure, retaining the dark energies concentrated in the human soul.<br>

Abstract: Le théâtre de Valère Novarina reprend à sa manière la réflexion d'Augustin sur le temps comme distension de l'âme. Se confrontant à l'aporie de l'être et du non-être du temps, il projette sur l'espace de la scène, par le déploiement de la parole, cette expérience intérieure de l'esprit écartelé. Renverseur du temps, Novarina opère aussi une dispersion de temporalités multiples, un éclatement joyeux qui libère la scène et le spectateur de notre maladie chronique, et qui permet de rendre habitable le temps qui nous habite. Valère Novarina's theatre takes up and transforms Augustine's reflection on time as a distension of the soul. Confronting the aporia of time's being and non-being, it projects the inner experience of the stretched-out mind onto the space of the stage through the unfolding of speech. This theatre is also the site of a struggle with time; Novarina's dispersion of multiple temporalities produces a joyful explosion that liberates stage and spectator from our chronic illness, and transforms the time that inhabits us into an inhabitable space.<br>

Abstract: Au début du XIXe siècle, la philosophie de l'âme fournit des arguments aux psychologues qui, à la fin de ce siècle, réfléchissent sur les faits de conscience. Ils mettent alors en évidence les caractéristiques psychophysiologiques de l' « effort volontaire », force psychique qu'ils insèrent dans une phénoménologie de l'agir. Dans la première moitié du XXe siècle, de nouveaux discours reformulent la trame conceptuelle élaborée au siècle précédent et les psychologues, attentifs aux procédures adaptatives de l'énergétique humaine, livrent un autre mode de lisibilité de l'effort quand celui-ci représente, avant tout, un combat pour (sur)vivre. Early 19th-century philosophy of the mind or soul would provide arguments for psychologists who, at the end of this century, inquired into the facts of consciousness. They in turn highlighted the psychophysiologic characteristics of « voluntary effort », a psychic force that they placed within a phenomenology of the act. In the first half of the 20th century new discourses reformulated the elaborate conceptual framework of the previous century, and the psychologists attentive to the adaptive procedure of human energetics, offered a different reading of what effort means when it represents above all a struggle for survival.<br>

Abstract: Quoted in M. H. Abrams, The Mirror and the Lamp: Romantic Theory and the Critical Tra-
dition (New York: Oxford University Press, 1953), 60. No less illustrative is the quote from Yeats
that Abrams chose as his book's epigraph: "it must go further still: that soul must become its own
betrayer, its own deliverer, the one activity, the mirror tum lamp." It is to be regretted that Richard
Rorty—the author of Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature—never pronounced about the preference
of Romanticists for the metaphor of the lamp to that of the mirror, for quite a lot depends on this.<br>

Abstract: Although Dooyeweerd says that "all human acts have their origin in the soul," and
therefore beyond time, he holds that they function only within the temporal structure of the
human body (TM, XX; cf XIV). For this reason he opposes the phenomenology of Husserl and
Scheler, which regards acts as "incorporeal (onlichamelijk), (pure 'psychonomic') intentional
experiences" (TM, XV).<br>

Author(s): Glas Gerrit<br>
Abstract: I cannot go into the question whether substances can be such self-causing causes and
consequently how agency could be conceived in a metaphysics of substances. Moreland and
McRae (2000) argue for such an approach in their important work on anthropology and eth-
ics. I conclu with their spirit (a defense of the notion of soul in a biblical sense), without shar-
ing their mind-bodv dualism and the metaphysics behind it. One could make a case, I think, of
the statement that in their account the substantiveness of the body gradually disappears, in
spite of their body — soul dualism. Another issue is the distinctness between biblical and scien-
tific language. An important argument in almost all dualist accounts is the séparation between
body and 'soul' at death. I am not convinced that this 'séparation' can be used as an argument
for body-soul dualism as a philosophical position. Is what occurs at the moment of death not
just as mysterious as what occurs at the moment of conception (and in God's act of création)?
By introducing the biblical notion of the soul in a scientific discourse on mind-body dualism,
one is coerced to adapt the biblical meaning of the concept to the prevailing ontology of sub-
stances and entities; and this almost always implies not only réduction (loss of meaning), but
also adoption of certain conceptual characteristics inherent in the metaphysics of substances
(such as separateness of substances; or self-sustenance; or being bearer of a bundie of fea-
tures).<br>

Abstract: In Cooper's interpretation of Dooyeweerd two further errors are present. Cooper (1989,
250) says that Dooyeweerd's "notion of the ego allows the supranatural to shape the temporal
but not the reverse." Dooyeweerd however speaks of both divergence and concentration.
Cooper also states that in Dooyeweerd the basic directions of thinking, imagining and willing
are rooted in the heart, not in the temporal act structure. The passage at issue deals with the
functioning of the soul after death. Cooper holds that such rootedness of the basic directions
in the heart allows us to argue that the basic directions can also function outside the earthly
(i.e. temporal) modes. Apart from the fact that for Dooyeweerd the supra-temporal belongs to
the creatural (earthly) order, Cooper neglects that Dooyeweerd strongly denied the idea of an
incorporeal personal centre: acts and basic directions are inconceivable without involvement of
the temporal function cloak, c.q. the act structure.<br>

Abstract: L'article examine la lecture, par Hegel, de la critique kantienne de la métaphysique de l'âme et la conception hégélienne de l'âme comme « esprit-nature ». La question est de savoir ce que Hegel retient de la critique kantienne et en quoi, cependant, elle lui semble méthodologiquement inappropriée. Plus fondamentalement, il s'agit de saisir en quel sens les prédicats reconnus à l'âme dans la métaphysique dogmatique se trouvent « relevés » dans la conception hégélienne de l'esprit. The paper considers Hegel's reading of Kant's critique of the metaphysics of the soul and Hegel's conception of the soul as "natural spirit". The question is what Hegel retains from the Kantian critique and why it seems to him, nevertheless, to be methodologically inappropriate. More fundamentally, the aim of the paper is to grasp in which sense the predicates of the soul according dogmatic metaphysics are "sublated" in Hegelian conception of spirit.<br>

Abstract: En s'appuyant sur un commentaire du texte de la première nuit du Kitāb al-Imtāʿ wa-l-muʾānasa d'Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī, cet article se propose de montrer la place primordiale qu'occupe la parole conversante (al-muḥādaṯa) dans la pensée arabe classique. La conversation, ḥadīṯ, constitue bien dans la culture arabe à la fois un paradigme épistémique dominant et un cadre généralisé d'expériences esthético-éthiques: la parole conversante fonctionne à la fois comme facteur de construction des contextes d'interaction au sein desquels se tissent les réseaux de sociabilité et d'échanges intellectuels fécondants (muqābasa), comme action cathartique qui libère l'âme et purifie l'esprit, comme facteur de sublimation et d'émancipation de la personne (ʿitq). Ainsi, l'analyse de toutes ces formes de manifestation de la parole conversante dans la champ de l'adab nous a permis d'aboutir à deux conclusions complémentaires: premièrement, selon la conception de la culture propre à la vision anthropologique inhérente au système de l'adab, la culture ne se transmet pas héréditairement, mais par fréquentation, interaction et contact entre personnes contemporaines. Deuxièmement, l'adīb véritable, tel que nous en avons un exemple vivant dans la figure d'al-Tawḥīdī, est celui qui se montre capable de créer et prendre en charge les occasions de sociabilité et d'échanges permettant aux individus d'une même époque de s'insérer dans le tissu de la contemporanéité concrète et de s'influencer et se cultiver les uns les autres. /// Based on a commentary of the first night in Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī's Kitāb al-Imtāʿ wa-l-muʾānasa, the purpose of this article is to show the essential place held by conversing speech (al-muḥādaṯa) in classical Arabic thought. In Arabic culture, conversation (ḥadīṯ) represents indeed both a dominant and epistemic paradigm and a generalized ethical-aesthetic frame of experiences: i. e. conversing speech works at the same time as a building factor of interacting contexts in ~<br>

Abstract: That Cassian should posit some sort of intrinsic connection between the
soul aflame with love of God and the filial adoption implied in the term "Our
Father" is interesting. It is evocative of a relatively common image in patristic
literature for divinization: wood being burned until it gradually takes on the
properties of fire. The doctrinal thèmes of synergy, divinization, adoption, cré-
ation, and rédemption all Cluster here.<br>

Abstract: Girard, the sacred consists of:
all those forces whose dominance over man increases or seems to increase in pro-
portion to man's effort to master them. Tempests, forest fires, and plagues, among
other phenomena, may be classified as sacred. Far outranking these, however,
though in a far less obvious manner, stands human violence - violence seen as
something exterior to man and henceforth as a part of all the other outside forces
that threaten mankind. Violence is the heart and secret soul of the sacred. (31)<br>

Abstract: Recent work on conventional metaphor together with reinterpretations of classic studies of "soul substance" and mana are examined to assess the dangers of overinterpretation--the attribution of nonexistent theologies and metaphysics--by ethnographers. In our project of cultural translation, are we prone to attribute deeper salience to other peoples' way of talk than they in fact imply?<br>

Author(s): Witt Janet<br>
Abstract: Contemporary African American followers of Sunni Islam are self-consciously articulating a form of eating that they see as liberating them from the heritage of slavery, while also bringing them into conformity with Islamic notions of purity. In so doing, they participate in arguments about the meaning of "soul food," the relation between "Western" materialism and "Eastern" spirituality, and bodily health and its relation to mental liberation. Debates within the African American Muslim community show us how an older anthropological concern with food taboos can be opened up to history and to the experience of the past reinterpreted in terms of the struggles of the present.<br>

Abstract: É objectivo do presente estudo introduzir a uma reinterpretação das visões imagéticas. simbólicas e dramáticas que fascinam. apaixonam e obcecam a alma do pregador como indicadores proféticos do iminente advento da plenitude teândrico-cósmica e escatológica que designou como Quinto Império ou Reino de Cristo na terra consumado. A partir do levantamento dos seus fundamentos teológico-filosóficos, problematizando-os a partir do que o próprio autor designou como "tentações da esperança, visamos assim averiguar até que ponto na objectivação histórico-institucional e terrena da escatologia quinto-imperial se não projecta e refracta. inconsciente de si mesma. uma experiência mais autêntica da alma, em seu místico e visionário confronto com a simbologia do Infinito e da Totalidade. /// This essay aims to be an introduction to a reinterpretation of the imagetic visions, both symbolic and dramatic, that fascinate, impassionate and obsess the preacher's soul as prophetic signs of the impending coming of the theandric-cosmic and eschatological fulness that he called the Fifth Empire or Christ's Kingdom inaugurated on earth. On the basis of its theologic-philosophical foundations, which he questioned based upon what the author himself called "hope temptations", we aim to investigate to what extent a more authentic experience of the soul, in its mystic and visionary confrontation with the symbology of the Infinit and of the Totality, is projected and refracted, unconscious of itself, on the historic-institutional and worldly objectitication of the eschatology of the Fifth Empire.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: Ever since Plato the identity of philosophy has been at issue in the quarrel between philosophy and poetry. Can changing times alter the identity of philosophy, and simultaneously the identity of poetry? In the Republic poetry is a third rate illusion compared with contemplation of "the things that truly are". We can trace the background of this disqualification when we distinguish three levels in the relation of language to reality. 1. We can distinguish assertion, melody and rhythm. The first is the same in poetry and prose, the last is superfluous. 2. Speech is superior to writing in virtue of the speaker's inner mastery over himself. 3. The interiorizing move culminates in the soundless conversation of the soul with itself, contemplating the eternal identical "without the stain of speech or sign" (Boutens). For Plato, then, we move from poetry to prose, from prose to speech, from speech to silence. Is there room for aesthetics in this view? In the second part of my lecture I reconstruct Symbolism, a current in literature that in every respect is the opposite of Platonism. Although the goal is the same — the search for true reality — the difference is that the route is now reversed. I restrict myself to the French branch. 4. Baudelaire formulated the basic principle of Symbolism: the ineffable does not exist. "The ultimate goal of the universe is to be expressed" (Valéry). The same worldview is expressed later by Gadamer: an ontology "guided by language". 5. The second principle is that the primary language is script, "Book" (Mallarmé). 6. Poetry proves to be the true language. The music (rhyme, rhytm, tune) reveals the things "exactly as they are" (Wallace Stevens). In poetry the linguistic sign becomes a symbol because the sound, the physical aspect of the linguistic sign, plays a role in the production of meaning. A poem is a "sustained hesitation between sense and sound" (Valéry). Is sound not however a disturbing factor in revealing the things 'as they are'?~<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>

Date: 3 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Greisch Jean<br>
Abstract: Longtemps méconnue, l'herméneutique universelle des Lumières connaît actuellement un regain considérable d'intérêt. Après une caractérisation générale du profil de cette herméneutique, l'étude se focalise sur le Précis d'herméneutique de G.F. Meier, en prenant pour guide la thèse que le principe d'équité herméneutique forme l'âme de toute herméneutique qui se veut philosophique. Même s'il paraît difficile de faire encore de ce principe la clé de voûte épistémologique de l'herméneutique, les thèses de Meier relatives à ce principe conservent toute leur actualité, notamment dans les débats anglo-saxons récents relatifs au « principle of charity », de même qu'elles montrent la voie à une éthique de l'interprétation. The triumph of the romantic paradigm of hermeneutics as a general theory of understanding has partially hidden the former general hermeneutics of the Enligthment. In the current discussion about radical interpretation, we have good reasons to rediscover this older model. G.F. Meier's idea of a general hermeneutics including natural as well as artificial signs is under this respect of a special interest. The article focusses on Meier's statement that the principle of hermeneutic equity is the soul of a philosophical hermeneutics. Although it is impossible to maintain this principle as the epistemological foundation of hermeneutics, it shows the way toward an ethics of interpretation, which shades a new light on the debates regarding the so-called « principle of charity ».<br>

Issue: i40092321<br>
Date: 6 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Zollmann Mary Ann<br>
Abstract: This article explores the thesis that educators are called to define and describe truth morefoundationally than we have ever done before if tve are to facilitate existence that is right, just, correct on both a personal and communal level. This thesis is sourced in ever-deepening attentiveness to, appreciation for, and affirmation of this statement of Adrian van Kaam: "The work of reformation starts in the heart by means of the human spirit; it is the reclamation of the soul, via the spirit, of its innermost form direction. " Suggesting that education which would be truly correctional must, therefore, reach into the very heart of being, the author describes the current paradigm shift from the Newtonian model of what it means to be human with its positivistic approaches to learning to a more Einsteinian or fullfield understanding of human being and its requirement of more formative learning processes. In consonance with the truth of being as full-field, formative correctional education is reflective and experiential, dialogical, narrative in form, and globally inclusive. In her discussion of each of these methodologies, the author illustrates how each one draws us deeper into the truth of who we are and inspires us to be the unique presence that we are in the world. Through such methods and processes, individuals are formed, reformed, and transformed not only in self-appreciation and openness to their own possibilities, but in appreciation for the meaning and value of their existence with others in the world.<br>

Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and t~<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de Michel Henry aura été de «recueillir» et développer le côté affectif de la phénoménologie, que Husserl, dans un passage clé de ses Idées directrices, a délaissé au profit du côté intentionnel de la subjectivité — tout comme trois siècles plus tôt Descartes avait «recueilli» la subjectivité écartée par Galilée. Le texte qui suit compare le concept de soubassement, ou âme, chez Husserl avec celui de chair chez Michel Henry. On verra que les deux philosophes parlent d'une couche sensible, qu'on peut d'une certaine manière situer entre corps et esprit, de deux points de vue diamétralement opposés. Au-delà de l'opposition entre les deux philosophies, cette recherche mène à une interprétation topologique du rapport entre corps, âme et esprit, tel que suggéré par le terme husserlien de soubassement, et propose un éclairage différent de la notion henryenne d'auto-affection. Michel Henry's objective was to "pick up" and develop the emotional side of phenomenology, which Husserl, in a key passage in Ideas, left aside in favour of the intentional side of subjectivity — just as Descartes, three centuries earlier, "picked up" subjectivity left aside by Galileo. In this article, we compare the concept of the sub-basement, or soul, for Husserl, with that of the body for Michel Henry. We will see that both philosophers speak of a sensitive layer that can be situated in a certain manner between body and spirit, from two diametrically opposite points of view. Beyond the opposition of the two philosophies, this research leads to a topological interpretation of the relation between body, soul and spirit, as suggested by Husserl's term sub-basement, and proposes a different light on Henry's notion of self-affection.<br>

Abstract: A la fin du XIVe siècle, le Dialogue de Catherine de Sienne expose, par sa construction littéraire extrêmement élaborée, la conversion du mouvement raisonnable de recherche du divin en mouvement intelligent de contemplation, la conversion du langage théologique en langage de l'intelligence de l'âme, la conversion du langage difficile de la raison en langage métaphorique audible par tous et susceptible de ramener tous les hommes dans l'obéissance à l'Eglise. La méthode de connaissance recommandée par Catherine est celle des larmes. At the end of the 14th century, the Dialogo of Catherine of Sienna expounds in a very elaborate literary construction the conversion of the reasonable search for the divine into intelligent contemplation, the conversion of theological language into that of the comprehending soul, the conversion of the difficult language of the reason into a metaphorical one, understandable to everyone and fit to bring all men back to obedience to the Church. The method of knowledge which Catherine advises is that of the tears. En el final del siglo XIV, el Dialogo de Caterina de Sena por su construcción literaria muy elaborada expone la conversión del movimiento racional de búsqueda de Dios en el movimiento inteligente de contemplación, la conversión del lenguaje teológico en el lenguaje de la inteligencia del alma, la conversión del lenguaje difícil de la razón en el lenguaje metafórico que todos entienden y que puede reducir a todos en la obediencia a la Iglesia. El método de conocimiento preconizado por Caterina es el de las lágrimas.<br>

Abstract: La relation entre spiritualisme et philosophie réflexive peut donner lieu à deux lectures inverses : ou bien la méthode reflexive trouve son fondement dans la reconnaissance de la réalité de l'esprit, ou bien c'est la pratique réflexive qui autorise et au besoin contrôle la portée des affirmations spiritualistes. L'article se situe dans cette seconde lignée. La précession de l'être par l'être qui définit la condition de la conscience ne légitime aucune intuition de l'Absolu, mais bien une affirmation ontologique originaire. L'âme, c'est la passion d'intériorité de cette auto-affirmation manifestante. Quant à l'Esprit, troisième dimension de l'être, c'est un Advenir éthique qui n'est en acte qu'à travers le monde des êtres, dans la rencontre réflexive multilatérale des consciences. The relationship between spiritualism and philosophical reflexivity can be seen in one of two ways: either a recognition of the reality of the spirit gave rise to the reflexive concept, or the practice of reflexivity came first and widened the scope of spiritual affirmations, controlling them when necessary. The article favours the latter view. The ability of a being to form a judgment about itself, and thus create a conscience, does not justify any conclusion about an Absolute, being on the contrary one of the basic statements of ontology. The soul is the result of this active self-judgment emerging from its seclusion. As for the spirit, the third component of the being, this is an ethical by-product which only comes into play through the world of beings, in the multilateral reflexive meeting of consciences.<br>

Abstract: Confrontation de diverses lectures d'un récit, d'une scène, d'une tradition religieuse. À partir de la figure évangélique de la pécheresse (Luc 7), les analyses philosophiques du pardon s'inscrivent chez le jeune Hegel dans une réflexion sur l'opposition de la loi (le châtiment) et de la réconciliation (l'amour). Dans son Esthétique, les traités de l'art romantique et de la peinture voient en la Madeleine la figuration d'une beauté où intériorité et extériorité s'accordent harmonieusement. Dans divers écrits sur la religion, le même personnage, qui évoque les traits de la belle âme, n'est pas étranger aux méditations sur destin de Jésus, le pardon des offenses et l'idée de la grâce. Ces diverses représentations induisent une pensée en rupture avec d'autres approches philosophiques de la grâce et du pardon (Spinoza, Kant). Une deuxième partie évoque la pécheresse, souvent confondue avec d'autres femmes des Évangiles, telle qu'on la retrouve chez des écrivains de la spiritualité française (Bérulle 1627, Charles de Saint Paul 1628, Lacordaire 1859) et chez les peintres de l'époque baroque. L'article se termine par une étude des nombreuses évocations de la pécheresse chez Kierkegaard. À la différence de la spéculation philosophique ou des « élévations » mystiques, c'est dans une méditation toujours au plus près de la lettre même du Nouveau Testament que sont alors développés de manière existentielle les thèmes du repentir et du pardon. A look at diverse readings of a story, a scene, a religious tradition. Taking the gospel figure of the adulterous woman (Luke 7) as a starting point, the youthful Hegel sets his philosophical analysis of forgiveness in a meditation on Law (Punishment) versus Reconciliation (Love). In his Aesthetics, the treatises on the romantic art movement and on paintings see in Mary Magdalen the figuration of a beauty in which interiority and exteriority are harmonised. In various writings on religion, the same character, now the figuration of the bea~<br>

Abstract: It is not new for poets to renovate the language of poetry by appropriating or sending up enervated, devalued language as a way to critique discourses of power. It may even be one of the oldest methods of literary innovation, considering the Roman appropriation of Greek literature. But some contemporary, experimental poets explicitly link mass production of capitalist consumer products and the logic of the copy
         
               to the production of art in a Benjaminian vein. De la Torre refers to the age of mechanical reproduction in an epigraph to “Photos While U Wait,” which she borrows from Jacques Barzun's introduction to Gustave Flaubert's110
            Dictionary of Accepted Ideas: “The cliché, as its name indicates, is the metal plate that reproduces the same image mechanically without end.”
               Poems written under constraint and composed of recombined, appropriated text at times thematize the activity of appropriation itself as endemic to capitalism. The supermarket is a popular trope for the destruction of authenticity, disenfranchisement, and advertising's interpellation of the subject. A discursive tone dotted with imperatives mark these poems, as they echo the language of consumerism. African American poet Harryette Mullen's111
            S*PeRM**K*T, included in herRecyclopedia, is structured according to the logic of supermarket aisles (“sort of like your shopping list”), and the missing letters in its title spell outu are, as in, “you are what you eat,” as Mullen explains in an author's note. “I was thinking about domestication, about the role of women, women as consumers, women having supposed power as consumers but also being disempowered in other ways…. You can't necessarily buy who you really want to be. You have to buy the available images,” she writes in an accompanying statement.
               Mullen, like Hayes, also connects her poetics to that of a woman poet predecessor. Her books112

Abstract: Over the course of an academic career that involved many ups and downs, and many dislocations, SPEP has remained a constant, a place of refuge almost, where I could be recognized and accepted. Many friendships were formed and continued there, and after a time the possibility of seeing friends became a major reason for attending. It's strange that SPEP can seem like a fixed place to which one returns again and again, even though it is a movable feast held each year in a different place. In a certain sense arriving at SPEP each year is “getting back into place,” to plagiarize a well-known phenomenologist, even though we may be in Philadelphia, Chicago, New York, or even (if we can find it) Penn State. Its heart and soul, of course, remains the exchange of ideas built around a common tradition: ideas, texts, philosophers. As important in the history of SPEP has been the appearance among us of some of the most important European philosophers of these last fifty years: We were too late to lure Heidegger, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty to our shores, but we heard Gadamer, Arendt, Ricoeur, Habermas, Derrida, and many more.<br>

Abstract: Yet we saw in the passage quoted above a qualification (“to the extent”) to establishing equivalence between the mental substance and “I.” The chief reason is Brentano's critique of Descartes's view that the mind (
            qua res cogitans) is always thinking. But for Brentano deep dreamless sleep means that the self/I becomes absent, and so we must not simply equate the psychic substance (traditionally called “soul”) with the self-aware I or the subject. In this respect, Brentano would not follow Bolzano, for whom it would be inappropriate to say, “I have a soul,” because for Bolzano “soul” means the first-person referent of “I,” whichhasits acts, body, brain, and so on.
                  Yet Brentano's claim that there is self-awareness by the I-substance rounds out his own view of self-awareness as a “knowing [7
               Bekenntnis] which relates itself to that which has the knowing.” And such aKenntnis“is an accident and each which has the knowledge is a substance.”
                  Yet there is no necessary connection between the substance of “I” or “self” and the accident of self-awareness. We will return to this.8<br>

Abstract: Second, like Ricoeur, Shaw posits the poetic imagination, as it reveals itself in religious and other kinds of narrative texts, as the capability best suited for mending the ailing soul and resurrecting the frangible will. The human heart may be deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, as the prophet laments, but for Shaw (and Ricoeur) it is corrigible. Things can and do change; this is the first law of Shavian evolution. And, in Shaw's judgment, there is no more effective catalyst for provoking restorative transformation, for ridding the world of the ignorance that fuels evil, than the making of imaginative art that is aesthetically pleasing. Why is this the case? Because storytelling can break the infernal spell that enthralls the will. Telling stories, Shaw maintains, can deliver the imbecilic will from slavery, thereby restoring enlightened individual autonomy and the untrammeled capacity to act in accordance with higher rather than lower passions.
      
               “Fine art,” he muses, as exemplified for example in his own dramatic works, by implication, “is the only teacher except torture.”50
            
               In this regard, Shaw is very much like the “artist” and “Bohemian” Jesus he commemorates: the sage and commiserative guide who, “when reproached for resorting to the art of fiction when teaching in parables,” justified “himself on the ground that art is the only way in which the people can be taught.”51
            
               Consider the biblical Testaments, once more. Shaw believes they are unreliable historical documents yet nonetheless finds “in their readable parts”—that is, in their tales, fables, and legends—a treasure trove of tropes vital to the species' wellness (the same is true for Ricoeur).52
            
               However, and this is critical, he cautions that “you cannot read the Bible if you have no sense of literary art.”53
            
               Thus, in addition to whatever else they do, insist~<br>

Abstract: The great builder of worlds denounces his own project—and therefore every totalizing, world-building literary or political enterprise, be it historical (epic) or fantastical (Utopian): “you have reared your disunited kingdom on the vacuum of your own most intensely doubtful soul.”

            Ulyssesdoes not transcend the dystopian paralysis ofDubliners;
               but in the euphoria of Bloomsday it may take135
            Finnegans Waketo remind us of that.Ulyssesis a mock epic in the same way thatA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Manis mock-epiphanic: the young Stephen Dedalus's eager epiphanies—of family, sexuality, religion, romance, and philosophy—ultimately (when confronted with material circumstances) do not quite attain the transcendental climaxes he might have expected of them.Ulysses's Utopian cornucopia might thereby be seen as eventually as anticlimactic asDubliners's exotic dreams—the “Eastern enchantment” of “Araby.”
               But that would be to impose a closure upon136
            Ulysses—or, for that matter, uponFinnegans Wake—that the text stridently resists. It is not that these texts fail to attain their visions; it is just that they have not done so yet. Their endings (if they can be said to have endings) are therefore not so much anticlimactic as affirmingly preclimactic. As such, they seem to represent a mode of that “foreplay” that Jacques Derrida sees as the province of literary pleasures. But while Derrida views such textual pleasure as “null and endless,”
               Joyce's later work might be characterized as endless (which is not to say directionless) and full: an inexhaustible crescendo of Barthesian137
