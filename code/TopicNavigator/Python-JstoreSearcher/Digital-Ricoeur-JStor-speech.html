  Book Title: Superchurch-The Rhetoric and Politics of American Fundamentalism<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Edwards Jonathan J.<br>
  Abstract: Christian Fundamentalism is a doctrine and a discourse in tension. Fundamentalists describe themselves as both marginal and a majority. They announce the imminent end of the world while building massive megachurches and political lobbying organizations. They speak of the need for purity and separation from the outside world while continually innovating in their search for more effective and persuasive ways to communicate with and convert outsiders. To many outsiders, Fundamentalist speech seems contradictory, irrational, intolerant, and dangerously antidemocratic. To understand the complexity of Fundamentalism, we have to look inside the tensions and the paradoxes. We have to take seriously the ways in which Fundamentalists describe themselves to themselves, and to do that, we must begin by exploring the central role of "the church" in Fundamentalist rhetoric and politics. Drawing on five fascinating case studies,
      Superchurchblends a complex yet readable treatment of rhetorical and political theory with a sophisticated approach to Fundamentalism that neither dismisses its appeal nor glosses over its irresolvable tensions. Edwards challenges theories of rhetoric, counterpublics, deliberation, and civility while offering critical new insights into the evolution and continuing influence of one of the most significant cultural and political movements of the past century.<br>

  Abstract: To be Fundamentalist is to be marginal. It is to adopt and enact one’s own marginalization in society. It is to assume a position of outsider. It is to invoke counterpublic speech against public norms. Yet it is also to lay claim to an imagined higher standard than that which society currently upholds. It is, as we discussed in the last chapter, to envision a world in which Fundamentalist speech is normative. It is to speak for a public that the Fundamentalist community imagines but cannot, itself, enact. Therefore, we have seen, within Fundamentalism, a continual and productive tension between<br>

  Abstract: This article is intended as a call for reform, but I must begin by confessing some uncertainty about what it is that I am attempting to reform. The fact is that I do not have a secure understanding about the state of the art as it is now practiced in teaching public speech. I have not made a survey of the methods now used in classroom instruction, nor undertaken a systematic study of the textbooks, and I have not reviewed the current scholarly literature.

  Abstract: In his 1915 Flag Day speech, President Wilson argued that the flag was an emblem of the nation’s possibilities. That token reminded citizens that “national life” was created not by abstract ideals, but by the “actual daily endeavors of a great people to do the tasks of the day and live up to the ideals of honesty and righteousness and just conduct.”¹ His words tied behavior to national ideals—an association that heralded the actions of “sober, quiet” citizens, not “swashbuckler[s].”² His goal was to honor the quotidian nature of citizenship, those who did not attract attention to their patriotism<br>

  Abstract: The subject of Canto XX is avarice, for Dante the most detestable of vices. Avarice—in this case the collective avarice of the kings of France, who in the poet’s lifetime thwarted the election of an emperor and effectively subjugated the papacy—destroys the ordered fabric of life, and the canto is notable for an impassioned speech delivered by a shade, Hugh Capet, who is a mouthpiece for the poet’s anti-gallicism. Canto XX is virtually devoid of lyricism, as befits the gravity of the vice, and it can be seen to fall into three parts, with a sustained central speech<br>

The give-and-take of speech acts in the imaginary dialogue about Mendelssohn’s concerto helps point the way to something more resonant, but we need to go further in that direction.

  Book Title: The Language of the Gods in the World of Men-Sanskrit, Culture, and Power in Premodern India<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Pollock Sheldon<br>
  Abstract: In this work of impressive scholarship, Sheldon Pollock explores the remarkable rise and fall of Sanskrit, India's ancient language, as a vehicle of poetry and polity. He traces the two great moments of its transformation: the first around the beginning of the Common Era, when Sanskrit, long a sacred language, was reinvented as a code for literary and political expression, the start of an amazing career that saw Sanskrit literary culture spread from Afghanistan to Java. The second moment occurred around the beginning of the second millennium, when local speech forms challenged and eventually replaced Sanskrit in both the literary and political arenas. Drawing striking parallels, chronologically as well as structurally, with the rise of Latin literature and the Roman empire, and with the new vernacular literatures and nation-states of late-medieval Europe,
      The Language of the Gods in the World of Menasks whether these very different histories challenge current theories of culture and power and suggest new possibilities for practice.<br>

Instead, animate movement effectively enables our minds to commune so that we can subsequently share the world in speech.

  Abstract: A standard narrative of American religious history has relied on the Puritan sense of a common purpose. John Winthrop’s famous “City on a Hill” speech to the Pilgrims is emblematic of this. This narrative of election and purpose has shaped the way other religions have been measured. But in doing so it has neglected the voice of religious dissenters and the significance of racial diversity within the ranks of American Christians. Likewise, social science and historical studies of immigrants and refugees tend to gloss over religious affiliation and focus mainly on adaptation or assimilation processes into American culture.

  Abstract: One difference between shame and embarrassment in Rousseau can be stated quite simply. Shame is a passion productive of discourse. The confessing done under its aegis seems marvelously able to serve as an action of which to be ashamed, and so to provoke more confession. Embarrassment, on the other hand, is tonguetied, an anacoluthon in the grammar of feelings. Where, under influence of timidity, Rousseau manages to blurt something out nonetheless, the effect is not to end the silence but most often to prolong it, rendering the hapless speaker even more incapable of timely speech.

  Book Title: Puzzling the Parables of Jesus-Methods and Interpretations<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Ruben<br>
  Abstract: Modern scholarship on the parables has long been preoccupied with asking what Jesus himself said and what he intended to accomplish with his parables. Ruben Zimmermann moves beyond that agenda to explore the dynamics of parabolic speech in all its rich complexity. Introductory chapters address the history of research and distinguish historical from literary and reader-oriented approaches, then set out a postmodern hermeneutic that analyzes narrative elements and context, maps the sociohistorical background, explores stock metaphors and symbols, and opens up contemporary horizons of interpretation. Subsequent chapters then focus on one parable from early Christian sources (Q, Mark, Matthew, Luke, John, and the Gospel of Thomas) to explore how parables function in each literary context. Over all reigns the principle that the meaning or theological “message" of a parable cannot be extracted from the parabolic form; thus the parables continue to invite hearers' and readers' involvement to the present day.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155j2q7">Puzzling the Parables of Jesus</a><br>
  Abstract: The parables of Jesus are puzzling. A lack of comprehension is nothing unusual when one encounters these “short stories.” Even the earliest Christian texts share this assessment as one finds Gospel accounts relating that those listening to Jesus’ teaching did not understand the parables (Mark 4:10.13; John 10:6). The disciples themselves had to ask of Jesus, “Explain to us the parable…!” (Matt. 13:36, cf. Mark 4:10), which is to say that even they did not understand the parables, or at least not immediately. Parable speech is incomprehensible and mysterious. This is also expressed by the term παραβολή (

  Abstract: Words are not the same thing as concepts. While concepts make things accessible to reason and thought, words make them accessible to speech (
                  parole). In ordinary language there may not be much need to differentiate neatly between the two, especially since speech and thought are closely interrelated, perhaps even closer than language (langue) and thought. But, at least in part, their interrelatedness is due to their common opposition to what in ordinary language is called reality. Speech and thought are among the most important devices of the human soul for conceptualizing reality. It may be naïve to identify reality with<br>

  Abstract: Exodus 14, the text of Israel’s deliverance at the Sea of Reeds is very different from either Genesis 12 or Genesis 17. The different genres of Genesis 12 (speech, journey, anecdote) are not present. The sustained divine monologue of Genesis 17 does not recur. Instead, the text is in the form of a report of what happened when the fleeing Israelites were delivered from the pursuing Egyptian force. The paradox has not escaped later rabbis: deliverance for the Israelites means destruction for the Egyptians. In the midst of disturbance, deliverance brings joy; in times of tranquillity, destruction brings pain.<br>

Nevertheless, I propose that the second section of the initial divine speech (Job 38:39–39:30, some thirty-three verses), may invite us or allow us to move ‘the problem’ to a quite different context. The experience of God is still crucial, but the context is radically other than generally allowed for in the book<br>

Intuiting that the two masks demonstrate a substantial complicity and distrusting an idea of peace that continues to be based on war, Lévinas elaborates a radical critique of violence that is based on an atypical reading of the sixth commandment—or,<br>

  Abstract: Following the Augustinian tradition, original sin is something that we are responsible for and hence guilty of, yet in another sense it is a destiny that befalls us. At stake is hence a fine balance between necessity and freedom, between personal guilt and delivery to destructive structures. Accordingly, acknowledging sin takes a personal sense of the I, confessing or revealing itself as the originator of deeds and speech, while acknowledging that this I is indebted—for better and for worse—to the inheritance of and continuous participation in a form of life that bestows coherence to those deeds and utterances.<br>

  Book Title: Speak Thus-Christian Language in Church and World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hovey Craig R.<br>
  Abstract: In its various forms, speech is absolutely integral to the Christian mission. The gospel is a message, news that must be passed on if it is to be known by others. Nevertheless, the reality of God cannot be exhausted by Christian knowledge and Christian knowledge cannot be exhausted by our words. All the while, the philosophy of modernity has left Christianity an impoverished inheritance within which to think these things. In Speak Thus, Craig Hovey explores the possibilities and limits of Christian speaking. At times ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical, these essays go to the heart of what it means to be the church today. In practice, the Christian life often has a linguistic shape that surprisingly implicates and reveals the commitments of people like those who care for the sick or those who respond as peacemakers in the face of violence. Because learning to speak one way as opposed to another is a skill that must be learned, Christian speakers are also guides who bear witness to the importance of churches for passing on a felicity with Christian ways of speaking. Through constructive engagements with interlocutors like Ludwig Wittgenstein, George Lindbeck, Jeffrey Stout, Stanley Hauerwas, John Howard Yoder, Thomas Aquinas, and the theology of Radical Orthodoxy, Hovey offers a challenging vision of the church'able to speak with a confidence that only comes from a deep attentiveness to its own limitations while able to speak prophetically in a world weary of words.<br>

The figure of the performer who acts as a mediator between music and audience is a crucial element in understanding the mutual relationship between theoretical approaches to music and its possible, actual performances.

Dialogue intertitles and character-written inserts allowed cinematic representations to extend beyond the pictorial exterior and into the linguistic consciousness of characters.

  Author(s) Kripal Jeffrey J.<br>
  Abstract: The term “esoteric” has a very specific meaning in the Islamic tradition. The Koran as well as other fundamental religious texts emphasize the difference between what is “ apparent” and “ outward” (
                  zâhir) and what is “hidden” and “inward” (bâtin).Zâhiris everything that is obvious in our perceptions and thoughts (an empirical phenomenon, the meaning of a text), about the presence of which no doubt can be raised.Bâtinis what is not expressed outwardly (feelings for instance), what is hidden in natural phenomena, or concealed in speech. The “hidden” is, however, no less real than the “apparent.” On<br>

Whence this compulsion (for it is not merely a caprice) I cannot fully articulate even to myself. I know only that this fiction which I somehow do not feel to be fictitious enables me a mode of speech which has hitherto not been possible, but which now becomes imperative because we have reached a time of reckoning.

  Book Title: In the Eyes of God-A Metaphorical Approach to Biblical Anthropomorphic Language<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Howell Brian C.<br>
  Abstract: Anthropomorphic language has provided a conundrum for exegetes and theologians for millennia. Attempting to use human language to describe the divine presents ontological and epistemological problems that push our speech to the breaking point. In this new work, Howell shows that instances of divine action should not automatically be reduced simply to theological categories such as omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, immutability, etc., nor to criteria such as personhood, life, and approachability. Rather, he introduced readers to two unique approaches to “anthropomorphic expressions".<br>

  Abstract: Anthropomorphic language has provided a conundrum for exegetes and theologians for millennia. Attempting to use human language to describe the divine presents ontological and epistemological problems that push our speech to the breaking point. Initially, we looked at several different modes of speech, the univocal, equivocal, analogical, and metaphorical, looking at their approach to speaking of a transcendent being. The univocal approach treated language for God and for humans as having the same sense. This immediately runs into problems, however, as God is a non-created Being and His attributes are neither contingent nor finite in nature. Process theologians attempt to<br>

  Abstract: In Part One, the

Beginning with language, this raises a hermeneutical problem: how to determine meaning, significance, from speech or text. But theskandalonof the body is also a hermeneutical problem: how to “read” the body, especially the present absence of Christ’s “displaced” body, which overextends its bounds and incorporates all bodies. In both cases, we encounter a plurisignificance that is unsettling. It seems there is no possibility of singular or univocal meaning.

Even a stone can possess graceful beauty, but one must be on guard against bribes that are likened to it (Prov 17:8).

Using a series of examples she shows that the interaction between an Englishman and a Pole does not always go smoothly, because of the fact that differences in the formulation and interpretation of requests can lead to misunderstandings. According to Wierzbicka, two cultural values held by Poles seem to motivate certain lexico-syntactic phenomena in this type of speech acts namely cordiality and courtesy.<br>

  Abstract: People’s relations with signs in Java, the degree to which they are master of or subject to them, at once indicate and determine their potency. This assumption about the relationship between self and Signs has important consequences for Javanese epistemology. Exegesis of wayang exemplifies these consequences, and I will take it as a starting point for a more general discussion of Javanese interpretation. My point is that, like speech, the signs that are an art form, a tract of ngèlmu, or a dream, all pose a challenge to a person’s autonomy, a challenge to which modes of interpretation are the<br>

                  thanniversary of the beginning of the Great Irish Famine. This historical event, which has been reworked as one of the founding traumas of the Irish nation, also marked a dramatic increase in the Irish exodus that made Ireland the only country in Europe to experience a decline in population growth in the second half of the nineteenth century (Kuhling and Keohane, 2007: 53).

  Abstract: In the last lecture, we offered theory a reprieve from its banishment by Knapp and Michaels, and we did so by saying that there really is a difference between language and speech. That’s a claim that I want to continue investigating in today’s concluding lecture. In the meantime, when I keep saying we saved theory, you may well be asking why anybody would bother saving it. We began to wonder last time, especially in view of the neo-pragmatists’ claims about the common agency of language and speech—understood on their view to be one and the same thing—whether we<br>

Whereas we are faced with the massive collection of manuscripts in the Husserl Archives at Louvain and the continuing publication of selections from them in the Husserliana series, Fink listened to Husserl himself, spoke with him, thought with him. It was not the written line of what Plato called “dead discourse” but “the living speech”³ of Husserl’s own teaching that he followed.

In 1949, the Soviets declared the Soviet zone its own country, and the German Democratic Republic (GDR) was born, becoming a satellite country of the Soviet Union.

  Abstract: The Gospel of Mark (or, for that matter, any text) may be read from different locations. Our attempt has been to enter imaginatively into the world in which the Gospel was composed and to hear its discourses as a first-century audience might have heard them. Twentieth-century historical critics brought questions to Mark that required that the discourses be fragmented to uncover their pre-Markan sources or traditions. Having fragmented the discourses, historical critics were then unable to read them as coherent speech acts. Our reading has sought to hear the discourses themselves, their distinct patterns and strategies, in terms of the<br>

  Abstract: Cultural relativism is arguably an older concept than institutionalized anthropology. There are foreshadowings of it in the work of Herodotus, Protagoras, Sextus Empiricus, Johann Gottfried Herder, and Wilhelm von Humboldt. However, the genealogy of the concept in modern American anthropology may, as Regna Darnell shows (2001: 39, 40), be correctly traced back to Boas’s 1889 article, “On Alternating Sounds,” which drew attention to the ethnocentrism that can result when scholars from our speech community apperceive one sound in another supposedly primitive language as two alternating sounds (e.g., Inuit

  Abstract: When Barack Obama gave his revealing speech on race in America, he juxtaposed what he called “the white immigrant story” with the memories aired in black barbershops and beauty salons. In what is now known as his “More Perfect Union” address, Obama also made a distinction between his own generation’s experiences of how race is lived in America and the memories of Reverend Jeremiah Wright’s generation. In each case, Obama recognized a segregation of memory along the lines of color, class, and generation.

  Abstract: Even earlier in the twentieth century, the public agenda seemed lost or abandoned. In an atmosphere of crisis, civic institutions could only repeat empty symbolic reassurances. The symbols were in fact empty, because there appeared to be no learned experience except failure for them to rest on. Resignation, cynicism, and hopelessness had become the order of the day. In the midst of this material and symbolic dispossession it seems almost fanciful to imagine a creative ethical option for speech.

Before the foundations of the world were laid, there is the eternal Word of God, the Word that St. John says was “in the beginning” (Jn 1:1). Since God’s Word expresses not only the infinite intelligibility of God, but contains the original pattern of every created thing, it already encompasses within itself all true human speech about God, including true philosophical speech<br>

  Abstract: When I think about the politics of speech and writing, I return again and again to the final scene in Akira Kurosawa’s movie
                  Ran, or “chaos,” which contemplates, among many other things, the fragmentation of social life in postmodernity. Kurosawa shows us a man in the fading light, bent forward on his staff at the edge of an enormous cliff. This man, really a boy, cannot see that the sun is going down because he can no longer see anything, having lost his eyes in a dynastic struggle that left most of his family dead. Nor can he know that<br>

  Author(s) Gadamer Hans-Georg<br>
  Abstract: If anything is universal in philosophical hermeneutics, it is probably the recognition of one’s own finitude, the consciousness that actual speech does not suffice to exhaust the inner conversation that impels us toward understanding. Gadamer ties the universality of the hermeneutic process to the fact that understanding depends on this ongoing conversation: “That a conversation occurs, no matter when or where or with whom, wherever something comes to language, whether this is another person, a thing, a word, a flame (Gottfried Benn)—this is what constitutes the universality of hermeneutic experience.”¹ Only in conversation, only in confrontation with another’s thought<br>

  Author(s) HAUERWAS STANLEY<br>
  Abstract: The close connection between rhetoric and religion has profound consequences for the possibility of unity within social and religious communities. Earlier Marjorie O’Rourke Boyle noted that the Renaissance humanists appreciated the “unitive power” of religion and rhetoric, “the bond of society, the integration of self, and communion with God,” drawing on the classical orators for whom speech was a socializing and civilizing act. In a similar way, Kathy Eden’s thoughtful study links adages, commonly held formulations of belief that unify both discursive practice and social relationships, to secular and Christian conceptions and practices of friendship, love, and community.

A great deal of talk involved comments on or indications of states of feeling—such as when Carla said, “I just feel wretched. I really do,” at a group meeting. Although I did not keep count, overt references to feelings seemed more numerous in the shelter than in most other contexts.

Whereas the two methodologies and discursive practices may not appear commensurable on the surface, there emerge beneath important philosophical convergences between Shpet and Voloshinov.

We have ample evidence, especially from Papuan and Austronesian languages, of the high proportion of spatial indices in speech.

Inverting the analytic logic of her previous work, which sought to uncover what social structures concealed, Josephides focuses instead on the cultural understandings that people make explicit in their actions and speech. Using approaches from philosophy and anthropology, she examines elicitation (how people create their selves and their worlds in the act of making explicit) and mimesis (how anthropologists produce ethnographies), to arrive at an unexpected conclusion: that knowledge of self and other alike derives from self-externalization rather than self-introspection.<br>

  Abstract: Life in certain kinds of intense moments leads us to intuitions of realms that stretch or soar beyond speech and everyday realia, but these intuitions resist definition; they cannot be captured. While acknowledging that our reason and our language must always be defeated in such attempts to attain the unobtainable, we still have the deepest desire to edge near to and at least partially glimpse them. We respond to these needs with language and the use of language that, like other aesthetic resources, can give us intimations and rough outlines of the unmanifest beyond the manifest and, even further, the<br>

  Abstract: The proper balance between moral pluralism and community is, I believe, a pervasive interpretive issue in American constitutional law in the constitutional jurisprudence of state neutrality required by the religion clauses, free speech, and constitutional privacy. State abridgements of religious liberty, for example, are justifiable, if at all, only on a strong showing of neutral state purposes.¹ In a recent book,

To do this I want to play off the historical moment and its surrounding contextual discourses with the speech’s invocation of a transhistorical and universal set of values. New Historicism evolved in the 1980s as in some ways a reaction to structuralism and formalism. Indebted to political, poststructuralist and reader-response theory, it has focused on the intertextuality of literary and non-literary texts and the presence of diverse culturally specific discourses<br>

If man had been, as Foucault notes, a political animal this was because his humanity was created through the social relations he established through speech and action.

  Author(s): LAFONT CRISTINA<br>
  Abstract: Jürgen Habermas is one of the most influential philosophers of our time. His diagnoses of contemporary society and concepts such as the public sphere, communicative rationality, and cosmopolitanism have influenced virtually all academic disciplines, spurred political debates, and shaped intellectual life in Germany and beyond for more than fifty years. In
      The
            Habermas Handbook, leading Habermas scholars elucidate his thought, providing essential insight into his key concepts, the breadth of his work, and his influence across politics, law, the social sciences, and public life.This volume offers a comprehensive overview and an in-depth analysis of Habermas's work in its entirety. After examining his intellectual biography, it goes on to illuminate the social and intellectual context of Habermasian thought, such as the Frankfurt School, speech-act theory, and contending theories of democracy. TheHandbookprovides an extensive account of Habermas's texts, ranging from his dissertation on Schelling to his most recent writing about Europe. It illustrates the development of his thought and its frequently controversial reception while elaborating the central ideas of his work. The book also provides a glossary of key terms and concepts, making the complexity of Habermas's thought accessible to a broad readership.<br>

  Abstract: The notion of unavoidable, idealizing presuppositions of a pragmatic nature that Habermas elaborates in his later works represents an effort to nuance—and, ultimately, to replace—the confusing concept of an “ideal speech situation” that he presented in the works of his middle period. Since
                     Between Facts and Norms, Habermas has understood “counterfactual presuppositions”—or, alternatively, the “vocabulary of the as-if”—as “the nerve of my entire theoretical undertaking” (1998, 418). The social sciences in particular have paid little attention to this conceptual move, however. Accordingly, the matter represents one of the most misunderstood elements of Habermasian theory.<br>

  Book Title: Neopoetics-The Evolution of the Literate Imagination<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Collins Christopher<br>
  Abstract: The quest to understand the evolution of the literary mind has become a fertile field of inquiry and speculation for scholars across literary studies and cognitive science. In
      Paleopoetics, Christopher Collins's acclaimed earlier title, he described how language emerged both as a communicative tool and as a means of fashioning other communicative tools-stories, songs, and rituals. InNeopoetics, Collins turns his attention to the cognitive evolution of the writing-ready brain. Further integrating neuroscience into the popular field of cognitive poetics, he adds empirical depth to our study of literary texts and verbal imagination and offers a whole new way to look at reading, writing, and creative expression. Collins beginsNeopoeticswith the early use of visual signs, first as reminders of narrative episodes and then as conventional symbols representing actual speech sounds. Next he examines the implications of written texts for the play of the auditory and visual imagination. To exemplify this long transition from oral to literate artistry, Collins examines a wide array of classical texts-from Homer and Hesiod to Plato and Aristotle and from the lyric innovations of Augustan Rome to the inner dialogues of St. Augustine. In this work of "big history," Collins demonstrates how biological and cultural evolution collaborated to shape both literature and the brain we use to read it.<br>

  Abstract: In the last chapter, I discussed writing as a means of reenacting speech events such as dialogues and monologues, either for others or for oneself. If for oneself, this performance could be a silent simulation of speech using the reader’s articulatory and auditory imagination. In this concluding chapter I will sketch out some of the unique ways in which writing also began to represent aspects of the mind that only writing could reveal. We have no reason to assume that the new model of the mind that literate culture introduced was the inevitable outcome of evolutionary forces. For Europe, it<br>

Thus, for example, if we are to know how people construct an awareness of historical processes, we must learn why certain events have become memorable, how they are given explanatory meaning, and how they are integrated into earlier life experiences.

  Book Title: The Deed of Reading-Literature * Writing * Language * Philosophy<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): STEWART GARRETT<br>
  Abstract: To take the measure of literary writing,
         The Deed of Readingconvenes diverse philosophic commentary on the linguistics of literature, with stress on the complementary work of Stanley Cavell and Giorgio Agamben. Sympathetic to recent ventures in form-attentive analysis but resisting an emphasis on so-called surface reading, Stewart explores not some new formalism but the internal pressures of language in formation, registering the verbal infrastructure of literary prose as well as verse. In this mode of "contextual" reading, the context is language itself. Literary phrasing, tapping the speech act's own generative pulse, emerges as a latent philosophy of language in its own right, whereby human subjects, finding no secure place to situate themselves within language, settle for its taking place in, through, and between them.<br>

  Book Title: Outlaw Rhetoric-Figuring Vernacular Eloquence in Shakespeare's England<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mann Jenny C.<br>
  Abstract: Outlaw Rhetoricexamines the substantial and largely unexplored archive of vernacular rhetorical guides produced in England between 1500 and 1700. Writers of these guides drew on classical training as they translated Greek and Latin figures of speech into an everyday English that could serve the ends of literary and national invention. In the process, however, they confronted aspects of rhetoric that run counter to its civilizing impulse. For instance, Mann finds repeated references to Robin Hood, indicating an ongoing concern that vernacular rhetoric is "outlaw" to the classical tradition because it is common, popular, and ephemeral. As this book shows, however, such allusions hint at a growing acceptance of the nonclassical along with a new esteem for literary production that can be identified as native to England. Working across a range of genres, Mann demonstrates the effects of this tension between classical rhetoric and English outlawry in works by Spenser, Shakespeare, Sidney, Jonson, and Cavendish. In so doing she reveals the political stakes of the vernacular rhetorical project in the age of Shakespeare.<br>

  Abstract: Unlike any other medium, literature has the ability to employ the reader’s imagination in the construction of bodies. When a narrator communicates information about a text’s characters, the reader completes the act of constructing bodies by imagining their contours, postures, and gestures. A character’s gender is thus dependent upon both the narrator’s speech—his/her use of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives—and the reader’s expectations regarding gender. If the narrator omits information about the character’s gender, the reader finds clues in the text—social cues, behaviors, and actions—to fill in that information and assign one. Such moments activate literature’s potential<br>

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: This account of illocutionary force is particularly suited to illuminating struggles for recognition on the part of women who have often entered the public sphere only through the narrative form, in novels, biographies, and autobiographies. Lara is particularly interested in the way in which women take up each other’s lives to make moral claims and to fashion and refashion identities. Hannah Arendt looks at the life of Rahel Varnhagen in order to assume her own identity as a pariah, as a Jew, and as a woman; later, contemporary feminists take up Arendt’s identity as reflected in her biography of Varnhagen to fashion their own. Simone de Beauvoir creates a fictional self to sort through her lived relationship to Jean Paul Sartre, which then becomes the site for contemporary feminists to sort through their own identity and autonomy. This loop occurs repeatedly in what Lara, following Ricoeur, sees as a tripartite mimesis. In mimesis 2, Jane Austen takes up the limited life of the women of her time (mimesis 1) to construct an identity for women that is then taken up again by contemporary women in films of Jane Austen’s novels (mimesis 3) to continue to construct that identity. Moreover, what is told in these looping narratives is the way in which women are and become moral agents. Thus, while many commentators have associated Austen only with Aristotle, with an ethics of virtue, Lara is just as interested in the morality of principle that Austen’s heroines exhibit. Moreover, she emphasizes the extent to which the moral claims Austen raises are validated through the narrative structure of her novels. This is a relationship that Martha Nussbaum also articulates, as Lara notes. For both, it is through the structure of narrative and imaginative speech that moral claims become not only rationally justified but compelling as well.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: What about the last dimension of the constitution of moral action, the dimension of practical reason? Ricoeur agrees with Hans‐Georg Gadamer that judgment and interpretation cannot be removed from the application of laws and principles to particular cases. Hence, he also accepts Ronald Dworkin’s argument against legal positivism. Because legal positivism identifies the meaning of a law with its original intent, it is left no recourse in hard cases that seem to be outside the purview of this intent except to appeal to the discretionary power of the judge. In contrast, Ricoeur emphasizes a criterion of validity that looks to the narrative coherence of a legal judgment in view of the history of the legal enterprise. Yet, Ricoeur thinks that Dworkin misses the opportunity to coordinate his “narrativist notion of fit” (p. 114) with a theory of argumentation borrowed from Habermas and the Erlangen School. Just as Rawls’s theory of justice lends formalism to the selection of principles of justice within a community of shared understandings and aspirations, Habermas’s discourse theory lends formalism to Dworkin’s interpretive judgments insofar as interpreters must argue for their interpretations under a set of discourse rules. Indeed, Ricoeur sees the ideal endpoint of a trial as a kind of ideal speech situation in which both winner and loser recognize each other as subjects of rights whose causes should have been heard, who made plausible arguments, and whose arguments were heard (p. 131).<br>

Date: 06 2002<br>
Author(s): Vidal Fernando<br>
Abstract: The gist of Boyle’s argument is that since no one particular portion of matter determines personal identity, the sameness of the terrestrial and the resurrected individual is not to be judged by material criteria. The soul, in his view, “shall be again united, not to an aetherial, or the like fluid matter, but to such a substance as may, with tolerable propriety of speech … be called a human body” (
            “S,”p. 201). The basic, minimal substance must be nonvolatile and possess plastic power. In a similar argument, and also citing resurrected plants, Leibniz speculated that each body possesses a “flower of substance” endowed with a “seminal power.”86The conservation of such “flower” could account for the physical possibility of resurrection. Again, numerical identity is no longer the ultimate criterion for individual identity, nor for the identity between terrestrial and resurrected bodies.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Durantis presentation of the three paradigms of the study of language and anthropology in the United States is useful not only for anthropologists but also for discourse analysts. Indeed, one source of modern discourse analysis coincides with the second paradigm described by Duranti, namely, the study of communicative events by Hymes, Gumperz, and others in the ethnography of communication. In fact, it was roughly in the same period (196474) that other developments took place that can be interpreted as historical foundations of discourse studies and as paradigm breaks with formal (structuralist or generative) linguistics, such as text grammar, semiotics, pragmatics, conversation analysis, and the psychology of text processing. In other words, the paradigm shift in anthropology is part of a much more general international movement in which interest has shifted from socially contextfree formal grammar or fixed or elicited data to the more dynamic properties of talk, spontaneous everyday interaction, speech acts, strategic processing, nonverbal communication, and social context, that is, to actual language use and discourse.<br>

Abstract: We have thus followed a strange movement, a sort of coming and going between perceiving subjects and perceived objects, a zoom effect like that of a camera trying to set the right distance with its object in order to achieve a maximum degree of clarity—total transparency. On the one hand, we have seen how the tricky adjustment between the multiplicity of stabilized representations of Hawking and my face‐to‐face interaction with him has fragmented his identity. Like an impressionist painting, distance allows us to see what proximity causes us to lose. The layering of the multiplicity of narratives about Hawking reveals the stable identity of an individual that face‐to‐face contact does not allow. The closer we get to the object‐subject, the further we move from it. We no longer know who or where he is. All the categories we normally use in thinking about a person, a body, a machine, a mind, an interaction, a conversation, a text, and speech are blurred. In his presence, Hawking seems even more difficult to seize than we had imagined. The reason is, first, because, as we have shown, the depth of the social body (the one that talks of the other as much as of itself and allows the accumulation of self‐definitions), normally visible but unnoticed in any interaction, is absent in his case. Second, the internal functioning of the flesh‐and‐blood body, normally invisible, becomes visible and distributed here (the
      Iandlegsare mixed in the same discourse and are detached from the body; they are before him while his voice is next to him, and the flesh‐and‐blood body is collectively taken care of) and omnipresent (it appears at different moments during the interaction). Third, the machine, by the coordination of the actions it allows, disturbs the interaction as much as it creates it. This is where the confusion and fragmentation of identity is pursued by recomposition. Here we follow, step by step, how the machine to which this silent body is attached makes the component~<br>

Abstract: Camus outlined his idea of his art and the role of the writer that is resonant with the title of his short story collection,
            Exile and the Kingdom,in his 1957 Nobel Prize acceptance speech, available online (http://www.nobel.se/literature/laureates/1957/camus‐acceptance.html): “[My art] is a means of stirring the greatest number of people by offering them a privileged picture of common joys and sufferings. It obliges the artist not to keep himself apart; it subjects him to the most humble and the most universal truth.… By definition he cannot put himself today in the service of those who make history; he is at the service of those who suffer it. Otherwise, he will be alone and deprived of his art. Not all the armies of tyranny with their millions of men will free him from his isolation, even and particularly if he falls into step with them. But the silence of an unknown prisoner, abandoned to humiliations at the other end of the world, is enough to draw the writer out of his exile, at least whenever, in the midst of the privileges of freedom, he manages not to forget that silence, and to transmit it in order to make it resound by means of his art.”<br>

Abstract: Against the act of oblivion described above, I begin by invoking two terms from the rhetorical corpus:
            brevitasandcopia. Brevity or concision is a familiar norm, butcopia,or the capacity for elegant variation and elaboration of a given theme, is not. These terms appear to be mutually exclusive principles, but they are never regarded as such in antiquity. The choice between them is a question of what is appropriate to a particular context or aim. And yet in retrospect the rhetorical tradition can seem heavily weighted in favor ofcopia. Although Erasmus contended, for example, in his hugely popularDe copiathat “no artist will better compress speech to conciseness than he who has skill to enrich the same with as varied an ornamentation as possible,” the work itself was given over, as its title promises, to the techniques of elegant variation.40The concept ofcopia,as Terence Cave has pointed out, was never a technical term in rhetoric, but the popularity of Erasmus’s work suggests why it came in some ways to stand for rhetoric itself.41When other stylistic norms emerged in the revisionist rhetorics of Adam Smith and his successors, the choice forbrevitasovercopiaexpressed an implicit dissatisfaction with the whole system of rhetoric.<br>

Abstract: The analogy with political speech, supported by the observation that a community’s official doctrines are the products of controversy, suggests that the ability of these doctrines to define and sustain a sense of identity might be their most basic function. The curious fact that theologically trivial or obscure points often attain tremendous doctrinal importance suggests that doctrines derive their significance more from their effectiveness in defining the identity of a community than from their putative correspondence to metaphysical reality. The life‐and‐death importance attached to the cognitively obscure difference between the Nicene
         homoousiosand the semi‐Arianhomoiousiosexemplifies this idea that doctrinal differences derive much of their original significance from the dynamics of social and political struggle. Mundane political discourse represents the limit case of this phenomenon, allowing us to see its basic features with stark clarity. The political slogan or label has meaning only relationally, its political use having effaced much of the intrinsic cognitive content of its words.39This neutralization of semantic or descriptive meaning allows these words more effectively to take on emotionally charged connotations from the political context and thus to serve as effective means for shaping and directing public sentiment. While the political analogy carries the obvious danger of reductionism if pressed too far, an acknowledgment of the political dimension of theological debate nevertheless sheds light on the way certain theological doctrines are able to hold tremendous religious significance in spite of—or perhaps precisely because of—their informational vacuity.<br>

Abstract: The configurational act is one of composition or grasping together. It is an act that extracts a configuration from that which is otherwise a succession of events [
            14]. In the series of operations, configuration is the turning point or crucial pivot; it is the mediation between prefiguration and the rest of the process. “What is at stake … is the concrete process by which the textual configuration mediates between the prefiguration of the practical field and the refiguration through the reception of the work” [14, p. 53]. This moment of articulation may have a range of expression, including speech and writing, and it is through this expression that configuration opens up the experience, which itself has come in prenarrative form, to the process of emplotment.<br>

Abstract: Nonetheless this poses a problem, especially when it comes to the interpretation and implementation of human rights.
         14Thus some countries insist on their own religious interpretation of human rights, as is evident in the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam preparatory to the Second UN Human Rights Conference in Vienna in 1993, which states that “the islamic Shari’ah is the only source of reference for the explanation or clarification of any of the articles of this Declaration.”15As for the implementation of human rights, there are religious institutions like the Catholic Church, which, while recognizing human rights in societal domains outside their own, reject or limit some of these rights within their own domains, for instance, gender equality, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech—and do so on religious grounds.<br>

Abstract: The Gen. 1:27 myth can be said in part to represent, from this angle, a narrative of the human narrative capability: a narrative of a capability that lies at the very origins or limits of human narration as such. This capability is here represented by humankind being affirmed as an image of a Creator who creates, precisely, by narrating. That is, the Creator is affirmed to have made the world by speech (“And God said, ‘Let there be light’; and there was light”; “Then God said, ‘Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness'”) and over a period of time (seven days). Genesis 1 is a story of the world as created by story. As the image of such a Creator, humankind is placed in touch with narration’s ultimate mystery: the impossibility, finally, of narrating our capacity for narration itself. Such can only be mythologized as an image of something invisible and divine: a peculiar form of narration that resists reduction to anything that could ever be understood from actual history. From this angle, human ethical narration is affirmed as an imitation of divine narration. It consists in a primordial capability for simultaneously ahistorical (or free) and historical intentionality over time.<br>

Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: The concept of the good may apply particularly pointedly to professional codes of ethics. The codes are aimed at the positive right of free speech and also at professional responsibility. They attempt to articulate practical and normative standards of ethics. Both the ALA Code of Ethics and the American Society for Information Science and Technology Professional Guidelines speak in terms of responsibility to communities, to the profession, and to society as a whole. Public pronouncement of the codes does serve to affirm the existence of libraries as just institutions in a democracy. Related to the second scenario above, accuracy does fit with the good since it is in people’s interest to obtain accurate information that they can employ for their own well‐being. Advocacy is certainly not always and everywhere prohibited, but it is secondary to people’s right to information that is as accurate as it is possible to provide. Accuracy also embraces a commitment to truth, which recognizes a fundamental inequality of some information (the true and the false; refer again to the first scenario). It is generally taken to be responsible professionalism to check information sources against one another to corroborate information. This action, as Lynch observes, is not a substitute for truth; it is a means to truth (in the weak sense) [
         19, p. 81]. Toward the end of accuracy and truth, there are some closely related matters. For one thing, there have been some persistent challenges related to government information and its accessibility versus its effective suppression. This is an area in which advocacy and accuracy merge, with the common aim of presenting library users with the most authoritative information possible. Also, libraries’ access mechanisms, including subject headings, can benefit from advocacy directed toward language that encompasses the culture, linguistic distinctions, and other facets of the people who will search for information.<br>

Abstract: It should be noted that the writings of Floridi have not gone unnoticed among scholars in library science. For example, an entire issue of the journal
            Library Trends(Winter 2004) was devoted to analyzing and critiquing Floridi’s work. Explanations of library science as the applied domain of the philosophy of information (as defined by Floridi) offer an intriguing approach to laying a new foundation for understanding the practice of what we do and why we do it. However, like Budd's exploration of library philosophy [6], the problem of truth is not central to the analysis. In particular, there is no consideration of the act of truth‐seeking being challenged increasingly by the vagaries of the digital age. Rather than being positioned as one of the foundational issues for analysis, references to the problem of truth in Floridi’s published writings orbit around other topics, crossing into view only as truth relates to a concern he expresses that philosophy of information should not be bounded by a communication‐based concept of information that correlates to a correspondence theory of truth [47] or that it is used as a synecdoche figure of speech to illuminate ideas of false information.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: This dialectic may not be as easy to recognize in a disciplinary imposter like film as in a putatively stable example like English—which was immediately considered a likely model for film. At first blush, English certainly names a field, one usually taken to be expanding outward from a core of anglophone literary classics, toward official or personal documents, and then toward zones of popular and folk expressions, including oral culture. But English, perhaps more usefully, refers as well to a set of reading practices, a kind of schooled attention that distinguishes itself whenever faculty from around the university happen to get together to discuss some common topic. On these occasions the English professor can be counted on to address the complexities of representation and expression that constitute or relate to the topic. Deliberately or automatically, she or he would be likely to deploy some form of rhetorical analysis, be it formal, deconstructive, philological, generic, or what have you, often making a point through elaborate figures of speech, allusions to literary works, and ornate diction. The MLA houses language and literature scholars who think and talk this way, including not just those in English but in the fields of Spanish, Slavic, Japanese, and so on who share (or debate) this array of approaches and attitudes that are meant to make sense of, and put into play, similar types of subject matter.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: In conclusion, Coleridge testifies, in poetry and theological reflection alike, to an internal struggle constitutive of prayer and its language. Going back to the most recent philosophical discussions, this is not incompatible with Derrida’s insistence that the words of prayer are always inappropriate to the Other. Yet because Coleridgean prayer is a response, this struggle is entirely fitting: the call of God upon the subject is to open up the for‐God in one’s being, thus by definition practicing a kind of violence against one’s current being—including one’s speech. In
         Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit, Coleridge describes the name of God, the “I Am,” as part of a religious category called “stasis.” Prayer, however, is part ofmetastasis‐anastasis(change of state/rising up): the conflictual, dynamic, unfinished scene of human redemption that includes grace, love, hope, and perseverance.71Appropriately enough, the primary signification of metastasis is a transition between rhetorical figures. For Coleridge, there can be no transformation in one’s spiritual state unless the language in which one responds is also transformed, wrenched toward the improper. The heart of Coleridgean prayer is the metastasis between proper signification and catachresis that cuts against one’s language, one’s understanding, and hence one’s being in order to open oneself up to God. Perhaps one may even argue that in this cut, this wound, made against the “fleshly Understanding” (N6666, fol. 83), “the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered” (Rom. 8:26). This, certainly, is a hope on which much of his poetry and certainly his philosophy of prayer is founded.<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: Revelation of the transcendent is always apocalyptic, but apocalypse is not limited to religious discourse: “For in poetry, language is broken open to let the previously inconceivable appear” (24). The negative capability of poetry is a creative deconstruction akin to negative theology, and this is especially true of modernist poetry that reflects on the limits of its own representation. The result is deconstructive—a breaking down of the idols of thought and speech—but also openness to what we cannot conceive or represent. The deconstructive power of literature reveals and reveils grace or gift, but Franke insists that this openness to transcendent mystery has no positive or dogmatic content. However, to deny this openness as irrational repeats the dogmatism of absolutist belief, and here Franke parts company with Habermas and insists that such openness informs reason. None of us has a privileged vantage point to confirm or deny the transcendent, and reason itself requires an openness that questions the present in pursuit of new knowledge.<br>

Abstract: It is difficult to imagine that any recitation would occur at the level of everyday language. Rather, it probably was uttered at the level of ritual oratory, that is, in a stressed register akin to a chant or prayer. High register and marked rhythm have long been recognized as components of ritual persuasion. Tambiah describes the “hyper‐regular surface structure of ritual language,”
            21and the way that modulations of speed, loudness, and rhythm can foreground certain messages, “telescoping or fusing them into an amalgam that is given motion and direction by compelling illocutionary words of command and persuasion or declaration.”22Bloch too observes the intangible sense of power communicated through the stressed register created by fixed speech and gesture,23and others have studied the rhythmic drivers within ritual performance and their effects on neurophysiology.24Such studies support this recitation as powerful in the way of rhythmic or musical performances, which exert pressure on bodies and persons and render the underlying messages difficult to resist.25<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: Just as literature effaces the proper meaning of words, imposing a slippage that leaves the reader with no firm ground to stand on, so this essay effaces the proper meaning of Lévinas's text. To return to Blanchot's letter to Malka, it reveals to us finally what Blanchot meant when he said that in a
         certainway Judaism was so close to him that he could not speak of it. In what way is Judaism close to Blanchot? This proximity is one that must be announced as a distance. In maintaining that distance is not Blanchot declaring himself more loyal than Lévinas to the teaching of deracination, of which Blanchot considers Lévinas to be the teacher? In his letter to Malka and in his rewriting of Lévinas's essay “Heidegger, Gagarin, and Us,” Blanchot is answering Lévinas's call for Judaism to announce a new teaching to the postwar world. Undoubtedly Lévinas intended this call to strengthen both the Jewish community and the broader perception of Judaism's message. Blanchot's interpretation could be interpreted as doing the opposite. At the very least, it ignores the pragmatics of Lévinas's concerns. Yet, for Blanchot, Judaism's political power is only realized in renunciation. Its highest teaching, he suggests, is that there must be a gap between the call and the one in whose name the call is made. This is a space that literature discloses, offering us a mode of political speech that does not operate on the principle of mythical identification but rather ceaselessly interrupts itself, reminding us that fulfillment is not yet.<br>

Abstract: Likening the eagle's speech to a bird's song, Dante gives another example in the following canto in which nonhuman creatures and blessed humans are analogous. Here he suggests that we can know “blessedness” through a bird's song. Thus, with the present tense emphasizing eternal action (“si spazia” [soars], “tace” [silences], “sazia” [satiates]) the lark sings and then falls silent because, like the blessed, it satisfies its desires within itself:<br>

Issue: 656725<br>
Date: 01 01, 2011<br>
Author(s): Pranger Burcht<br>
Abstract: If that is indeed the case, it is our historical duty to realize that the rhetoric of
      Confessionscomprises both sound and silence to the effect that the fullness of voice can sound in such a way that it is possible to say about Augustine—and his reader—that he “did not hear [its] silence.” Is that perhaps the essence of the fact that what Augustine is looking for cannot but be a momentary gift and that the rhetoric of this search in all its loudness comes down to shaping the fact that it cannot be ascertained, beyond the “speech act” ofconfessioitself, whether that which is given sounds or not? Saying this, we do not find ourselves in the realm of mystical silence. We are, rather, faced with the demands of rhetorical precision. For to establish the magic of a language of desire that is given—a language with the power of Kafka's hammer of the facts of life in the shape of the song of the Sirens—confessiohas to be framed and shaped, dramatized and theatricalized. Consequently, the possibility has to be taken into account that the phrase “Ulysses did not hear the silence of the Sirens” is not the final word about the matter, just as the dialectic of speech and silence cannot be taken to function as an automatism.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673367<br>
Date: 02 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Lehnhof Kent R.<br>
Abstract: In these lines, we might find the rudiments of an early modern rationale for Levinas’s claim that
         autruiis always and only human. Perplexed by his anthropocentric stance, several of Levinas’s critics have asked why the “I” is not also ordained by the alterity of animals, or even plants. Though Levinas answers religiously (the human other bears “the trace of God,” whereas plants and animals do not), the human exceptionalism established in Lear’s speech is different. As Laurie Shannon has shown, it is a negative exceptionalism, predicated upon the underprovisioned condition of humankind. Whereas nonhuman animals are naturally “coated,” the human creature Lear considers is uniquely naked, compelled to case himself in secondhand skins, or “lendings.” Given Levinas’s insistence on the essential nudity ofautrui, Lear’s vision of “unaccommodated man” seems relevant. As Shannon remarks, the “poor, bare, forked animal” we are made to see in the play raises the question of whether any animal other than the human may fairly be deemed “naked.” See Laurie Shannon, “Poor, Bare, Forked: Animal Sovereignty, Human Negative Exceptionalism, and the Natural History ofKing Lear,”Shakespeare Quarterly60 (2009): 168–96.<br>

Abstract: Historiography, too, was part of the larger process. Memory turned into history is traceable in written form from the beginning of the third century BC onward. We have evidence of honorific funerary inscriptions, increasing in scale with the sarcophagi and
         elogiaeto the Scipiones. The earliest known funerary oration (laudatio funebris), which survives in fragmentary form and was presumably a speech recorded in writing, dates from 221 BC; it concerns the twice consul—although this information is absent from the textual fragment—andpontifex maximusL. Caecilius Metellus. Religious data were included in historiography, which took shape in different generic forms, following or modifying Greek models.
               By the middle of the third century BC, the16
            pontifex maximusTiberius Coruncanius began to record pontificalcommentarii, protocols of changes in memberships, prodigies observed, decisions taken. Ascription of agency to actors, and hence the situating of specific priesthoods within a network of ever more formalized and differentiated authorities, seems to have been the dominant function. Thus we know that in 275 or 274 BC Lucius Postumius Albinus was the priest called therex sacrorum.
               In that capacity he witnessed the introduction of a new divinatory practice: the17
            haruspicesstarted to pay attention to the heart of the sacrificial victim in their scrutiny of entrails.

Abstract: The second two qualities of metaphor important to early modern tragedy’s use of the figure pertain to the effects of this conceptual reorganization on the audience. Many theorists of metaphor describe the figure as “provoking,” “inviting,” or “asking” something of the audience.
      
            Thus, the third notable quality of metaphor is its function as, in the words of Ted Cohen, an “intimate” figure that forges a community by initiating a “cooperative act of comprehension.” Cohen argues that metaphor, as a special type of speech, emphasizes a process present but generally unstated in all communication: “Three aspects are involved: (1) the speaker issues a kind of concealed invitation; (2) the hearer expends a special effort to accept the invitation; and (3) this transaction constitutes the acknowledgment of a community.”15
         
            In doing the work of deciphering the relationship between tenor and vehicle, the strange and the familiar, audiences become part of an interpretive community, both drawn into the interpretation intended by the maker of the metaphor and participating in the creation of new knowledge formulated through the metaphoric conjunction. If the metaphor is accepted, and thus both the tenor and vehicle are “modified” in the process, the poet and the audience have been carried by the metaphor into a new discursive community. In the tragic theater’s metaphors of pain, this process paves the way for further audience engagement with the play in the forms of empathy for the characters and potential adoption of a new worldview.16

Abstract: Murray Jardine continues this theme of “foundations without foundationalism” in his essay “Sight, Sound, and Participatory Symbolization,” which compares the communications of print and speech in the context of Voegelin's and Poteat's philosophies. According to Jardine, literate cultures tend to promote thinking of symbols as visual phenomena, which results in neglecting the initial experiential content behind them. Voegelin's conception of consciousness as participatory and his emphasis on experience asks us to return to an oral culture in which reality is conceived of in a personal context; what this context consists of, however, especially with respect to Christianity, is a source of disagreement for Voegelin and Poteat. For Jardine, Voegelin misconceptualized Christian revelation in terms of nature instead of human creativity, leading to a dogmatization of own symbolization of the Christian experience (83). This misconception of Christianity stems from Voegelin's belief that Christian revelation has been “a closed matter” since the time of Augustine.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>

Author(s): Ashley David<br>
Abstract: This paper analyzes J. Habermas's theory of “universal pragmatics” and examines the extent to which Habermas's ideal speech community is predicted upon a specific type of relationship between the individual and society. The ability of the theory of universal pragmatics to overcome the form of domination institutionalized by modern societies is questioned, and the argument is made that Habermas's radical program of emancipation is vitiated (1) by Habermas's conflation of “transcendental” and “situationally engaged” enlightenment and (2) by Habermas's inability to reintegrate practical-emancipatory and technical forms of reason. Habermas's idea of “communicative competence” replicates, rather than displaces, the “modern” solution to the problem of the relationship between the individual and society.<br>

Article Title: Generic Studies: Their Renewed Importance in Religious and Literary Interpretation<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263709<br>

Author(s): Wiggins Mary<br>
Abstract: In recent years, the need for a critique of "reader" as rigorous as that which has been developed for "text" and for "author" has become increasingly acute. Whether in the study of religion as story and biography or in interpretative reading in general, a critical notion of reader is essential if the act of reading is to be anything other than mere consumption of texts. Some new way of understanding the hermeneutical circle is required to avert the narcissism latent in the Anselmian model. The notion of "genre" as developed by four recent theorists is helpful in the task of constructing a critique of "reader." E. D. Hirsch, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Tzvetán Todorov, and Paul Ricoeur have each surpassed the idealist notion of genre as a classificatory device and developed in its place the notion of genre as a generative pinciple. Todorov, for example, illustrates how "form" is a theoretical, as distinct from a descriptive or explanatory, issue. According to both Hirsch and Todorov, somewhere between empirical details and metaphysical thematizations lie generic formulations which can assist the reader to organize his/her response to the text and to recognize the probable understanding toward which the conventions of the text are directed. In Gadamer's theory of interpretation, the notion of genre acquires historicity. After Gadamer, genres can no longer be regarded as timeless a priori categories. Rather, because they are constituted by historical reflections, their rise and decline are intrinsic to text-interpretation. Finally, in Ricoeur's theory that generic considerations are correlative principles of production and interpretation, we find a basis for understanding genre as praxis. If we understand reading to be isomorphic to authoring, it becomes clear that the reader can no longer be regarded as the self-evident recipient of text-signification. Genre, in Ricoeur's theory, transforms "speech" into a "work" and points toward a new notion of "reader" as one whose reconst~<br>

Abstract: Recent study of the nature of textuality as such opens new insights for the study of the Bible. Although individual parts of the Bible have oral antecedents, the Bible as a whole has existed only as a text, and a unique kind of text, folded back on itself out of communal memory as no other book has been. A text is a monument. Textuality establishes a special relationship between discourse and death. Spoken words are exchanges between living persons. The text presents its message as well if its author is dead as it does if he or she is alive. Print is even more bound to death than writing is. In comparison with oral performance-delivery of an oration, song-a text physically has certain special alliances with past time. All texts come out of the past. Literature as text is psychologically retrospective: its effects typically include an element of nostalgia. Because of its future orientation, culminating in the closing words of Revelation, "Come, Lord Jesus" (as against typical narrative closes such as "They lived happily ever after"), the Bible has an unusual relationship to textuality: it is not literature in the way other texts are. Typical narrative plot structures existence retrospectively: the story is organized back from the conclusion. This retrospective organization is maximized by writing, which tightens plot and makes more of re-cognition, a kind of return to the beginning (the past) and hence a cyclic pattern. In addition to being related intimately to death, writing and print are also limitlessly fecund, the central forces in the evolution of consciousness, once they appear. The fecundity of writing and print, like other fecundity in human existence, is achieved by passage through death. "Unless the grain of wheat dies." The Word of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is conceived of by analogy with the spoken word. The Father speaks the Word, the Son (eo verbum quo filius); he does not write the Word, who would then by biblical attestation be not life but d~<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303098<br>
Date: 7 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): White Gabriel<br>
Abstract: The article draws on a doctoral dissertation which suggests a different approach to Ottoman historical texts. Its chief argument is that contrary to current scholarly assumptions, the seventeenth-century Tarih-i Al-i Osman works are not unstructured mines of information useful only for the reconstruction of extrinsic referents. Informed by the so-called linguistic or literary turn in some quarters of historical scholarship, the dissertation approaches the historical texts as a historiographic corpus that constitutes a narrative discourse containing a variety of interpretations, judgments, and meanings conveyed by various forms of language. The article itself is a reading of a historiographic story, the Haile-i Osmaniye (Ottoman tragedy), in the light of a twofold scholarly debate over (1) the author's intentions, and (2) the speech/writing polarity. The story covers the deposition and assassination of Osman II as well as the subsequent second reign of Mustafa I (May 1622-September 1623). After identifying the central historical account of the event, from which the entire historiographic story evolves, I propose a double reading of it: (1) the central text is interpreted as an oral address (i.e., a speech situation) delivered to and intended for a specific audience; (2) the central text is analyzed in terms of its use by seventeenth-century historians who integrated it into their histories and for whom this text represented a written artifact rather than a speech situation.<br>

Abstract: Since the language of political inquiry seems to be inescapably metaphorical, the question necessarily arises as to how metaphors of various types, including models, enter into the composition and expression of political knowledge. The solutions that have been most influential in contemporary political science can be called the verificationist and constitutivist views of political metaphor. While both views contain important elements of truth, there are fundamental difficulties in each that require the search for a more satisfactory view. An alternative view of metaphor and political knowledge is developed by reference to four main problems: Why is political speech metaphorical? How do metaphors make political things manifest? How are political metaphors tested? and Are metaphors indispensable to political expression and political knowledge?<br>

Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
Abstract: The first part of the essay explore's three features of Wolterstorff's account of God as a performer of speech acts: (1) the claim that God literally speaks, suggesting that this claim needs something like a Thomistic theory of analogy as an alternative to univocity and mere metaphor; (2) the claim that speaking is not reducible to revealing; and (3) the political implications of these claims, especially in relation to Habermasian theory. The second part focuses on the theory of double discourse, which seeks to make sense of the notion that God speaks to us through the human voices of prophets, apostles, and especially of Scripture, and seeks to show that a fuller account of the speech act by which God deputizes or appropriates human speech is needed. The final section suggests that Ricoeur and Derrida are not the threat to his theory that Wolterstorff takes them to be and that their emphasis on the text, rather than the author, makes sense in contexts where we have only the text to consult.<br>

Author(s): Schutz Richard<br>
Abstract: The introduction to the symposium sets out a methodological framework for the apprehension of Southeast Asian rituals, languages, and literary texts so that they are at once open to cross-cultural comparative analysis and recorded in social and symbolic contextual detail. Philosopher Paul Ricoeur's use of the term "interpretation" is central here: he urges students of cultures to combine attention to structural features of language and culture (for example, grammatical patterns) with inquiries into social contextual features (for example, speech usage in real communities). Moving back and forth between the two sorts of analysis allows researchers to bring the insights of the one pole to the investigation of the other; the full hermeneutic process constitutes interpretation. This style of inquiry, a modification of the sort of interpretive social science developed by Geertz and Becker, allows Southeast Asianists to draw on careful ethnography to make crucial "course corrections" in anthropological and linguistic theory building in general.<br>

Publisher: The Association for Asian Studies, Inc.<br>
Issue: i309685<br>
Date: 8 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Wurm Richard<br>
Abstract: The logic of Indonesian subjectless and tenseless expressions appears to have cultural implications, just as the use of tenses in English scientific writing entails much more than grammatical minutiae. A. L. Becker has pointed out that tense in English functions in a "coherence system" that pervades and transcends grammar. A parallel coherence system is suggested for Indonesian, based not on tense but on topic. Paul Ricoeur's distinction between LANGUAGE and DISCOURSE is the basis of the claim that Indonesian sentences cohere on the bond between grammatical subject and discourse topic. Examples are drawn from a number of contexts that call forth passive sentences in Indonesian. The article concludes on another suggestion by Becker. The Indonesian topic may be part of a larger deictic category of person, which may be related in discourse to orientation in space--both physical and social--of participants in the speech event. If this suggestion is correct, then the contrast between English and Indonesian coherence systems may be found in the opposition tense/time vs. person/space.<br>

Author(s): ZIÓŁKOWSKI MAREK<br>
Abstract: The present paper is an analysis of the functioning of memory, selective memory and oblivion (or to put it differently—the game of remembering, partial remembering and forgetting) in Poland during the period of democratic transformation which, after long years of dictatorship and the hibernation of public discourse, ensures freedom of speech and encourages expression of different beliefs as well as articulation of divergent interests. It defines two distinct layers of memory and oblivion and, consequently, two main types of hidden or repressed elements which may be dubbed "skeletons in the nation's history closet." One is linked with the pre-communist past (before 1945), while the other is connected with the communist past (1945-1989). The latter is linked to political differences—within the same ethnic group—which presently constitute a very hot issue but are less likely to be inherited over more than two generations. The former comprises mostly nationwide skeletons, related mainly to contacts between the Polish and other ethnic groups and involving the sense of collective identity, collective pride, collective guilt, and collectively suffered injustice. On the one hand, these skeletons are currently still more willingly kept in the closet because they can be detrimental to the perception and self-perception of the national group as a whole, but on the other hand the memory of these ethnic and religious conflicts is more likely to be inherited and internalized by future generations for much longer. The question of how to facilitate the process of removing the nationwide skeletons from the national memory closet seems, therefore, all the more important.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this essay is to define the nature of the metaphor in Berdiczewski's novel Miriam (1921). For this purpopse I examine the short story included in Miriam about the scholar who was studying a book entitled The Gate of Heaven. Comparing this story with other literary texts which present a hero who stands in a mystical or philosophical sense before the gate of Heaven illuminates the historic-generative essence of the above metaphor. Using the theoretical and methodological system developed by three scholars (P. Ricuer, D. Schon and B. Indurkyia) to follow the metaphorical process, I attempt to show that Berdiczewski's metaphors are not only figures of speech; they form our essential cultural and historical cognition (tolada in Hebrew). I therefore suggest applying to Berdiczewski's metaphor the form 'historic-generative metaphor.'<br>

Abstract: In 'Anti-Latomus' (1521), Luther defined the concept of metaphor from a Christological viewpoint, thus touching upon the relationship between the word of God and the word of man, theology and aesthetics. In his later work 'Vom Abendmahl Christi. Bekenntnis' (1528) an eschatological frame of reference determines his interpretation of the words of institution as metaphorical but real speech.<br>

Abstract: The article replies to the polemic by Nicholas Onuf. It defends a particular conceptualisation of metaphor distinguishing between conceptual metaphors and metaphorical expressions and explaining why metaphors are unidirectional. Following this, performativity of speech is addressed. Then metaphors of European integration are discussed. Finally, the case for metaphorical analysis is put in terms of ontology, epistemology and methodology.<br>

Author(s): ZIRK-SADOWSKI MAREK<br>
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to indicate that it is impossible to describe the difference betweeen logical sentences and norms on the level of the structure of the language but it has to be done only on the level of the use of the language, viz. the act of speech. The author stresses specificity of the natural language in which every legal norm is formulated. He emphasizes the difference between extensional and intensional language stating that the natural language should be ranked among the latter. La tâche de l'article est de démontrer que la différence entre les phrases logiques et les normes ne peut pas être décrite sur le niveau de la structure de la langue, mais seulements sur le niveau de son usage, c'est-à-dire sur le niveau d'un acte de la parole. L'auteur souligne la specificité de la langue naturelle dans laquelle de chaque norme juridique est formulée. Il met l'accent sur la différence entre le langues extensionelles et intensionelles et constate que la langue naturelle est la langue intensionelle. Dieser Artikel bezweckt, nachzuweisen, daß man den Unterschied zwischen logischen Sätzen und Normen auf der Strukturstufe der Sprache nicht beschreiben kann, sondern nur auf der pragmatischen Gebrauchsstufe der Sprache, d.h. des Sprechaktes. Der Autor betont einen spezifischen Charakter der Umgangssprache, in welcher jede Rechtsnorm formuliert ist. Er akzentuiert den Unterschied zwischen extensionalen und intensionalen Sprachen und stellt fest, daß die Umgangssprache eine intensionale Sprache ist.<br>

Abstract: The theoretical premise of this essay is that metaphors are not simply decorative figures of speech; they have instead played a decisive role in the formation of scientific theory. My specific intention is to show how the metaphors of the "machine", the "body" and the "invisible hand", in diverse ways, provided models with which to represent a social and economic order which was the unintended outcome of human actions. Moreover, reciprocal comparison reveals the limitations on their use, and the reasons why the "invisible hand" was more successful than the other two metaphors in conveying the concept of the competitive market.<br>

Abstract: Quentin Skinner's methodological project contains a fundamental imprecision that is rarely mentioned by the secondary literature: the assumption, present in several of his methodological texts, that a theory designed for the analysis of oral communication (speech act theory) can be unreservedly used for interpreting text. In this article I will use some of Paul Ricoeur's phenomenological insights on the difference between textual and oral communication in order to advance a systematic critique of Skinner's project and to suggest new methodological possibilities for the history of political thought and related disciplines. This procedure will also allow me to organize some of the criticism raised against Skinner's Collingwoodean approach since its inception.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, I assume that speech act theory should be based on a theory of action. I will try to show that a pragmatic theory of speech acts (Gazdar, 1981) can be easily based on a certain theory of action (a model combining Searle's and Von Wright's proposals).<br>

Abstract: The article deals with the problem of revelation in Levinas' writings. The first part of the article analizes Levinas' ideas on the Same and the Other, more particularly the topics of the face and of discourse, as these come to the fore in the first section of Totality and Infinity. Investigating the non-totalising relationship between the Same and the Other presents us with the suitable framework for understanding the relation between the finite and the Infinite. Leaving out any ontotheological speech, Levinas shows how Metaphysics is enacted in the ethical relation. The second part cootinues with a description of Levinas' position on revelation in the Jewish tradition. The active Interpretation of Biblical texts "beyond the verse" represents an opportunity of hearing the divine word today and to enter into a more primordial Order than the Order of the Same. In the course of the article, we point to affinities and striking similarities between E. Levinas' and F. Rosenzweig's view on revelation. We also demonstrate how Levinas Orients his Jewish writings to his philosophy of the Other and vice versa. In writing on revelation, Levinas' main concern seems to be the description of the possibility of a fracture in the immanent order of totality and in the self-sufficiency of reason which is its correlative. This fraction is produced by the command "thou shalt not kill", calling the Same to open itself to the Other.<br>

Abstract: On part ici de l'hypothèse que Mémoires d'aveugle. L'autoportrait et autres ruines de Jacques Derrida est en quelque sorte l'illustration de La Voix et le phénomène et donc la critique, par Derrida, de la phénoménologie de l'intuition, de la perception et de la vue. On relève toutefois aussi des rencontres avec Husserl et Kant. On n'oublie pas non plus qu'il y va de l'art, des arts visuels et, dans la grande richesse thématique de cet ouvrage, on relève des moments forts, aussi bien que des moments faibles, au sujet des arts du « visible ». La question demeurant : Derrida « voit »-il le dessin, la peinture et, même, entend-il la musique? The starting point of this paper is the hypothesis that Mémoires d'aveugle. L'autoportrait et autres ruines is somehow the illustration of Speech and Phenomenon, and constitutes consequently Derrida's critique of the phenomenology of intuition, perception and vision. It is however also possible to put the emphasis on some crossingpoints with Husserl and Kant. What should not be forgotten is the fact that what is at stake here is art, i.e. visual arts, and that in the great thematic richness of this work, it is possible to bring to light strong and weak points concerning the arts of the « visible ». But the question remains : can Derrida « see » the design, the painting, and even can he hear the music?<br>

Abstract: An initial awareness is needed of the debates regarding the choice of research approaches in sociology and the diversity and specificity of methods currently being used in the domain of textual data analysis in France. In general the influence of the French socio-linguistic tradition looms large, including, on the one hand, the older works of Michel Pécheux on the "discursive formations" and his A.A.D. (Analyse Automatique du Discours, 1969), and on the other hand, two main perspectives of the "Ecole Française d'Analyse du/de Discours" - which refer to the "speech act" concept and to the problematics of enunciation, and emphasizes the processes and "sociodiscursive practices" between socially-located speakers. Such theoretical conceptions and specific requirements lead to build on methodologies different from the classic, theme-based content analysis, though not yet translated into an operational software. Then the main software developments currently having an impact (at least potential) on practices of computer-aided sociological analysis of textual data, in France, are classified : from the lexicometric using procedures of "French Data Analysis" ('Analyse Factorielle des Correspondances' of Benzecri, and so on...), to a set of "expert-systems" working on specific theoretical frameworks, through more classical methods of content analysis and coding-sorting-retrieving socio-semantic procedures, eventually with various statistical methods. L'auteur expose d'abord quelques considèrations épistémologiques générales sur les présupposés implicites des méthodes de recherche sociologique, abusivement séparées en qualitatives et quantitatives, et des interrogations spécifiques sur le statut des corpus textuels et des pratiques socio-discursives dans différents domaines et selon divers types de problématique en sociologie. Puis, après un résumé des problématiques sociolinguistiques de l'"énonciation", propres aux courants de l'Analyse de Discours à la française", il propose~<br>

Abstract: Le théâtre de Valère Novarina reprend à sa manière la réflexion d'Augustin sur le temps comme distension de l'âme. Se confrontant à l'aporie de l'être et du non-être du temps, il projette sur l'espace de la scène, par le déploiement de la parole, cette expérience intérieure de l'esprit écartelé. Renverseur du temps, Novarina opère aussi une dispersion de temporalités multiples, un éclatement joyeux qui libère la scène et le spectateur de notre maladie chronique, et qui permet de rendre habitable le temps qui nous habite. Valère Novarina's theatre takes up and transforms Augustine's reflection on time as a distension of the soul. Confronting the aporia of time's being and non-being, it projects the inner experience of the stretched-out mind onto the space of the stage through the unfolding of speech. This theatre is also the site of a struggle with time; Novarina's dispersion of multiple temporalities produces a joyful explosion that liberates stage and spectator from our chronic illness, and transforms the time that inhabits us into an inhabitable space.<br>

Abstract: I begin with the hypothesis that Jacques Derrida's Memoirs of the Blind: The Self-Portrait and Other Ruins is in a way the illustration of Speech and Phenomena and therefore Derrida's critique of phenomenology, intuition, perception, and seeing. I also want to show in this regard parallels with both Husserl and Kant. I emphasize that what is at issue in Memoirs of the Blind is art, visual arts; and in the great thematic richness of this text, I note the high points as well as the low points concerning the arts of the "visible." The fundamental question is: Does Derrida "see" the drawing, the painting, and indeed listen to the music?<br>

Abstract: For myself the feature which qualifies schooling as schooling is the activity of 'making
distinctions'. Learning to make distinctions, along with the particular foei of learning
languages, exercising imaginativity, and achieving compétence in various basic skills: all
these disciplines occur - especially during the earlier academie grades - under an 'ethical
halo'. (The fundamental importance of imaginativity within schooling', in Ratnbou/s for
the fallen world [Toronto Tuppence Press, 1980), pp. 141-45; cf. also K. J. Popma,
'Opvoeding, Onderwijs, Schoolverband', Philosopbia Reformata 12 (nos. 1-3: 36-41, 86-93,
130-44). Schooling necessarily traditions students, especially in the faith-vision which
guides the schooling, but schoolteachers do such traditioning in the solvent of reflection,
speech, imaginativity, and skills.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur delineates how self-relatedness is implied in domains of speech, action, narra-
tion, and communal (institutional) interaction — in speech by the use of performatives (prom-
ises, assertions, déclarations) which refer to the integrity (tnistworthiness) of the speaker; in
action by the fact that acts are not simply events in the world but présupposé agency and re-
sponsibility; in narration by the subtle dialectics between character and plot, a dialectic in
which the narrating self aims at coherence of the I-self relationship over time; and, at the
communal level, because larger communal wholes (institutions) maintain their moral identity
only in the openness to otherness.<br>

Abstract: Envisagée dans une perspective discursive et énonciative, l'opération historiographique se révèle être une mise en discours du passé et de son espace. En tant que configuration et représentation, elle se fonde sur différents types de mémoire individuelle et collective qu'elle configure par différents moyens discursifs et rhétoriques. Suffisamment compréhensive, elle contribue à l'institution de régimes et de logiques de spatio-temporalité qui, eux-mêmes marqués dans le temps et dans l'espace, correspondent à des régimes de vérité pratique, ayant une efficacité discursive dans le présent. Éloignées dans l'espace et dans le temps comme c'est le cas pour la Grèce antique ou plus proches de nous, ces opérations d'" historiopoiésis " reposent sur des approches anthropologiques. /// From the discursive perspective of speech acts, the writing of history turns out to be the working out of a discourse about the past and its space. As a configuration and representation, it has grounds in various types of individual and collective memories that it configures using diverse discursive and rhetorical means. Sufficiently comprehensive, it helps institute spatiotemporal systems and "logics" that, with markers of time and space, correspond to systems of practical truth with discursive effectiveness in the present. Whether remote in space and time (as in the case of Ancient Greece) or close to us, these "historiopoiesis" operations rely on anthropological approaches.<br>

Abstract: En s'appuyant sur un commentaire du texte de la première nuit du Kitāb al-Imtāʿ wa-l-muʾānasa d'Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī, cet article se propose de montrer la place primordiale qu'occupe la parole conversante (al-muḥādaṯa) dans la pensée arabe classique. La conversation, ḥadīṯ, constitue bien dans la culture arabe à la fois un paradigme épistémique dominant et un cadre généralisé d'expériences esthético-éthiques: la parole conversante fonctionne à la fois comme facteur de construction des contextes d'interaction au sein desquels se tissent les réseaux de sociabilité et d'échanges intellectuels fécondants (muqābasa), comme action cathartique qui libère l'âme et purifie l'esprit, comme facteur de sublimation et d'émancipation de la personne (ʿitq). Ainsi, l'analyse de toutes ces formes de manifestation de la parole conversante dans la champ de l'adab nous a permis d'aboutir à deux conclusions complémentaires: premièrement, selon la conception de la culture propre à la vision anthropologique inhérente au système de l'adab, la culture ne se transmet pas héréditairement, mais par fréquentation, interaction et contact entre personnes contemporaines. Deuxièmement, l'adīb véritable, tel que nous en avons un exemple vivant dans la figure d'al-Tawḥīdī, est celui qui se montre capable de créer et prendre en charge les occasions de sociabilité et d'échanges permettant aux individus d'une même époque de s'insérer dans le tissu de la contemporanéité concrète et de s'influencer et se cultiver les uns les autres. /// Based on a commentary of the first night in Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī's Kitāb al-Imtāʿ wa-l-muʾānasa, the purpose of this article is to show the essential place held by conversing speech (al-muḥādaṯa) in classical Arabic thought. In Arabic culture, conversation (ḥadīṯ) represents indeed both a dominant and epistemic paradigm and a generalized ethical-aesthetic frame of experiences: i. e. conversing speech works at the same time as a building factor of interacting contexts in ~<br>

Abstract: La réflexion offerte dans cet essai s'inscrit dans une entreprise d'approfondissement de la compréhension générale que nous avons de l'activité politique (parler, écrire, revendiquer, mettre en scène), et particulièrement de la relation que cette activité entretient avec l'idée de l'émancipation. Plus précisément, il s'agit de prendre pour objet d'exploration théorique le fait de parole, défini en termes d'articulation performative des espaces-temps humains, et d'en faire le paradigme de toute action politique. L'analyse de ce paradigme, au terme, permettra de pointer vers une matière utopique qui se qualifie à la fois comme événement et comme permanence du commun. /// In this article, the author seeks a better understanding of the modalities of political action (speaking, writing, claming, staging), and more specifically of the relation between political action and the idea of emancipation. To do so, the author proposes that the speech act, comprehended as the performed articulation of lived space/time, is to be taken as the paradigm of political action. Further analysis of this paradigm, as developed in the article, compels the manifestation of a philosophical object which qualifies both as event and as the manifestation of the perennially of the common.<br>

Abstract: Agamben on the function of the pronoun in medieval grammatical thought:
"Inasmuch as it contains both a particular mode of signification and an indicative act, the
pronoun is that part of speech in which the passage from signifying to demonstrating is
enacted: pure being, the substantia indeterminata that it signifies and that, as such, is not in
itself signifiable or definable, becomes signifiable and determinable through an act of 'indi-
cation'" (31/22).<br>

Article Title: Language and the Making of Place: A Narrative-Descriptive Approach<br>
Publisher: Association of American Geographers<br>
Issue: i323950<br>
Date: 12 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Tuan Yi-Fu<br>
Abstract: How places are made is at the core of human geography. Overwhelmingly the discipline has emphasized the economic and material forces at work. Neglected is the explicit recognition of the crucial role of language, even though without speech humans cannot even begin to formulate ideas, discuss them, and translate them into action that culminates in a built place. Moreover, words alone, used in an appropriate situation, can have the power to render objects, formerly invisible because unattended, visible, and impart to them a certain character: thus a mere rise on a flat surface becomes something far more-a place that promises to open up to other places-when it is named "Mount Prospect." The different ways by which language contributes toward the making of place may be shown by exploring a wide range of situations and cultural contexts. Included in this paper are the contexts of hunter-gatherers, explorers and pioneers, intimate friendship, literary London, Europe in relation to Asia, and Chinese gardening and landscape art. There is a moral dimension to speech as there is to physical action. Thus warm conversation between friends can make the place itself seem warm; by contrast, malicious speech has the power to destroy a place's reputation and thereby its visibility. In the narrative-descriptive approach, the question of how and why language is effective is implied or informally woven into the presentation, but not explicitly formulated or developed. Ways of making place in different situations-from the naming of objects by pioneers, to informal conversation in any home, to the impact of written texts-are highlighted and constitute the paper's principal purpose, rather than causal explanations, which must vary with each type of linguistic behavior and each situation.<br>

Abstract: This paper demonstrates how, in a southern Irish setting, differences based on the historic struggles between Protestantism and Catholicism are perpetuated and communicated. It outlines the background and identifies modes of speech indicating unexamined assumptions grounded in the collective memory of the past. It analyses the ways in which the irruption into everyday communication of this emotional legacy reproduce difference, and examines Protestant perceptions that Catholics see them as incapable of possessing an authentic national identity. It shows how the process results in Protestant exclusion from the imagined nation and the category of 'Irishness'.<br>

Abstract: This paper analyses the semantic and poetic variations present in two of the texts which Julio Torri devotes to Brazilian themes: "Saudade" and "Machado de Assis". By creating metaphors and introducing words in Portuguese, this member of the Mexican Ateneo extends the meanings of the phrases he uses. He is able to do so since both these devices serve as figures of speech, transforming the meaning of the phrases and opening them up to new interpretations.<br>

Abstract: The Russo-Japanese War broke out in February 1904, starting with the rupture of diplo-
matic relations on February 6. Murakami's speech at the conference was published in the April
1904 issue of Rikugô zasshi, but it probably had been given before the outbreak of the war,
since Murakami only speaks of "the Russo-Japanese problem." The same issue of Rikugô
zasshi no. 280 also contains the article Yoga sensdkan no ippan 予が戦争観の一班（‘‘My View
on War," according to the original English table of contents) by the Christian minister Ebina
Danjô 海老名弾正（1856-1937). In this article, he argues for the "inevitability" of the Russo-
Japanese War，saying “it is my conviction that our whole country has no choice but to fight at
the risk of dying, and must assure victory" (Rikugô zasshi no. 280，April 1904, p. 17).<br>

Author(s): ATZENI PAOLA<br>
Abstract: Using an "anthropo-pragmatic" approach, this essay analyzes the speech made by Mussolini in the square in Carbonia, Sardinia, on 18 December 1938. The analysis also takes in other speeches and reveals the power of Mussolini's logos: this was not simply inaugural, ritual and foundational in its celebration of the new town, but recognised a historic turning point in the policies of the Italian nation and empire in the passage of the fascist state from ruralism to industrial urbanism. By broadening the study, the power of Mussolini's declarative strategy becomes more apparent. Also that other subjects were submerged with subversive micro-narrations of different types. Finally, multiple discourses, practices and complex negotiating subjects appeared in the post-fascist democracy. The "anthropo-pragmatic" approach, which is at first restricted, is later broadened and utilized on a speech-by-speech basis: from the comical and satirical to the poetic and the contractual. Highlighting the discursive conflicts at work, examples are emphasized of dialectical speeches that constitute and characterize other antagonists and protagonists of democratic cultural modernity: the nurse-comedy-writer, miner-poet, and miner-trade unionist. In the new fascism these figures test new risky declarations that were also practices of freedom, caring for oneself and many others, to the extent of spreading into democratic relations. These speeches and themes operate in a setting where discursive and identity-related powers meet, hidden and manifest, public and private, in the mine and the city.<br>

Abstract: Régulièrement proclamés partout dans le monde, la liberté d'expression et le pluralisme de la presse sont considérés comme des instruments de mesure démocratique. Seulement en France, où le journaliste porte dans son hérédité la tradition littéraire du débat d'idées, la diversité des opinions tend à se réduire. La déontologie professionnelle est associée à des dispositifs visant à établir l'objectivité – procédés linguistiques, recours systématique à des études sociologiques – dont les effets sont souvent de restreindre le jugement ou du moins de le conformer à des faits « scientifiquement » établis. L'observation, l'intuition, l'enquête sont ainsi supplantées par des protocoles qui agissent comme des écrans dans la démocratie d'opinion. Alors même que l'on continue d'accuser les médias de manipulation, la production endogène d'une pensée commune est une des raisons de sa perte d'influence. Generally claimed around the world, freedom of speech and press pluralism are considered as instruments of democratic measure. However in France where the journalist has in his heredity the literary tradition of ideologic debates, the diversity of opinions is lowering. Professional deontology is linked with rhetoric devices – linguistic process, resort to sociological inquiries – whose effects are often to refrein assesments or to produce them, according to « scientifically » set up items. Investigation, intuition, clearsightedness are overlapped by procedures which appear as screens in relationship to the public opinion. Even if the media are accused of manipulation, the endogeneous production of a commun thought is one of the reasons of their lack of influence.<br>

Abstract: Sociocultural anthropology and evolutionary biology have reached the point at which it is possible to give a coherent and synthetic account of the origins of human cultural variability. From a sociocultural perspective what must be explained is not just the fact of varying cultures and societies, but also the human capacity to create, maintain and alter social forms over time. From a biological perspective we have to ask, what is the selective advantage of such variability? The answer lies in human sociality. Sociality consists in a package of social intellectual capacities-higher order intentionality, pedagogy, narrativity, crativity, speech-which made possible an increasing division of labour. But as these capacities grew, they gave rise to distinctively human (rather than Darwinian) history, that is to the forms of social, political, economic and cultural causation which create ever new variations on the theme of social existence.<br>

Publisher: Centre national de la recherche scientifique<br>

Author(s): Vincent Gilbert<br>
Abstract: Reflections by scientists, philosophers and sociologists upon the role of science as the motor of modern history show that apocalyptics can be interpreted neither as irrationalism nor as rhetorical, emphatic speech. Speaking out of the imagination, apocalyptics takes the form of a discourse that is hypercritical of and the least inexact about science, whenever scientific successes have rendered the habitual distinction between reality and model untenable. The imaginary realm of apocalyptics follows upon utopia and science fiction. However it has to be separated from "catastrophism". The latter still takes science to be a messiah because its idea of scientific develop. ment conceals favorable future effects underneath presentday catastrophic consequences. By refusing to separate intentions and effects and by objectifying science as a "totalizing" power, apocalyptics, on the other hand, leads to an irreversible situation that identifies history and destiny. Not only the semantic contents of the apocalyptic discourse are examined but also its "pragmatic" value is weighed. Its paradoxical declarations assume the form of a discourse whose proclamation has a meaning-an instituting scope-that literally contradicts its content, the proclaimed "non-sense" of science.<br>

Abstract: L'étude de l'engagement de "Frères du Monde" contre la guerre du Vietnam (1965-1973) permet de mettre en évidence les tensions existant entre la sphère du religieux et celle du politique, au sein d'un groupe de catholiques engagés, au cours de la décennie marquée par mai 68. Au début de la guerre du Vietnam, en février 1965, cette revue catholique, dirigée par des Franciscains bordelais, prend une position originale dans les milieux chrétiens: elle condamne très rapidement et très fermement l'intervention américaine. Ses rédacteurs "témoignent" en faveur du peuple vietnamien et dénoncent, en termes marxistes-léninistes, l'impérialisme américain. A travers les analyses, les prises de positions et les actions de "Frères du Monde" à propos du Vietnam, c'est le glissement vers le gauchisme d'une fraction minoritaire de la gauche chrétienne que l'on peut observer. Après 1968, le discours de la revue sur la guerre du Vietnam perd toute référence religieuse pour devenir, apparemment, exclusivement politique. Il reflète cependant une évolution théologique qui conduit des Franciscains, destinés à l'origine à la Mission, vers une théologie de la Libération, en gestation, à la même époque, en Amérique latine. L'engagement de "Frères du Monde" contre la guerre du Vietnam prend fin prématurément en septembre 1971. Alors que les combats redoublent de violence, la rédaction de la revue ne s'exprime plus sur cette guerre. En proie à des divisions internes, la revue disparaît au cours de l'année 1973. /// The study of "Frères du Monde's" commitment against the Vietnam War brings to the fore the tensions existing between the religious field and the political one, within a group of politically involved Catholics during the decade around May 1968. At the beginning of the Vietnam War, in February 1965, this Catholic review, published by a Franciscan friary from Bordeaux, takes an original stand among Christian circles: it quickly and firmly comdemns the American military intervention.

Issue: i40014421<br>

Author(s): Do Carmo Silva Carlos Henrique<br>
Abstract: O presente estudo constitui um ensaio crítico de reflexão sobre a questão dos limites da linguagem em Wittgenstein. A perspectiva deste estudo observa, numa primeira parte, o próprio procedimento do método wittgen-steiniano e segue um modelo de discurso plural, a partir de várias perspectivas que, não só permitem desconstruir a aparente unidade da razão, como indagar interiormente do próprio limite da análise wittgensteiniana. Retomando a caracterização da linguagem e do pensamento nos seus traços fundamentais, desde o "Tractatus" até às "Investigações Filosóficas", chama-se a atenção para os pontos de dificuldade, da indefinição e da cons-trutividade do modelo de Wittgenstein. A plena lição do "autómaton" da linguagem face a uma possível diferenciação dos signos e aprofundamento lógico, constitui uma parte desta reflexão que se complementa pela referência aos horizontes de resíduo do não-linguístico, ou até do indizível, numa dupla maneira de estabelecer os limites da linguagem. Enfim, e a título conclusivo, apontam-se, não apenas os contornos do que se entende como uma moral retórica da linguagem em Wittgenstein, mas para perspectivas originais de um reaprofundamento em termos etioló-gicos de diferenciação de escala da lógica e da linguagem, e de recuperação de uma intencionalidade psico-lógico-linguística superando aquela indiferen-ciação do dizer no automático da fala estatuída na "ordinary language". /// La présente étude constitue un essai critique qui réfléchie sur la question des limites du langage dans la philosophie de Wittgenstein. Dans une première partie la perspective de cette réflexion analise les procédés que Wittgenstein lui-même utilise dans sa méthode, et pour cela se sert d'un modèle de discours pluriel, lequel permet non seulement la déconstruction de l'apparente unité de la raison, mais aussi faire une enquête au dedans des limites de l'analyse wittgensteinienne.

Publisher: Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40019046<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Urban Martina<br>
Abstract: In his early interpretation and representation of the oral teachings of the Hasidic masters, Martin Buber engaged in issues pertinent to the critique of language (Sprachkritik,) of the fin-de-siècle. Associated pre-eminently with Fritz Mauthner and his circle, the critique of language (Sprachkritik) questioned the epistemological status of language, wedded as it is to the divisive Erfahrungswelt. By drawing attention to ecstatic speech, which paradoxically gives expression to the experience (Erlebnis) of the ineffable unity of existence, Buber adumbrates a solution to the cognitive limitations of language. Refracted through Lebensphilosophie, he distinguishes between language as bound to Erfahrung and speech as nurtured by Erlebnis. Whereas language is propelled by conceptual and propositional forms of cognition, speech, principally sustained by metaphors evoked by an experience of the noumenal. Through an examination of his interpretive translation of a well-known Hasidic parable, this article explores how he amplifies this distinction by means of a semantic transformation of the key mystical metaphor of 'ahizat ' enayim (lit. seizing the eyes). Discerning the hermeneutical layers of Buber's rendition of the parable, we argue that his own ambiguous propositional casting of the metaphor entraps him into the very problem he sought to overcome. /// O presente artigo tem como ponto de partida o facto de que na interpretação e representação que dos mestres do Hasidismo fez logo na primeira fase da sua actividade como intelectual, Martin Buber assumiu como próprias questões especialmente pertinentes para uma crítica da linguagem (Sprachkritik) típica da época fin-de-siècle. Associada de modo particular a Fritz Mauthner e ao seu círculo, a Sprachkritik interrogava-se sobretudo acerca do estatuto epistemológico da linguagem, conectada como ela estava com uma Erfahrungswelt que era, desde logo, fonte de divisão. Nesse sentido, a autora do artigo defende que ao chamar a aten~<br>

Abstract: Jürgen Habermas postulates an ideal archaic society as the starting point for his theory of social development, which involves subsequent loss of communicative rationality in a society as it grows into an industrial nation. The western Caroline Islands, an historical archaic society, exhibited a concern with a spirit-world and with the manipulation of the nonmaterial, inherited life-world; both of these features are ignored by Habermas. Western Carolinians had also usurped the ideal speech situation and turned it into a means toward strategic action that resulted in instrumental rationality.<br>

Abstract: À partir d'un petit corpus de controverses advenues récemment en France à propos de fictions littéraires ou cinématographiques, mettant l'accent sur les fortes restrictions encadrant actuellement la censure, cet article — inscrit dans la perspective d'une sociologie des valeurs dont sont tout d'abord explicitées les règles énonciatives — se propose : premièrement, de comprendre les principes qui poussent les acteurs à limiter l'espace imparti à la fiction ; deuxièmement, d'examiner la façon dont la narratologie a traité cette question des limites, les principes qui s'en dégagent et les instruments qui méritent d'être retenus ; troisièmement, de réfléchir aux raisons pour lesquelles il peut être nécessaire de limiter soit axiologiquement, soit ontologiquement, la fiction; et quatrièmement, d'expliquer pourquoi les chercheurs ont intérêt à en élargir les limites, de manière à éviter plusieurs types de réductions - logiciste, esthète, herméneutique, scientiste. L'article se termine par une tentative de solution aux controverses précitées, en forme d'avis d'expert outillé par cette analyse des limites de la fiction. Using a small corpus of recent controversies in France about fiction in literature or the cinema that have emphasized the tight restrictions now on censorship, this approach in terms of a sociology of values starts by examining the rules governing speech acts about this topic. First of all, how to understand the principles that lead to limiting the room allowed for fiction ? Secondly, how has narratology dealt with this question of limits ? What principles can be identified, and what instruments are worth using? Thirdly, what reasons might make it necessary to limit fiction either axiologically or ontologically ? Finally, the attempt is made to explain why researchers have an interest in broadening these limits so as to avoid several types (logical, aesthetic, hermeneutic, scientific) of « reduction ».

Abstract: Ever since Plato the identity of philosophy has been at issue in the quarrel between philosophy and poetry. Can changing times alter the identity of philosophy, and simultaneously the identity of poetry? In the Republic poetry is a third rate illusion compared with contemplation of "the things that truly are". We can trace the background of this disqualification when we distinguish three levels in the relation of language to reality. 1. We can distinguish assertion, melody and rhythm. The first is the same in poetry and prose, the last is superfluous. 2. Speech is superior to writing in virtue of the speaker's inner mastery over himself. 3. The interiorizing move culminates in the soundless conversation of the soul with itself, contemplating the eternal identical "without the stain of speech or sign" (Boutens). For Plato, then, we move from poetry to prose, from prose to speech, from speech to silence. Is there room for aesthetics in this view? In the second part of my lecture I reconstruct Symbolism, a current in literature that in every respect is the opposite of Platonism. Although the goal is the same — the search for true reality — the difference is that the route is now reversed. I restrict myself to the French branch. 4. Baudelaire formulated the basic principle of Symbolism: the ineffable does not exist. "The ultimate goal of the universe is to be expressed" (Valéry). The same worldview is expressed later by Gadamer: an ontology "guided by language". 5. The second principle is that the primary language is script, "Book" (Mallarmé). 6. Poetry proves to be the true language. The music (rhyme, rhytm, tune) reveals the things "exactly as they are" (Wallace Stevens). In poetry the linguistic sign becomes a symbol because the sound, the physical aspect of the linguistic sign, plays a role in the production of meaning. A poem is a "sustained hesitation between sense and sound" (Valéry). Is sound not however a disturbing factor in revealing the things 'as they are'?~<br>

Abstract: El autor reflexiona sobre la evolución de la historia del discurso en Francia y su aproximación a la historia semántica, inspirada en la obra de Koselleck, y a la historia del discurso de tradición anglosajona. Tras repasar los antecedentes de la actual historia del discurso francesa desde los años setenta y evaluar la influencia de la obra de Foucault en esta disciplina, el autor aborda, a la luz de los últimos trabajos de Quentin Skinner, la cuestión de la intencionalidad individual y colectiva de los textos históricos, es decir, los mecanismos que constituyen y explican, en palabras de Koselleck, «la conexión empírica entre la realidad y el discurso». The author thinks about the evolution of the history of discourse in France and its approach to semantic history as inspired by the work of Koselleck, and also to the history of discourse in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. After revising the precedents of the current French history of speech from the 70s and evaluating the influence of the work of Foucault in this discipline, the author approaches, in the light of Quentin Skinner's last works, the question of the individual and collective premeditation of historical texts, that is to say, the mechanisms that constitute and explain, in words of Koselleck, «the empirical connection between reality and discourse».<br>

Abstract: The construction of a meta-discourse in order to describe interior monologues (IM) cuts across narratologic and linguistic approaches. It varies according to whether the purpose is to establish a typology based on their wider representation or to provide a linguistic analysis restricted to reported speech. The paper highlights the persistent under-rating of a phenomenon close to the IM, and related to the "unspeakable sentence", that of "the point of view". The represented "point of view" and the free indirect speech have coexisted since the second half of the 19th. However, unlike as in the IM, these forms are not clearly differentiated as dual forms of the expression of the inner speech. Consequently, inner speech (at least as a theory issued from literary experience) is reduced to the relatively homogeneous form of the "interior speech" or "flow of consciousness". But this representation is under the influence of enormous tensions as literary manifestations of inner speech are more varied than the phrase IM gives to understand.<br>

Article Title: The Things We Do with Words: Ilongot Speech Acts and Speech Act Theory in Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i393665<br>
Date: 8 1, 1973<br>
Author(s): Voloshinov Michelle Z.<br>
Abstract: I begin by introducing the Ilongots and some of their attitudes toward speech. Whereas most modern theorists think of language as a tool designed primarily to "express" or to "refer," Ilongots think of language first in terms of action. They see commands as the exemplary act of speech, displaying less concern for the subjective meanings that an utterance conveys than for the social contexts in which utterances are heard. An ethnographic sketch thus outlines how Ilongots think of words and how their thought relates to aspects of their practice -- providing an external foil for theorists found closer to home. Speech Act Theory is discussed and questioned first on internal grounds, as an approach that recognizes but slights important situational and cultural constraints on forms of language use. A consideration of the application of Searle's taxonomy of acts of speech to Ilongot categories of language use then leads to a clarification of the individualistic and relatively asocial biases of his essentially intra-cultural account. Last, I return to Ilongot directives. A partial analysis of Ilongot acts of speech provides the basis for a statement of the ways in which indigenous categories are related to the forms that actions take, as both of these, in turn, reflect the sociocultural ordering of local worlds.<br>

Abstract: La tentative autobiographique de Jacques Derrida, portée par plusieurs de ses livres, paraît contredire toute une part de son élaboration philosophique qui, quant à elle, s'efforce de démontrer l'impossibilité de tenir un discours sur la vie et sur l'identité. D'où la nécessité, pour Derrida, de déplacer les coordonnées traditionnelles de la forme autobiographique. Nous proposons dans cet article de désigner comme hétérofiction la modification derridienne de la pratique du récit de soi. L'hétérofiction suppose une multiplicité de versions (il y a plusieurs récits de vie), une multiplicité de dictions (dans ces récits, le dire précède toujours le dit), une multiplicité d'énonciations (plusieurs voix sont requises pour porter ces récits), et enfin une multiplicité de confessions (chaque récit réserve la ressource d'un secret supplémentaire). Jacques Derrida's ventures into autobiography, as seen in a number of his books, seem to contradict a large body of his philosophical work, which, for its part, tries to demonstrate the impossibility of holding a discourse on life and identity. Thus the necessity for Derrida of displacing the usual parameters of the autobiographical genre. We will here use the term hétérofiction to designate Derrida's modification of the practice of self-narrative. Hétérofiction supposes a multiplicity of versions (there are a number of lifenarratives), a multiplicity of dictions (in the narratives, speech supplants content), a multiplicity of modes of enunciation (several voices are necessary to carry the narratives), and finally a multiplicity of confessions (each narrative keeps a supplementary secret back from the telling, as a resource).<br>

Abstract: President Obama's commencement address on the University of Notre Dame campus evoked substantial controversy, providing public demonstration of rhetorical differences and demands generated by differing provincial and cosmopolitan positions. Icontend that public civic rhetoric, in an era of narrative and virtue contention, must address the creative interplay of both provincial and cosmopolitan perspectives. In this essay I examine reactions to the Obama address from news sources connected with the local Catholic diocese, as well as the South Bend and University of Notre Dame newspapers. I argue that Obamas address is an example of a public civic speech that openly engaged the interplay of provincial and cosmopolitan understandings of a controversial communal common center. Obamas Notre Dame speech framed discourse that walks within a world of tension and difference on the public stage, highlighting the communal rhetorical constitution of a speech moment shaped through the interplay of provincial and cosmopolitan commitments.<br>

Date: 7 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Vedlesen Arne Johan<br>
Abstract: In this article, the case of Bosnia is used to raise important theoretical and practical questions concerning the role of third parties in preventing and punishing genocide. After the massacre at Srebrenica, a UN-declared 'safe area', the debate over complicity in genocide on the part of UN personnel has gained particular urgency, and much of the discussion here is related to that debate. The article also draws attention to the role of intellectuals in preparing for genocide by way of ideological hate speech, a role of crucial importance in top-down orchestrated genocidal campaigns such as those seen in Rwanda and Bosnia. On the basis of the empirical material presented, it is argued that considerable responsibility resides with knowledgeable third-party bystanders to unfolding acts of genocide. The article also tries to distinguish between different kinds of bystanders, and it attempts to define and discuss what it means - and what it should imply - to be a contemporary bystander to genocidal warfare.<br>

Author(s): Bílek Petr A.<br>
Abstract: The essay focuses on the term textuality and foliows and comments the changes of its use and meaning. It examines the link between Russian Formalist concept of literariness (mostly Jakobson and Tynianov), its Bakhtinian switch to intertextuality, developed in quite contrastive but distinet ways by Julia Kristeva and Gerard Genette, and finally it interprets the use of the term textuality in Derridian deconstruction and Foucault’s semiotics of the world. The point of the essay is to show the importance of the deconstructive challenge of the traditionally supposed opposition between speech and writing as well as between the world and the seif. Following Hugh Silverman’s concept of the autobiographical textuality, the essay makes attemps to suggest an interpretation of ali Kundera’s writings (both „fiction“ and „essays“) as one undistinguishable textuality without óbvious boundaries of a genre or identity of the person who speaks.<br>

Author(s): Corradi Consuelo<br>
Abstract: A lively concern for new instruments of knowledge has led sociology, among other disciplines, to collect life stories in order to explore social phenomena. Dialogue and interpersonal communication thus become crucial tools, as well as loci of knowledge. This paper investigates the epistemological suppositions of 'the biographical approach': the quest for identity in the narrative, the dialogical relationship between the narrating self and the researcher, the fixation of speech into text and more. The overall effort of the investigation is to reach criteria of analysis which are not simply borrowed from other areas, but are the outcome of reflection upon the constituent features of life stories. This investigation, however, does not widen the gap between 'qualitative' and 'quantitative' sociology, but rather it contributes to put this division into question.<br>

Abstract: Comment le discours philosophique est-il possible ? Cette question met en difficulté, pour des raisons symétriques et inverses, la phénoménologie de conscience et la conception herméneutique du langage. Elle révèle la nécessité où se trouve le philosophe méditant d'assigner conjointement la possibilité de la signification et celle de sa propre réflexion sur celle-ci. Cette conjonction évoque formellement la doctrine flchtéenne de la Liberté. Mais elle ne peut être matériellement déterminée que dans les termes d'une Impression intérieurement et impérativement ouverte sur son autre. What makes the philosophical discourse possible ? This query calls into question, for symmetrical and inverse reasons, both the phenomenology of consciousness and the hermeneutic conception of speech. It reveals the necessity, for the meditating philosopher, to assign conjunctively the possibility of signification and that of his own reflection on it. This conjoncture formally calls to mind the Fichtean doctrine of Liberty. But it can be materially determined only in terms of an Impression inwardly and imperatively geared to its contrary.<br>

Abstract: La phénoménologie de Husserl est tenue pour descriptive dans la mesure où elle montre comment les choses apparaissent. Cela commence avec la visée de toute chose comme quelque chose. Voir et « voir comme », montrer et dire, sont profondément entrelacés. Toutefois, la description indirecte va plus loin. Elle se réfère à quelque chose en renvoyant à quelque chose d'autre – nous le savons depuis le concept de communication indirecte de Kierkegaard et l'analyse bakhtinienne de la parole indirecte et de la citation. Une approche indirecte est requise aussitôt que notre expérience dépasse le royaume du sens et de l'intentionnalité, car nous sommes alors confrontés à quelque chose qui nous affecte et à quoi nous répondons. Les principales figures de l'indirectivité vont au-delà du sens sous la forme de l'excès, de la déviance, ou du retrait. La voie de la description indirecte sera illustrée en référence à quelques phénomènes cruciaux: la dimension passive de l'attention, le caractère responsif de la liberté, le fait de porter témoignage de la violence, et la scission entre le dire et le dit. Husserl's phenomenology turns out to be descriptive as far as it shows how things appear. It starts with taking everything as something. Seeing and seeing as, showing and saying are deeply interconnected. But indirect description goes further. It refers to something by referring to something else, as we know it from Kierkegaard's concept of indirect communication or from Bakhtin's analysis of indirect speech and of quotation. An indirect approach is required as soon as our experience surpasses the realm of meaning and intentionality, being confronted with something we are affected by and with something we respond to. Main figures of indirectness are going beyond by excess, deviating from, or withdrawing from. The way of indirect description will be illustrated by referring to some crucial phenomena: the passive part of attention, the responsive character of liberty, bearing witness of~<br>

Abstract: Le discours philosophique, même lorsqu'il se propose comme chez Hegel de « sauver » intégralement les phénomènes, ne parvient pas vraiment à saisir (et en même temps dédaigne) le ceci en son individualité la plus contingente. La parole poétique est plus apte à le recueillir, comme on tente de le montrer à partir de l'exemple de l'incipit d'un roman de Claude Simon. Elle fait ainsi affleurer la vérité d'une obscure dimension de l'être que Heidegger désigne sous le nom de Terre. Seule une ontologie de la différence est susceptible de fournir une structure d'accueil adéquate à cette valorisation poétique de l'infra-conceptuel. Au niveau de l'herméneutique littéraire, il en résulte l'exigence d'une démarche particulièrement attentive aux détails les plus factuels à travers lesquels se configure cette dimension voilée de l'être. Even when it proposes, as in the works of Hegel, to « save » the phenomena in full, the philosophical discourse does not really succeed in seizing (and at once disdains) the this in its most contingent individuality. The poetic speech is more capable of catching it, as this article will attempt to show it from an incipit of a novel by Claude Simon. The poetic speech makes thus the truth of an unknown dimension of the being which Heidegger calls Earth emerge. Alone an ontology of the difference is liable to provide this poetic valorisation of the infra-conceptual with an adequate « home ». Asfar as literary hermeneutics are concerned, it results in the necessity of a method which must be particularly heedful of the most factual details through which this veiled dimension of the being forms itself.<br>

Abstract: Are the readings of Luke being proposed in this volume evidence of readers finding in the text what they want? Different readings of the same text can be related to different manifestations of "the reader". Yet a responsible reading of the text implies taking the text as a speech-act functioning in a communicative context. The role of the author and the context therefore becomes important again. The concept of foolproof composition is relevant too ās it implies the exclusion of the possibility of a counterreading of the text. Tlie phenomenon of the inspiration of a sacred text also functions as a constraint.<br>

Abstract: The use of metaphor, transposed from small to large units of speech is analogical to the structuralist transfer of the laws of language organisation from units of levels below the sentence to units of an order above or equal to the sentence. The metaphor can be defined as a word in counterdetermining context. The unconventional contextual use of the metaphoric term creates a tension which can be explained in terms of the interaction view of metaphor. The metaphor functions as a contextual filter which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the principal subject by implying statements about it that normally apply to the subsidiary subject. The contextualisation of a text can be defined as a text in counter-determining context. The tension between text and contemporary context or discourse is reminiscent of the tension between vehicle and frame in the metaphor. The contextualisation functions as contextual filter of the text which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the context or discourse by implying statements about it that normally apply to the text in its conventional or original context or discourse. As an activity, the metaphor, as well as the contextualisation has socio-political significance since it is determined by the discourse of the reader or contextualiser.<br>

Abstract: Dans la Vie d'Apollonios de Tyane, Philostrate construit, au moment de la rencontre entre son protagoniste et Iarchas, le chef des brahmanes, un dialogue dans lequel autorité et charisme sont essentiels. Cette mise en scène l'autorise ensuite à produire un discours concernant la domination romaine et ses représentants, à destination des Grecs comme des Romains. La question du destinataire permet de mettre en lumière certains des enjeux les plus fondamentaux de l'œuvre du sophiste. Elle montre de quelle manière Philostrate interroge les Hellènes sur leurs choix de vie et leur identité dans le monde gréco-romain du début du IIIe siècle. In the Life of Appolonios of Tyana, Philostratos builds up, when his protagonist meets larchas, the chief of the Brahmins, a dialogue in which authority and charisma are essential. That staging allows him to produce a speech concerning Roman sway an dits representatives, addressing Greeks and Romans alike. The question of addressee enables him to highlight some of the more fundamental point at stake in the sophist's work. It shows in what way Philostratos questions the Greeks about their life choices and their identity in the Greco-Roman worlf at the beginning of the IIIrd century.<br>

Abstract: Neste ensaio, entrelaço fios de vidas das mulheres negras que estáo atadas óï fio da minha vida. Com os fios soltos das canções de Zezé Motta e dos escritos da filósofa Hannah Arendt, teço este texto-existência. Na leitura dos ensaios e poemas de Marlene Nourbese Philip, escritora afro-caribenha, me inspiro não só para resistir às amarras culturais hegemônicas, mas também para transcendê-las, criando possibilidades de escrita que vincule a dinâmica da fala com a dinámica da ocóo, compondo um texto que se movimenta ora como dança, através do espaço, ora como urna canção, ritmada pelo tempo, pois criar e dançar uma coreografia é uma forma de fazer historia. Como investiga Selma Treviños, trata-se de urna ferramenta para animar o passado ou uma "escrita" acerca de algo que já foi feito, se concordamos que cada corpo carrega sua pròpria história e individualidade, memòria, sentimentos e emoções. Na busca do entendimento desta minha breve existência, danço, escrevo, teço palavras com fios desfiados da flor do útero das minhas ancestrais. Vasculho minhas lembranças e, na memória corporal, decifro a dor, encontró a raiz da violência, observo o medo, destilo a alegría, enfeito a doçura, mergulho na paz e conheço a liberdade. In that essay I interweave threads of the black women's lives that are tied to the thread of my life. With the free threads of Zezé Motta's songs and of philosopher Hannah Arendfs writings, I weave this text-existence. In the reading of the essay and poems of Marlene NourbeSe Philip, writer Afro-Caribbean, I am inspired not only to resist the hegemonic cultural ties, but also transcend them, creating possibilities of writing that links the dynamics of the speech with the dynamics of the action, to compose a text that is moved some times as a dance through the space, other times as a song, with its rhythm determinedby time, because creating and dancing a choreography is a form of making history. As investigates Selma Treviños it is a tool to encourage th~<br>

Abstract: Este artigo procura abordar os papéis de sacerdote, chefe e xamã - todos presentes no ngillatun, ritual de fertilidade mapuche - da perspectiva de seus modos diferenciais de travar relações por meio da linguagem. A linguagem, conforme entendida pelos Mapuche do meio rural chileno, não emerge exclusivamente das intenções de falantes individuais, mas igualmente da força (newen) constitutiva da totalidade do ser. Sacerdotes, chefes e xamãs recorrem à fala para alinhar-se a essa força, que por meio deles se atualiza. Uma tal observação lança nova luz sobre o entendimento de Clastres quanto à relação entre chefia e linguagem. Se, acompanhando os Mapuche, enfatizamos as qualidades indexicais da linguagem, em detrimento das simbólicas, vemos que se torna um tanto problemático analisar a linguagem dos chefes em conformidade com um modelo de “troca”, como faz Clastres. This paper seeks to approach the roles of priest, chief, and shaman — all present in the Mapuche ngilUtun fertility ritual -from the perspective of their differential modes of relating through language. Language, as understood by rural Mapuche, emerges not solely from the intentions of individual speakers, but equally from the force -newen -constitutive of all being. Priests, chiefs, and shamans all seek to align themselves through speech to this force which instantiates itself through them. Such an observation casts new light on Clastres' understanding of the relationship between chiefs and language. If we follow Mapuche in emphasizing the indexical rather than symbolic qualities of language, we see that Clastres'analysis of chiefly language as susceptible to a model of "exchange" becomes somewhat problematic.<br>

Abstract: Avec quelques ouvertures nouvelles en direction des sciences humaines, et dans la ligne d'ouvrages publiés par l'auteur, surtout L'Un et l'Autre Testament, vol. 1 (1977), vol. 2 (1990) et Le Récit, la Lettre et le Corps (1982), l'accomplissement des Écritures, comme plénitude de l'acte du Christ, est proposé comme fondation d'une théologie, qui ne peut pas ne pas être biblique. Le chemin consiste à chercher la vérité anthropologique de l'accomplissement dans les dimensions humaines de la Parole et du Corps, vécues dans l'échange narratif. Le lieu de cet échange est la figure des noces à ses niveaux divers de réalisation, individuelle, sociale, historique. With some new pointers taken from anthropology and prolonging the inspiration of works previously published by the author (in particular: L'Un el l'Autre Testament, vol. 1, 1977; vol. 2, 1990 and Le Récit, la Lettre et le Corps, 1982), we here find the proposition that the fulfilment of Scriptures, inasmuch as it is the culminating point of the work of Christ, could be the basis for a genuinely and unescapably biblical theology. The method consists in searching for the human anthenticity of fulfilment in the anthropological dimension of Speech and Body understood as life through tales exchanged. The crucial point of that exchange is marriage symbolism on its different levels of experience: personal, social and historical.<br>

Abstract: Cet article trouve son point de départ dans l'analyse du caractère sévère de Jésus dans l'évangile. Des synoptiques, c'est Matthieu qui met le plus l'accent sur la tension entre les pharisiens et Jésus. Le point culminant est le discours dans le temple dont le noyau est constitué des sept « Ouai » (Mt 23,13-36). Pour expliquer cette sévérité, nous utilisons comme approche méthodique la « pragmatique » de la science de la communication et de la linguistique. L'objectif de la recherche est d'offrir une nouvelle perception de la réalité et d'interpeller sur l'agir moral. This article begins from the analysis of the harsh nature of Jesus in the Gospel. Among the Synoptics, it is Matthew who insists the most on the strain between the Pharisees and Jesus. Its culmination is Jesus' speech in the Temple, at whose centre are the seven "Woes" (Matt. 23 :13-36). To explain this harshness, we will make use of the methodical approach called "pragmatic", in communication science and linguistics. Our aim is to offer a new perception of reality and to challenge to moral action.<br>

Abstract: À partir de l'exemple de deux autobiographies, celles de Jacques-Louis Ménétra et d'Agricol Perdiguier, tous deux compagnons du Tour de France, il s'agit d'établir des constantes de l'écriture de soi. La perspective adoptée, le discours sur la sexualité, sert de point d'ancrage. Après avoir déterminé les sphères d'énonciation de la sexualité des deux compagnons, le ludique chez Ménétra, l'altérité chez Perdiguier, on en vient à établir, au-delà des spécificités de chacun, une permanence des formes et, partant, des règles de transformation internes au récit autobiographique. From the example of two autobiographies, those of Jacques-Louis Ménétra and Agricol Perdiguier, both compagnons du Tour de France, it acts of establishing constants of the writing of oneself. The prospect adopted, the speech on sexuality, is used as theme of approach. After having determined the fields of stating of the sexuality of the two compagnons, the ludic one for Ménétra, the alterity for Perdiguier, we can establish, beyond specificities of each one, a permanence of the forms and, therefore, internal rules of transformation to the autobiographical account.<br>

Abstract: In their interpretations of magical acts and utterances, anthropologists frequently argue that magic and technology are informed by two different kinds of logic, the former "expressive" in character, the latter "instrumental." A close analysis of magical hunting songs used by the Aguaruna of Amazonian Peru reveals that the songs are part of a general ordering process that encompasses the strategic use of thoughts, speech, objects, and acts to achieve practical ends. In Aguaruna thought the expressive imagery of magical songs is an instrumental tool that shapes events in the performer's world.

Author(s): Whitten Janet Wall<br>
Abstract: Language is constitutive of social reality through the constant articulation and reinforcement of significant linguistic concepts, which give meaning to social relations. Among the Shuar of southeastern Ecuador, discourses on power and knowledge validate the traditional ideological structure and create a new ideological structure through the mobilization of meaning in political speech that legitimates relations of domination. Ideological transformation is assisted by a cultural predisposition to seek non-Shuar sources of technical and symbolic knowledge in the acquisition of power.

Author(s): Wangyal Marcia S.<br>
Abstract: Recent studies of performance genres suggest that many rituals generate propositional force by manipulating ritual frames and so drawing the audience to reflect upon various levels of performance reality. This article focuses on the fusion of such levels during the performance of a Tibetan opera before an audience of refugee Tibetans living in India, a spectacle wherein the mimetic performance of a mock exorcism became an actual exorcism. The article analyzes this transformation from the combined perspective of theatrical semiosis and speech act theory. [Tibet, performance theory, opera, ritual, theater]<br>

Author(s): Woolard Webb<br>
Abstract: Sumbanese descriptions of the "traditional house" as a microcosm and emblem of local identity are neither unproblematic expressions of a cultural totality nor simply objectifications imposed by ethnography or modernity. One way the house is able to serve as a discursive object reflects, in part, specifically Sumbanese models of action and beliefs about language as refracted in changing historical circumstances. In ritual, speakers seek to engage and elicit responses from powerful others, whereas current religious and political developments reframe ritual words as means of describing a cultural world. Both sets of practices draw on the authority of "entextualized" language but interpret it in different ways. Emerging representations of cultural meaning are shaped by long-standing speech genres and by recent social and cultural transformations, mediated by shifting language ideologies.

Abstract: This article analyzes “Rotología del poroto” by Pablo de Rokha. Our contention states that the bean works as a multiple and complex metaphor, allowing the poetic voice to refer to the nation, the working-class subjects and the political project of the revolution. Each of these categories takes place in a production context marked by the presence of the hacienda and the Cold War scenario. Additionally, the article analyzes how the poem, at the time of enunciation by the speaker, builds a counterpoint between the Chile of yesterday and today to articulate a social protest speech in favor of the working-class subjects of the national community.<br>

Abstract: This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of the “(as yet) untold story” to consider the relationship between James Joyce's 1904 short story “Eveline” (in
         Dubliners) and Colm Tóibín's award-winning 2009 novel,Brooklyn. Although Tóibín has denied the influence of Joyce in general, there are many similarities in the storyworlds of the two protagonists, Eveline Hill and Eilis Lacey: Eveline wishes to leave her father's home in Dublin but stays, whilst Eilis would prefer to remain at home but is forced to emigrate. Both act according to their perception of their mother's wishes and the rightness of their decisions has preoccupied readers. Through close analysis of thought and speech presentation, this essay shows that interpretive responses to the actions of Eveline and Eilis are inextricably linked to the formal qualities of each text.<br>

Author(s): Siff David B.<br>
Abstract: R. Naḥman of Bratslav's magnum opus,
         Liqutey Moharan, expresses contradictory attitudes toward the value and ontological primacy of books as opposed to living speech. When his discourses are sorted by the date delivered, one can see a specific shift in attitude. R. Naḥman's emphasis on oral expression, in discourses leading up to 1804, is characteristic of Hasidism's shift from the literary approach of Kabbalah toward an orally driven mass movement. Rebbe Naḥman's later emphasis on printed books can be understood in light of his decision in 1804 to embrace the printed book as a mechanism for spreading his ideas, a decision that may have stemmed from his messianic aspirations. Ontologies of orality and literacy are thus exposed as shifting ideological responses to biographical and historical circumstances.<br>

Article Title: Poetry Is Theft<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: In an infamous 1927 article, “Contra el secreto profesional” (“Against Professional Secrets”), Peruvian poet César Vallejo uses a similar metaphor to criticize the “false and epidermic” pan–Latin Americanism of Mistral, as well as the modish cosmopolitanism of other
         vanguardistawriters (including Borges). Echoing Emile Zola's “J'accuse,” Vallejo writes, “Acuso, pues, a mi generación de continuar los mismos métodos de plagio y de retórica de las pasadas generaciones, de las que ella reniega” (“I accuse, then, my generation of continuing the very same methods of plagiarism and rhetoric used by the past generations that they repudiate”).
               In direct opposition to the academicized poetic formulas borrowed from European Surrealism, Vallejo advocates particular elements of the Romantic ethic (notions of inspiration, honesty, authenticity, emotion, and the human), yet without drawing on its aesthetic. Vallejo's own poetry grows in part from an investigation of the linguistic function of “I,” that stuttering, fragmented convergence of energies. His poetry is not subjective, per se—it is an investigation of the61
            possibilityof subjectivity. His poems are shaped by a concern with the plasticity of language and the process of writing, ludic maneuvers, and a mix of registers (colloquial speech, and Peruvianisms romp with arcane scientific vocabulary) as he fashions a poetic form that corresponds to his sense of the contemporary.<br>

Abstract: The second half of the narrative (chapters 6–8) creates a strong movement and longing back to this textual hyper-memory, both voluntarily and involuntarily. The style of the narration is more distanced, reflective, mimetic, and filled with direct speech and flashbacks that slow down its speed. The past textual memory in the reader is not only evoked through the very change of style, but also through the reuse of common symbols that were developed in the first part. This strategy is called literary distance. This division mimics that of the division of the nostalgic reaction. The first part represents the happiness of the memory, and the second part illustrates the melancholic reflection on this memory. Thus, the process of reading
      Gatsbyis similar to the process of a nostalgic reaction. One way to dramatize how these halves function is through Leonard Baird's description of the structure ofGatsbyas a party followed by a hangover: “[W]hen you get through with the story you feel as if you'd been some place where you had a good time, but now entertain grave doubts as to the quality of the synthetic gin” (208). The sense of a party giving way to a hangover corresponds very well with the binaries of presence and distance.<br>

Abstract: Questions like this have shaped much of my own work. Being surrounded by so many enthusiastic but incompatibly articulate spokespersons for neglected lifeworld concerns, I concluded that criticism of tradition is most powerful when offered by those who are already in the midst of trying to be better phenomenologists—not, of course, in the sense that they are trying to be better members of a philosophical school but in the sense that they are motivated by the urge to find better ways to articulate something that tradition distorts or neglects. Why
      shouldaccounts of what matters most in life first be measured against the standards of “clear and distinct” propositional speech? Does anyone reallylive though life, thinking of it as a process going on inside our bodies? Do we reallyexperiencefreedom as an unconceptualizable combination of limitlessness and limit? And why throw the metaphorical wet blanket of a rigorously trained consciousness and its “correlates” over thepretheoretical practices of everyday life? Negative genuflections to philosophy's traditional priorities, privileging the subjective instead of the objective, inner instead of outer, lived body instead of house-for-the-mind—all of these inversions ultimately foster the continuing and undeserved hegemony of a traditionally objectivist understanding of what is Really Real. Kockelmans once told me that Merleau-Ponty eventually decidedPhenomenology of Perception“was not yet a philosophical book.” To be sure, its content and much of its treatment of that content is phenomenological, but its structure is still Cartesian. To start with specificallybodilyperception, however generously reconceived, still implies that other dimensions of presence to the world—linguistic, social, cultural, political, historical—can be added on at a later time, perhaps along with discussions of abstractly identified and timeless “topics” like freedom, the self, and so on.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: In the history of moral philosophy culminating in our moment of hyperbolic ethics, our plight has become less familiar and more uncanny, as the notion of duty or obligation increasingly takes on the sense of risk and urgency involved in substituting myself for another in a way that entails danger, even hostage, which, by the way, also has its roots in a Latin word for pledge—
      pledgein the sense of giving oneself over for the other and also in the sense of making a promise or a binding oath, in other words, a speech act, the very possibility of which assumes both other people and the Other of language and culture. Kant's autonomous will gives way to the vulnerability of the face for Levinas or suffering as the uncanny “capacity” for vulnerability for Derrida. The “I can” of moral agency becomes passively subjected to the other upon whom it depends ontologically and biologically for its very existence. Levinas proposes a responsibility that I cannot refuse because there is no I without it. Insofar as I am, I am answerable and responsible to and for the other. Contra Hegel and Sartre, Levinas (1998) maintains that subjectivity is not the in-itself become for-itself but, rather, the in-itself become for-the other. Yet Levinas insists that this hyperethical responsibility operates on a level opposed to the political. Justice, he says, requires a third, whereas the force of our ethical obligation finds its imperative in the face-to-face relation, which cannot be translated into the political realm.<br>

Article Title: Critical Theory<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: The Theory of Communicative Action, the leading tome of the first phase, addressed two things: social theory and analytic philosophy. On the one hand, it attempted to address critical theory's contribution to social theory, particularly in relationship to Weber and Parsons. On the other hand, it embedded critical theory in a full-blown analytic argument, which was designed to address developments in analytic philosophy. In retrospect these were permanent contributions to the reconstruction of critical theory and if anything, kept it alive. As many know I expressed my doubts regarding the universal claims associated with Habermas's reconstruction of speech-act theory.
                  However, it must be admitted that Habermas's reconstruction shaped the subsequent debates. If there are any doubts about that, I suggest that people consult the Sage Masters in Modern Social Thought series volumes on Habermas. An extraordinary amount of material has been produced responding to Habermas. Further, the debate over this contribution has been kept alive by the development of the discourse ethic, which began at a session of the Habermas seminar in spring 1982. Regarding the publication of4
               The Theory of Communicative ActionI recall specifically a four-hour discussion I had with Habermas over his theory of modernity, which in my view was all too willing to undercut archaic experience at the expense of scientific modernity. In retrospect that problem did not go away, and Habermas is now confronting it. A second recollection from that period has to do with Habermas's presentation of the paper that became the basis for the discourse ethic. Ernst Tugentat had written a six-page critique of it, which was circulated among the Habermas seminar group. Looking back it appears that most of the criticisms that were ever made subsequently of that view were made on that day. We were merciless, and when I left the conversation a full eight hours after it began Habermas and T~<br>

Abstract: Like Levinas and Derrida, Kierkegaard gives us a phenomenology of inverted intentionality.
            
                  While objects may be given to us through my gaze or our language games, subjects are given to us as we are seen and (especially) as we are addressed by them. Thus, in Genesis and in25
               Fear and Trembling, Abraham and God have a covenantal relation. It is grounded in a series of promises and commands that God issues to Abraham. This God is thus a personal God, an agent capable of keeping those promises, and a speaking God, capable of such speech acts as making promises and giving commands. Unlike Levinas's God, Abraham's might well be called his Constant Interlocutor. Accordingly, Abraham's faith (the central theme ofFear and Trembling) consists not primarily in a doxastic attitude toward various propositions (belief that …) but in the combination of trust in God's promises and obedience to God's commands.

Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: More than a simple and obvious trope, hyperbole is a perspective that allows one to view the world otherwise through the use of excess and exaggeration. It is a mode of thought, a practice of excess, and an act of becoming. It can operate discursively, polemically, prophetically, paradoxically, and philosophically. It is a generator of meaning and being and a lens through which to view the world and the limits of knowledge differently. It is a disruptive force within language that always attempts to move beyond the insufficiency of thought and language while at the same time revealing the errant multiplicity and exorbitance of discourse through the abundance of excess. Hyperbole is a different kind of speech; through it a lie that is not a deception can be employed on the side of truth(s), which is always lacking and unstable, necessitating the abundance of excess.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not view the movement from mimesis
      3to mimesis1as arhetoricalmoment. He employs rhetorical terminology as he discusses the techniques that the actual (as opposed to implied) author of a text utilizes in order to conceal “the violence … in the strategy of persuasion” (1988, 3:162). But he abandons this vocabulary when he approaches the reader, opting instead for the language of phenomenology and aesthetics (1988, 3:166–67). In part, he discards the language of the rhetorical tradition because of his limited view of rhetoric's capacity to produce real change in the world. He privileges poetics and philosophy “ontologically” over rhetoric, as Michael Leff has rightly pointed out (1987, 60). Ricoeur valorizes these intellectual traditions according to their ends: poetry results in a cathartic moment that purges old emotions and makes way for new ones, whereas rhetoric results in a persuasive moment that merely crystallizes the preexisting opinions of the audience. According to Ricoeur, these two ends are starkly opposed to one another: “Catharsis must, finally, be opposed to persuasion.” Unlike “all seduction or flattery” (i.e., rhetoric), catharsis stirs the emotions in order to enable “the creative imitation of human action” (1997, 66; see also 1977, 35). However, in the third volume ofTime and Narrative, Ricoeur also admits that the set of effects attached to catharsis is “complex”: “It designates first of all the effect of the work that is more moral than aesthetic: new evaluations, hitherto unheard of norms, are proposed by the work, confronting or shaking current customs” (1988 3:176). Because catharsis possesses a moral component, Ricoeur reasons, it is capable of instructing. Many rhetorical scholars would likely take issue with his assigning such seemingly “persuasive” effects to the realm of poetics rather than rhetoric. Does not Aristotle say that the stirring of emotions is as essential as logical argument to persuasion and judgm~<br>

Abstract: Along the same lines, in the preface to
      Man and Superman, he draws a distinction between two states of corporeal infirmity. The first, what he calls “the true joy of life,” results from “the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap, the being a force of nature.” The second is engendered by a failure of will and perspective, producing “a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.”
            Scholars and biographers have taken both views of Shaw. Countless testimonies of friends and acquaintances as well as innumerable pronouncements by GBS himself laud the extraordinary vibrancy of the “active young revolutionist” following his typical schedule of prolific writing and speech giving.22
         
            At the same time, Shaw's private diaries are replete with meticulous physiological self-examination, documenting his crippling headaches as well as myriad illnesses, injuries, changes in weight and appetite, and suspected symptoms. Robert Brustein attributes “a kind of Swiftian disgust at the human body and its functions” to the playwright, while Sally Peters pathologizes his interest in health, arguing its origin in latent psychosis, specifically an obsessive fear of contagion.23
         
            His commitment to vegetarianism, teetotalism, and Jaegerism, she argues, was founded as much upon hygienic paranoia as moral principle: “Fueled by a “desperate revulsion from body and biology[,] … Shaw's was an ever-lasting defense against dirt, poison, and contamination[,] whatever symbolized to him the form-destroying potencies of existence.”24
         
            In any case, the vexed body, on its way to evolutionary elimination, assiduously preoccupied Shaw, and matters of personal and public wellness remained an idée fixe until the end of his life.25<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>

Abstract: Because utopia is an imagined symbolic better world, it implies an aim or ideal by which conditions can be judged “better or worse.” Specific utopian fictions or proposals may use utopian comparisons with the present society for critical or even satirical purposes, but an underlying ideal seems ingrained in the very function of persuasive language. Rhetorical theory has also consistently evoked ideals throughout its history and into the present: Plato (when he wasn't warning against rhetoric) gave rhetors the ideal Good to strive for in dialogues such as
         PhaedrusandRepublic. Cicero's theory gave rhetoric theorator perfectusas a personal model of perfect civic leadership to strive for in the mind of the speaker. In the mid–twentieth century revival of rhetoric, Kenneth Burke and Richard Weaver theorized hierarchies of “god-terms”—that is, the ultimate ideals of value-based argument in any given culture. Chaim Perelman was a rhetorical theorist who described the universal audience, an ideal and culturally transcendent audience as it is imagined by any particular speaker from within his or her particular culture. Each of these ideals might be seen as part of an imagined rhetorical situation in the minds of the speaker and the audience. It might be said that Aristotle's classic “rhetorical triangle”—the speaker, the audience, and the subject—is often haloed by a dream triangle that points to one or more ideals of each element of the rhetorical situation. In contemporary philosophies of discourse, this notion calls to mind Habermas's ideal speech situation, in which speaker and hearers are free to express or question any assertion whatsoever, so long as certain implicit social rules are followed. This invocation of ideals is not to suggest that utopian aspects of rhetoric lack a critical function. The opposite may be more accurate if we define critical thought as rhetorician Kenneth Burke does, as “equipment for going beyond the criticism of experience to a crit~<br>
