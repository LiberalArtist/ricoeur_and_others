  CHAPTER 7  Purple Silk and Black Cotton: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76ttq">Exploring Jesuit Distinctiveness</a><br>
  Author(s) D’Ortia Linda Zampol<br>
  Abstract: On September 10, 1573, Francisco Cabral (1533–1609), superior of the Jesuit mission in Japan, informed the superior general in Rome (Francisco de Borja [1510–72], who had already died by that time) that the ship of Visitor Gonçalo Álvares (1527–73) had sunk in front of the port of Nagasaki, with immense loss of lives and funds. At least the state of the Japanese mission was finally acceptable:<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76ttq">Exploring Jesuit Distinctiveness</a><br>
  Author(s) Casalini Cristiano<br>
  Abstract: The ability to examine talents is one of the key features that continue to distinguish the Jesuits in a large number of fields today. The mission statements of many educative institutions run by the Society all around the world, such as schools and universities, insist on the cultivation of students’ skills and talents as a hallmark of their excellence. Yet, this characteristic goes beyond the boundaries of the ministry of education, for it involves many other tenets of the Jesuit identity.<br>

  Chapter One  The Public and Its Fundamentalists from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt14bs0wp">Superchurch</a><br>
  Abstract: In
                  The Public and Its Problems(1927), John Dewey defended the ideal of strong publics. Challenging Walter Lippmann’s pessimistic assessment that modern states were far too complex to be managed by their citizens, Dewey offered a fluid understanding of democracy and the state that highlighted the critical role of robust “public interests.”¹ Yet, as his title suggests, Dewey’s optimism was tempered by a sense that the modern public was in trouble. In the context of expanding technology, bureaucratization, and a dehumanizing standardization of action and association, the public, he argued, was fragmenting. The problem for Dewey, as Robert Asen argues,<br>

  3  Representing Target Populations from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt16wd0hf">Invoking the Invisible Hand</a><br>
  Abstract: Social policies ineluctably invoke target populations—people who, in the case of Social Security, would contribute to and benefit from an insurance or investment system. Whether supporting or opposing a policy proposal, debate participants address various qualities of a target population. Policymakers may assert that future retirees harbor hopes and dreams for their retirement, while retirees may expect policies to help them realize their visions. Beyond aspirations, potential beneficiaries may exhibit stated and unstated needs. Workers certainly do not plan to suffer a serious on-the-job injury or premature death, but they may need to protect their families against a tragic<br>

  4  Reconstructing a Time for Reform from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt16wd0hf">Invoking the Invisible Hand</a><br>
  Abstract: A new millennium brought a shift in the privatization debates. In the political realm, the year 2000 ended with great controversy as the winner of the November presidential election remained in doubt even after the polls had closed and the ballots had been counted. The nation focused its attention on the state of Florida, where reported problems with cast ballots placed in doubt the very outcome of the presidential election. Dramatic public statements and courtroom arguments by representatives of both campaigns ended only when the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of

  Abstract: In North Carolina, the state in which I live, every year over one hundred thousand dogs and cats are euthanized because there is no place to put them (North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services). That is almost 300 animals every day, which I find shocking and heartbreaking.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) PRĘGOWSKI MICHAŁ PIOTR<br>
  Abstract: Burying companion animals had been practiced by humans as early as 16,500 years BP, as recent archeological findings from the Epipaleolithic cemetery of Uyun al-Hammam suggest.¹ During the Early Neolithic (ca. 8000 BP) the burials of dogs who accompanied hunter-gatherers were already common.² Despite having a significant history, mortuary practices related to companion animals gained social significance not so long ago—in the nineteenth century, following industrialization, urbanization, as well as the rise of the middle class. At that time, purebred dogs ceased to dwell mostly in upper-class estates and became a fixture in the confined spaces of European and<br>

  Abstract: The last issue of this journal included our critique of Lincoln’s Cooper Union Address, and we assume that the neo-classical origins of the analysis were apparent, even though methodological concerns were slighted. A more elaborate statement on methodology appeared in an earlier version, but the editors cautioned that the single article did not offer sufficient scope for both an explication of the rationale and its application.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1tqx76n">To Become an American</a><br>
  Abstract: In 1919, Raymond Crist, the director of citizenship in the Bureau of Naturalization, appeared before a House committee hearing on proposed changes to naturalization laws. In his opening statement, Crist suggested that the true import of his testimony was to praise the recent education initiatives of Americanization: “There is, however, a far greater subject which I should like to present to the committee for its most careful consideration. That subject is the all-absorbing, Nation-wide question rather loosely referred to by the term ‘Americanization.’”¹ For Crist, effective Americanization altered the hearts and minds of the unnaturalized.

  Abstract: In a 1917 issue of the journal

At one moment in the address, Governor Brumbaugh proposed a statewide housing code to preserve the health of the populace. As the governor affirmed the responsibilities of the state toward residents, he hailed proper living conditions as requisite to the production of stronger citizens. In particular, he heavily promoted these standards for the populace of ethnic neighborhoods, stating, “We are not Americanizing our new-coming immigrants if we allow them to live in what is often termed the ‘black<br>

In New York, Governor Al Smith composed a Reconstruction Commission to shepherd the state through the postwar period. One of the proposals included in reconstruction enlarged funding and opportunities for Americanization. Proponents, progressive state legislators Abram Elkus and Felix Adler, sought to Americanize the least educated residents of the state.

He states that “We are witnessing a new stage in the escalation to extremes.”¹ Asan escalation of mimetic rivalry, both Islam and the West are responsible for their participation in the current global crisis of violence. Indeed, Girard claims in the same book, “When violence is involved, wrongs are always shared.”² But it might seem as though violence is endemic to Islam in a way that it is not to the West.

  Realism and Rhetoric in International Relations from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: The conduct of international relations has always involved skillful use of persuasive discourse. Relations between states might depend on factors such as military capability and natural resources, but the decisions made about the conduct of peace and war are also a result of the successes, failures, habits, and nuances of persuasive appeal among elites and publics alike. For the most part, however, academic research in international relations has not focused on the forms and effects of conversations, speeches, debates, narratives, or discourses in political practice. This systematic inattention to the role of words in foreign affairs is the result of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: One consequence of realism being deeply embedded in Western culture is that it can operate effectively in fragments. The entire code can be activated any time we are reminded, e.g., that people are by nature self-interested, that law is useless without enforcement, or that testaments of common ideals are mere rhetoric. As we accept these and similar nostrums, we enter a world of states competing for power, experts capable of calculating advantages, and idealists and other amateurs counseling folly. As these beliefs cohere, they shape our attitudes, our sensitivities (or lack of them), and our political identity.<br>

  Realism Masking Fear: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Author(s) L.Ivie Robert<br>
  Abstract: Fear is a feature of human nature that political realists typically factor into their pessimistic view of international affairs. The world as it actually “is,” they assume, consists of nation-states inherently conflicted over competing interests and limited resources, arbitrating their differences and seeking security through the elusive agency of power. Humankind is motivated less by morality and law than by fear and greed, motives which must be managed through the intelligent application of power—not just military power, but economic and ideological might as well. Providing for national security and fulfilling national interests are constant aspirations and tenuous achievements in<br>

  [III Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Abstract: One rewrites in order to improve a text. Sometimes the result is thought to be the better expression of an original meaning; at other times, it extends the idea in a new direction. In any case, textual revision is a process characterized by imperfection, change, negotiation, and fallibility. Traditionally, realism has seemed to be above this process: One identifies the relations of power or suffers the consequences. This attitude is reflected in the standard invocation of the classics of realism, which are seen as equivalent statements of a core doctrine of universal truths. From Thucydides to Machiavelli to Morgenthau, there<br>

  Rethinking Sovereignty from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Author(s) Elshtain Jean Bethke<br>
  Abstract: Sovereignty is the vote. The union card. The insignia of membership in the club. Less exclusive than it once was, the club now encompasses much of the globe and those not members at present continue to seek entry, often utilizing rather impolite methods to that end. Sovereignty remains the “essential qualification for full membership in international society, or, to express the point more comprehensively, the qualification which makes a state eligible for full membership.”¹ Sovereignty names an aspiration; serves as a goad to action; signifies an accomplishment; defines an opposition (state/society); and encodes a legalistic construction (formal sovereignty).<br>

  Author(s) Milliken Jennifer L.<br>
  Abstract: During the Vietnam War, the objectives of American policy toward Vietnam centered not on the strategic importance of the “real estate” involved, but on the effects a defeat in Vietnam would have on the United States’ prestige in the world and its reputation for keeping its commitments.¹ American policy makers spoke often of these considerations. And they measured American actions in Vietnam against them, weighing the costs in lives and resources of deepening intervention against the costs in prestige and reputation of halting that intervention.² If prestige and reputation are, as many claim, the intangible side of power, then in<br>

  [IV Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Abstract: From the perspective of realism, writing policy is the least of the tasks of statecraft. Action, not words, is the credo, and written statements are incidental accoutrements/or means of deception/or the hallmark of institutions that lack the force to back up their pronouncements. Once again, however, the realist is caught unaware. As the essays in this section demonstrate, foreign policy is a mixture of manifold practices of composition. Whether dependent on unacknowledged texts, or extending cultural practices of racial labeling into state action, or rein scribing the general text of modernity on indigenous peoples, or constructing a common narrative through<br>

  Author(s) Majeski Stephen J.<br>
  Abstract: At the Yalta Conference, in February 1945, Roosevelt and Stalin briefly discussed Indochina and the role that the French should play therein after the world war ended. During their colloquy, “the President said that the Indochinese were people of small stature, like the Javanese and Burmese, and were not warlike.”¹ Five years later, Roosevelt’s successor approved an official policy statement in which those Indochinese fighting against the French were described as “a determined adversary who manufactures effective arms locally ... and who was, and is able, to disrupt and harass almost any area within Vietnam ... at will.”² In the<br>

  Book Title: The Genesis of Desire-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Webb Eugene<br>
  Abstract: We seem to be abandoning the codes that told previous generations who they should love. But now that many of us are free to choose whoever we want, nothing is less certain. The proliferation of divorces and separations reveal a dynamic we would rather not see: others sometimes reject us as passionately as we are attracted to them.Our desire makes us sick. The throes of rivalry are at the heart of our attraction to one another. This is the central thesis of Jean-Michel Oughourlian's
      The Genesis of Desire, where the war of the sexes is finally given a scientific explanation. The discovery of mirror neurons corroborates his ideas, clarifying the phenomena of empathy and the mechanisms of violent reciprocity.How can a couple be saved when they have declared war on one another? By helping them realize that desire originates not in the self but in the other. There are strategies that can help, which Dr. Oughourlian has prescribed successfully to his patients. This work, alternating between case studies and more theoretical statements, convincingly defends the possibility that breakups need not be permanent.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: Two of the most important developments of the twentieth century have been the return of large numbers of Jews to Israel (and the creation of the state of Israel following that return), along with the rise of a Palestinian people. In this book, we illuminate these events through an analysis of the trajectories of Palestinian and Israeli symbol use over roughly the last century. Our thesis is that symbolic practices—speeches, essays, poetry, and other public communication—have played a crucial role in shaping each society and the conflict between them.<br>

  11  Palestinian Myth and the Reality of Oslo from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: The Oslo Accords could not have occurred without a transformed Palestinian symbol system. Palestinians involved in the Oslo talks recounted that the terms used in describing the Palestinians and the contested land were in dispute at Oslo. However, the Israelis came to accept the phrase “Palestinian people” and the words “West Bank” and “Gaza” rather than “Judea” and “Samaria” to describe a common reality. In turn, the Palestinians recognized the state of Israel. Indeed, demonstrating the importance of the symbol, the wording of the Oslo Accords and references to people and land were at the center of the negotiations.¹ The<br>

  3  Leading the Tribes Out of Exile: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt6fv">Christianity and the Mass Media in America</a><br>
  Abstract: In 1936 General Francisco Franco and other military leaders revolted against the Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic, plunging the country into a devastating civil war that would last until 1939. American Roman Catholics faced divided loyalties in trying to stake out positions in the public discourse about the war. Hoping that the Republic would become more democratic, and fearful of Francoʹs ʺcrusade,ʺ some Catholics argued for supporting the new Republican government even in the face of its violence against clerics of the state church. Other Catholics believed that Francoʹs campaign enjoyed clerical support and might, in spite<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt9dq">Executing Democracy</a><br>
  Abstract: I argued in chapter 2 that post-Revolutionary America experienced a backlash against too-damned-much-democracy: revolutionary impulses needed to be curtailed, so elites thought, to prevent the young nation from succumbing to what founding father Benjamin Rush diagnosed as the disease of “anarchia” and from sliding into what the Connecticut Wits portrayed in
                  The Anarchiadas a coming age of democracy run wild. Part of this backlash against those who took the words of the Declaration of Independence too literally—for of course all men were not created equal and happiness was not a natural right—entailed the use of state-sanctioned violence,<br>

  Abstract: In Canto V there appears none of those cruxes on which contemporary criticism often fastens as a basis for understanding the poem’s deeper meaning. Nevertheless, this canto contains some of the most vivid episodes of the journey, especially in its second part, which involves the stories of three memorable characters. As is typical of the whole

  Abstract: When Mario Sansone stated that Canto XXVII functions as a narrative pause between two climactic sequences (the rise through the three richly populated last cornices of the purgatorial mountain and the meeting with Matilda and Beatrice in the Terrestrial Paradise), he certainly did not mean to reduce Canto XXVII to merely a link lacking a poetical strength of its own. In fact, Sansone has added that the pauselike quality or narrative suspension following the poignant voice of Arnaut Daniel in the refining fire and foreshadowing the apparition of Matilda in the place of perennial springtime is counterpointed by an “ascending<br>

  Abstract: Artists—painters, playwrights, musicians—imagined and re-imaged the state and Indonesian society as Suharto’s New Order regime unraveled after thirty-three years of autocratic rule. At the heart of this chapter are the work and reflections of three contemporary Indonesian painters and their efforts to constitute a space and visual language for critical engagement with their society. The chapter draws on our conversations about their subjective experiences of producing art and describes their ongoing efforts to carve out distinctive modes of subjectivity as artists and intellectuals during the period of

  Author(s) Hyde Sandra Teresa<br>
  Abstract: When this policeman downplays AIDS, he is not ignoring the emergence of the epidemic; rather, he reflects a recurrent discourse around HIV/AIDS that emphasizes policing and surveillance of China’s border regions.¹ Borders here provide a liminal space where many transactions occur and where the spread of HIV in Sipsongpanna, an autonomous minority prefecture bordering Laos and Burma, symbolizes what Arjun Appadurai (1996) characterizes as late-twentieth-century cross-border migrations. These mass migrations of peoples, goods, services, and now viruses color a moving transnational canvas. This chapter focuses on the late-socialist Chinese state and untangles the actions of certain actors, such as the<br>

  Author(s) Hollifield Michael<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter we examine the problem of subjectivity as a transformation of lived experience in the wake of civil warfare and formation of the postcolonial nation-state. The specific terms of subjective alteration—collectively imprinted as a clash of political ethos¹ and personally imprinted as a shattering of identity and sentiment—are considered in relation to a culturally produced anguish in the aftermath of a conflict. Our ethnographic illustration of this process is the well-known case of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.² Prior to this political formation in 1975, multiparty warfare was waged throughout a fractured nation, as anticommunist armies<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapter frankly acknowledged the limitations, even the banality, of much of what we say about music, and it defended those qualities for what we can make of them. The give-and-take of speech acts in the imaginary dialogue about Mendelssohn’s concerto helps point the way to something more resonant, but we need to go further in that direction. We want, I assume, to articulate meaning, not just approximate it, as much so with music as with anything else. We need a reason to trust our interpretive statements. On the basis of the last chapter, again, we can surmise that<br>

  9  Analysis from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnchw">Interpreting Music</a><br>
  Abstract: Analytic statements about music inevitably have a hermetic quality. Even the simplest descriptions, say the labeling of an interval or a chord, call on an assumed body of technical knowledge that, at least initially, does not seem to point beyond itself. Those who love music but lack the technical knowledge tend to find analytic descriptions alienating, irrelevant, or intimidating. Those who have the knowledge do not always feel compelled to use it, or to use all of it. Music in the world survives handily without any help from analysis. Yet no one who wants to understand music deeply can avoid<br>

  Abstract: The topic of this chapter is musical meaning and musical performance. In saying so, I trope lightly on the title of a classic little book by Edward T. Cone,
                  Musical Form and Musical Performance.¹ The trope, literally the turn, a turning away or turning aside, lies in the substitution ofmeaningforform. This change epitomizes much of the recent history of musicology. It reorients musical understanding. It turns from an implicit statement of hierarchy (form over performance) to an implicit statement of reciprocity (meaning with performance). Grammatically identical though they are, my phrase and Cone’s are dramatically different as<br>

  Abstract: Madness or psychotic illness fundamentally challenges local understandings of human nature, as well as the theorization of subjectivity. Societies and individuals understand madness in various ways: as possession by haunting spirits, a flight from reason, a regression to childlike or primitive states, an essential mode of being in the world and a distinctive form of human subjectivity, the entry into an alternative world, or a mode of deeply disturbed and pathological subjectivity reflecting disordered brain chemistry. Whatever the interpretation, the chaotic and disturbing qualities of psychosis are deeply threatening to those undergoing the experience as well as to their families<br>

  Book Title: The Language of the Gods in the World of Men-Sanskrit, Culture, and Power in Premodern India<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Pollock Sheldon<br>
  Abstract: In this work of impressive scholarship, Sheldon Pollock explores the remarkable rise and fall of Sanskrit, India's ancient language, as a vehicle of poetry and polity. He traces the two great moments of its transformation: the first around the beginning of the Common Era, when Sanskrit, long a sacred language, was reinvented as a code for literary and political expression, the start of an amazing career that saw Sanskrit literary culture spread from Afghanistan to Java. The second moment occurred around the beginning of the second millennium, when local speech forms challenged and eventually replaced Sanskrit in both the literary and political arenas. Drawing striking parallels, chronologically as well as structurally, with the rise of Latin literature and the Roman empire, and with the new vernacular literatures and nation-states of late-medieval Europe,
      The Language of the Gods in the World of Menasks whether these very different histories challenge current theories of culture and power and suggest new possibilities for practice.<br>

  Abstract: Few local literary cultures of premodernity anywhere permit us to follow the history and reconstruct the meanings of vernacularization with quite the same precision as is possible for Kannada, the language of what is now the southern union state of Karnataka. We can chart the shifts in cosmopolitan and vernacular cultural production without interruption from about the fifth century on, based on texts that are for the most part securely datable—an almost unparalleled antiquity and chronological transparency. Much of the data is the hard evidence of epigraphs, and their quantity is breathtaking. The region must be one of the<br>

  Abstract: The idea of scale is useful because historians agree that religions such as Buddhism, with their “karmic eschatologies,” emerged during India’s “second urbanization”(the first of course associated with the Indus valley civilizations). During this period small communities were linked to each other by trade networks and the imperialist designs of emergent empires. Similar, although not identical, social changes were occurring in the small Greek city-states, although the scale of change was not as great as in India. Avoiding terms like

  Author(s) Faust Drew<br>
  Abstract: To whom do the dead belong? And how must they be claimed? War produces unnatural death, deaths that occur out of place—away from home and kin—and deaths that occur out of time, to the young and strong. Modern war kills more noncombatants than soldiers; death strikes outside the rules meant to contain and rationalize the violence of war. The nations that are war’s agents claim the dead for political purposes and ideologies, wrenching them away from family and leaving deep wounds, turning them into instruments rather than agents of history. Religious tradition is subordinated or expropriated by state<br>

  Abstract: Ancestors and ghosts are not the only categories of death found in Vietnamese domestic ritual space. In traditional times, these two categories might have been sufficient for conceptually organizing the cosmological mirror of the living world. The rise of the modern nation-state, however, has added a novel category of death to the traditional cosmology of death. Called
                  liet siin Vietnamese, it refers to the heroic death of fallen soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the sacred purpose of protecting the nation. Historians suggest that the institutionalized commemoration of this category constitutes the core of “modern national memory.”¹ In western<br>

  Abstract: Heroes, ancestors, and ghosts coexist in the village environment. While revolutionary politics and traditional religious heritage separate them, the three social classes in afterlife associate in popular ritual practices. Although they constitute a hierarchy, the hierarchy that structures their relative values varies at different sites of memory. Their status changes between the state war memorial and the community temple, and the war heroes who occupy the symbolic center in the former are relegated to the margins, outside the village ancestors, in the latter. The position of ghosts also shifts in this movement of memories. The memory of tragic death is<br>

  Abstract: In 2004, Raʾūf ʿAbbās, one of Egypt’s leading historians, published his autobiography. This memoir, ostensibly a pedestrian intellectual autobiography of a retired history professor, proved instead to be a frontal assault on Egypt’s entire historiographical establishment. The author spared no one: neither the stars of Egypt’s academic elite nor the lowliest graduate student escaped the lashing of his pen. Over the course of 336 crowded pages, he accused his colleagues of poor academic standards, plagiarism, intellectual shallowness, ethical violations, political partisanship, and collaboration with the state’s security services.

  Abstract: After the outbreak of World War II and increasingly throughout the 1940s, Egyptian public life was radicalized. Parliamentary politics was viewed as detached from the country’s real problems, and politicians appeared as self-serving and corrupt. Successive governments rose and fell, and the existing political order began to lose both credibility and respect. Thus, the largest opposition group, the Muslim Brotherhood, openly challenged the state by murdering Prime Minister Maḥmūd Fahmī al-Nuqrāshī. The government responded in the same fashion and eliminated the brotherhood’s leader, Ḥasan al-Bannā. On a number of occasions the state brutally suppressed the communists.

  Abstract: The decade that followed the events of July 1952 critically altered the conventional assumptions of post–World War I Egyptian historiography. This impact was obvious. A variety of state-owned media invoked the memory of past events on a daily basis. Indeed, over the years, scholars had been drawn to the extensive usage of the past during the 1950s. Subscribing to the idea that the task of historiography is mainly that of studying shifts in historical representation, they emphasized the changing image of several rulers and popular leaders.¹ Though the issue of changing historical images was the most visible historiographical trait<br>

I present my thesis hesitantly because no one seems to have a clear knowledge of precontact or “traditional” Maori anthropophagy. In fact this phrasing might be a misnomer because New Zealand consisted of a multiplicity of Maori communities, such that, forms of anthropophagy, wherever they existed, would have shown local variations. Conventional ethnography simply constructs an ideal type of Maori cannibalism from a variety of statements—interviews with older men, myths, missionary and magistrate accounts, and even that of eyewitnesses.

  Book Title: Reconfiguring Modernity-Concepts of Nature in Japanese Political Ideology<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Thomas Julia Adeney<br>
  Abstract: Julia Adeney Thomas turns the concept of nature into a powerful analytical lens through which to view Japanese modernity, bringing the study of both Japanese history and political modernity to a new level of clarity. She shows that nature necessarily functions as a political concept and that changing ideas of nature's political authority were central during Japan's transformation from a semifeudal world to an industrializing colonial empire. In political documents from the nineteenth to the early twentieth century, nature was redefined, moving from the universal, spatial concept of the Tokugawa period, through temporal, social Darwinian ideas of inevitable progress and competitive struggle, to a celebration of Japan as a nation uniquely in harmony with nature. The so-called traditional "Japanese love of nature" masks modern state power. Thomas's theoretically sophisticated study rejects the supposition that modernity is the ideological antithesis of nature, overcoming the determinism of the physical environment through technology and liberating denatured subjects from the chains of biology and tradition. In making "nature" available as a critical term for political analysis, this book yields new insights into prewar Japan's failure to achieve liberal democracy, as well as an alternative means of understanding modernity and the position of non-Western nations within it.<br>

  CHAPTER 7  The Acculturation of Japanese Nature from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppt3b">Reconfiguring Modernity</a><br>
  Abstract: The preceding chapters highlighted the centrality of nature in early Meiji political thought through the mid–1880s; this chapter explores a hiatus in nature’s overt political presence, extending until the Russo–Japanese War of 1904–5. In contrast to early Meiji documents—the Charter Oath, the Constitution of 1868, and the books and articles by Katō, Baba, and Ueki during the Crisis of 1881—the major documents of Meiji state formation produced around 1890, including the Meiji Constitution, hardly mention nature in any form. Nature fades from political prominence just when Japan acquires its modern governmental structures, a modern educational<br>

                  New International Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements,titled “Theology, Pentecostal.”¹ That article gives a succinct, balanced, and informative description of the main systematic contributions to developing Pentecostal theology.

  Author(s) Renard John<br>
  Abstract: Thomas Hobbes famously observed in his
                  Leviathanthat human life is “nasty, brutish, and short.” He and other influential philosophers have identified violence as virtually a “state of nature” that humankind has struggled endlessly to ameliorate, and with precious little success. Religious authors in every age and culture have likewise filled libraries with their analyses of the roots and remedies of this scourge, this “mark of Cain.” Every credible religious or ethical system condemns murder, yet sacred texts claimed by adherents of most (if not all) religious traditions describe in often grisly detail how believers have had recourse to divinely<br>

  Abstract: In late November 1992, I visited the Gandhi Memorial in bustling Delhi. Eight days later I traveled to the remote city of Nanded, in the Indian state of Maharashtra, for ethnographic research. At the Gandhi memorial, the Gita was regularly cited by tour guides and was even part of a makeshift display on the techniques of nonviolence that Gandhi used. The verses displayed were from the second half of the second chapter of the Gita, verses about attaining inner peace and self control, which Gandhi (d. 1948) felt were the core of the Gita’s message.

  Abstract: The last two decades of the twentieth century witnessed a popular representation of Sikhs in the Indian media as bloodthirsty avengers rather than as bloodied victims. The principal reason for this stereotype was the rise of Sikh nationalism in the early 1980s. Akali Dal (army of the immortal), the main political party of the Sikhs in the Punjab, was demanding increased autonomy for all the states of India. During that period, relations with the Indian government became increasingly strained as a result. In an apparent attempt to sow dissension in the ranks of the Akali Dal, the Congress government encouraged<br>

  Book Title: Rifle Reports-A Story of Indonesian Independence<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Steedly Mary Margaret<br>
  Abstract: On August 17, 1945, Indonesia proclaimed its independence from Dutch colonial rule. Five years later, the Republic of Indonesia was recognized as a unified, sovereign state. The period in between was a time of aspiration, mobilization, and violence, in which nationalists fought to expel the Dutch while also trying to come to grips with the meaning of "independence."
      Rifle Reportsis an ethnographic history of this extraordinary time as it was experienced on the outskirts of the nation among Karo Batak villagers in the rural highlands of North Sumatra. Based on extensive interviews and conversations with Karo veterans,Rifle Reportsinterweaves personal and family memories, songs and stories, memoirs and local histories, photographs and monuments, to trace the variously tangled and perhaps incompletely understood ways that Karo women and men contributed to the founding of the Indonesian nation. The routes they followed are divergent, difficult, sometimes wavering, and rarely obvious, but they are clearly marked with the signs of gender. This innovative historical study of nationalism and decolonization is an anthropological exploration of the gendering of wartime experience, as well as an inquiry into the work of storytelling as memory practice and ethnographic genre.<br>

  Abstract: The evacuees’ return to their homes after the Renville Accord was not the end of the struggle, though it does provide a convenient stopping point for my story of Indonesian independence. The events that followed had more to do with the consolidation of the state than with the idea of independence. During the yearlong hiatus in the fighting, Indonesians turned their attention to matters of administration and governance, political routinization, and military reorganization. The army set up new training programs emphasizing guerrilla warfare, clarified and strengthened its chain of command, and endeavored to enhance the discipline and esprit of the<br>

  Author(s) Hogarth Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Michel Beaujour states his dissatisfaction with the term 'autoportrait' to encapsulate adequately literary endeavours at self-representation.¹ The connection between self-portraiture and painting is evident, and the slippage of the term across mediums leads, in Beaujour's opinion, to deny the specificity of literary works. Yet, referring to works such as Michel de Montaigne's
                  Essais, Michel Leiris'sL'âge d'hommeand Jean-Jacques Rousseau'sRêveries, Beaujour highlights its usefulness as a tool that distinguishes it from autobiographical texts for two fundamental reasons. First, self-portraiture insists upon an absence of continuity, thus defying any clearly arranged order of events that contribute to a personality created<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12878n5">The Mission of Demythologizing</a><br>
  Abstract: We noted in the previous chapter Bultmann’s claim that radical demythologizing is “the consistent application [of the doctrine of justification by faith alone] to the field of knowledge.”² This application has both a negative and a positive dimension. Negatively it is criticism of objectifying thinking within the
                     Weltbildof mythology, which I suggest we can restate ascriticism of constantinianism. Demythologizing is a critical epistemology in the sense that it subverts every attempt to interpret the kerygma in the form of aWeltanschauung. It is thus an antimythological and antimetaphysical—i.e., deconstantinizing—hermeneutic.<br>

  Book Title: Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BERGER HARRY<br>
  Abstract: Figures of a Changing World offers a dramatic new account of cultural change, an account based on the distinction between two familiar rhetorical figures, metonymy and metaphor. The book treats metonymy as the basic organizing trope of traditional culture and metaphor as the basic organizing trope of modern culture. On the one hand, metonymies present themselves as analogies that articulate or reaffirm preexisting states of affairs. They are guarantors of facticity, a term that can be translated or defined as fact-like-ness. On the other hand, metaphors challenge the similarity they claim to establish, in order to feature departures from preexisting states of affairs. On the basis of this distinction, the author argues that metaphor and metonymy can be used as instruments both for the large-scale interpretation of tensions in cultural change and for the micro-interpretation of tensions within particular texts. In addressing the functioning of the two terms, the author draws upon and critiques the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, Roman Jakobson, Christian Metz, Paul Ricoeur, Umberto Eco, Edmund Leach, and Paul de Man.<br>

  Abstract: Fiction and history in the era after World War II are interlocking journeys by immigrants to America’s shores. This immigrant tide in contemporary American fiction is global, flowing across diasporas, borders, and postcolonial terrains. From the Holocaust to the Haitian and Cuban boatlifts, many of the departures and arrivals are reflections of recent historical traumas, creating in fiction what Bharati Mukherjee terms “odysseys of dislocation” (Woodford 2). Immigration for America’s short story writers and novelists today is the representation of radically new desires by the world’s uprooted peoples, an allegory chronicling the evolution of a multicultural nation-state.<br>

  Author(s) Frangoulidis Stavros<br>
  Abstract: It is only very recently that scholars of Apuleius’
                  Metamorphoseshave come to observe and appreciate the theme of Aristomenes’ metaphorical death and rebirth when he falls victim to the witches (Met. 1.15–17). Thus, Donald Lateiner has called attention to the imagery of death and rebirth when Aristomenes is on the ground, lifeless, naked and cold (1.14).¹ W.H. Keulen points out that Aristomenes describes his state of humiliation when the witches leave the inn “in terms of both new-born life and death”.² Finally, in their most recent article, Warren S. Smith and Baynard Woods briefly observe Aristomenes’ vacillation between<br>

  Book Title: Tastes of the Divine: Hindu and Christian Theologies of Emotion-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS MICHELLE VOSS<br>
  Abstract: The intensity and meaningfulness of aesthetic experience have often been described in theological terms. By designating basic human emotions as rasa, a word that connotes taste, flavor, or essence, Indian aesthetic theory conceptualizes emotional states as something to be savored. At their core, emotions can be tastes of the divine. In this book, the methods of the emerging discipline of comparative theology enable the author's appreciation of Hindu texts and practices to illuminate her Christian reflections on aesthetics and emotion. Three emotions vie for prominence in the religious sphere: peace, love, and fury. Whereas Indian theorists following Abhinavagupta claim that the aesthetic emotion of peace best approximates the goal of religious experience, devotees of Krishna and medieval Christian readings of the Song of Songs argue that love communicates most powerfully with divinity. In response to the transcendence emphasized in both approaches, the book turns to fury at injustice to attend to emotion's foundations in the material realm. The implications of this constructive theology of emotion for Christian liturgy, pastoral care, and social engagement are manifold.<br>

  Abstract: Prior to its use as a term for aesthetic delight,
                  rasahad basic meanings of taste, relishing, or the essence of a thing.Rasadenotes juice or sap, as well as a special concoction of various ingredients that yields a unique flavor distinct from any one of the ingredients. The wordrasaalso applies to each of the six flavors—sweet, bitter, sour, salty, pungent, and astringent—which impart unique gustatory experiences.¹Rasa’s use as a technical aesthetic term derives from the Indian tradition of dance-drama in Bharata’sNāṭya Śāstra, where it denotes emotional states savored by spectators of the<br>

  Abstract: In her poem “The Robin’s My Criterion for Tune,” Emily Dickinson attempts to describe the peculiar vision that powers her imagination and informs her poetry. With typical deftness, she states simply, “I see—New Englandly.” Anyone who has read even a few of Dickinson’s poems—each sparse and spare, yet offering up food for the soul even the angels might savor—recognizes exactly what she means by this. Dickinson’s geographic home, an accident of her birth, has located her in the universe, given her a vantage point from which to see the world and a language to engage it. The<br>

  Abstract: Jean-Luc Marion’s
                  Le phénomène érotique (PE)¹ is not only the culmination of an ongoing and long-standing concern² but, as such, is also the most explicit statement in his oeuvre to date about the sheer primacy of love. Specifically,PEsuggests that only in thephénomène croisé, only in erotic love, can one receive the gift of significance that is capable of contesting the ultimate challenge of nihilism—namely, the challenge of “What’s the use?” or “to what end?” (à quoi bon?). As we shall see here, Marion’s suggestions resonate profoundly with those of a classical philosopher unmatched in his sustained<br>

  Abstract: According to Aristotle (in

Unlike declarative propositions that assume a possible correspondence between our words and the affairs of the world—a correspondence that can be checked or verified by the methods of scientific observation—prayers do not illuminate or clarify the world in the way that more or less scientific statements do. They cannot be tested according to the rigors of scientific procedure because they follow a different grammar, obey rules of use in which considerations other than truth<br>

  Book Title: Questioning the Human: Toward a Theological Anthropology for the Twenty-First Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Van Stichel Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology is being put to the test: in the face of contemporary developments in the spheres of culture, politics, and science, traditional perspectives on the human person are no longer adequate. Yet can theological anthropology move beyond its previously established categories and renew itself in relation to contemporary insights? The present collection of essays sets out to answer this question. Uniting Roman Catholic theologians from across the globe, it tackles from a theological perspective challenges related to the classical natural law tradition (part 1), to the modern conception of the subject (part 2), and to the postmodern awareness of diversity in a globalizing context (part 3). Its contributors share a fundamental methodological choice of a critical-constructive dialogue with contemporary culture, science, and philosophy. This collection integrates a wider range of approaches than one usually finds in theological volumes, bringing together experts in systematic theology and in theological ethics. Authors come from different American contexts, including Black and Latino, and from a European context that include both French and German. Moreover, the interdisciplinary insights upon which the different contributions draw stem from both the natural sciences (such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and ethology) and the humanities (such as cultural studies, philosophy, and hermeneutics). This volume will be essential reading for anyone seeking a state-of-the-art account of theological anthropology, of the uncertainties it is facing, and of the responses it is in the process of formulating. The shared Roman Catholic background of the authors of this collection makes this volume a helpful complement to recent publications that predominantly represent views from other theological traditions.<br>

  Book Title: Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatter Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Tocqueville suggested that the people reign in the American political world like God over the universe.This intuition anticipates the crisis in the secularization paradigm that has brought theology back as a fundamental part of sociological and political analysis. It has become more difficult to believe that humanity's progress necessarily leads to atheism, or that it is possible to translate all that is good about religion into reasonable terms acceptable in principle by all, believers as well as nonbelievers. And yet, the spread of Enlightenment values, of an independent public sphere, and of alternative projects of modernitycontinues unabated and is by no means the antithesis of the renewed vigor of religious beliefs.The essays in this book shed interdisciplinary and multicultural light on a hypothesis that helps to account for such an unexpected convergence of enlightenment and religion in our times: Religion has reentered the public sphere because it puts into question the relation between God and the concept of political sovereignty.In the first part, Religion and Polity-Building,new perspectives are brought to bear on the tension-ridden connection between theophany and state-building from the perspective of world religions. Globalized, neo-liberal capitalism has been another crucial factor in loosening the bond between God and the state, as the essays in the second part, The End of the Saeculum and Global Capitalism,show.The essays in the third part, Questioning Sovereignty: Law and Justice,are dedicated to a critique of the premises of political theology, starting from the possibility of a prior, perhaps deeper relation between democracy and theocracy. The book concludes with three innovative essays dedicated to examining Tocqueville in order to think the Religion of Democracybeyond the idea of civil religion.<br>

  Abstract: Those who led Senegal to independence and established the institutions of the new state, notably Léopold Sédar Senghor and Mamadou Dia, intended it to be based on the philosophical foundation of a socialism that would be both African and spiritualist. And they also meant it to be secular. African socialism, spirituality, secularism, those were the concepts that were to guide the state toward modernity and development. Socialism had transformed Russia into a world power; it was at work in China and elsewhere to bring progress to the lives of the “damned of the earth.” It was logical to think that<br>

  Abstract: Modern capitalism in the 1960 s and 1970 s was called late capitalism, and this index of time—the word “late”—implied that modern capitalism, with free markets of labor, real estate, and money, had come to an end. Its final decay was supposed to be only a question of time, political power, and successful regime change. During the 1960 s and 1970 s, the leftist alternative seemed to be clear and present. The variety of socialist alternatives was overwhelming: Grassroots democracy, democratization of the economy, a strong social welfare state, state or market socialism, but socialism (or social democracy)<br>

  Abstract: Thomas Hobbes’s political philosophy is based on a paradox: Hobbes, one could say, gives too much and too little to the state at the same time.

Rossiter shows that when constitutional democratic governments have faced severe political or economical crises, they have not hesitated to employ dictatorial means in “an unconscious but nonetheless real imitation of the autocratic methods of their enemies.”¹ He goes on to claim that modern democracies differ from totalitarian regimes on this count because in democracies the state of exception is itself used only exceptionally.

  Abstract: Some scholars and laypersons alike worry aloud about the current state of African American Christianity.

They see enormous sanctuaries and massive gatherings of worshippers enraptured by very charismatic personalities who proclaim the word of God and offer a blueprint for individual healing. For some, these events—and they are events in scale and in emotion—confirm the somewhat standard claim that the tone and timbre of Pentecostalism have come to dominate African American religious expression,<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking God as Gift: Marion, Derrida, and the Limits of Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Horner Robyn<br>
  Abstract: Rethinking God as Gift is situated at the intersection of philosophy, critical theory and theology. The first sustained study of the work of Jean-Luc Marion in English, it offers a unique perspective on contemporary questions and their theological relevance. Taking its point of departure from the problem of the gift as articulated by Jacques Derrida, who argues that the conditions of possibility of the gift are also its conditions of impossibility, Horner pursues a series of questions concerning the nature of thought, the viability of phenomenology, and, most urgently, the possibility of grace. For Marion, phenomenology, as the thought of the given, offers a path for philosophy to proceed without being implicated in metaphysics. His retrieval of several important insights of Edmund Husserl, along with his reading of Martin Heidegger and Emmanuel Lvinas, enables him to work out a phenomenology where even impossiblephenomena such as revelation and the gift might be examined. In this important confrontation between Marion and Derrida issues vital to the negotiation of postmodern concerns in philosophy and theology emerge with vigour. The careful elucidation of those issues in an interdisciplinary context, and the snapshot it provides of the state of contemporary debate, make Rethinking God as Gift an important contribution to theological and philosophical discussion.<br>

  Abstract: “Reading” is a term that, through overuse, can easily become confused with interpretation. In fact, there is a crucial difference: Reading involves the undoing of interpretative figures; because it is not an operation opposed to the understanding but rather a precondition for it, it allows us to question whether the synthetic moves of the understanding can close off a text. It leads away from meaning to such problems as the text’s constitution and meaning generation. Unlike interpretation, which implies a development over the course of a narrative toward a single figure reconciling all its diverse moments, reading states the logic<br>

  Abstract: One difference between shame and embarrassment in Rousseau can be stated quite simply. Shame is a passion productive of discourse. The confessing done under its aegis seems marvelously able to serve as an action of which to be ashamed, and so to provoke more confession. Embarrassment, on the other hand, is tonguetied, an anacoluthon in the grammar of feelings. Where, under influence of timidity, Rousseau manages to blurt something out nonetheless, the effect is not to end the silence but most often to prolong it, rendering the hapless speaker even more incapable of timely speech.

  Abstract: In her first major speech as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in 1997, Ireland’s former president Mary Robinson admonished the international body for having abandoned its historical mission of “realising human rights”: “Somewhere along the way many in the United Nations have lost the plot and allowed their work to answer to other imperatives.”¹ Recalling the purposes for which the UN incorporated itself in 1945, Robinson insisted that “almost by definition and certainly according to its Charter, the United Nations exists to promote human rights.” Indeed, the Charter’s preamble rehearses the organization’s statement of purpose, enumerating the common<br>

  Abstract: “When the police came to mamCatherine’s house in 1976, they said: … Let’s search the bedroom.”¹ The scene of this domestic invasion by the state is Catherine Mlangeni’s South African township home, to which apartheid police had come looking for her son Bheki, who was then a student but would later become a prominent human rights lawyer. That night, mamCatherine succeeded in saving her sons, but fifteen years later Bheki Mlangeni would be decapitated at home by a bomb the police had planted in a walkman.

  Abstract: A piece of historical writing is often thought of as a narrative interpreting the times of those who can themselves no longer depict the epoch in which they lived and moved and had their being. The subjects of this story are no longer here to attest to their era’s culture, economy, institutions, politics, and way of life, whether to praise or to excoriate them.

  Author(s) SWANCUTT DIANA M.<br>
  Abstract: In the midst of war in Iraq and a color-coded campaign against terror, American Christians are waging an intense cultural battle over the sexual dynamics of sexual difference. Responding to the legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts (2004) and civil union in Vermont (2000) and Connecticut (2005), some of the nation’s largest Protestant denominations (e.g., the Southern Baptist Convention), evangelical political organizations (e.g., the Arlington Group, Focus on the Family, and the American Family Association), and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops have devoted unparalleled resources to fighting similar threats to American moral values in other states.

  Abstract: The statement by T.S. Eliot with which I begin is not without its problems, the most obvious of them the difficulty of actually defining “poetry.” Yet it seems worth sticking with Eliot’s formulation for the time being, inasmuch as too often the fact that the Song of Songs is poetry—and not another thing—seems to be forgotten by interpreters, or at least neglected. What would it mean to consider the Song of Songs as poetry? And further, what
                  kindof poetry do we find in the Song of Songs? What are the “other things” that it ought not to<br>

  Author(s) Treanor Brian<br>
  Abstract: Friedrich Nietzsche famously stated: “There are no facts, only interpretations.”¹ Perhaps this could be slightly rephrased: no facts go uninterpreted. There are simply no bare facts, at least if a fact is to be meaningful. Every fact has meaning only in relation to other facts, to context, and to the human understanding itself. In other words, at the heart of every confrontation of concept and perception is the issue of

  Abstract: In a series of astute papers over the last fifteen years, Steven Vogel has developed a remarkably compelling social constructivist critique of “nature.” Having drawn on several well-known and widely accepted postmodern worries, he might have appeared vulnerable to the traditional environmentalist’s equally well-known counterthrust: doesn’t the reduction of nature to culture simply efface nature in one last, hubristic and utterly anthropocentric gesture? Yet Vogel’s argument is carefully constructed, the fruit of a thoughtful and sober mind. He carefully avoids the overstatement to which some have been prone.

  Author(s): KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: This important book brings together in one volume a collection of illuminating encounters with some of the most important philosophers of our age-by one of its most incisive and innovative critics.For more than twenty years, Richard Kearney has been in conversation with leading philosophers, literary theorists, anthropologists, and religious scholars. His gift is eliciting memorably clear statements about their work from thinkers whose writings can often be challenging in their complexity. Here, he brings together twenty-one originally published extraordinary conversations-his 1984 collection Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, his 1992 Visions of Europe: Conversations on the Legacy and Future of Europe, and his 1995 States of Mind: Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers. Featured interviewees include Stanislas Breton, Umberto Eco, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Herbert Marcus, George Steiner, Julia Kristeva, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard. To this classic core, he adds recent interviews, previously unpublished, with Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Jacques Derrida, and George DumZzil, as well as six colloquies about his own work.Wide-ranging and accessible, these interviews provide a fascinating guide to the ideas, concerns, and personalities of thinkers who have shaped modern intellec-tual life. This book will be an essential point of entry for students, teachers, scholars, and anyone seeking to understand contemporary culture.ContentsPrefacePart One: Recent DebatesJacques Derrida: Terror, Religion, and the New PoliticsJean-Luc Marion: The Hermeneutics of RevelationPaul Ricour: (a) On Life Stories (b) On The Crisis of Authority (c) The Power of the Possible (d) Imagination, Testimony, and TrustGeorges Dumzil: Myth, Ideology, SovereigntyPart Two: From Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, 1984Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics of the InfiniteHerbert Marcuse: The Philosophy of Art and PoliticsPaul Ricour: (a) The Creativity of Language (b) Myth as the Bearer of Possible WorldsStanislas Breton: Being, God, and the Poetics of RelationJacques Derrida: Deconstruction and the OtherPart Three: From States of Mind, 1995Julia Kristeva: Strangers to Ourselves: The Hope of the SingularHans Georg Gadamer: Text MattersJean-Franois Lyotard: What Is Just?George Steiner: Culture-The Price You PayPaul Ricour: Universality and the Power of DifferenceUmberto Eco: Chaosmos: The Return to the Middle AgesPart Four: Colloquies with Richard KearneyVillanova Colloquy: Against OmnipotenceAthens Colloquy: Between Selves and OthersHalifax Colloquy: Between Being and God Stony Brook Colloquy: Confronting ImaginationBoston Colloquy: Theorizing the GiftDublin Colloquy: Thinking Is DangerousAppendix: Philosophy as Dialogue<br>

  Abstract: This important book brings together in one volume a collection of illuminating encounters with some of the most important philosophers of our age-by one of its most incisive and innovative critics.For more than twenty years, Richard Kearney has been in conversation with leading philosophers, literary theorists, anthropologists, and religious scholars. His gift is eliciting memorably clear statements about their work from thinkers whose writings can often be challenging in their complexity. Here, he brings together twenty-one originally published extraordinary conversations-his 1984 collection Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, his 1992 Visions of Europe: Conversations on the Legacy and Future of Europe, and his 1995 States of Mind: Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers. Featured interviewees include Stanislas Breton, Umberto Eco, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Herbert Marcus, George Steiner, Julia Kristeva, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard. To this classic core, he adds recent interviews, previously unpublished, with Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Jacques Derrida, and George DumZzil, as well as six colloquies about his own work.Wide-ranging and accessible, these interviews provide a fascinating guide to the ideas, concerns, and personalities of thinkers who have shaped modern intellec-tual life. This book will be an essential point of entry for students, teachers, scholars, and anyone seeking to understand contemporary culture.ContentsPrefacePart One: Recent DebatesJacques Derrida: Terror, Religion, and the New PoliticsJean-Luc Marion: The Hermeneutics of RevelationPaul Ricour: (a) On Life Stories (b) On The Crisis of Authority (c) The Power of the Possible (d) Imagination, Testimony, and TrustGeorges Dumzil: Myth, Ideology, SovereigntyPart Two: From Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, 1984Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics of the InfiniteHerbert Marcuse: The Philosophy of Art and PoliticsPaul Ricour: (a) The Creativity of Language (b) Myth as the Bearer of Possible WorldsStanislas Breton: Being, God, and the Poetics of RelationJacques Derrida: Deconstruction and the OtherPart Three: From States of Mind, 1995Julia Kristeva: Strangers to Ourselves: The Hope of the SingularHans Georg Gadamer: Text MattersJean-Franois Lyotard: What Is Just?George Steiner: Culture-The Price You PayPaul Ricour: Universality and the Power of DifferenceUmberto Eco: Chaosmos: The Return to the Middle AgesPart Four: Colloquies with Richard KearneyVillanova Colloquy: Against OmnipotenceAthens Colloquy: Between Selves and OthersHalifax Colloquy: Between Being and God Stony Brook Colloquy: Confronting ImaginationBoston Colloquy: Theorizing the GiftDublin Colloquy: Thinking Is DangerousAppendix: Philosophy as Dialogue<br>

  UNRESOLVED AND UNRESOLVABLE: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0610">Scrolls of Love: Ruth and the Song of Songs</a><br>
  Author(s) Brettler Marc<br>
  Abstract: The statement that best encapsulates the problems of the Song of Songs is the simile attributed to Sa’adiya Gaon, the head of the Babylonian Jewish community in the tenth century: “It is like a lock whose key is lost or a diamond too expensive to purchase.”¹ The double simile is odd, since we typically discard locks whose keys we have lost, and certainly do not consider them to be fine diamonds. Yet, it is a perfect description of the Song: Its magnificence is well recognized, yet it refuses to be unlocked (though many have claimed to have found its missing<br>

  Author(s) Pertile Lino<br>
  Abstract: In his treatise the
                  Monarchy, Dante argues against those who maintained that the foundation of faith consists in the traditions of the church. He distinguishes three stages in the history of Scripture: before the church (i.e. the Old and the New Testament), with the church (the early fathers), and after the church (thedecretales). In defining the first stage, the stageante Ecclesiam, Dante states that “this is what the Church says speaking to her bridegroom: ‘Draw me after thee.’ ”¹ The standard footnote tells us that this sentence—“Trahe me post te” in the Vulgate’s Latin—is a quotation<br>

  Author(s) HART KEVIN<br>
  Abstract: Imagine that someone knocks on your door and, when you open it, the man standing there says to you, “I have experienced God.” And imagine that you have walked down the hallway from the kitchen or the study with a remote in hand, a newfangled contraption with a special feature you have been dying to try out: a pause button that works with human beings. No sooner has that remarkable statement been uttered than you press the button: the man becomes a living statue, and you are left to ponder what has been said to you without having to respond.<br>

  Book Title: Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SULLIVAN LAWRENCE E.<br>
  Abstract: What has happened to religion in its present manifestations? In recent years, Enlightenment secularization, as it appeared in the global spread of political structures that relegate the sacred to a private sphere, seems suddenly to have foundered. Unexpectedly, it has discovered its own parochialism-has discovered, indeed, that secularization may never have taken place at all.With the return of the religious,in all aspects of contemporary social, political, and religious life, the question of political theology-of the relation between politicaland religiousdomains-takes on new meaning and new urgency. In this groundbreaking book, distinguished scholars from many disciplines-philosophy, political theory, anthropology, classics, and religious studies-seek to take the full measure of this question in today's world. This book begins with the place of the gods in the Greek polis, then moves through Augustine's two cities and early modern religious debates, to classic statements about political theology by such thinkers as Walter Benjamin and Carl Schmitt. Essays also consider the centrality of tolerance to liberal democracy, the recent French controversy over wearing the Muslim headscarf, and Bush's God talk.The volume includes a historic discussion between Jrgen Habermas and Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, concerningthe prepolitical moral foundations of a republic, and it concludes with explorations of new, more open ways of conceptualizing society.<br>

  Author(s) Voruz Véronique<br>
  Abstract: The separation of church and state is the French expression, linked to the dominant Catholic Church in that country, used to signify the complete differentiation between the laws [
                     droits] and powers of the religious order (whether ecclesiatical or constituted in another way) and the political order. In any civil or public matter, the political order is understood to prevail; whereas in any religious matter—henceforth considered to be private or having to do with an intimacy of conscience—the authority exercised is defined by a religious instance to which anyone is free to adhere.<br>

  Abstract: If, generally speaking, readers’ and writers’ attitudes toward the autobiographical genre can be characterized as naïve in that they take for granted the sincerity of the author, it is even harder for historians to be professionally effective without taking their products to be authentic reflections of time. There is a sense, however, in which histories of the state, histories of the church, and, indeed, histories of great institutions at large are so many contradictions in terms, at least if state and church are taken—as they are bound to be—to be bodies whose temporal existence transcends the moment, to<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x06k8">Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World</a><br>
  Author(s) Nguyen Anh<br>
  Abstract: The suggested theme for our discussion today is reminiscent of a question that Ernst Wolfgang Böckenförde, in the mid-1960s, succinctly put as follows: Is the liberal secular state nourished by normative preconditions that it cannot itself guarantee?¹ The question expresses doubt that the democratic constitutional state can renew the normative preconditions of its existence out of its own resources. It also voices the conjecture that the state is dependent upon autochthonous conceptual or religious traditions—in any case, collectively binding ethical traditions. Were the doubt substantiated and the conjecture proven true, the state would find itself in trouble, for it<br>

  Author(s) Brown Wendy<br>
  Abstract: In recent years, culture has become a cardinal object of tolerance and intolerance. This is not only because liberal democratic societies have become increasingly multicultural as a consequence of late-modern population flows and the affirmation of cultural difference over assimilation. It is also because political conflict has become, in Mahmood Mamdani’s phrase, “culturalized”: “It is no longer the market (capitalism), nor the state (democracy), but culture (modernity) that is said to be the dividing line between those in favor of a peaceful, civic existence and those inclined to terror.”¹ Mamdani credits Samuel Huntington and Bernard Lewis with conceptually catapulting culture<br>

  Laïcité, or the Politics of Republican Secularism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x06k8">Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World</a><br>
  Author(s) Valenta Markha G.<br>
  Abstract: Laïcité—the French version of secularism, which insists on the strict separation of church and state or, more generally, of politics and religion—has become well known internationally in the context of the March 2004 law prohibiting pupils at public schools from wearing “signes religieux ostensibles [conspicuous religious signs].”¹ Historically, however, it is important to view laïcité, in the context of the struggle between Catholicism and Republicanism during the first decades of the Third Republic (1870–1905). This contextualization will allow us to critique the use of laïcité, but also of secularism more generally, as a frame within which to<br>

  Author(s) Asad Talal<br>
  Abstract: In modern society there is typically a multiplicity of religious beliefs and identities, and—so we are told—they can be held together only by a formal separation between religious belonging and political status, and by the allocation of religious belief to the private sphere. To be fully part of a democratic community, citizens holding different religious beliefs (or none) must share values that enable them to have a common political life. These values reflect the unity of the state that represents them. Without shared values there can be no integration, without integration no political stability, without some measure of<br>

It is critical, then, to avoid the danger of the confusion resulting from “badly put or badly analyzed problems.” Philosophy, or at least its significance, stands or falls with the problems it is capable of setting up.

  Abstract: In the spring of 2003, the news came from the diocese of Helsingoer—Hamlet’s country, quite appropriately—that Thorkild Grosboell, a theologian and minister in the Lutheran Church of Denmark, was an atheist.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x06k8">Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World</a><br>
  Author(s) Schott Nils F.<br>
  Abstract: In his 1920 Oxford lecture “The Possible and the Real” (published in 1934 in
                  La Pensée et le mouvant, rather unhappily translated asThe Creative Mind¹), Bergson returns to a question of method: the importance of the position of problems in philosophy. Solutions, or answers to problems, are implied in the way in which problems are stated; they are their empirical results. It is critical, then, to avoid the danger of the confusion resulting from “badly put or badly analyzed problems.” Philosophy, or at least its significance, stands or falls with the problems it is capable of setting up.

  Author(s) Woods Fronza<br>
  Abstract: In the spring of 2003, the news came from the diocese of Helsingoer—Hamlet’s country, quite appropriately—that Thorkild Grosboell, a theologian and minister in the Lutheran Church of Denmark, was an atheist. The pastor later retracted, but the fact remains: he had publicly stated that he believed neither in God the creator of the world, nor in the resurrection of Christ, nor in the eternal life of the soul. Mr. Grosboell is my post-Christian hero. I sincerely hope that history will remember his name as that of a pioneer in a new kind of enlightenment. To see the existence<br>

  Abstract: It is, by now, almost a commonplace to state that “human rights” were invented in the eighteenth century.¹ Although it is not immediately clear what it might mean to say that a concept was “invented” at a particular moment in time (or over a particular stretch of time, say the eighteenth century), I shall leave this hanging since I want to begin with a more simple-minded examination of the validity of this statement.² If one searches the database of eighteenth-century printed materials in English (ECCO) for use of the term

  Abstract: In

No conciliation is possible” because the exclusion affirms the settlers and rejects the natives (Fanon,Wretched, 38–39). “At times,” he says, “this Manichaeism goes to its logical conclusion and dehumanizes the native, or to speak plainly, it turns him into an animal” (42).

  Abstract: Warm-up pitches can help us start.¹ I write in this paper as a philosopher of religion examining statements Royce made about intrafaith relationships. I use the term “intrafaith” to indicate the interpersonal relations between members of the world religions—Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, etc.² Then, too, in 1912 what Royce did
                  notknow about “the historical Jesus” contrasts sharply with today’s far more nuanced and subtle treatment of that topic. In addition, Royce used the term “Christian” in two senses, each determinable from its context. Sometimes he spoke of “Christian” in the narrow sense of a person baptized with<br>

  Author(s) Mahowald Mary B.<br>
  Abstract: As a philosophy graduate student in the 1960s, I was struck by the statement of Royce that his entire philosophy was encapsulated in his conception of community. Initially, my interest was sparked by the fact that I lived in a small community, and the term, as I understood it, identified an appealing ideal of how human beings in general might live or aspire to live together. I also thought, perhaps naively, that this ideal could be practically implemented, at least in part. So I wrote my dissertation on Royce, tracking how a pragmatic element intertwined with idealism in the development<br>

                  Science of Logic, Hegel refers to “the peculiar restlessness and distraction of our modern consciousness.”¹ Although the tone of this statement makes it sound like something to be avoided or at any rate minimized, a moment’s reflection tells us that for Hegel, it is one of modernity’s irreducible and most definitive components. Superficial though it may be, restlessness is nonetheless also the forerunner of negativity, what he calls elsewhere the “seriousness, the suffering, the patience and work of the negative.”² Finally, for Hegel, this restlessness is the active dimension without which<br>

  Abstract: Insofar as Western philosophy, like Christianity, begins with a scene of capital punishment—that of Socrates being sentenced and put to death—doesn’t it also have its beginnings in the death penalty? Derrida answers that philosophers from Kant to Levinas justify the death penalty and “just” wars on the basis of
                  lex talionis, which takes us back not only to its theological roots but also to the basis of sovereignty (2004, 146).¹ For the sake of protection by the state, citizens subject themselves to state sovereignty and grant to the state, and only to the state, the power to kill.<br>

  Abstract: I wish here to explore the relation between our desire to exist meaningfully through action and the question that this poses for philosophy. My thesis is simple: We are erotic beings. Our Eros, however, is neither divine nor animal. It is distinctively human: We are beings who seek meaning imaginatively through each other, and the locus of this transformative encounter is the community. This model of human nature contrasts with the dominant view in analytic philosophy of humans as “minds” consisting of “states,” as purely “epistemic subjects” whose primary function is thought to lie in generating propositional claims about the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0c0w">The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence</a><br>
  Abstract: It is more than an understatement to say that philosophy today is not associated with “spirituality.” Professional philosophers disdain the topic. Some may try to approach it with a philosophical method, analytic or phenomenological, that is not itself inherently spiritual but cognitive. Those philosophers writing within a spiritual tradition—for example, people like Søren Kierkegaard, Gabriel Marcel, Martin Buber, or D. T. Suzuki—are segregated as “religious thinkers” or, like Emmanuel Levinas, seen as leading double lives. Otherwise the term “spirituality” suggests the range of New Age nostrums seeking to fill the void left by abandoned faiths and vapid materialism.<br>

It broadened and expanded the first two laws of thermodynamics, which state the conservation of energy and the general tendency toward entropy, beyond the realm of physics, mechanics, and chemistry to the life sciences and even the social sciences and the humanities, as the title “The Energetic Foundations of Cultural Studies” (Die energetischen Grundlagen der Kulturwissenschaft) from 1909 suggests.¹ Ostwald introduces a “classification of pure sciences”² that differentiates between<br>

It is far from obvious, however, whether Kant’s efforts to develop a model of practical human autonomy are in any sense “clarified” by his statement that poetry “sets the imagination free.” A great deal of scholarship on Romanticism has relied, implicitly or explicitly, on the assumption of a substantive connection between creativity and liberty—if not their outright identity—but this position is rarely evaluated by trying to use it as a vantage point from<br>

  Book Title: Reading the Allegorical Intertext: Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: Judith H. Anderson conceives the intertext as a relation between or among texts that encompasses both Kristevan intertextuality and traditional relationships of influence, imitation, allusion, and citation. Like the Internet, the intertext is a state, or place, of potential expressed in ways ranging from deliberate emulation to linguistic free play. Relatedly, the intertext is also a convenient fiction that enables examination of individual agency and sociocultural determinism. Anderson's intertext is allegorical because Spenser's Faerie Queene is pivotal to her study and because allegory, understood as continued or moving metaphor, encapsulates, even as it magnifies, the process of signification. Her title signals the variousness of an intertext extending from Chaucer through Shakespeare to Milton and the breadth of allegory itself. Literary allegory, in Anderson's view, is at once a mimetic form and a psychic one-a process thinking that combines mind with matter, emblem with narrative, abstraction with history. Anderson's first section focuses on relations between Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Spenser's The Faerie Queene, including the role of the narrator, the nature of the textual source, the dynamics of influence, and the bearing of allegorical narrative on lyric vision. The second centers on agency and cultural influence in a variety of Spenserian and medieval texts. Allegorical form, a recurrent concern throughout, becomes the pressing issue of section three. This section treats plays and poems of Shakespeare and Milton and includes two intertextually relevant essays on Spenser.How Paradise Lost or Shakespeare's plays participate in allegorical form is controversial. Spenser's experiments with allegory revise its form, and this intervention is largely what Shakespeare and Milton find in his poetry and develop. Anderson's book, the result of decades of teaching and writing about allegory, especially Spenserian allegory, will reorient thinking about fundamental critical issues and the landmark texts in which they play themselves out.<br>

  Abstract: Harry Berger’s “Wring out the Old: Squeezing the Text, 1951–2001” will be a major critical statement on the Bower of Bliss for years to come, and serious work on the Bower needs to engage its generously annotated, tightly argued analysis of the structural discourse that constitutes this site.¹ In “Squeezing the Text” (is the trope laundry or lemon juice?), Berger exposes the workings of misogyny as a target, and emphatically not a given, of the Bower. He reads the Spenserian narrative as an instance of “
                  specular tautology,” or self-reflection, which he also understands as an inversion of cause and<br>

  CHAPTER 1  Storytelling in the Future: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0fd2">Written Voices, Spoken Signs</a><br>
  Abstract: The question whether the Greek epic tradition is a matter of truth or of fiction remains a central issue in Homeric scholarship, and any answer to it betrays one’s stance with regard to a host of other issues, such as text, tradition, and authorship. Opinions are divided as to whether the Homeric rendition of the heroic past is wholly traditional and so “objective,” or allows of fictional, “original” admixture by an individual poet. What is less often asked is whether the notion of truth itself, in the sense of an acknowledged correspondence between a statement and a state of affairs<br>

  Author(s) Berndt Jaqueline<br>
  Abstract: In recent years, graphic narratives¹ in general and manga in particular have attracted critical attention from a variety of fields, including media and globalization research as well as Japanese, gender, and ethnic studies. This broadening of topic-oriented interest usually leads to two lines of contestation, one pertaining to manga-specific expertise and the other to culturally divergent mediascapes as contexts of productions and use. Taking a typical case of discordance—the ethnic identity of manga characters—opinions differ notoriously as to whether mangaesque faces and physiques are to be regarded as “stateless” (

  Book Title: Value and Values-Economics and Justice in an Age of Global Interdependence<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Hershock Peter D.<br>
  Abstract: The most pressing issues of the twenty-first century-climate change and persistent hunger in a world of food surpluses, to name only two-are not problems that can be solved from within individual disciplines, nation-states, or cultural perspectives. They are predicaments that can only be resolved by generating sustained and globally robust coordination across value systems. The scale of the problems and necessity for coordinated global solutions signal a world historical transit as momentous as the Industrial Revolution: a transition from the predominance of technical knowledge to that of ethical deliberation. This volume brings together leading thinkers from around the world to deliberate on how best to correlate worth (value) with what is worthwhile (values), pairing human prosperity with personal, environmental, and spiritual flourishing in a world of differing visions of what constitutes a moral life.<br>

  Abstract: “Is there a common value judgment for the cultures of different nations?”¹ So questioned the twentieth-century Japanese philosopher Nishida Kitarō. In the wake of global imperialism and expansionism in the latter half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century, myriad nascent nation-states sought to create/integrate their indigenous traditions into the new world order, thereby necessarily shaping/reshaping it, as well as to situate themselves in the perceived existing hierarchy of nations. Accordingly, among Japanese intellectuals in the 1930s, such as Nishida Kitarō, Watsuji Tetsurō, Kuki Shuzō, Miki Kiyoshi, and Ienaga Saburo, the issues of value and<br>

  Abstract: Developments in science, medicine, technology, and national economies have rapidly resulted in aging societies in both developed and developing countries around the world. The increasingly large number of elderly people has caused various problems to the political and economic systems of societies, including family structure, ethical relationships, lifestyles, and values, as well as to the emotional state of their members. Neither the spontaneous capitalistic market nor a state welfare system can easily resolve these issues. In a modern market economy ruled by the logic of capital and profit, elderly people, who, usually unemployed, are considered mere consumers, thus present a<br>

  Book Title: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan-Modernity, Loss, and the Doing of History<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Karlin Jason G.<br>
  Abstract: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan is a historical analysis of the discourses of nostalgia in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japan. Through an analysis of the experience of rapid social change in Japan’s modernization, it argues that fads (ryūkō) and the desires they express are central to understanding Japanese modernity, conceptions of gender, and discourses of nationalism. In doing so, the author uncovers the myth of eternal return that lurks below the surface of Japanese history as an expression of the desire to find meaning amid the chaos and alienation of modern times. The Meiji period (1868–1912) was one of rapid change that hastened the process of forgetting: The state’s aggressive program of modernization required the repression of history and memory. However, repression merely produced new forms of desire seeking a return to the past, with the result that competing or alternative conceptions of the nation haunted the history of modern Japan. Rooted in the belief that the nation was a natural and organic entity that predated the rational, modern state, such conceptions often were responses to modernity that envisioned the nation in opposition to the modern state. What these visions of the nation shared was the ironic desire to overcome the modern condition by seeking the timeless past. While the condition of their repression was often linked to the modernizing policies of the Meiji state, the means for imagining the nation in opposition to the state required the construction of new symbols that claimed the authority of history and appealed to a rearticulated tradition. Through the idiom of gender and nation, new reified representations of continuity, timelessness, and history were fashioned to compensate for the unmooring of inherited practices from the shared locales of everyday life. This book examines the intellectual, social, and cultural factors that contributed to the rapid spread of Western tastes and styles, along with the backlash against Westernization that was expressed as a longing for the past. By focusing on the expressions of these desires in popular culture and media texts, it reveals how the conflation of mother, countryside, everyday life, and history structured representations to naturalize ideologies of gender and nationalism.<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x1k9w">Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan</a><br>
  Abstract: After an initial period of euphoria, the establishment of the Meiji state in 1868 gave way to the sentiment that the revolution was a betrayal. At the root of this sense of betrayal was the contradiction between the elitism of the Meiji oligarchy and the expectation of popular political participation. E. H. Norman described the Meiji Restoration as an “incomplete revolution” owing to the persistence of “feudal remnants” that enabled the ruling class to manipulate the masses through traditional appeals.¹ In general, the susceptibility of the masses to manipulation by the state has been central to interpretations of the failure<br>

  CONCLUSION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x1k9w">Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan</a><br>
  Abstract: I began this book by considering how the Meiji Restoration had nurtured the sentiment that the revolution was incomplete. The calls to action that adhered around the notion of the “incomplete Restoration” in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were (re)productive of the myth of the Meiji Restoration. For both the state and its critics, revolutionary action was legitimized by invoking the Restoration: the state pursued the modernization of all aspects of social life, denouncing customs and practices incompatible with its ideology of progress as backward and barbarous, while its opponents condemned the state for its decadence and superficiality arising from<br>

  Abstract: Before being executed in 1864, Ch’oe Che-u, the founder of Tonghak, described the state of people’s affairs in Korea by declaring that “people’s minds were all confused and they did not know what to do.”¹ Many Koreans at that time attributed their “confused” conditions to the weakening of the Confucian political order. In large part, the breakdown of the Confucian order stemmed from the gradual decline of the Chosŏn state (1392–1910) during the nineteenth century, a period when the government showed signs of failing to live up to its role as the benevolent Confucian leader that provided for the<br>

Sekiya Teizaburo, the education director in the colonial government, declared that “the fundamental principle of Korean education, stated in a word, is to bring up the Koreans as citizens or subjects of the Japa nese empire. . . .

  Abstract: How do mobile media technologies shape the identities of city dwellers? In Indonesia the mobile phone – or
                  handphone– has rapidly gained in popularity (Figure 1). Reasons include the lagging state of fixed telephony in homes; its affordability even for low-income people; and omnipresent branding that induces an acute sense of “must have”. Most importantly and central in this chapter, mobile phones offer urban Indonesians rich opportunities for identity construction and expression. In this chapter, I look at how mobile media shape the construction and performance of identities that are specific to life in Indonesia’s capital city, Jakarta. Jakarta is both<br>

  Abstract: How do mobile media technologies shape the identities of city dwellers? In Indonesia the mobile phone – or
                  handphone– has rapidly gained in popularity (Figure 1). Reasons include the lagging state of fixed telephony in homes; its affordability even for low-income people; and omnipresent branding that induces an acute sense of “must have”. Most importantly and central in this chapter, mobile phones offer urban Indonesians rich opportunities for identity construction and expression. In this chapter, I look at how mobile media shape the construction and performance of identities that are specific to life in Indonesia’s capital city, Jakarta. Jakarta is both<br>

  Abstract: Years ago, I was hitching with a friend on a Buginese fishing boat from Sulawesi to the island of Lembata in eastern Indonesia. One late afternoon, when the sun was at its lowest, we had spotted a whale rising up from the waters within yards before us—so close and unexpected as to almost become unreal. Dolphins regularly accompanied our boat, and the sea stretched out with nothing in sight save some deserted islands scattered here and there. It was exactly one year before the great flood devastated eastern Flores, wiping away several islands in the Flores Sea. Now, however,<br>

  Abstract: Most current talk of forgiveness and reconciliation in the aftermath of collective violence proceeds from an assumption that forgiveness is always superior to resentment and refusal to forgive. Victims who demonstrate a willingness to forgive are often celebrated as virtuous moral models, while those who refuse to forgive are frequently seen as suffering from a pathology. Resentment is viewed as a negative state, held by victims who are not "ready" or "capable" of forgiving and healing.<br>

  Book Title: Intention Interpretation-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): ISEMINGER GARY<br>
  Abstract: "...an excellent and comprehensive discussion of a debate that was initiated in this century in William Wimsatt's and Monroe C. Beardsley's influential article 'The Intentional Fallacy.'...this is a splendidly conceived and very useful collection of essays. Readers will want to take issue with the arguments of individual authors, but this is to be expected in a volume at the cutting edge of a fertile philosophical controversy." --David Novitz, The Philosophical Quarterly "What is the connection, if any, between the author's intentions in (while) writing a work of literature and the truth (acceptability, validity) of interpretive statements about it?" With this question, Gary Isminger introduces a literary debate that has been waged for the past four decades and is addressed by philosophers and literary theorists in Intention and Interpretation. Thirteen essays discuss the role of appeals to the author's intention in interpreting works of literature. A well-known argument by E.D. Hirsch serves as the basic text, in which he defends the appeal to the author's intention against Wimsatt and Beardsley's claim that such an appeal involved "the intentional fallacy." The essays, mostly commissioned by the editor, explore the presuppositions and consequences of arguing for the importance of the author's intentions in the way Hirsch does. Connections emerge between this issue and many fundamental issues in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind as well as in aesthetics. The (old) "New Criticism" and current Post-Structuralism tend to agree in disenfranchising the author, and many people now are disinclined even to consider the alternative. Hirsch demurs, and arguments like his deserve the careful attention, both from critics and sympathizers, that they receive here. Literary scholars and philosophers who are sympathetic to Continental as well as to Anglo-American styles of philosophy are among the contributors. "This is a timely book appearing as it does when postmodernist views of the death of the author are disappearing quickly from the scene. As a collection it exemplifies the best work that is being done on this problem at the moment, and it will no doubt inspire further debate." --The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism "[T]his volume contains important articles illuminating the central debate over the role and relevance of authorial intentions in literary interoperation." --British Journal of Aesthetics<br>

  Author(s) BEARDSLEY MONROE C.<br>
  Abstract: The first thing required to make criticism possible is an object to be criticized—something for the critic to interpret and to judge. with its own properties against which interpretations and judgments can be checked. The Principle of Independence. as it might be called. is that literary works exist as individuals and can be distinguished from other things. though it is another question whether they enjoy some special mode of existence. as has been held. I think everyone must agree on this first postulate—here rather roughly stated. But there is another postulate that is logically complementary to the first:<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14bsxmk">Hegemony</a><br>
  Abstract: In mainstream theories of world politics, the workings of political power are usually seen as a historical constant. They share the view expressed so clearly by Paul Ricoeur that “power does not have much of a history.”¹ At the same time, political power is overwhelmingly associated with “the modern state,” to which all states are supposed to correspond, but which is usually a version of France, England, or the United States regarded as a unitary actor equivalent to an individual person. Political power is envisioned in terms of units of territorial sovereignty (at least for the so-called Great Powers) that<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14bsxmk">Hegemony</a><br>
  Abstract: “Globalization” is one of the premier buzz words of the early twenty-first century. In its most general usage it refers to the idea of a world increasingly stretched, shrunk, connected, interwoven, integrated, interdependent, or less territorially divided economically and culturally among national states. It is most frequently seen as an economic-technological process of time-space compression, as a social modernization of increased cultural homogeneity previously national in character scaled up to the world as a whole, or as shorthand for the practices of economic liberalism spontaneously adopted by governments the world over.¹ I do not want to deny the truth in<br>

  Abstract: The terms “globalization” and “imperialism” signify two features of contemporary world politics that are regarded as antagonistic to each other. The former stands for a seemingly autonomous process of globe shrinking or stretching (depending on how you look at it), whereas the latter indicates a self-conscious extraction and movement of profit from some places to others through political domination and coercion more than economic rationality. If advocates of the first tend to have a postmodern, depoliticized view of the world, those of the latter tend to have a profoundly modernist geopolitical view in which dominant states (above all, the United<br>

It is perhaps counterintuitive for joy to occupy a central place in a Christian theology, or at least in a theology capable of taking seriously the state of the world in which we live. Have not the masters of suspicion sufficiently warned theologians away from commending religious sentiments that, in their spiritual purity, distract their subjects from the material situation of life and issue in a total flight from the world? Did not the manifold tragedies of the mid-twentieth century disabuse theologians once and for all of their Pollyanna-ish penchant for progress, their sure confidence<br>

  Book Title: The Executed God-The Way of the Cross in Lockdown America<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Taylor Mark Lewis<br>
  Abstract: The new edition of Mark Lewis Taylor’s award-winning The Executed God is both a searing indictment of the structures of “Lockdown America" and a visionary statement of hope. It is also a call for action to Jesus followers to resist US imperial projects and power. Outlining a “theatrics of state terror," Taylor identifies and analyzes its instruments—mass incarceration, militarized police tactics, surveillance, torture, immigrant repression, and capital punishment—through which a racist and corporatized Lockdown America enforces in the US a global neoliberal economic and political imperialism. Against this, The Executed God proposes a “counter-theatrics to state terror," a declamation of the way of the cross for Jesus followers that unmasks the powers of US state domination and enacts an adversarial politics of resistance, artful dramatic actions, and the building of peoples’ movements. These are all intrinsic to a Christian politics of remembrance of the Jesus executed by empire. Heralded in its first edition, this new edition is thoroughly revised, updated, and expanded, offering a demanding rethinking and recreating of what being a Christian is and of how Christianity should dream, hope, mobilize, and act to bring about what Taylor terms “a liberating material spirituality" to unseat the state that kills.<br>

  Abstract: “We are trapped in the jaws of something shaking the life out of us.” With these words from his historical novel,
                  Philadelphia Fire, John Edgar Wideman conveys a sense of what it means to be caught out on stage, vulnerable at the point of having one’s life taken, shaken out, by what I have term “the theatrics of state terror.” Wideman’s discernment carries rage and lament. It is full of frustration and fear. There is consternation and a vexed wrestling with the entrapping “jaws” that belong … well, to “something.” State terror’s theatrics are like that, unleashing forces that brutalize<br>

  2.  Theatrics and Sacrifice in the U.S.-Led Imperium from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155j3fk">The Executed God</a><br>
  Abstract: The overall argument of this chapter is that the state terror that targets poor communities
                  withinthe United States, and racialized ones in particular,¹ is also part of the U.S. state’s pursuit of aglobalsovereignty. The U.S. deploys abroad both “soft power” (cultural influences and ideologies of U.S. “American exceptionalism”) as well as the brutal economic policies of neoliberal capitalism. These ways of pursuing global sovereignty are regularly supported by the threat or actuality of the terrors of overt or covert war.

  Abstract: Howard Thurman, in

Crucial to this technique is what Thurman points to as the “vital content” of the concept of love for the enemy. This can seem ludicrous. What force might any such concept of love have today given the opposition we face from Lockdown America, sustained by its histories of indigenous genocide, institution of chattel slavery, and by its global domination of Latin American, African,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155j3fk">The Executed God</a><br>
  Abstract: Building people’s movements amid and against Lockdown America also includes organizing against the U.S. death penalty, which at the federal and state levels assigns death as penalty for over 60 crimes.¹ Opposing it is surely no more important than the demilitarizing of policing in the U.S. or decarcerating the nation, which I have discussed in the previous chapter. Nevertheless, work against the death penalty is no mere add-on, some “extra-issue” to be raised.

  Abstract: There are only two possibilities: either one understands 1 Corinthians 1–2—that is, to put it in a concentrated way: the word of the cross (1 Cor. 1:18)—as the center of the Christian faith, or one does not understand 1 Corinthians 1–2 as the center of it.¹ Such a claim may seem trivial, as if one were saying: there are only two possibilities, either 1+2=3 or 1+2≠3.

To the question of her personal relation to God, Cixous describes herself as ‘religiously atheistic’ (O’Grady, 1996–97). The statements that frame this disclosure, however, provide a context in which to read just what it is that she is implicitly distancing herself from and, more importantly, what it might be within religious discourses with which in practice she aligns herself.

  Book Title: Britain and Africa Under Blair-In pursuit of the good state<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gallagher Julia<br>
  Abstract: Africa was a key focus of Britain’s foreign policy under Tony Blair. Military intervention in Sierra Leone, increases in aid and debt relief, and grand initiatives such as the Commission for Africa established the continent as a place in which Britain could ‘do good’. Britain and Africa under Blair: in pursuit of the good state critically explores Britain’s fascination with Africa. It argues that, under New Labour, Africa represented an area of policy that appeared to transcend politics. Gradually, it came to embody an ideal state activity around which politicians, officials and the wider public could coalesce, leaving behind more contentious domestic and international issues. Building on the story of Britain and Africa under Blair, the book draws wider conclusions about the role of ‘good’ and idealism in foreign policy. In particular, it discusses how international relationships provide opportunities to create and pursue ideals, and why they are essential for the wellbeing of political communities. It argues that state actors project the idea of ‘good’ onto idealised, distant objects, in order to restore a sense of the ‘good state’. The book makes a distinctive and original contribution to debates about the role of ethics in international relations and will be of particular interest to academics, policy-makers and students of international relations, Africa and British foreign policy, and to anyone interested in ethics in international affairs.<br>

  Abstract: I discussed two ways of expressing and realising the idea of good in Chapter 3 – the transcendental and transformative – both of which have found expression in the imagination of Africa and Britain’s relationships and role there. Historically, these have been expressed directly in relation to religion. Wilberforce and Buxton explicitly tried to recapture a religious idea of the good and relate it to the British state: the ‘happy state of a truly Christian nation’ (Wilberforce, 1958: 119). Chamberlain and Lugard, neither of them religious men, made explicit references to the idea that a replacement for dwindling religious feeling<br>

  Abstract: This chapter examines what Africa means to actors clustered around the state: MPs, officials and those working with them during the Blair era. I start out with some basic questions: How is British policy in Africa different from policy in other parts of the world? Why does Britain engage in it? What do the actors involved get out of it? Public sources gave clues: speeches, papers and initiatives from the government, and MPs directly interested or engaged in work in Africa suggested a number of themes which were pursued in interviews.<br>

  7  The good state from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jct4">Britain and Africa Under Blair</a><br>
  Abstract: This book has been about the way in which Britain under New Labour ‘did good’ in Africa as a way of creating a central core of ideal activity for the state. The themes and approaches contained within this trend were not new, but drew on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century ideas about the continent and Britain’s role there. I have suggested that the creation of a good project formed an important part of protecting the state from internal ambiguity and decay, by creating a utopian core at the heart of what it does.<br>

  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): Munro Martin<br>
  Abstract: In
         Tropical Apocalypse,Martin Munro argues that since the earliest days of European colonization, Caribbean-and especially Haitian-history has been shaped by apocalyptic events so that the region has, in effect, been living for centuries in an end time without end. By engaging with the contemporary apocalyptic turn in Caribbean studies and lived reality, he not only provides important historical contextualization for a general understanding of apocalypse in the region but also offers an account of the state of Haitian society and culture in the decades before the 2010 earthquake. Inherently interdisciplinary, his work ranges widely through Caribbean and Haitian thought, historiography, political discourse, literature, film, religion, and ecocriticism in its exploration of whether culture in these various forms can shape the future of a country.<br>

In the modernist language of mainstream ecology, things spin out of control, beyond steady states and tipping points. While some of these events may be less surprising than they used to be, they often pose spectacular problems for human society and, as a result, demand close attention and concerted action.

  Abstract: Was World War II a radical break in French Jewish history—a turning point in notions of community, identity, and political expression—or did the restoration of Jewish citizenship and the Fourth Republic’s promise to protect and defend all citizens regardless of religion or ethnic origin allow long-standing patterns of Jewish identification to reinstate themselves? This chapter will address this question by turning to an aspect of Jewish communal life that transcended the pre- and postwar years—that of how to integrate incoming Jewish refugees and immigrants into communal institutions and French society more broadly.

  Abstract: Recent studies about Jews in postwar France have shown that, for the most part, the newly reestablished republican state treated Jewish citizens in much the same way that they had been treated in the Third Republic, and indeed, in all French regimes since Napoleon. That is, Jews were not singled out for special treatment but were rather considered citizens indistinguishable from their fellow Frenchmen. For Jews, this reestablishment of republicanism was a “liberation” indeed, since it signaled an end to the anti-Semitic persecution of the war years.

Their particular vulnerability, and correspondingly the special duty of care toward them expected of state and community assistance organs, betoken a much bigger ethical picture than their apparently very spatially singular and temporally limited situation might at first suggest. It is an ethical picture that, albeit in inflected form, globally permeates various different geopolitical configurations today.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter contextualizes the claim that French Jews emerged from World War II with a sense of disenchantment with the republican tradition by presenting the opposite case, that of a man whose republican commitment was unshakable and indeed deepened by the war and the Shoah. René Cassin, jurist, international statesman, and one of the authors of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, never lost his faith in the republican project at home and abroad. From 1940 on, he worked to revitalize that tradition, not to discard or refashion it.¹<br>

We’re a pragmatic people; we’re practical people; we’re concerned about how to do things and how to act. In fact, pragmatism as a philosophy argues that theorizing follows action. Whereas classical Western wisdom stresses the thinking first and only thereupon the action that follows, Americans are very strong on action, and when it comes to defining religion, we tend to divide religions according to how they influence people’s behavior.

The first concludes with the statement, ‘These are the generations (

  Abstract: China has been a challenge to Christianity since the beginning of modern times and it remains so today. Here is a great civilisation comprising a quarter of humankind, yet largely untouched by Christian values and beliefs. Any theological evaluation of the state of world Christianity that does not take China into account is impoverished and radically incomplete.<br>

  Schillebeeckx’s Theological Method and Religious Pluralism in Asia from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt163t8h5">From North to South</a><br>
  Author(s) Chia Edmund Kee-Fook<br>
  Abstract: My focus in this chapter will be on the theological method of Edward Schillebeeckx. I will examine Schillebeeckx’s method in order to discover how it may assist in appreciating Asian theologies of religious pluralism. I am exploring the latter on account of my Asian origins as well as my involvement in the ministry of interreligious dialogue. I state this at the outset not so much to establish my credentials but in order to take seriously Schillebeeckx’s assertion that theology needs to begin with experience. For him, theology must evolve from the concrete, personal and contemporary experience of the theologian. To<br>

  Abstract: As I begin to offer a reading of one of the most famous stories of early Christianity, that of the encounter over water between Jesus and the Samaritan woman, two potent realities stand before Australians. The first is the ongoing issue of sale by tender of a large cotton farm, Cubbie station, which is in southern Queensland. The second is a report into the state of the freshwater breeding ground for pelicans on the Coorong waterways in south-eastern South Australia (a stretch of water made famous by the book and film called ‘Storm Boy’).<br>

  Book Title: Child Sexual Abuse, Society, and the Future of the Church-  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Regan Hilary D<br>
  Abstract: In November 2012 the Australian federal government announced the establishment of a ‘Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse’. This Royal Commission was set up after many years of reports of sexual abuse in Australia within religious institutions of various Christian churches, some state government inquiries and in the context of inquiries in other countries, most notably Ireland. The Royal Commission began its first hearing in April 2013. It has been forecast that the Commission will be hearing submissions for a number of years from witnesses, both from those who ask to speak to the Royal Commissioners and from those who will be asked to appear before the Commission. At the same time as the establishment of the Royal Commission, the Catholic Church in Australia established a Truth, Justice and healing Council to oversee the Catholic Church’s engagement with the Royal Commission. This collection brings together essays from biblical scholars, a church historian, theologians, ministers of religion from a number of churches, lawyers and a psychologist. They each address the issues of sexual abuse, society and the church in the context of the Australian inquiries. The volume ends with an overview of the processes engaged with by the Catholic Church and the State in the Republic of Ireland and reactions to these inquiries. The volume of essays considers sexual abuse from the perspective of the victims. What is to be done about the mess we are in over clerical sexual abuse? That question is puzzling concerned people today. This diverse collection offers them profitable reading, wherever they are coming from. It has enough useful suggestions and ideas to stimulate the calm, intelligent discussion now demanded by our communities.’ Edmund Campion, Australian Catholic University.<br>

  Author(s) Mulvihill Michelle<br>
  Abstract: Growing up in the late 1950s in country New South Wales, one of the larger states in Australia, was like living in an episode of the TV show, ‘Heartbeat’. Our family home was always full of priests; well, that’s how it seemed to me as a child, at least. Every Sunday five or six baby-faced, white, Irish Catholic boy-priests, all dressed in black suits and dog collars, would sit at our dining room table for lunch, along with Dad, Mum and my three siblings. There was no housekeeper at the bishop’s house on a Sunday so they were left to<br>

  Author(s) Treacy Bernard<br>
  Abstract: The Catholic Church in the Republic of Ireland would seem to be the most closely investigated of all the entities that make up the Catholic Church worldwide. Over a period of just over ten years, many of its dioceses, religious orders, and child-care institutions have been closely examined in reports issued by judicially-lead teams appointed by the state. Most of these investigations arose in response to information uncovered and published in some pioneering television programmes.<br>

  Abstract: Theodore Gericault’s Romantic era painting
                     Le Radeau de la Méduse(1816) shows a group of castaways desperately clinging to a raft in the midst of chaotic seas. The contrast between some castaways in a state of deep despair and other castaways frantically trying to hail what might be a passing ship in the far distance is a fitting image for the combination of despair and hope within Rorty’s appeal to “human beings clinging together against the dark.”¹<br>

  Book Title: Thou Shalt Not Kill: A Political and Theological Dialogue-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sitze Adam<br>
  Abstract: In this fascinating and rare little book, a leading Italian feminist philosopher and the Archbishop of Milan face off over the contemporary meaning of the biblical commandment not to kill. The result is a series of erudite and wide-ranging arguments that move from murder and suicide to just war and drone strikes, from bioethics and biopolitics to hermeneutics and philology, from Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer to Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault, from Torah and Scripture to art and literature, from the essence of human dignity and the paradoxes of fratricide to engagements with Levinasian ethics. Less a direct debate than a disputation in the classical sense, Thou Shalt Not Kill proves to be a searching meditation on one of the unstated moral premises shared by otherwise bitterly opposed political factions. It will stimulate the mind of the novice while also reminding more advanced readers of the necessity and desirability of thinking in the present.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16f8cb0">Thou Shalt Not Kill: A Political and Theological Dialogue</a><br>
  Abstract: This introductory framework should suffice to demonstrate that the very concept of “commandment,” when linked to the precepts of the Decalogue, requires a clarification that restates the authentic law. If we are to grasp the meanings of moral law in its actual cultural context, we cannot possibly trust some sort of common sense without immediately getting lost in a maze of multiple misunderstandings and contradictions. We will have to find ways to peel off the sedimented crust formed by the usual meanings and to strip ambiguity from the very debates that should have critically illuminated the problems.<br>

Born not of woman but created by God on the sixth day, Adam and Eve live in the Garden of Eden in a state that knows no sorrow, no toil, and, above all, no death. Already freed from the human condition of being born an infant, Edenic humanity is also missing the fundamental characteristic recognized as human by nearly all cultures: mortality.

  Abstract: Power relations inherent in the encounter between anthropologist and informant engaged the advocates of reflexive anthropology working in Morocco (Crapanzano 1980; K. Dwyer 1982; Rabinow 2007 [1977]). Their analyses have reconfigured the practice and writing of ethnography over the last three decades. Questions of truth, disclosure, and suspicion shape not only anthropologists’ relationships in the field, but also the data that can be collected and the forms in which it can be presented to outsiders.

Curious because it portrays anthropology as an improvable, developmental discipline, in spite of Bourdieu’s critique several pages earlier of the “positivist conception<br>

Villagers expect to have children, pity those who do not, ask about having them, pray to have them, and consider any equivocation about the desirability of parenthood to be a weird misunderstanding or a form of mental illness.

Within philosophy, phenomenology is as diverse as its practitioners. Indeed, Moran (2000: 3) in an introduction to philosophical traditions of phenomenology finds it important to warn readers not to overstate the degree to which phenomenology “coheres into an agreed method, or accepts one theoretical outlook, or one set of philosophical theses about consciousness, knowledge, and the world.” Some of this diversity continues to be a feature of anthropological uses of phenomenology, as we show here.

  Abstract: Responding to the atrocities of the Holocaust, the critical theorist Theodor Adorno declares in a 1966 radio interview that “the premier demand upon all education is that Auschwitz not happen again.”¹ A provocative statement, it is also revealing. His directive connects him to Emmanuel Levinas insofar as each presents education as that which will—and must—mitigate the possibility of evil that surrounds us. In so doing it also betrays the spectacular failure of education to humanize us in spite of its promise to do so. The aim of this book is to trace Levinas’s philosophical project, which describes a<br>

                  On Escape,a statement that could be easily dismissed as a passing swipe at the eighteenth-century thinker.¹ No doubt, Levinas would have ambivalent feelings about Rousseau, whose philosophy is often cited as influential in the French Revolution and the development of the French Republic. Yet, Levinas’s stab at Rousseau’s emphasis on self-sufficiency is not simply a throwaway line; self-sufficiency lies at the heart of a humanism that would develop out of modernity and to which Levinas offers a sustained response. In short, “self-sufficiency” sums up everything that<br>

This misunderstanding has several roots. One is the intrinsic difficulty of grasping Hegel’s thought. It is dense, technical, dialectical, and arranged in such a way that, to understand anything in it, one has to understanding its linkage with the whole system of thought.

  7  Did God Abandon Jesus? from:

  Abstract: Modern theology has focused upon the last words of Christ in Mark 15:34—“My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?”—as a key locus of Christological dispute and interpretation.¹ Revisionist Enlightenment historians such as Reimarus have perceived in this verse an “authentic saying” of Jesus that predates the redaction of the Gospels. For him it is the indication of the Nazarene’s disillusioned apocalypticism.² Protestant theologians, meanwhile, have found warrant in this Scriptural text for a theology of Christ’s “god-forsakenness” experienced for us as a dimension of redemption. For Calvin it indicates Christ’s state of abandonment as an “experience<br>

My own opinion, as stated in my study of Galilee and the Gospels, is as follows: “The fact that Galilee enters the ironic patterns that the author (John) seeks to develop, shows just how important the memories associated with the region were to Christian self-understanding, even when there is no concern to develop a realistic narrative of that setting” (Freyne 1988, 131–32).

  Abstract: Happiness is in short supply in

At the beginning of the main body of his book, Robert Burton (1577–1640) reminds us that, before the Fall, humankind was ‘pure, divine, perfect, happy’ (vol. 1, p. 121). All this was lost with the advent of sin. A state of permanent discontent took its place, which, in the broadest sense of the word, is what constitutes melancholy:<br>

  Abstract: Emotions-based commentary on early modern literature, and Shakespeare in particular, may suffer from a reductiveness due to reluctance to reflect multiple emotional states present simultaneously, either within an individual as ‘mixed emotions’, or between different characters often listening ‘at cross purposes’, or between characters and the audience (‘dramatic irony’). This perceived deficiency arguably stems from three basic assumptions that can be challenged. First, there has been recently an emphasis on the physiological approach to emotions, which suggests that early modern theory analysed feelings as primarily stemming from the body.¹ In general terms this approach is clearly justifiable in the light<br>

  Author(s) Šimkunas Vidmantas<br>
  Abstract: One way to understand the Roman Catholic Church in Lithuania during the period of Soviet oppression is through a historical-theological lens. This approach begins with the position, restated in the Second Vatican Council document
                     Lumen Gentium, that the Church is not just a social institution but also “a kind of sacrament or sign of intimate union with God, and of the unity of all humankind.” Because the Church lives this sacramentality in history, a full interpretation of that life must be sensitive to both the historical and the theological dimensions of its existence.<br>

  Author(s) Posner David M.<br>
  Abstract: In his brief essay “De la liberté de conscience,”¹ Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) holds up as his hero the fourth-century Roman emperor Julian, surnamed by later (hostile) generations the Apostate. Julian (331–361/363 ce) was so labeled for having abandoned, upon becoming emperor, the Christian faith in which he was raised, and further for restoring paganism to the empire, thereby disestablishing Christianity as the empire’s official religion. This caused Saint Augustine to make of Julian one of the principal villains in his

  Author(s) Powell Russell<br>
  Abstract: Considering the role of democracy in the United States, Peru, Lithuania, and Indonesia presents opportunities for comparing the influence of culture and dominant religion on the development of political and legal systems. In particular, it invites inquiry into similarities and distinctions between predominantly Muslim societies and predominantly Christian or Catholic societies in their approaches to democracy. Examining the role of Islam in Turkish law and politics as a comparative example, this chapter explores approaches to reconciling religious identity with legal secularism (the mechanism states use to insulate themselves from religious influence) in liberal democracies.<br>

  Author(s) Beltrán María Soledad Escalante<br>
  Abstract: The goal of this chapter is to offer a brief overview of the relationship between the Roman Catholic Church and the Peruvian state in the modern era. This will include a discussion of church-state relations prior to the Second Vatican Council of the Roman Catholic Church (1962–1965) and an analysis of two key periods during and after the Council: 1958–1977 and 1978–1980.

  Abstract: Observers of the complex relationship between church and state have noted throughout history that religious activity seems greater where religion is more free from state regulation.¹ Yet it is only recently that social scientists began systematically working out the mechanisms by which varying levels of church-state separation have contributed to enhanced religious vitality and religiously based political activism, most notably in support for transitions toward democracy. Indeed, the last quarter century has been marked by an increase in scholarship exploring the role and compatibility of various religious traditions with the spread and consolidation of democratic practices. Such research has included<br>

  Author(s) Ingram David<br>
  Abstract: On January 19, 2004, world-renowned German political theorist Jürgen Habermas met with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) to discuss religion as one of the cultural foundations of the democratic state.¹ Two points of convergence emerged from their discussion. First, both agreed that reason alone cannot sustain respect for individual dignity and the common good without more substantive faith commitments. Second, they agreed that these values, however complementary they might be philosophically, are difficult to harmonize in practice. Agreeing on policies that respect the right of each to pursue his or her own conception of the good appears all<br>

  Abstract: In Brazil, the history of video games began in the 1980s when the first video game appeared on store shelves. According to Chiado (2011, 26), the first Atari VCS (1977), “half mounted and half manufactured in Sao Paulo,” reached stores in April 1980. Joseph Maghrabi, a 1980s entrepreneur, was instrumental in bringing video games to Brazil and created Channel 3, a pioneering club that manufactured game cartridges.

  Author(s): PARKIN DAVID<br>
  Abstract: William C. Olsen, Walter E. A. van Beek, and the contributors to this volume seek to understand how Africans have confronted evil around them. Grouped around notions of evil as a cognitive or experiential problem, evil as malevolent process, and evil as an inversion of justice, these essays investigate what can be accepted and what must be condemned in order to evaluate being and morality in African cultural and social contexts. These studies of evil entanglements take local and national histories and identities into account, including state politics and civil war, religious practices, Islam, gender, and modernity.<br>

  Abstract: While few cultural anthropologists practicing today would be willing to label culturally bound human behaviors as “evil,” many apply this label to the gruesome individual and collective acts that constituted the 1994 genocide of Tutsis, politically moderate Hutus, and others defined as an “enemy of the state.” Because evil, conceived of as the opposite of good, is defined by a moral system, its application in a particular context involves moral judgment and violates the principle of cultural relativism, which lies at the heart of anthropology. Furthermore, on the continent of Africa, the concept of evil is inextricably tied up in<br>

  Abstract: The paradox of silence in literature has forever intrigued writers and philosophers. Among the many different types of silence, Beckett refers to the silence of what is being invoked indirectly, but not said explicitly, that is, the silence between phrases that we can hear in the intervals of a statement. This is a deeply literary silence not only because poetic language is generated by modes of indirection but also because, almost paradoxically, it is often this silence in the interstices of language that breathes life into literature, endowing it with the ability to engage readers with the limits of what<br>

  Abstract: In all societies, there are differences in power between persons. There is not a single society where all adults have exactly the same influence over every decision, where everyone has exactly the same rights and duties. Social differentiation and inequality are, in other words, universal phenomena. The European ideas of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries about the ‘original primitive society’, where all humans supposedly had the same rank and were political equals, was completely devastated when the first professional ethnographers returned from the field. Even among very small groups, and even among peoples with very simple technology, differences in rank<br>

It has been noted for decades that the ethnographic present, the tense conventionally used when anthropologists talk about different societies, is increasingly, and more and more rapidly, becoming a past tense. In Australia, 250 languages were spoken in the late eighteenth century. At the outset of the twenty-first century, there were about 30 still regularly spoken, and few of them seemed likely to survive for another generation in Australia.

The growth of nationalism and nation-building has been, and still is, an important, spectacular and highly consequential dimension of the worldwide processes of change connected with colonialism and decolonisation. Nationalism is a kind of ideology which exists almost everywhere in the world, although it assumes very different forms and varies in significance.

Raising fundamental questions such as 'What is anthropology really about?', 'How does the public understand, or misunderstand, anthropology?' and 'What and where do anthropologists study now, and for whom do they write?' Hannerz invites anthropologists to think again about where their discipline is going. Full of insights and practical advice from Hannerz's long experience at the top of the discipline, this book is essential for all anthropologists who want their craft to survive and develop in a volatile world, and contribute to new understandings of its ever-changing diversity and interconnections.<br>

Second, to explore the structural facilitating factors of these constructions, through such institutions as the state and the media. Finally, the book synthesises a psycho-social perspective to look at the underlying mechanisms which fuel social exclusion and inclusion in society.

  Book Title: Cities of Affluence and Anger-A Literary Geography of Modern Englishness<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): KALLINEY PETER J.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a compact literary history of the twentieth century in England, Cities of Affluence and Anger studies the problematic terms of national identity during England's transition from an imperial power to its integration in the global cultural marketplace. While the countryside had been the dominant symbol of Englishness throughout the previous century, modern literature began to turn more and more to the city to redraw the boundaries of a contemporary cultural polity. The urban class system, paradoxically, still functioned as a marker of wealth, status, and hierarchy throughout this long period of self-examination, but it also became a way to project a common culture and mitigate other forms of difference. Local class politics were transformed in such a way that enabled the English to reframe a highly provisional national unity in the context of imperial disintegration, postcolonial immigration, and, later, globalization.Kalliney plots the decline of the country-house novel through an analysis of Forster's Howards End and Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, each ruthless in its sabotage of the trope of bucolic harmony. The traditionally pastoral focus of English fiction gives way to a high-modernist urban narrative, exemplified by Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, and, later, to realists such as Osborne and Sillitoe, through whose work Kalliney explores postwar urban expansion and the cultural politics of the welfare state. Offering fresh new readings of Lessing's The Golden Notebook and Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, the author considers the postwar appropriation of domesticity, the emergence of postcolonial literature, and the renovation of travel narratives in the context of globalization. Kalliney suggests that it is largely one city--London--through which national identity has been reframed. How and why this transition came about is a process that Cities of Affluence and Anger depicts with exceptional insight and originality.<br>

  Abstract: The decisive role Thomas Müntzer played during the German Peasants’ War of 1525 and his prophetic statement about the people being free later did encourage Friedrich Engels to see him as a precursor of all later revolutionaries. Engels’s interpretation is deeply influenced by the Left Hegelian historian Wilhelm Zimmermann, himself a politically radical scholar who first identified Thomas Müntzer as a revolutionary figure.¹ Engels sees the incidents during the revolution of 1525 and the following counterrevolution as paradigmatic for the historical dynamic of revolutions in general. Indeed, this also allows him to relocate the historical origin of the communist revolution<br>

The new motto became ‘unity through diversity’ and the national charter emphasized democracy, social justice and the belief in ‘the unique Godhead’. Indonesian law recognizes five monotheistic world religions and has made the adherence to one of these a legal requirement. Moreover, Indonesian (
                  bahasa Indonesia) was declared the national language, to be employed in schools everywhere and as the language<br>

  5  Post-apartheid repertoires of memory from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt18mbfgr">South African performance and archives of memory</a><br>
  Abstract: I turn now from these performances of memory by state or cultural institutions to look at embodied repertoires in the public sphere and in theatres. While the TRC clearly attempted to hear hidden stories and renegotiate the perceptions and values of South Africans, its effect was limited because a state of mind, values, and peoples’ views cannot be easily changed. Thus the extent to which the creative arts can facilitate further dialogue on the past and what the ‘rainbow nation’ means for individual people are important insofar as the arts can reach local communities in spaces outside of everyday reality.<br>

  Abstract: In a footnote to
                  Reproduction, Bourdieu stated that his ‘theory of pedagogic action’ was ‘grounded in a theory of the relations between objective structures, the habitus and practice’, which would ‘be set out more fully in a forthcoming book’ (1970, p. 9n.1 [p. xiii n.1]). The book in question was published two years later and drew on fieldwork Bourdieu had conducted during the Algerian War. EntitledEsquisse d’une théorie de la pratique(1972), it took the form of three anthropological studies of Kabylia followed by a sustained reflection on the political, ethical, and epistemological implications of anthropological study.

  Book Title: Truth Commissions-Memory, Power, and Legitimacy<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Bakiner Onur<br>
  Abstract: Bakiner demonstrates how truth commissions have recovered basic facts about human rights violations, forced societies to rethink the violence and exclusion of nation building, and produced a new dynamic whereby the state seeks to legitimize its central position between history and politics by accepting a high degree of societal penetration into the production and diffusion of official national history. By doing so, truth commissions have challenged and transformed public discourses on memory, truth, justice, reconciliation, recognition, nationalism, and political legitimacy in the contemporary world.<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Speaking Truth to Power? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt18z4gmr">Truth Commissions</a><br>
  Abstract: Chapter 1 identifies autonomy as a key ele ment of what makes a truth-finding panel a
                     truth commission. Politicians may establish commissions with selfserving motives, but it is far from obvious that the commissioners share those motives. Commissions are neither state bureaucracies nor pure civil society initiatives. Rather, they come into existence and carry out their tasks through interactions between politicians, bureaucracies, supportive and hostile civil society actors, and the commissioners themselves. This chapter explores these complex state-society dynamics.<br>

  Abstract: The detailed description of the pre-commission, commission, and postcommission processes in Chile and Peru in Chapter 5 reveals the complexity of interactions between politicians, state bureaucracies, civil society actors, and commission members. This chapter zooms out to explore how these dynamics influence commissions’ mandate, composition, goals, modes of operation, and outcomes in thirteen other societies that have lived through political transitions from authoritarianism to democracy and/or violent conflict to peace. There is enormous cross-national variation with respect to commissions’ impact on policy, judicial behavior, and social norms, as well as the sources of impact (i.e., political will to implement reforms<br>

  Abstract: In what ways do truth commissions transform the ways in which citizens of contemporary societies think and speak about historical truth, justice, reconciliation, and official historiography? Transitional justice mea sures, and truth commissions in particular, try to raise awareness around histories of violence and violations in the context of rebuilding state institutions and national identity.¹ Most truth commissions combine meticulous human rights investigation with a critique of the national past in order to rebuild the nation.² Aside from pursuing such goals as delivering a measure of justice and reconciliation, avoiding future violence, strengthening democratic institutions, and enhancing peace and stability,<br>

  Book Title: Timing Canada-The Shifting Politics of Time in Canadian Literary Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Huebener Paul<br>
  Abstract: From punch clocks to prison sentences, from immigration waiting periods to controversial time-zone boundaries, from Indigenous grave markers that count time in centuries rather than years, to the fact that free time is shrinking faster for women than for men - time shapes the fabric of Canadian society every day, but in ways that are not always visible or logical. In Timing Canada, Paul Huebener draws from cultural history, time-use surveys, political statements, literature, and visual art to craft a detailed understanding of how time operates as a form of power in Canada. Time enables everything we do - as Margaret Atwood writes, "without it we can't live." However, time also disempowers us, divides us, and escapes our control. Huebener transforms our understanding of temporal power and possibility by using examples from Canadian and Indigenous authors - including Jeannette Armstrong, Joseph Boyden, Dionne Brand, Timothy Findley, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Gabrielle Roy, and many others - who witness, question, dismantle, and reconstruct the functioning of time in their works. As the first comprehensive study of the cultural politics of time in Canada, Timing Canada develops foundational principles of critical time studies and everyday temporal literacy, and demonstrates how time functions broadly as a tool of power, privilege, and imagination within a multicultural and multi-temporal nation.<br>

  Author(s) Barreto Susan<br>
  Abstract: One early frosty Saturday morning in mid-December, one mom and dad were initially told that there was a 25 percent chance that their third child, a newborn baby girl, would live. This was simply due to the fact that she was born in 1973, happened to weigh 2 pounds 1 ounce, was born weeks early, and was in a hospital in rural Northwestern Illinois. Quickly realizing the situation’s seriousness, a local pediatrician suggested transporting the baby to the nearest state-run hospital with a preemie center in Peoria, Illinois.<br>

Constructing its history was an important part of Japan’s attempt to achieve a political status on par with the West. In this sense, “Japan as a modern state cannot be found outside the West … Criticism of Japan includes that of the West.¹ In other words, modern Japan – as well as Korea and other modern Asian nations – cannot be considered without recognizing Western influence.<br>

  Abstract: The gnostic movement that, in Irenaeus’s day, threatened to engulf Christianity subsided gradually into an underground current that would rise to the surface but sporadically in subsequent Christian history. Meanwhile, the Christian church soon advanced from being a persecuted minority to become the state religion of the Roman Empire, and eventually, in many ways, its successor. Once the age of martyrs gave way to Christendom, the sacralized political order on which Christendom rested would create tensions of its own and these, nine centuries after Irenaeus, provide the setting for the next work to claim our attention, Anselm of Canterbury’s

  Abstract: For over twenty years (1987–2009), you were director of the Archives Husserl de Paris at the École normale supérieure, which has historically been an important center of phenomenological research in France. From this position, you have a unique vantage point on the present state of French phenomenology and its future.

  Book Title: Turns of Event-Nineteenth-Century American Literary Studies in Motion<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Blum Hester<br>
  Abstract: American literary studies has undergone a series of field redefinitions over the past two decades that have been consistently described as "turns," whether transnational, hemispheric, postnational, spatial, temporal, postsecular, aesthetic, or affective. In
         Turns of Event, Hester Blum and a splendid roster of contributors explore the conditions that have produced such movements. Offering an overview of the state of the study of nineteenth-century American literature, Blum contends that the field's propensity to turn, to reinvent itself constantly without dissolution, is one of its greatest strengths.<br>

  Book Title: Local Church, Global Church-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): YOUNG JULIA G.<br>
  Abstract: This important volume investigates the many forms of Catholic activism in Latin America between the 1890s and 1962 (from the publication of the papal encyclical Rerum Novarum to the years just prior to the Second Vatican Council). It argues that this period saw a variety of lay and clerical responses to the social changes wrought by industrialization, political upheavals and mass movements, and increasing secularization. Spurred by these local developments as well as by initiatives from the Vatican, and galvanized by national projects of secular state-building, Catholic activists across Latin America developed new ways of organizing in order to effect social and political change within their communities.<br>

  Author(s) Edwards Lisa M.<br>
  Abstract: By the middle of the nineteenth century, the Catholic Church faced serious challenges from competing ideologies, including Protestantism, liberalism, Marxism, and anarchism. These new ideas and actors posed a real threat to the Catholic Church’s privileges and moral influence in Latin America. Throughout the region, these challenges often took the form of debates over freedom of religion, the role of religion in state educational systems, civil marriage, and secular cemeteries. They were exacerbated by the proliferation of secular, and sometimes even overtly anti-Catholic, political parties. As an institution, the church had to revise its previous strategy of either condemning or<br>

  Abstract: On October 9, 1924, Catholic lawyer Miguel Palomar y Vizcarra addressed Mexico City’s Eucharistic Congress on the topic of men and Holy Communion. Palomar’s underlying theme was the affinity between Eucharistic participation and Catholic militancy, yet he described this relationship in masculine language: the Eucharist, Palomar stated, was an “ESSENTIALLY VIRILE SACRAMENT,” an invigorating banquet of Christ’s flesh that should fortify Catholics in the struggle to reconquer Mexican society. The Eucharist was also constitutive of Catholic manhood: “I have not come here to tell you that men should take communion because they are men,” Palomar continued, “but that they must<br>

  Abstract: God is whoever raised Jesus from the dead, having before raised Israel from Egypt. This trademark sentence of Jenson’s is, as Stanley Hauerwas observes, both “elegantly simple” and “dauntingly deep.”³ At the heart of this dense slogan is the principle that Christian discourse about God intends and is made possible by a specific reality. “God,” as we have seen Jenson argue, is intrinsically specifiable, because God is known by and with a history. The God Jesus addressed as Father and who raised him from the dead was not a previously unknown deity. Rather, as Jenson states, “It is the God<br>

  Abstract: This chapter explores the connections between creation and the God of Israel’s consummating and redemptive purposes in the election of a peculiar people. As has been previously argued, Israel knew herself to be contingent, to be a people formed by God’s gracious intention. As a correlate of this understanding, Israel came to apprehend her God as the Creator of all. Reflecting on this “rule of faith” in Israel, Jenson cites 2 Maccabees: “Look at the heavens and the earth … and acknowledge that God made them.”¹ The new thing the New Testament adds, states Jenson, is that creation is for<br>

  Abstract: Judgment involves us in all manner of districts of human life and discourse; aesthetic, social, moral, and political judgments all vary in one way or another in shape and consequence. As a political matter the question of judgment inevitably binds us up in the exchange of speech, and therefore the generation of shared meaning.¹ Judgment is executed in speech relations. To execute a judgment, therefore, is to determine in relation why any existing state of affairs is, or is not, conducive to human flourishing.

  Abstract: Free individuality, human capacities, and inner state of mind most directly involve the personal space of the self but also in a broader sense the distinction and interaction between the individual domain and the public sphere. As interrelated aspects of the social world, the individual domain and its connection to the public sphere also sets the concrete background for the historical process of accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things. As the actual mode of being, accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things is never separable from diverse social resources, and the acquisition, possession, and distribution of resources involves the issue of social justice.<br>

Nessuno ipotizzava che le incursioni nella narrativa dell’estrema attualità potessero diventare un campo scientifico autonomo, semmai si consideravano queste “digressioni” occasionali come un’appendice della letteratura novecentesca, espressione solo di una certa eccentricità da parte di chi vi si dedicava.

  Book Title: Grand Hotel Abyss-Desire, Recognition and the Restoration of the Subject<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Safatle Vladimir<br>
  Abstract: Long-expected translation of the Portuguese academic bestseller Grande Hotel Abismo. In the last two decades recognition - arguably one of the most central notions of the dialectical tradition since Hegel - has once again become a crucial philosophical theme. Nevertheless, the new theories of recognition fail to provide room for reflection on transformation processes in politics and morality. This book aims to recover the disruptive nature of the dialectical tradition by means of a severe critique of the dominance of an anthropology of the individual identity in contemporary theories of recognition. This critique implies a thorough rethinking of basic concepts such as desire, negativity, will and drive, with Hegel, Lacan and Adorno being our main guides. The Marxist philosopher György Lukács said that the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer, Adorno, etc.) left us with nothing but negativity towards the state of the world. Their work failed to open up a concrete possibility of practical engagement in this world. All too eager to describe the impasses of reason, the Frankfurt philosphers remained trapped in a metaphorical Grand Hotel Abyss (Grand Hotel Abgrund). It was as living and being guardian of lettered civilization in a beautiful and melancholy grand hotel, of which the balconies face a gaping abyss. But perhaps in this way Lukács gave – and no doubt without realizing it himself – a perfect definition of contemporary philosophy, namely to confront chaos, to peer into what appears to a certain rationality as an abyss and to feel good about it. Touching Hegelian dialectics, critical theory and psychoanalysis, Grand Hotel Abyss gives a new meaning to the notion of negativity as the first essential step for rethinking political and moral engagement.<br>

  Abstract: Let us dwell for a moment on the suggestive closing lines of the preceding chapter: the transformation of individualities into political subjects implies their having the ability to convert subjective gestures into manifestations of a trans-individual multiplicity of desires. Were that to be the case, political subjects could conceivable attain a historical density of such great proportions within social struggles that they would in effect become modes for the actualization of a past never entirely gone, and, subsequently, points of contact for experiences scattered throughout time. This is unequivocally grasped by Walter Benjamin, as evidenced in the following statement: History<br>

  Abstract: After our initial look at how certain aspects of Hegel’s account of desire might transform the concept of individuality, we turned to possible repercussions for his theories of juridical ordering and the state. Then, a third textual movement attempted an articulation of subjectivity, history and infinity, the foremost aim of which was to show that the Hegelian subject exceeds all egological reductions, analytics of finitude or anthropological limitations. That is to say, Hegel leaves us with a subject sufficiently inclusive to allow for both reflections on models of institutional association, as well as modes of determination or the process of<br>

  Abstract: In the following essay I examine sound-on-disc cinema prior to World War I through a framework of national and urban comparisons. The objective is to explore sound-on-disc’s international diffusion as an example of how the cinema’s uneven global development, its geographical diversity, was conditioned by regional variations in electric power. The focus on sound-on-disc thus involves an argument that bears implications for cinema history as a whole. One aspect of the argument concerns difficulties posed to the established nation-state film historiography by electrification, a sub-or transnational phenomenon more than a national one.<br>

  Abstract: In the 1990s, there was much debate among observers of the ‘normalisation’ of French industrial relations (Freyssinet 1993; Ruysseveldt and Visser 1996; Goetschy 1998). Broadly, the argument is that there has been a shift from an under-institutionalised system in which state intervention was needed to mediate a more or less naked class conflict between capital and labour to one based upon regular decentralised compromise bargaining between ‘social partners’. From this perspective, the system of labour regulation in France – the ‘rules of the game’ by which wages and working conditions are established – is coming to resemble more closely that of other<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbwzh">Sartre Against Stalinism</a><br>
  Abstract: After completing ‘Matérialisme et révolution’, Sartre’s quest continued. Philosophically and politically dissatisfied with the PCF, he wished to establish a revolutionary alternative. Yet Naville’s anti-Stalinist materialism was clearly not what he was looking for. In this context a major influence was his fellow-editor of
                     Les Temps modernes, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, who was usually the author of editorial statements signed ‘T.M’., to which Sartre gave his consent,¹ apparently recognising that Merleau-Ponty was more politically sophisticated than he was. Merleau-Ponty was not a Trotskyist, but he had had a number of friends and contacts in the Trotskyist movement since before the war.²<br>

  Abstract: The task of defining urban identities seems to be more necessary than ever at a time of massive socio-economic upheaval and residential mobility, and as the relationship between the local, national (itself undergoing redefinition) and international is changing. There are important political, economic and social reasons for defining specific urban identities. The political reasons relate to successive urban regeneration initiatives since the early 1980s as well as decentralisation laws dating from the same period. Economic regeneration has a marked regional and local aspect, particularly since decentralisation, as mayors compete for business location and state funding on the basis of local<br>

  Author(s) Shimada Shingo<br>
  Abstract: The revival of interest in cultural identity, now a key issue in world politics and likely to remain so for some time, is an outcome of the end of the so-called Cold War. The Cold War order that had defined world politics and had assumed economic and political bipolarity is no longer dominant. ‘Culture’ has been rediscovered in an effort to explain obvious differences between states (Huntington, 1993). However, in view of the seemingly endless conflicts in many parts of the world it is increasingly doubtful whether we can justly understand and interpret conflicting realities on the basis of our<br>

  Abstract: ‘

Ever since the dawn of the postmodern era, however, we are constantly offered new theoretical arguments to persuade us of the plurality and the frailness of the I. It is commonplace nowadays to talk of the individual as a representational construct that is conditioned, manufactured and manipulated by language, images and society, a construct that can even be artificially portrayed. The subject, so the argument runs, emerges precisely because it issubjectedto<br>

  Abstract: Within Britain, the Welsh language is often presented by the English media as controversial. In some cases it is seen as the instrument through which the minority, namely Welsh language speakers, impose their will on the majority.

Her contribution to social anthropology and women’s studies is revealed in the chapters of this book and in her innumerable publications. She recognised the similarity between the ‘consciousness-raising’ proposed by Western feminist movements and the social anthropological techniques of ‘isolating from their context statements which though trivial in themselves carry assumptions with wider significance’ (Ardener 1978: 45, n. 9).

One only need browse book stands or news racks for examples of how the idea of whiteness is being interpreted, defined, reinterpreted, and contested by popular writers and journalists.

  Abstract: Initially, the law largely treated black slaves as non-beings.¹ Eventually, the law evolved into a paternalistic system that viewed blacks as lesser beings whom white masters and overseers needed to protect from their own ignorant, sloven, and evil nature. Finally, slave law provided for legal limitations on the activities of slaves and their masters; in other words, the state stepped between slaves and masters and imposed external rules.² Thus, slavery bequeathed three powerful constructions of law to legal interpretation—ignoring blacks altogether, treating blacks paternalistically, and creating limited legal rules to regulate white behavior toward blacks.

This is particularly the case given the highly charged racial context within which notions of rights and duties were developed, who they were meant to exclude, and our societal struggle to make the law “color-blind.” In this context, abstract notions of citizen, government, rights, and duties do not begin to account for the relationship between people<br>

  Book Title: Re-treating Religion: Deconstructing Christianity with Jean-Luc Nancy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nancy Jean-Luc<br>
  Abstract: One of the most complicated and ambiguous tendencies in contemporary western societies is the phenomenon referred to as the turn to religion.In philosophy, one of the most original thinkers critically questioning this turnis Jean-Luc Nancy. Re-treating Religion is the first volume to analyze his long-term project The Deconstruction of Christianity,especially his major statement of it in Dis-Enclosure.Nancy conceives monotheistic religion and secularization not as opposite worldviews that succeed each other in time but rather as springing from the same history. This history consists in a paradoxical tendency to contest one's own foundations-whether God, truth, origin, humanity, or rationality-as well as to found itself on the void of this contestation. Nancy calls this unique combination of self-contestation and self-foundation the self-deconstructionof the Western world.The book includes discussion with Nancy himself, who contributes a substantial Preambleand a concluding dialogue with the volume editors. The contributions follow Nancy in tracing the complexities of Western culture back to the persistent legacy of monotheism, in order to illuminate the tensions and uncertainties we face in the twenty-first century.<br>

                     Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus: “The sense of the world must lie outside the world.”¹ If secularization is our perspective, the most logical option seems to lie in a mere immanentization of this otherworldly sense.

Or, as Nancy has it, Christianity “understands itself in a way that is less and less religious in the sense in which religion implies a mythology (a narrative, a representation of divine actions and persons)” (D37/57). The seemingly strange statement that the Christian religion increasingly understands itself “in a way that is less and less religious,” is a reformulation of Nancy’s central thesis that Christianity is a<br>

Responses can take various forms—essays, treatises, paintings, conversations, narratives, plays, and poems—each of which has constraints that, whether respected or transgressed, inflect phenomenological observation in different ways. Literature certainly gives us a range of examples for understanding phenomenology. When reading Italo Calvino’s

They have also spent the greater part of their lives interpreting and discussing their experience in a language almost entirely shaped by ideology. These aspects of their mental world lend special resonance to the work of collecting and analyzing their memories. In their case, too, the controversial term “collective memory” has real meaning.

  Book Title: Provocations to Reading: J. Hillis Miller and the Democracy to Come-J. Hillis Miller and the Democracy to Come<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kujundžić Dragan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a marker of the state of theorytoday. Its rich array of wideranging essays explores the dimensions and implications of the work of J. Hillis Miller, one of the most eminent literary scholars in America. For nearly half a century, Miller has been known for his close and imaginative engagement with the implications of European philosophical thought and for his passionate advocacy of close reading.Building on this intellectual legacy, the contributors instantiate and extend the practice and ethics of sustained close reading that is Miller's hallmark. The book culminates in a moving piece by Jacques Derrida, Miller's close friend of forty years, who engages Miller's readings of Gerard Manley Hopkins in a historic encounter between French philosophy and American reading practices.A provocation to reading for new generations of students and teachers, these essays offer important resources for grasping the question of language in historical perspective and in contemporary life-a task essential for any democratic future. Barbara Cohen is Director of HumaniTech at the University of California, Irvine. She is co-editor of Material Events: Paul de Man and the Afterlife of Theory. Dragan Kujunzic is Professor of Russian and Comparative Literature and Director of Russian Studies at the University of California, Irvine. Among his publications is The Returns of History: Russian Nietzscheans after Modernity.<br>

By 1559 Machiavelli’s works appeared—along with those of Erasmus, Boccaccio, and Savonarola—on the papal index of prohibited books.¹ The Counter-Reformation was in full force and Machiavelli was censured as an enemy to religion in treatise after treatise in Spain and Italy. In particular, Machiavelli was condemned as the proponent of reason of state—the use of any and all available means, however immoral, to preserve the state and to increase the power of its ruler.

  Abstract: DECADES before the condemnation of Machiavellian reason of state in Counter-Reformation treatises of the 1590s and early 1600s, Cardinal Pole provided a quick sketch of the Machiavel in his

He tells us that Machiavelli’s works “stink of the malice of Satan” (malitiam Satanae redolent) and thatThe Princewas written “by Satan’s hand” (Satanae digito). He also offers a synopsis of Machiavelli’s rhetorical politics, noting that the prince must learn to simulate and dissimulate according to the age-old rhetorical criteria of time, place, and audience.

  Abstract: In the collection of Napoleonic bon mots that Balzac collected and published in 1838, the French emperor at one point states, “War is above all a matter of tact.”¹ The pithy formulation compresses a whole discourse in philosophy, military theory, pedagogy, and literature into a single concept. What for Napoleon, or at least for Balzac’s Napoleon, is presented as a self-evident truth in need of no further explanation was the subject of a more detailed analysis in various fields that attempted to develop a kind of knowledge that could guide action.

  Abstract: The interest in operational knowledge was not limited to the fields of philosophy, military theory, and literature. As the logical extension of the attempts to delineate its basic features the question arose: How does one acquire operational knowledge, and, conversely, how does one teach it? Practical knowledge entered the curriculum of educational theory. Military pedagogy, however, differed from the contemporary developments in educational theory during the second half of the eighteenth century in that it was specifically tailored to the state of war. This created a fundamental problem, for how does one train a recruit without exposing him to the<br>

  Conclusion: from:

  Abstract: The state of war is articulated in a diverse range of forms, materials, and genres that all, with shifting emphases, respond to the disappearance of a secure foundation of knowledge. Out of the flat geometrical order, war emerges as a fully formed three-dimensional world governed by an operational dynamic that allows only hypothetical scenarios, average truths, a spectrum of probabilities. In its tremendous complexity, war is a blurry object in which a pervasive disorder obtains. But even as some seek to exclude the state of war from the realm of epistemology—be it in philosophical and military treatises or in<br>

  Abstract: Freud’s reading of Jewish history, centered around the return to group consciousness of the long repressed memory of the primeval Father, did not end with Moses or the Hebrew prophets. Yes, Moses created the Jews and Judaism by restoring the Father to them alone, through his own person and in the teaching of the one omnipotent God of the universe. Following his death this revelation was repressed in turn, only to reemerge from its state of unconscious latency in the teachings of the prophets, which would become the common patrimony of the entire Jewish people.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cd0kz3">Twentieth Century Theories of Art</a><br>
  Abstract: The Expression Theory is one of the distinctively modern approaches to art. “Art is the expression of emotion.” Of course earlier writers said a good deal about art and emotion. Plato described art as the feeding and watering of the passions. In the third century the Peri-Hypsous stressed the importance of vehement emotions in the literary work. Renaissance artists were much concerned with the faithful rendering of feeling states in the portrayal of their subjects. Eighteenth century artists and theorists had much to say about the sublime, the feeling of delicious terror. Hegel emphasized the insight art gives into the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cd0kz3">Twentieth Century Theories of Art</a><br>
  Abstract: Though formalism reached its full flowering in the 20th century, there are vigorous statements of formalist themes in the 19th century and its roots go back to the 18th century. To trace the origins of 20th century versions is by no means an easy task. In part formalist theories emerge as protests against other theories, partic:ularly those emphasizing emotion and biographical criticism on the one hand and those which emphasize general rules and classical traditions on the other. Partly also they emerge in response to the challenge of developing critical methods adequate to late 19th and 20th century art forms.<br>

  Book Title: Principalities and Powers-Revising John Howard Yoder’s Sociological Theology<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Pitts Jamie<br>
  Abstract: The present book is an attempt to grapple with Yoder’s critics in order to decide how to move forward with a revised “Yoderian" theology. Pitts suggests how that revision should be accomplished by first providing an overview of the current state of Yoder scholarship and this book’s place within it; then proposing an argument that Yoder’s theology can profitably read as a “sociological theology" that exhibits reductive tendencies, but which can be revised to be non-reductive; and finally offering an outline and justification of the proposed method of revision, which involves putting Yoder’s theology of the principalities and powers into conversation with the reflexive sociology of Pierre Bourdieu.<br>

  2  Revising Yoderʹs Theological Anthropology from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4k49">Principalities and Powers</a><br>
  Abstract: John Howard Yoder frequently described his basic outlook as that of a “free church” theologian.¹ Anabaptist convictions about the meaning of Christian discipleship led to the rejection of infant baptism, the separation of church and state, and the elevation of a scripture-centered community ethic above doctrine as a principle of unity.² In each case, the impetus to free the church from identification with the civil community was derived from a command of Christ as recorded in the New Testament: baptize believers (Matt 18; Mark 16); do not take up the sword or otherwise resist evil (Matt 5:39); order your community<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4k49">Principalities and Powers</a><br>
  Abstract: Alongside his christocentric pacifism, Yoder is perhaps best known for posing the church as an alternative political body to the nation state. In imitation of the politics of Jesus, Christian communities are to share goods, welcome the excluded, and practice reconciliation, servant leadership, and the priesthood of believers.¹ When it does these things, the church becomes “a proclamation of the lordship of Christ to the powers from whose dominion the church has begun to be liberated.”² Through faithfulness to its master, not compromise, the church fulfills its call “to contribute to the creation of structures more worthy of human society.”³<br>

  6  “Holy War” and the Universal God: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4mgz">After Imperialism</a><br>
  Author(s) Longman Tremper<br>
  Abstract: The “divine warrior” with its background in “holy war” is one of the most stirring themes in the Old Testament, but also one of the most difficult for a modern Christian to understand and appreciate. The battle of Jericho, for instance, is a magnificent display of divine power as the walls of this powerful Canaanite city-state come tumbling down so that the Israelites can defeat it without even raising a single siege ramp. On the other hand, if, as I believe we can safely presume, Joshua followed the requirements of

  Abstract: Heredity or environment? Which of these factors most determines the behavioral development of a child? This question has been debated vigorously among psychologists and behavioral scientists. No doubt most would conclude today that both hereditary and environmental factors are important and that both should be considered. This is also the case with the development of early Christianity, if we may employ an analogy between human growth and the historical development of a religious movement. What later became rabbinic Judaism and Christianity were both developments out of Judean state religion. Jesus and his disciples were Jews, and for some time Christianity<br>

  Abstract: Certain questions are essential for interpretation. One question to be addressed before asking what a text originally meant is, did the text originally state that? For example, if we want to understand what the author of 1 John originally meant by the phrase “the Spirit, the water, and the blood” (5:7–8), we had better be certain that the author of 1 John composed it.¹ How reliable are the Greek manuscripts on which our modern translations are based?<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter we looked at NT books composed in a basic narrative framework: the four Gospels and Acts. Although they include large amounts of direct discourse, such as sayings, speeches, and dialogues, the Gospels and Acts mostly contain narrative materials (e.g., miracle stories and historical legends). Also, the direct discourse in these books is joined by narrative comments and summary statements that permeate each work. The epistolary literature is primarily direct discourse. Its small amount of narrative material is mostly autobiographical. Much of its hymns, sayings, and teaching material is part of a dialogue between author and reader.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4mm1">An Introduction to the New Testament</a><br>
  Abstract: The problems of Pauline chronology are similar to those in the study of Jesus. Evidence is sparse and scattered, and the sources are often dominated by literary and religious purposes. Factors that are distinctive for a chronology of Paul are that (a) we have the apostle’s own words about certain events in his life; (b) references to Paul’s life in Acts sometimes coincide with statements in Paul’s letters; and (c) an ancient inscription confirms the Lukan account of Paul’s appearance before Gallio (Acts 18:12–17).<br>

  Book Title: Dealing with Dictators-The United States, Hungary, and East Central Europe, 1942-1989<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): VINCZ JASON<br>
  Abstract: Dealing with Dictators explores America's Cold War efforts to make the dictatorships of Eastern Europe less tyrannical and more responsive to the country's international interests. During this period, US policies were a mix of economic and psychological warfare, subversion, cultural and economic penetration, and coercive diplomacy. Through careful examination of American and Hungarian sources, László Borhi assesses why some policies toward Hungary achieved their goals while others were not successful. When George H. W. Bush exclaimed to Mikhail Gorbachev on the day the Soviet Union collapsed, "Together we liberated Eastern Europe and unified Germany," he was hardly doing justice to the complicated history of the era. The story of the process by which the transition from Soviet satellite to independent state occurred in Hungary sheds light on the dynamics of systemic change in international politics at the end of the Cold War.<br>

  Abstract: The year 1948 saw a basic shift in American policymakers’ attitudes toward Soviet control of European territory. The idea of peaceful cooperation, nurtured up to then by many British and American politicians and diplomats, was shattered. The last Eastern European democracy, Czechoslovakia, had been amalgamated into the Soviet camp and closed off, although, almost miraculously, Finland was released from Moscow’s grasp. Washington no longer saw Soviet control as a stabilizing factor in Eastern Europe. Instead, the restoration of independent states and the rollback of Soviet military power became the prerequisites of a secure and lasting continental peace. The goal thenceforth<br>

  Abstract: On October 23, 1956, Hungary exploded. Although it is hard to pinpoint why one country remains docile under tyrannical rule while another revolts, historians have dedicated years of research to identifying the specific factors that led to the only armed uprising against Soviet rule. Because virtually all segments of Hungarian society had suffered various forms of repression, unrest was not confined to the capital city. Centrally engineered “circular social mobility” failed to satisfy even the social groups whose aspirations the regime had privileged.¹ Grievances included foreign military occupation, state terror that sometimes exceeded even the limits of Soviet tolerance, serious<br>

Washington was forced to take a hard look at the European situation, and over the course of a decade they concluded that there was nothing they could do to reverse the continental division. The calculation that Europe would remain divided for the foreseeable future was not based solely on the United States’s inability to influence the power structure behind the Iron Curtain.

  Abstract: It is hard to disagree with historian Geraint Hughes’ assessment that “throughout the late 1960s, Britain and other Western powers were above all concerned that the status quo in Europe should be upheld.”¹ The European status quo would be sanctioned by an unlikely candidate. Richard Nixon had been known for his uncompromising anticommunist stance, but as president he espoused an unabashed realism. He and Henry Kissinger formed a tandem that would redefine American Cold War politics and treat the division of Europe as if it were permanent. Stability was to prevail at the expense of the independence of old nation-states.<br>

                  Reading from This Place: Social Location and Biblical Interpretation in the United states, asserted that reading the Bible should involve “positioned readers, flesh-and-blood persons” who are in “critical dialogue” within a “truly global interaction” regarding the meaning of biblical texts.¹ Daniel Patte, in his bookEthics of Biblical Interpretation: A Re-evaluation, argued for a conversation between levels of exegetical practice and for the inclusion of the “ordinary reader” in that conversation.² in his book,Texts under Negotiation: The Bible and<br>

  10  AMERICAN SCRIPTURES from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgdw89">Reading Scripture with the Saints</a><br>
  Abstract: George Washington’s (1732–1799) farewell address and Abraham Lincoln’s (1809–1865) second inaugural are among the very few specimens of American statecraft now accorded iconic status. This chapter considers them as
                     theologicalstatements. As counter-intuitive as that may seem, the pudding’s proof awaits its tasting.<br>

  4  Platonist Ideas in the New Testament from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgdwbb">Returning to Reality</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter sketches a short outline of how some important statements in the New Testament align with one of the central ideas about the nature of reality found in Plato’s dialogues. In order to do this I will be “proof texting” both the New Testament and Plato. Whilst I hope this chapter will prove to be a useful contribution to the argument of this book, I am very aware that this exercise has some very clear limits and is fraught with perils.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgdwbb">Returning to Reality</a><br>
  Abstract: Over the past three days two of my daughters have been at a music camp. We live on the eastern coast of Australia in the beautiful sub-tropical city of Brisbane, and at this music camp Aurora and Claire have been playing their violins with four hundred other primary-school aged music students from state schools in the northern suburbs. This evening we had a two-hour concert where the children displayed their achievements to over a thousand admiring parents and relatives. They played music in two string orchestras and three stage bands, but the highlight was the massed choir at the end.<br>

  5  The Kingdom of God from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgdxgw">Why Resurrection?</a><br>
  Abstract: The belief in the persistence of life after death is not a goal in itself. People who believe in immortality of the soul and in resurrection of the dead do not do so just to state that personal identity will endure. They do so in order to state that the personal identity will endure in a different world, in a different kind of life. The belief in life beyond death is therefore meant to affirm that there is a new world waiting for us, and that life on Earth is not the definitive, final reality.<br>

  Book Title: The Atheist's Primer-  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Palmer Michael<br>
  Abstract: In The Atheist's Primer, a prominent philosopher, Dr Michael Palmer, reinstates the importance of philosophy in the debate about God's existence. The 'new atheism' of Richard Dawkins and others has been driven by largely Darwinian objections to God's existence, limiting the debate to within a principally scientific framework. This has obscured the philosophical tradition of atheism, in which the main intellectual landmarks in atheism's history are to be found. With an analysis of atheistic thought from the Ancient Greeks to the present day, Palmer explains and comments on the philosophical arguments warranting atheism, discussing issues such as evil, morality, miracles, and the motivations for belief. The emphasis placed on materialism and the limitations of our knowledge might seem disheartening to some; but Palmer concludes on a positive note, arguing – alongside Nietzsche, Marx and Freud and many others – that happiness and personal fulfilment are to be found in the very materialism that religious belief rejects. Michael Palmer first addressed these issues in his student-oriented edition, The Atheist's Creed, of which The Atheist's Primer is a revised abridgement for the general reader. Palmer has now stripped out the primary texts and expanded his commentaries into fluent and concise analyses of the arguments. Free of philosophical jargon and assumptions of prior knowledge, this is an important introduction to a major cultural debate.<br>

  Abstract: Some years ago I wrote an article for

In that article I maintained, “The hymns of the churcharetheology. They are theological statements: the church’s lyrical, theological commentaries on Scripture, liturgy, faith, action, and hosts of other subjects which call the reader and singer to faith, life, and Christian practice.”³<br>

  Abstract: Pope Benedict XVI’s social encyclical,

The Pope did not approve the status quo, but in what he called the socialmagisterium, addressed the global dimension of the social question understanding of what has been happening in the contemporary international economic scene. Benedict recognizes the disconnect between the Word of the Gospel<br>

  Abstract: Atheism is apparently in an ambiguous state with respect to postmodernism. By some accounts, postmodernism is nearly synonymous with unbelief, if not full blown atheism.

  Conclusion from:

  Abstract: As I stated at the beginning of the study, my purpose in writing this book was to examine John hick’s theology of religious pluralism with special regard to his rejection of the traditional Christian understanding that Jesus of Nazareth is “God incarnate, who came to die for the sins of the world and who formed the church to proclaim this.”¹ Hick’s negation of such a central tenet of orthodox Christianity is essential to his project of establishing religious equality among major religions, because, in hick’s own words, “if he [Jesus] was indeed god incarnate, Christianity is the only religion founded<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf1rx">Sacramental Presence after Heidegger</a><br>
  Abstract: The theology of Louis-Marie Chauvet is a sustained example of how Heidegger can be made productive in the theology of sacramental presence, and also theology in general. Chauvet moves his theological statements completely outside of the realm of metaphysics understood as a privileged discursive conceptualism; such statements may only be made via a phenomenology and hermeneutics of the ritual dynamic proper to Christian liturgy. In this symbolic mode, as we will see, theological statements, no longer mediated by traditional metaphysics, will be weighted more towards history than ontology, and therefore more towards absence than presence.

  Abstract: In the previous chapter I argued for the viability of a theological engagement with history for the purpose of informing our theology of the atonement with the historical intention of Jesus of Nazareth. The task now is to discuss what can be known of the world of meaning that Jesus constituted for his death and then, in the next chapter, to bring these results to bear on our understanding of Christian atonement. Easy enough perhaps to state, a rather more difficult task in practice. Indeed, the endeavor threatens to become all-consuming; John Meier’s four-volume work is ample evidence of the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf353">Grasping Truth and Reality</a><br>
  Abstract: Each generation since the modern missionary movement began in the eighteenth century has produced a few great missionary statesmen, persons whose thought and work were a major influence on the global missionary enterprise during their particular era and who have influenced subsequent missionary thinking as well. At the end of the twentieth century this honor, it would seem, fell upon Lesslie Newbigin, long time missionary to India and global ecumenical leader.<br>

Oldham was present at the ecumenical conference held in Jerusalem in 1928 and he began to raise questions about the gospel and secular culture, but they were not perceived as central to the missionary concerns of the time. They reappeared at The Edinburgh Quadrennial of 1933. Newbigin recalls:<br>

  Abstract: ‘The main thrust of what I want to say is that translating the Bible is an art that we seem to have lost, for mysterious reasons.’ So said David Daniell, the distinguished Tyndale scholar, at a conference in London in February 1995. There has been, to my knowledge, no decisive answer offered to the question implied by his statement. Daniell himself points out some of the central paradoxes of this situation. The ‘we’ of his statement refers, of course, to the community of English-speakers, a language which ‘has never been in better shape … It is healthier than ever before,<br>

  Chapter Four  When is a priest not a priest? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf395">Translating the English Bible</a><br>
  Abstract: In Chapter Three we considered the Preface to Luke’s gospel, and found that it was a certain combination of syntactical features, rather than the semantics of the piece, which gave it its relevance. This, of course, is not the universal or perhaps even the normal state of affairs: on the contrary, the semantic properties of a text are normally very important in how it achieves relevance. Although part of the agenda of the present work is to challenge the assumption that semantics are always and everywhere the ‘trump card’ in interpreting a text, it has to be acknowledged that they<br>

  Abstract: When Wesley spoke of “the whole process of a man reasoning, groaning, striving, and escaping from the legal to the evangelical state,”¹ he was bearing witness that there is “a definite teleology to divine grace.”² The centerpiece of this testimony was that the revelation of Christ was (and is) the salvation-historical event that demarcates the legal from the evangelical (gospel, Christian) dispensation of the covenant of grace. This was more than a theological affirmation, for even as the revelation of Christ in the course of the history of God’s saving deeds ushered all of humanity into the Christian dispensation (historically<br>

  Book Title: Beyond Old and New Perspectives on Paul-Reflections on the Work of Douglas Campbell<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Adams Edward<br>
  Abstract: In his work 'Deliverance of God' Douglas Campbell presents what Chris Tilling considers a "complete rereading of Paul’s letters that genuinely offers a way beyond problems associated with old and new perspectives. And his resultant picture of Paul’s theology generally, and the Apostle’s soteriology particularly, is beautiful, liberating, consistent, exegetically rigorous, theologically aware and pastorally compelling. It captures, I think, the best of the old perspective, with its concern to speak energetically about the God who saves, and it takes seriously the concerns of the new perspective on Second Temple Judaism. But in remarkable and jarringly elegant ways, it moves beyond them both." This collection of essays is divided into two sections. Part One analyses key aspects of Campbell’s account of the problem confronting readers of Paul. Part Two analyses key aspects of Campbell’s proposed solution to to the current confused state of Pauline interpretation. This book is essential reading for anyone involved in the study of Paul.<br>

  Abstract: The journey to a solution from the problems I outlined in chapter 3 can begin usefully by considering just one concern— Judaism—in relation to a limited text—Galatians 2:15–16.² This consideration can illustrate both why the presence of a fundamentally Arian type of western contractualism in Paul is so problematic, however unnoticed, and what the basic strategy for resolving it is that
                  Deliveranceis proposing. In what follows, largely for the sake of convenience, I will call the problematic approach “forwardness.”³ in Galatians 2:15–16 Paul states, Ἡμεῖς φύσει Ἰουδαῖοι καὶ οὐκ ἐξ ἐθνῶν ἁμαρτωλοί· [16] εἰδότες δὲ<br>

  Abstract: The “Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification” AFFIRMS an epoch-making new ecumenical consensus and reconciliation between the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran World Federation concerning the understanding of justification, which has historically been a stumbling block to both sides.¹ This declaration was signed on October 31, 1999, Reformation day. In order fully to understand the importance of this statement on justification, it is necessary to take note of the historical development and debates on this doctrine that have played a major role separating the Catholic Church from Protestant churches.

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf9s9">Christian Ethics as Witness</a><br>
  Abstract: This book brings together two long-standing interests of mine, namely Christian social ethics and social theory, and the theology and ethics of Karl Barth. Giving serious attention to both of these fields of inquiry is not an easy task, but requires a great deal of thinking about how the methodologies of these two fields fit together. On one hand, this really is not a problem for the social ethicist who occasionally refers to Barth’s theology or ethics, by applying his thought to issues like church and state, war, or politics. On the other hand, it is a different matter when<br>

  CHAPTER TWO  Barth’s Early Ethics and the Trinitarian Other from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf9s9">Christian Ethics as Witness</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter looks at the early development of the theological ethics of Karl Barth. Because of his significant wrestling with the problems of modern theology and ethics in the early twentieth century, the early years of Barth’s thinking (1916–31) provides an important point of departure for our study. Barth rejects the anthropocentric “immanent frame” of liberal theology, by shifting theology away from personal religious consciousness toward a genuine search for the divine trinitarian
                  Other; his method is deconstructive and critical before it becomes constructive and positivist. With this in mind, two important points must be stated about Barth’s early<br>

  Abstract: As stated in chapter 2, every religious symbol expresses, either explicitly or implicitly, a threefold referentiality: (1) reference to some notion of ultimate reality, the sacred, or God; (2) reference to a concept of the human; and (3) reference to a specific vision of the world. The Christian symbol of divine suffering naturally exhibits that threefold referentiality in both the explicit symbol and its twofold presupposition. Thus, in these two primary presuppositions, the human and God do not relate to one another in some sort of vacuum. The human (Ο άνθρωπος) and God (Ο θεός) relate to one another in<br>

  Abstract: The first stage of the journey toward capitalism was marked by the conquest and pillage of America (sixteenth century), while the second stage was marked by the rise and affirmation of the bourgeoisies (seventeenth and eighteenth century). These elements of capitalism fused into a powerful mix, propelling European states toward the territorial conquest of the world. Based on this unique fusion of state and capital, capitalism became identified with the state, thus triumphing.¹<br>

  Abstract: We have examined the development and expansion of capitalism in terms of a critical study of Marx’s idea and theory of monopoly capital and late capitalism. However, those committed to economic study from the standpoint of the world-system take issue with monopoly capitalism as a rational and progressive system which retains big business organized in giant corporations as its prime mover. Smaller business was treated as a part of the environment around the operation of big business.¹ A state under monopoly capitalism has a responsibility to insure that prices and profit margins in the deviant industries are brought within the<br>

  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Morra Linda M.<br>
  Abstract: At the Speed of Light There is Only Illuminationcollects a dozen re-evaluative essays on Marshall McLuhan and his critical and theoretical legacy; from intellectual adventurer creating a complex architecture of ideas to cultural icon standing in line in Woody Allen's Annie Hall. Given McLuhan's prominent status in many academic disciplines, the contributors reflect a multi-disciplinary background. John Moss and Linda Morra chose the essays from a gathering of McLuhan's academic devotees. The contribution - from "McLuhan as Medium" and "McLuhan in Space" to "What McLuhan Got Wrong" and "Trouble in the Global Village" - to provide a kaleidoscope of new views. As Moss writes of the collected essays: "Some are big and some are small, some exegetic and some confessional, some stand as major statements and others are sidelong glances; some resonate with the concerns of public discourse and others are private or privileged or impious and provocative. Each consists of many parts, each a design on its own. They speak to each other…they may have come together as one version of what happened."<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ckpdx6">Philosophical Theory and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a><br>
  Author(s) Munro Bradley R.<br>
  Abstract: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 1948. That the Universal Declaration could be proclaimed by a body representative of most of the world’s states is a remarkable achievement and worthy of celebration in this so-called postmodern world. Indeed, most of the states that since joined the General Assembly have also endorsed the UDHR. Truly remarkable about this tremendous achievement is the UDHR embracing a whole series of principles and value statements that define what constitutes human dignity. The world has an exceedingly rich array of cultures,<br>

  Author(s) Lea David<br>
  Abstract: Article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, “Everyone has a right to own property alone as well as in association with others.” Though the UN has thrown its weight behind a universal right to property, the bare assertion of a right to property needs further clarification. This assertion certainly means that these rights should be recognized by all states, regardless of their conventions and local legislation. We can also say that this means such rights are independent of the established legislation (“positive law”) of a particular country, in that these rights possess a legitimacy that is not<br>

  CHAPTER TWO  INGARDEN’S INTERPRETATION OF HUSSERL from:

  Abstract: In this chapter I offer a critical examination of Ingarden’s interpretation of Husserl as a ‘metaphysical idealist’. While the idealist interpretation antedates Ingarden’s first statement of criticism, his ceaseless endeavour to drive home his point for his entire career has resulted in his being designated its chief proponent. The current debate concerning Husserl’s metaphysical position may be said to have been initiated by Richard Holmes’s 1975 paper “Is Transcendental Phenomenology Committed to Idealism?,”¹ which, like most of the recent literature, identifies Ingarden as such. With regard exclusively to Ingarden’s interpretation, the issue as addressed in the recent literature focusses on<br>

  Book Title: A Theology for the Earth-The Contributions of Thomas Berry and Bernard Lonergan<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): DALTON ANNE MARIE<br>
  Abstract: While many feel that something must be done, few perceive the state of the ecological crisis as a "profound religious problem." While Thomas Berry sought to fire the imagination and motivate his listener to action, Bernard Lonergan was absorbed by the growing gulf between traditional Christian theology and its relevance to modern problems. This book brings together the work of these dynamic thinkers and examines their mutual contribution to theology for our time and for our planet.<br>

  Abstract: While most of the relevant categories of Bernard Lonergan’s thought will be employed in more detail below, some comments about his distinction between two language categories (description and explanation) shed initial light on the nature of Berry’s proposal. Succinctly stated, description deals with things as they relate to us; explanation with things as they relate to each other.¹ So, for instance, to speak of a wheel as round is to

  Author(s) Anderson Paul N.<br>
  Abstract: The words of Jesus pose the greatest challenge to scholars seeking to identify the message of Jesus within his ministry. If the historical Jesus indeed spoke in parables about the kingdom of God—a near-certain likelihood—why does John’s narrative include no Synoptic-like parables, and why is the kingdom of God mentioned only in John 3:3,5? There Jesus declares access to the kingdom requires being born from above, and in John 18:36–37 he describes the character of his kingdom as one of truth; but unlike the teachings of the Synoptic Jesus, John’s kingdom sayings are contrastive statements (the kingdom<br>

  Author(s) Culpepper R. Alan<br>
  Abstract: The Gospel of John poses unique and formidable problems for those interested in identifying traditional sayings of Jesus. The Jesus Seminar, for example, found only one authentic saying of Jesus in the Gospel of John (John 4:44—the dishonored hometown prophet; see Funk, Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar 1993, 412). The difficulty in using traditional criteria for identifying Jesus sayings in John was aptly stated by Norman Perrin.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cx3vmb">John, Jesus, and History, Volume 3</a><br>
  Author(s) Theobald Michael<br>
  Abstract: There’s no denying that the Johannine Jesus speaks entirely differently from the Synoptic Jesus. Whereas the latter proclaims the kingdom
                  of God, the former continuously speaks ofhimself : “Iam the bread of life” (John 6:35); “Ihave come that you might have life” (John 10:10); “Ihave come from the Father into the world,Iwill leave the world again and go to the Father” (John 16:27).¹ This persistent, penetrating “I” seems to have little to do with the simple statements about God by the Synoptic Jesus, which scholars have taken to be more likely to be historical.<br>

  Abstract: What does the Johannine Son of Man have to do with the historical Jesus? In modern critical scholarship, the answer is: Absolutely nothing. The sentiment of the majority of scholars can still be summed up in the statement of Ernst Käsemann (1964, 32): “We must admit that nowhere in the New Testament is the life story of Jesus so emptied of all real content as it already is here [in the Gospel of John], where it seems to be almost a projection of the present back into the past.” Normally, when John’s Gospel is allowed at all as a source<br>

  Abstract: Walking through Washington Square in New York City, I discovered this inscription cut into a monument: “The event is in the hand of God.” Though poetically articulated, this is of course an imprecise statement, because God, rather, is always in the hands of the event. That is to say, God is something other than the omnipresent demiurge who pronounced the words “fiat lux.” Perhaps what we call God is only the blink of an eye at the instant the voice resounded: Let there be light. It may well have been the combined and undefined vibration of matter and perception, of<br>

  Abstract: The comics series
                  100 Bulletsopens on a rainy street with the words “Bang. You’re dead ” (1:5). The premise is simple: an agent offers an attaché case of one hundred untraceable bullets and an unregistered gun to people who have been wronged in life. Equipped with the evidence the agent supplies, they have carte blanche to take their revenge. After the opening statement of “Bang. You’redead,” the series spends the remaining one hundred issues of its run exploring the moral and ethical implications of firing or not firing that lethal bullet. The series can be read as a<br>

  Author(s) Glajar Valentina<br>
  Abstract: Two languages inform the writings of Nobel Prize laureate Herta Müller: German as well as Romanian bear on Müller’s novels, essays, and collage poetry. Born in 1953 in German-speaking Nitzkydorf—a Banat-Swabian village in southwestern Romania—Müller grew up as part of a linguistic and ethnic minority in a Communist state. Her writing career began with a fictionalized portrayal of the village of her childhood, an isolated backward community deeply influenced by National Socialism and characterized by narrow-minded ethnocentrism. Romanian literary censorship, which had dramatically increased in the 1980s, delayed the publication of Müller’s first collection of short stories for<br>

  Abstract: Loneliness is an unnatural and unwanted state of isolation in which the individual cannot thrive.¹ It is not to be confused with solitude, which may be sought and savored. Loneliness is often seen as a feature of modernity, associated with the breakdown of traditional communities and extended family structures. In the second half of the twentieth century it was identified more as a product of Western capitalist societies, which tend to atom ize individuals, than of Eastern bloc societies. The latter attempted to unite their citizens through socialist values and central planning, while in practice often uniting them in disaffection.<br>

  Abstract: I do not think it a stretch to say that translating Native verbal arts occupies an unseen boundary with its comings and goings between what is actually said, what is interpreted, then invented out of those words, and the written text that is presented as a faithful rendition of what was originally stated or sung. And while translation is of course reliant upon getting the words straight, I think the heart of translation is centrally about re-expressing the rhythms and movements expressed by those words. As we are all very much aware, words have the ability to move us. And<br>

  Abstract: World War I was not “the Good War.” Americans in general were reluctant to become involved in what was widely viewed as a “European war” (Wilson’s successful presidential campaign slogan in 1916 was “He kept us out of war”), and the draft did not help foster general enthusiasm for it. Among artists and intellectuals, the war was even less popular. Randolph Bourne, an influential writer and critic associated with the radical little magazine

  Abstract: As a young man, Jesse Mabry showed an enterprising spirit but little tendency toward extravagance. Born in South Carolina in 1791 or 1792, by 1810 Mabry had married a woman named Nancy and the couple had established an independent household in Union County, situated in the northwestern Piedmont section of the state. They did not own much and likely brought in some income by selling cloth that Nancy wove herself, but they amassed wealth slowly and steadily over time. Sometime around 1820, they left South Carolina to pursue new economic opportunities in Mississippi, and by 1830 Jesse Mabry had become<br>

  Abstract: Cuban slavery impacted early American capitalism through Russia. In the early nineteenth century, as the U.S.–West Indies trade increasingly centered on the Spanish colony of Cuba, a small nexus of elite Americans—particularly New Englanders—became owners of Cuban plantations.¹ Intensive American participation in the Cuban slave regime both reinforces and complicates scholars’ recognition of slavery as a national rather than sectional bedrock of U.S. state formation. When convenient or profitable, the character of U.S. slavery was also transnational.² At the very moment of the continued expansion of the North American plantation frontier and the formation of the U.S.<br>

  Book Title: The Grecanici of Southern Italy-Governance, Violence, and Minority Politics<br>

  Abstract: The Grecanici of Southern Italyprovides a comprehensive ethnography that examines the ways the minority developed and sustain enduring cultural forms of solidarity and relatedness. Stavroula Pipyrou proposes the concept of "fearless governance" to describe overlapping and sometimes contradictory systems of power, authority, and relational networks that enable the Grecanici to achieve political representation at the intersection of local, national, and global encounters. Refuting easy assumptions of top-down governmental influence, Pipyrou shows how the Grecanici find political representation through the European Union and UNESCO, state policy, civic associations, family networks and illegal organizations; not being afraid to take risks, incur wrath, lose friends, or risk death in challenging the political status-quo.<br>

Scholars such as Jennifer Jackson Preece (1997), Mark Mazower (2004), and Jane Cowan (2010) examine the historical predicament of developing a comprehensive UN framework toward the protection of minority populations after 1918. Looking at the issue of the minorities from a top-down perspective, these studies delve deeply into the logics of treaties and the thorny position of minority recognition on a pan-European level.

  Abstract: In her article “Sheroes and Villains: Conceptualizing Colonial and Contemporary Violence against Women in Africa,” Amina Mama locates the source of contemporary African models of patriarchal violence in colonial states. These states not only used the famous colonial formula “Ayons les femmes et le reste suivra” [Let’s win over women and the men will follow] (“L’Algérie se dévoile” 18; “Algeria Unveiled” 37) but also adopted European concepts of womanhood such as repressive domestication.

  Abstract: In this chapter, I examine how women writers redefine war in their writing about political violence. The term
                  warnormally refers to a “hostile contention by means of armed forces, carried on between nations, states, or rulers, or between parties in the same nation or state; the employment of armed forces against a foreign power, or against an opposing party in the state” (Oxford English Dictionary Online). This definition needs to be expanded to include several consequences of war with a disproportionate impact upon women, such as sexual violence; the destruction of family and the loss of husbands, sons, and<br>

  Book Title: Views from the Margins-Creating Identities in Modern France<br>

  Author(s): Curtis Sarah A.<br>
  Abstract: What does it mean to be French? What constitutes "Frenchness"? Is it birth, language, attachment to republicanism, adherence to cultural norms? In contemporary France, these questions resonate in light of the large number of non-French and non-European immigrants, many from former French colonies, who have made France home in recent decades. Historically, French identity has long been understood as the product of a centralized state and culture emanating from Paris that was itself central to European history and civilization. Likewise, French identity in terms of class, gender, nationality, and religion mainly has been explained as a strong, indivisible core, against which marginal actors have been defined.<br>

  Abstract: Based on a decade's work in Ginzburg's archives, the book discusses previously unknown manuscripts and uncovers a wealth of new information about the author's life, focusing on Ginzburg's quest for a new kind of writing adequate to her times. She writes of universal experiences-frustrated love, professional failures, remorse, aging-and explores the modern fragmentation of identity in the context of war, terror, and an oppressive state. Searching for a new concept of the self, and deeming the psychological novel (a beloved academic specialty) inadequate to express this concept, Ginzburg turned to fragmentary narratives that blur the lines between history, autobiography, and fiction.<br>

  Abstract: During the first decades of the twentieth century, Australian scientists, supported by their British counterparts, worked to convince the recently formed (1901) Commonwealth government of Australia, a federation of the states and territories,¹ of the value of anthropology. They argued that it had value as an academic discipline for two reasons: first, it sought to ascertain the laws of human sociality and origins, and second, it would be useful in training colonial field officials (Kuper 1996; Kuklick 1991; Stocking 1995).

  Book Title: Firewalking and Religious Healing-The Anastenaria of Greece and the American Firewalking Movement<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Danforth Loring M.<br>
  Abstract: "If the Saint calls you, if you have an open road, then you don't feel the fire as if it were your enemy," says one of the participants in the Anastenaria. This compelling work evokes and contrasts two forms of firewalking and religious healing: first, the Anastenaria, a northern Greek ritual in which people who are possessed by Saint Constantine dance dramatically over red-hot coals, and, second, American firewalking, one of the more spectacular activities of New Age psychology. Loring Danforth not only analyzes these rituals in light of the most recent work in medical and symbolic anthropology but also describes in detail the lives of individual firewalkers, involving the reader personally in their experiences: he views ritual therapy as a process of transformation and empowerment through which people are metaphorically moved from a state of illness to a state of health. Danforth shows that the Anastenaria and the songs accompanying it allow people to express and resolve conflict-laden family relationships that may lead to certain kinds of illnesses. He also demonstrates how women use the ritual to gain a sense of power and control over their lives without actually challenging the ideology of male dominance that pervades Greek culture. Comparing the Anastenaria with American firewalking, Danforth includes a gripping account of his own participation in a firewalk in rural Maine. Finally he examines the place of anthropology in a postmodern world in which the boundaries between cultures are becoming increasingly blurred.<br>

  Abstract: À l’heure de la désaffection des traditions religieuses historiques, les couvents, les monastères et les abbayes qui émaillent les paysages de nos villes et de nos campagnes sont menacés de déshérence : les communautés qui les ont bâtis, habités et qui en ont assuré la survie n’ont plus les moyens d’assumer leur charge patrimoniale. En même temps que s’impose l’affection citoyenne pour ces vastes ensembles et leurs jardins, ceux-ci sont de plus en plus convoités à des fins de développement. Que faire de cet héritage riche et lourd ? Cet ouvrage collectif regroupe des contributions qui apportent des pistes de réflexion sur les problèmes de la sécularisation, de la réaffectation ou de la gouvernance d’anciens ensembles conventuels. Il vise également à nourrir la discussion sur les implications financières, juridiques, urbanistiques et mémorielles du changement de vocation des couvents et de leur mise en valeur. In this time of abandonment of historical religious traditions, the convents, monasteries, and abbeys that punctuate our rural and urban landscapes are in danger of becoming escheated properties. The communities who built them, lived in them, and have thus far ensured their survival can no longer bear the burden of their heritage value. These magnificent properties and their gardens are increasingly the objects of society’s affection, and yet at the same time are more and more coveted by real estate developers. What is to be done with such a rich and weighty legacy? This collective publication brings together contributions that provide ways of thinking about the issues of secularization, adaptive reuse, or the governance of former religious buildings. It also intends to contribute to the debate on the financial, legal, urbanistic, and memorial implications of the new destinies of convents and their redevelopment.<br>

  Author(s) Schwabe Claudia<br>
  Abstract: From the earliest stage of storytelling, oral tales and their mani fold retellings have served not only to mesmerize, entertain, and captivate listeners, but also to educate audiences about valuable life lessons and uni versal truths. Early tales contained examples of human conduct and provided guidelines on how to overcome serious challenges, survival struggles, or master problematic interpersonal relations. As Jack Zipes (2012) states in his recent study

  Abstract: One of my German students once stumbled upon several fairy-tale film adaptations by the
                  Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft(DEFA), the stateowned film studio of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), and inquired: “Are these movies very different from the Grimms’ original fairy tales?” This question inspired me to design a German fairy-tale class that ties students’ interest in fairy tales and films to a significant and fascinating part of Germany’s recent history. Although the Grimms’Märchen(fairy tales) are firmly embedded in courses and syllabi in German language, literature, folklore, culture, history, narrative theory, and fairy-tale studies, they are rarely discussed in<br>

  Abstract: The dislocation of form and content: I take my epigraph from a piece in which Brett Levinson reviews the state of the Latinamericanist field in recent years. He emphasizes the extent to which scholarship on Latin America has been fundamentally defined by the need to point to or show phenomena that are most essentially characterized by the lack of graspable form, or formlessness, if by form we understand Western schemata meant to determine universally what is and is not thinkable, and more generally, what can and should be and what falls beneath the dignity of Being.

  Abstract: In 2007 Fidel Castro was in seclusion, and no one seemed to know much about the actual state of his health. Since July 2006 his physical condition had become a state secret. The absence of the leader coincided with the reappearance of figures who had been in positions of power during some of the Revolution’s most repressive years. These were people who many thought had disappeared for good from the public sphere. Their return, in the nation’s various media, gave rise to a clamorous and by now well-known exchange of e-mails, some written by victims of these henchmen.¹ The discussion<br>

  Book Title: Taking Hold of the Real-Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Profound Worldliness of Christianity<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Harvey Barry<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer writes in one of his last prison letters that he had “come to know and understand more and more the profound this-worldliness of Christianity." In Taking Hold of the Real, Barry Harvey engages in constructive conversation with Bonhoeffer, contending that the “shallow and banal this-worldliness" of modern society is ordered to a significant degree around the social technologies of religion, culture, and race. These mechanisms displace human beings from their traditional connections with particular locales, and relocate them in their “proper places" as determined by the nation-state and capitalist markets. Christians are called to participate in the profound this-worldliness that breaks into the world in the apocalyptic action of Jesus Christ, a form of life that requires discipline and an understanding of death and resurrection. The church is a sacrament of this new humanity, performing for all to hear the polyphony of life that was prefigured in the Old Testament and now is realised in Christ. Unable to find a faithful form of this-worldliness in wartime Germany, Bonhoeffer joined the conspiracy against Hitler, a decision aptly contrasted with a small French church that, prepared by its life together over many generations, saved thousands of Jewish lives.<br>

  Abstract: Long before the age of the megalopolis, movement has defined cities. As complex constellations of people, objects and signs, cities are spaces where social, political and historical relations undergo constant negotiation and where the realities and representations of urban life are in persistent and dynamic states of becoming. This is to say that each person’s experience of the city organizes an intricately shifting site for the production and exchange of meaning. Simply walking through the streets – choosing a particular path to follow, avoiding certain others – involves many acts of interpretation and mediation, ways of practising urban space that<br>

  Abstract: The only part of Reyes’s quotation that interests me here is the chronicle, its generic nature and its acceptance as literature.¹ The conceptual structure of Reyes’s statement presumes that the chronicle is a genre, and a literary genre at that. But is it really? In asking the question “what is literature?” or “what is a genre?” we are confronted with a complex problem. One could answer the question in a straightforward manner, simply stating that literature is everything that our traditions recognize as literature and that genres are categories of texts, such as chronicles or missionary plays.

After the childless couple loses their shop and all their assets, Menasheh Hayim sets out to raise money as a beggar, with the help of a letter from the town rabbi, which lists his name and misfortunes.

While it is true that, in the narrator’s words, “Hirshl and Mina’s story is over,” the novel itself does not conclude with their dialogue. In fact, instead of granting the reader a sense of closure, the novel ends with the narrator’s statement that Bluma’s story isnotover.

  Abstract: After the epochal collapse of state-level societies at the end of the Bronze Age, most of the eastern Mediterranean experienced new forms of statehood for which new social identities were essential. The old system’s failure to prevent disaster would have discredited earlier ideologies defining personal achievement and social status through reference to the supernatural (for the Aegean, see Mikrakis 2013, 229–30, with references). Practices revolving around the human body, the handiest tool for survival in periods of hardship such as in the so-called Dark Age that followed the collapse, would have increased sharply, causing tensions and conflicts.<br>

  Abstract: Jacques Lacan (2001, 341) has famously declared that “it is not enough to decide on the basis of its effect—Death. it still remains to be decided which death, that which is brought by life or that which brings life.” Of course, for Lacan, whose psychoanalysis has much to do with one’s relations to death and the dead (Luepnitz 2003, 232), there is a difference between biological and psychic death and hence between mortality and vitality. Nevertheless, his statement does highlight, in a delightfully ironic way, how talk about death can—or should—be both specific and ambiguous at the<br>

Within this context film has attracted far greater attention than photography because of its explosive potential as a mimetic medium that can convey a sense of unfolding time and engender fresh modes of collective reception. Yet the photographic image was an even more ubiquitous and flexible instrument of visual dissemination because of the unprecedented proliferation of newspapers<br>

  Abstract: Many attempts to define cult movies and to describe their appeal are characterized by notions of doubleness, contradiction, and introjection. For example, J. P. Telotte finds in the “etymological underpinnings of ‘cult’” (14) a complex of potential meanings pointing to a dialectical impulse to possess and to be possessed, to express selfhood through surrendering to an external other. Thus, he suggests, the cult movie transgresses norms, enabling the cultist “to fashion a statement of difference” (14), even as it establishes “a stable ground from which to make that assertion, a ground
                  withinthe very boundaries” that are being transgressed (15).<br>

  Abstract: After arguing that “strange” narrators can be employed as tools for phenomenological investigation, this chapter places this investigation into a broader perspective by looking at the animal narrators of Andrzej Zaniewski’s Rat (1995; originally published in Polish in 1993) and Marie Darrieussecq’s

Zunshine’s argument is well known: we feel attracted to fiction because it affords opportunities for exercising our “theory of mind” (our capacity to attribute mental states to other subjects), thus functioning as some sort of cognitive “weightlifting” (124–25).

  Abstract: Much water has flown down the Jordan, Jhelum, ganges, Cauvery, Mahanadi, thames, rhines and Mississippi rivers since the dawn of humanity and the independence of india, and in recent years much discussion has taken place over the nature of secularism in india, including its uses and abuses. Broadly speaking, we can classify the various contending positions on secularism in india into three approaches: a) those who defend the secular character of the Indian Republic as enshrined in the Constitution of India; b) those who oppose it on the grounds that the practice of Indian state-led secularism has been a pseudo-secularism;<br>

  Abstract: The Cartesian-Kantian anthropomorphic subject represents a state of continual immanence in terms of its indefinite and infinite possibilities. The linguistic turn takes an anthropocentric form that has been embedded in the Cartesian-Kantian metaphysics of presence. Wittgenstein, especially, takes language as an enactable rule-governed activity, thereby making it immanent to the ‘lived experiences’ of the users of language. Heidegger introduces a comprehensive embeddedness of being in language and viceversa, thereby assigning it a hermeneutical closure. In such anthropomorphic and anthropocentric moves, what is lost is the very ground of reality on which language must act. A project of recovery of the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxpcqw">The Spirit of Luc Boltanski</a><br>
  Author(s) Spence David<br>
  Abstract: This chapter relates some of Luc Boltanski’s theoretical reflections to the study of the European Union, focusing on its endeavours to create a European-level approach to policy areas hitherto the ‘competence’ of member states. The chapter discusses problematic implications of European integration, such as the notion that some form of European state may emerge or that the ‘evercloser union’ – one of the EU’s ambitions – implies the creation of European citizenship and parallel forms of identity and class allegiances to those found in traditional nation-states.

  CHAPTER TWO  Pierre Bourdieu: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxpd95">The Legacy of Pierre Bourdieu</a><br>
  Author(s) Fowler Bridget<br>
  Abstract: Derek Robbins states categorically that ‘[t]here are no grounds for considering Bourdieu was ever a Marxist’ (2006: 513), whilst Brubaker argues that although Bourdieu might appear to be in the Marxist tradition, his critiques of Marxism should make us think otherwise (1985: 761). Although I shall be taking issue with both of these conclusions, I do not want to claim the opposite: that Marx alone influenced him. Bourdieu was unusually inventive in drawing also on Weber, Durkheim, Husserl, Mauss, Elias, and Pascal, not to mention others. Given more space, I would draw out all of these different strands in the<br>

  1  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxxq00">The Vision of the Priestly Narrative</a><br>
  Abstract: It is generally agreed that it is relatively easy to distinguish Priestly material (P)¹ from non-Priestly material (non-P) in Genesis–Numbers (Joshua).² However, when it comes to identifying the overall theology of the Priestly material, or what it might be primarily about, there is much more contention. A range of views have been proposed, primarily in articles³ and sections in books whose primary concern is mostly with one section of P⁴ or with source/redactional issues or with defining the extent or possible levels within P.⁵ Philip Jenson’s statement that “there have been surprisingly few full-scale theological studies of P in<br>

  Author(s) Poser Ruth<br>
  Abstract: The book of Ezekiel strikes us as strange. Readers find the enormous amount of violence contained in the text disturbing or even shy away from reading it altogether. The characters in the narrative appear only as people wounded, tortured, or devastated by acts of war; the catastrophe seems to have broken them all: the prophet himself, the people of Israel, the populations of surrounding nations. Even YHWH is portrayed as affected by the violence and brutality.<br>

  The Future of Islam from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h4mh5h">New Thinking in Islam</a><br>
  Abstract: The thinkers presented here have confronted a central problem of modern Islamic theology, namely, how to deal with specific Qur’anic statements. For us Muslims today this is an existential question since many Qur’anic statements do not agree with what we accept as values – at least when these statements remain uninterpreted. This complex of problems taken in itself can be discussed and a new way of interpretation devised and developed, for example, one that is favorable to women. But it can also be placed within the context of a more far-reaching question and an answer can be attempted as to<br>

  Author(s) DAVIS ANGELA Y.<br>
  Abstract: The concept of empowerment is hardly new to Afro-American women. for almost a century, we have been organized in bodies that have sought collectively to develop strategies that illuminate the way to economic and political power for ourselves and our communities. In the last decade of the nineteenth century, after having been repeatedly shunned by the racially homogeneous women’s rights movement, black women organized their own club movement. In 1895—five years after the founding of the General Federation of Women’s Clubs, which consolidated a club movement reflecting concerns of middle-class white women—one hundred black women from ten states<br>

  Author(s) Chakrabarty Dipesh<br>
  Abstract: The International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) names the current epoch the Holocene (“entirely recent”), which began about 11,700 years ago, after the last major ice age (Stromberg 2013). Many students of the Earth’s climate argue that, in view of human effects on the biosphere, this name is no longer adequate. They suggest that we may have entered a new geological epoch when humanity acts on the planet as a geophysical force: the Anthropocene. The first statement in this regard was made jointly by Paul J. Crutzen, a Nobel Prize–winning chemist from the Max Planck Institute, and Eugene F.<br>

  Author(s) Takach Geo<br>
  Abstract: In the industrialized world, petroleum fuels the INFRASTRUCTURE of our societies and the logistics of our lives. Yet its ubiquity and power transcend gas pumps, foodstuffs, and countless other delights of contemporary existence. Sure, oil fills state and private coffers, builds Brobdingnagian beacons like Dubai, and incites the odd bloodbath. But it can also color the soul of its sites of production by defining expressions of local values and representations of that place to the world. Take my home province of Alberta, Canada—to which many ecologically concerned global citizens would hastily add, “please.” Now playing ball with behemoths like Saudi<br>

  Abstract: The Niger Delta is where Nigeria’s plagues of political gangsterism, corruption, and poverty converge. What is happening in the Niger Delta is nothing short of a militarized insurgent struggle against the violent machinery of state security forces with a terrible reputation. At the same time, there is something distinctive about this violence; the militants’ struggle is a backlash against a long history of exploitation, the presence of transnational oil corporations, a style of politics dependent upon violence, and myriad groups, gangs, and cults with no leadership as such.<br>

  Author(s) Grusin Richard<br>
  Abstract: More than a decade after 9/11, the networked world remains in an acute state of “mediashock.” At the first sign of meteorological turmoil, social unrest, financial turbulence, or natural cataclysm, news media shift into 24–7 crisis mode, generating on-the-ground reports, live updates, multiple commentaries, and breaking news. CNN pioneered this mode in global cable news as far back as the 1980s, but the media’s obsession with remediating disaster and premediating shock has intensified in the twenty-first century, jump-started by the events of 9/11 but escalating since then. With the exception of regularly scheduled events like to the Olympics or<br>

  Metabolism from:

  Author(s) Dickinson Adam<br>
  Abstract: In all living things, ENERGY is consumed in specific physical and chemical reactions. Respiration, reproduction, digestion, blood circulation, and waste removal are functions of these metabolic processes. One driver of metabolism is the endocrine system, which regulates the flow of hormones through the body. Hormones act as a complex exchange of messages among different states and locations. The thyroid gland secretes instructions that increase the rate at which cells utilize energy from food. Human reproduction is similarly governed by sensitivity to chemical messengers like estrogen and testosterone. But the conventional energy sources that power economies and give rise to myriad<br>

  Abstract: Figure 15, produced by the International Energy Agency, maps the flow of the world’s total production and consumption of ENERGY (in various states and materials) between myriad origins and destinations. Although the diagram represents sources ranging from water to COAL, they are all converted into a single unit of measurement—the Mtoe, or millions of tons of oil equivalent. This visualization of global energy flows is just one example of how energy topologies (or energyscapes) are mapped and analyzed (Strauss, Rupp, and Love 2012; Appadurai 1990). Energy is analyzed in terms of type, source, capacity, conversion, distribution, etc., across various<br>

  Author(s) Worden Daniel<br>
  Abstract: Texas looms large in contemporary oil culture. The state’s first major oil well, Spindletop, came in in 1901 and led to the formation of Gulf Oil and Texaco. Since then, Texas has figured in oil culture as a site of extraction and refining, a center for the multinational corporate oil industry, and an anchor for the oil industry’s ideological construction as an innately heroic, individualistic, and deeply American enterprise. This prominence is somewhat odd, considering that Pennsylvania was the site of the modern oil industry’s origin in the United States.

After a decade of involvement with the project, Ben was moving on. In the autonomist equivalent of an exit meeting, Ben declared his exit from a collective whose stated goal was to exit from work itself, to “substruct the planetary work machine,” in the<br>

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

  12  “Nonsynchronism,” Traditional Music, and Memory in Ireland from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1j1nv2c">Memory Ireland</a><br>
  Author(s) COLEMAN STEVE<br>
  Abstract: “Sound,” the American composer Morton Feldman wrote, “does not know its history” (2000, 22). Feldman’s statement captures a particularly modernist approach to the material aspect of art: in the case of music, sound is to be encountered as a thing in itself, without any immediate connection to exterior meaning or reality. The desire for the experience of pure artistic form implies its converse, also desired, in which art is experienced as an object in time, linked to tradition and occasion. To set these two aspects of artistic experience against one another is the hallmark of the modern sensibility. Modernity, as<br>

  Abstract: Emphasis on the great missionary movement of the nineteenth century sometimes gives the impression that Africa was one of the last continents to be evangelized and that missionary work was largely undertaken by Europeans and North Americans. This seriously misrepresents the state of affairs. Orthodox Christianity flourished in northeast Africa for more than a millennium before the onset of the Western missionary endeavor. The Acts of the Apostles records a story of the conversion of an Ethiopian (or Nubian) official by the evangelist Philip. This comes in the chapter before Paul, the apostle to Europe, is introduced.

Moreover, racial attitudes have differed according to denomination, among sponsoring groups, from mission field to mission field (e. g., the attitudes of missionaries to Africa differed from those of missionaries to Asia), from mission station to mission station, and even among individual missionaries working in the same area and for the same organization.<br>

  Abstract: If in Javanese families potency should concentrate in the person of the father, in larger realms, such as the village and the state, potency should concentrate in males of similarly elevated status. Efforts to protect and magnify impressions of a leader’s potency, efforts to benefit by it, and efforts to escape any control it might imply mark political relations in these domains much as they do in the family. As a result, m all these political relations, the paradoxical concept of quiescent power influences everyone’s behavior.<br>

Instead of the theological concerns and intellectual questioning of Greek drama, Seneca develops the moral conflicts which he took over from the Greek dramatists in ways that owe at least as much to Virgil and Ovid as to Sophocles and Euripides. From his Roman predecessors he inherited a rich vocabulary for exploring morbid states of mind, the dark world<br>

  Abstract: The history of Ireland and of the Irish is full of stories of deprival, to the extent that they were, for a long time, divested of houses, estates, land, country, and nation, and forced to emigrate. Irish literature, inevitably, has bore witness to this history of deprivation recreating it once and again in an attempt to overcome that trauma, by means of the transformation, reorientation, or re-evaluation of the experience of loss (Balaev, 2008: 164). Recent examples by representative writers of the Irish literary scene are, among others, Joseph O’Connor (

  Abstract: Tourism tends to be observed as an indispensable but regrettable epiphenomenon. For many states it provides a major source of income, facilitating commerce and jobs that make up an important part of the national economy. At the same time, there is a tendency to see tourism as involving a pernicious commodification of space, culture, and people’s lives in general. Common conceptions of tourism tend to circle around cliché and stereotype. In an increasingly globalised economy, tourism is seen as bringing with it particularly reductive and restrictive forms of interaction across national and cultural borders.

Time’s three perspectival states of past, present, and potential future remain fixed in their successive sequencing. Yet the eras to which they apply are always being updated. As that happens, more history is generated daily for humans to consider.<br>

To be sure, a lot of academic writing (not yours or mine, of course) richly merits these scornful epithets. Many academics themselves will tell you that you compromise your career if you write in<br>

  “AND ROSE UP TO PLAY”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npn08">In Search of the Early Christians</a><br>
  Abstract: The logic of Paul’s counsel to the Corinthian Christians about “meat offered to idols” has long troubled interpreters. A particularly difficult problem has been the relation of 1 Corinthians 10:1–22 to the rest of chapters 8–10. In these verses Paul appears to adopt an absolute prohibition of contact with pagan cults, but that accords ill with his more lenient stand in chapter 8 and in 10:23–31. Moreover, the sequence of thought in 10:1–22 has not been completely clear, either. How are the scriptural examples connected with the paraenetic warnings? How is the consoling statement about temptation<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npqs8">Freedom and Time</a><br>
  Abstract: No metaphor is more common in contemporary political theory than the one that figures democracy or self-government in the language of speech, voice, conversation, dialogue, discussion, or some other speech-cognate. “The will of the community, in a democracy, is always created through a running discussion between majority and minority. . . .”¹ “Democracy is government by public discussion. . . .”² Self-government is that “state of grace in which . . . the voice of authority is nothing other than the voice of the self.”³ “[M]odern democracy invites us to replace the notion . . . of a legitimate power,<br>

  Book Title: Frontiers of History-Historical Inquiry in the Twentieth Century<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLEY DONALD R.<br>
  Abstract: This book, the third volume of Donald Kelley's monumental survey of Western historiography, covers the twentieth century, especially Europe. As in the first two volumes, the author discusses historical methods and ideas of all sorts to provide a detailed map of historical learning. Here he carries the survey forward to our own times, confronting directly the challenges of postmodernism and historical narrative. Kelley offers highly original discussions of historians of the last half century (including friends and mentors), the "linguistic turn," the "end of history," the philosophy of history, and various new methods of histories.The book focuses first on the state of the art of history in France, Germany, Britain, and the United States on the eve of World War I. Kelley then traces every important historiographical issue and development historians have encountered in the twentieth century. With the completion of this trilogy, Kelley presents the only comprehensive modern survey of historical writing. He provides an unparalleled portrait of the rich variety of historical method along with an insider's view of the challenges of capturing history on the written page.<br>

  Book Title: Engaging the Moving Image-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Carroll Noël<br>
  Abstract: Noël Carroll, a brilliant and provocative philosopher of film, has gathered in this book eighteen of his most recent essays on cinema and television-what Carroll calls "moving images." The essays discuss topics in philosophy, film theory, and film criticism.Drawing on concepts from cognitive psychology and analytic philosophy, Carroll examines a wide range of fascinating topics. These include film attention, the emotional address of the moving image, film and racism, the nature and epistemology of documentary film, the moral status of television, the concept of film style, the foundations of film evaluation, the film theory of Siegfried Kracauer, the ideology of the professional western, and films by Sergei Eisenstein and Yvonne Rainer. Carroll also assesses the state of contemporary film theory and speculates on its prospects. The book continues many of the themes of Carroll's earlier work
      Theorizing the Moving Imageand develops them in new directions. A general introduction by George Wilson situates Carroll's essays in relation to his view of moving-image studies.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nps8x">Engaging the Moving Image</a><br>
  Abstract: In both film studies and the culture at large, there is an area of practice which is typically labelled ‘the documentary’, or perhaps less frequently, ‘nonfiction film’. These labels are roughly serviceable for practical purposes, but they are not always as theoretically precise as they might be. Therefore, in this chapter, I will propose another label for the field—namely, ‘films of presumptive assertion’—and I will attempt to define it.¹ In response to this statement of intent, some may worry that my new label and its accompanying definition are stipulative and revisionist. However, I will argue that they track<br>

  Abstract: Now that we have followed the development of Husserl’s thought about intersubjectivity, we can turn to the Fifth Meditation, which contains the classic and famous statement of his view. Supporters and opponents alike have focused on this account, and those who read the Fifth Meditation alone for the first time find it difficult to grasp the sense of all that Husserl was doing. Now that we have met with each component of his account separately as it developed, we need to look at the Meditation to see how they are knit together.¹<br>

  Abstract: Certainty can be exhilarating; uncertainty, never. There is something fundamentally disquieting about not knowing the truth of things, the real as opposed to the unreal, the facts as opposed to the theories. Admittedly, artists and intellectuals occasionally celebrate uncertainty as if it were a liberating cause, but in the end uncertainty holds no thrill for me. Pliny’s maxim that ‘‘There is nothing certain but uncertainty, and nothing more miserable and arrogant than man’’ possesses the very quality the statement means to disparage. I reserve judgment about uncertainty, just as I would about anything that cannot be demonstrated without fear of<br>

Nor do poets themselves go around behaving like Byronic misfits, taking pride in their outcast state. And this, one might be surprised to learn, is of recent cultural vintage. Fifty<br>

  Book Title: The Only Mind Worth Having-Thomas Merton and the Child Mind<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Williams Rowan<br>
  Abstract: In The Only Mind Worth Having, Fiona Gardner takes Thomas Merton’s belief that the child mind is “the only mind worth having" and explores it in the context of Jesus’ challenging, paradoxical, and enigmatic command to become like small children. She demonstrates how Merton’s belief and Jesus’ command can be understood as part of contemporary spirituality and spiritual practice. To follow Christ’s command requires a great leap of the imagination. Gardner examines what it might mean to make this leap when one is an adult without it becoming sentimental and mawkish, or regressive and pathological. Using both psychological and spiritual insights, and drawing on the experiences of Thomas Merton and others, Gardner suggests that in some mysterious and paradoxical way recovering a sense of childhood spirituality is the path towards spiritual maturity. The move from childhood spirituality to adulthood and on to a spiritual maturity through the child mind is a move from innocence to experience to organised innocence, or from dependence to independence to a state of being in-dependence with God.<br>

  Author(s) Williams Rowan<br>
  Abstract: Becoming a child again: the first reaction may be a feeling that this would be wonderful—no responsibility, no battling with expectations, no long memories of failure and ambiguity. But when Jesus of Nazareth tells us to become like children, and when spiritual masters urge us to connect with the “child mind,” they are not being nostalgic or sentimental. They are drawing our attention to something we all instinctively recognise. There is something that our habitual adult consciousness has lost or buried, and it must be found, not as a comforting reinstatement of half-forgotten happiness but as a breakthrough to<br>

  Abstract: Eastern thought has long understood the value of the child mind in the adult seeker for spiritual maturity. The child mind is seen as a place of surrender, alertness, and nakedness. It is seen as a space where there is little if any self-consciousness; there is no judgment of others. It is a time of humility. It involves an awareness of the person’s nothingness—where the person is no -thing. The child mind recognizes the person’s smallness and yet connection in the scheme of things, and in Eastern practices it is seen as a state that can be developed through<br>

In the process of defending against such existential instabilities or limit-situations, different strategies and mechanisms are employed to provide a shelter or enclosure (Gehäuse). In this article, we explore the transition from the limitsituations to enclosures in psychotic and mystical states. In both we can differentiate multiple orientations. Many individuals, who experience psychotic and mystical states, have in fact experiences of both, at least to some extent. Together with everyday, common-sense level of experience we can<br>

  Abstract: In August 1914, enthusiasm for a war that would be over by Christmas was widespread. In Germany, Thomas Mann, otherwise renowned as the nation’s great literary ironist, hailed the patriotic fervour shown by the writers with unequivocal appreciation: “Wie die Herzen der Dichter sogleich in Flammen standen, als jetzt Krieg wurde!” (How the hearts of the poets have been inflamed immediately now that war has broken out!).¹ Gerhart Hauptmann, Germany’s Nobel Prize winner of 1912, who had distanced himself from the Wilhelmine state through his critical pre-war plays, now supported the nation’s war efforts with patriotic poems.² The war, it<br>

  Abstract: The only undeniable information one can have access to is that they were living people, and now they are dead. Apart from this information, there is an accumulation of discursive constructions in which the deaths of people are used in media images and political discourses in order to endorse a given logic or strategy in the battle for recognition and power. However, the statement of passage from life to death is more than a referential base. It is a way of reinstating an ethic of recognizing the Other. It traces a path towards self-reflection that demands new and different solutions.<br>

  Book Title: Constructing Constructive Theology-An Introductory Sketch<br>
  Publisher: Fortress Press<br>
  Author(s): Wyman Jason A.<br>
  Abstract: To date, constructive theology hasn’t been viewed or conceptualized as a movement or trend in theology on its own as a whole. Questions arise as to what constructive theology is, where it came from, why it considers itself “constructive," and why constructive is something different from the ways in which theology has been done in the past. This book traces the overall historical arc of constructive theology, from proto-movement through the present. Inklings of constructive theology emerged well before it began to take any formalized shape. At the same time, an important shift occurred when a group of theologians decided to create the Workgroup on Constructive Theology. Further, even as the workgroup continues to work collectively, producing textbooks, statements, and methodologies concerning theology, many theologians who are not part of the workgroup or may not even know it exists have adopted the moniker of “constructive theologian." The book also considers the term “constructive" itself, offering possible reasons and historical contexts that led to this distinction being made in contrast to “systematic" theology and its subcategories. Constructive theology speaks to a very specific, historically situated emergence in the academy generally and in theology’s attempts to engage those shifts specifically.<br>

  Author(s) Parker Marti G.<br>
  Abstract: In most industrialized countries, the needs and demands for medical care and social services for elderly people are increasing. There are several reasons for this. One factor these countries have in common is that the number and the proportion of elderly persons is increasing. This is especially true for persons over eighty years of age. The increase is expected to continue into the next century. Since it is the oldest groups that have the greatest need for care and services, this development is creating a challenge for welfare states.<br>

Often the stories are explanations for unusual physical strength, the heroic make up of one or more of the protagonists.

They live outside Alexandria, without possessions, and spend most of their time focusing on God, or rather “Being” (Contempl.2), studying scripture, and composing music in small huts, gathering together only on Sabbath days for communal teaching and a meal.

  Abstract: Historically, gay men have primarily become fathers in the context of heterosexual relationships, or for some men through foster care, adoption, or co-parenting arrangements as sperm donors (Riggs and Due). Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, however, gay men living in western countries have increasingly made use of commercial surrogacy services (Everingham, Stafford-Bell, and Hammarberg). The increased use of these services has become possible as a result of legislative change in countries such as the U.S. (in which many states now allow for the contracting of surrogacy services), in addition to the provision of services in countries where the<br>

  Abstract: I premised at the outset that the idea of community is often romantic and utopian, idealising and evoking a bygone age. Often considered to have been ‘lost’ through modernity, community has also been hailed as the solution to social ‘problems’ by successive governments in the UK. From the New Right to the present Conservative-led coalition government, community has become synonymous with a relinquishment of responsibility by the state (Hoggett et al, 1997). When the women made their move to Spain, community in policy circles was presented by the then government, as a panacea to the lack of social cohesion among<br>

  Abstract: The notion of Ithaki for most men and women has been historically and socially differentiated, the result of socially determined gender expectations and personal and social constraints. Men’s journeys in this century have typically been associated with their lives outside the home and at work (Seccombe, 1986). However, the social and economic changes of the past three decades have made many men feel that the journey to the island is no longer a well-charted one.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t8982m">Biography and social exclusion in Europe</a><br>
  Author(s) Breckner Roswitha<br>
  Abstract: More and more people share the experience of migration, in the sense of crossing nation-state borders to start a new life in a different society. Theories of globalisation and postmodernism present this experience as a typical occurrence, almost taken for granted, in the lives of growing numbers of people. Even though migration constitutes the ‘normality’ of many societies to a greater or lesser degree, the public and, not least, the sociopolitical discourses of migration, are still predominantly shaped by the view that the large-scale movement of people somehow constitutes a problem. In the first place, the ‘problem’ of migration within<br>

  Author(s) Cooper Andrew<br>
  Abstract: This chapter asks questions about the conceptualisation of the ontology of the social subject that informs biographical methods of research. Arguing from a psychoanalytically informed view of the subject, I suggest that emotionality and creativity as it derives from our capacity to dream (or what Freud referred to as primary process thinking), and our hesitant and uncertain development as subjects out of infantile states of near complete inarticulacy, are all necessary dimensions of a fully developed concept of what it is to be a subject.<br>

  Book Title: Localism and neighbourhood planning-Power to the people?<br>
  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Bradley Quintin<br>
  Abstract: A critical analysis of neighbourhood planning. Setting empirical evidence from the UK against international examples, the Editors engage in broader debates on the purposes of planning and the devolution of power to localities.Governments around the world are seeing the locality as a key arena for effecting changes in governance, restructuring state/civil society relations and achieving sustainable growth. This is the first book to critically analyse this shift towards localism in planning through exploring neighbourhood planning; one of the fastest growing, most popular and most contentious contemporary planning initiatives. Bringing together original empirical research with critical perspectives on governance and planning, the book engages with broader debates on the purposes of planning, the construction of active citizenship, the uneven geographies of localism and the extent to which power is actually being devolved. Setting this within an international context with cases from the US, Australia and France the book reflects on the possibilities for the emergence of a more progressive form of localism.<br>

  ONE  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t89h5j">Localism and neighbourhood planning</a><br>
  Author(s) Bradley Quintin<br>
  Abstract: This statement and the legislation that followed it unleashed a new wave of community-based planning in England. As one of a range of rights and powers introduced by the localism agenda of 2011, neighbourhood groups were able to draw up statutory land-use plans, thereby creating a new tier in the planning framework. Five years later, with close to 2,000 neighbourhoods formally engaged in the process, it was clear that neighbourhood planning had emerged as one of the most widespread community initiatives in recent years and one of the most current topics within spatial planning. As such, it demands further investigation,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t89h5j">Localism and neighbourhood planning</a><br>
  Author(s) Sparling William<br>
  Abstract: Whether the state strategy of localism delivers on its promise of empowerment depends on the extent to which it devolves effective instruments of policy to citizens and communities. The devolution of localism is commonly conveyed by invitation to citizens to join local governance structures or be included in neighbourhood management projects (Lowndes and Sullivan, 2008). Citizens seldom acquire the right to make decisions as a collective, and it is rare for statutory power to be designed to be wielded by public participants rather than public officials (Bradley, 2015). This chapter examines the use of statutory planning powers to effect spatial<br>

  Author(s) Bradley Quintin<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between people and place possesses a powerful fascination for governments. The belief that people feel an emotional bond with the place in which they live has motivated state strategies of localism, with their promise to devolve policymaking to neighbourhoods. Localism has been understood as a technology of spatial governmentality that uses place and place relationships to influence the behaviour and subjectivity of citizens (Gibson, 2001; Davoudi and Madanipour, 2015). The same bond between people and place is mobilised by community organisations and citizen groups to inspire participants and foster their ability to bring about change (Somerville, 2016). A<br>

It discusses the concept of locality, identifies the further potential of community planning beyond land use and explores the impact of different state and governance structures on ideas of localism and devolution.

  Author(s) Zetlaoui-Léger Jodelle<br>
  Abstract: Planning in France has always been a state affair. In the 17th century, a territorial administration was created to implement the rational organisation of space through centralised infrastructure as the cornerstone of the new-born nation state and, from the late 18th century, a vector for republican values (Foucault, 1975). In the late 20th century, despite a shift towards decentralisation that saw private actors taking a central role in urban planning, things remained fundamentally unchanged. By defining and implementing urban laws, including the process for the declaration of public utility, national and local government remain responsible for orchestrating spatial planning.¹ This<br>

  Author(s) Burton Paul<br>
  Abstract: Localism is often used in confusing and contradictory ways in Australian political debate and policy discourse. While many state and territory governments extol the virtues of devolving responsibility for planning and service delivery down to local governments, they show no sign of relinquishing their constitutional authority over local government or of pressing for further devolution to more localised communities. State and territory governments continue to exercise their constitutional authority over local government in regulating their powers, responsibilities and finances, and, most symbolically, in enforcing the amalgamation of local councils in the name of efficiency and effectiveness, often in the face<br>

  Book Title: The Qing Formation in World-Historical Time-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Struve Lynn A.<br>
  Abstract: For many years, the Ming and Qing dynasties have been grouped as “late imperial China," a temporal framework that allows scholars to identify and evaluate indigenous patterns of social, economic, and cultural change initiated in the last century of Ming rule that imparted a particular character to state and society throughout the Qing and into the twentieth century. This paradigm asserts the autonomous character of social change in China and has allowed historians to create a “China-centered history." Recently, however, many scholars have begun emphasizing the singular qualities of the Qing. Among the eight contributors to this volume on the formation of the Qing, those who emphasize the Manchu ethos of the Qing tend to see it as part of an early modernity and stress parallel and sometimes mutually reinforcing patterns of political consolidation and cultural integration across Eurasia. Other contributors who examine the Qing formation from the perspective of those who lived through the dynastic transition see the advent of Qing rule as prompting attempts by the Chinese subjects of the new empire to make sense of what they perceived as a historical disjuncture and to rework these understandings into an accommodation to foreign rule. In contrast to the late imperial paradigm, the new ways of configuring the Qing in historical time in both groups of essays assert the singular qualities of the Qing formation.<br>

  Abstract: The complex and diffuse identity of the Hui as outlined in the preceding chapter challenges traditional approaches to ethnicity theory. Anthropology in the past was ill-equipped to address this kind of expansive ethnic identity. Given their widespread distribution and lack of cohesion, one may very rightly question the validity of Hui ethnic identity. The Hui regard themselves as an ethnic group, however, and the Chinese state registers them as an official nationality. The Hui are also beginning to play an increasingly important role in the Chinese state’s domestic affairs and in international ethnopolitics. The Hui thus pose an interesting problem<br>

  Abstract: That god created “heaven and earth” or simply “all things” is a fundamental Christian belief, repeatedly stated in scripture and featuring in the ecumenical creeds. It entails an absolute difference between God and all that is not God—absolute in the sense that this difference is incomparable with any of the relative differences between creatures. The difference can be stated in a number of ways. For example, it means that all creatures are utterly dependent on God for their very existence as well as for being the creatures they are and for all that makes for their flourishing.

  Book Title: Imagining the popular in contemporary French culture-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): LOOSELEY DAVID<br>
  Abstract: This groundbreaking book is about what ‘popular culture’ means in France, and how the term’s shifting meanings have been negotiated and contested. It represents the first theoretically informed study of the way that popular culture is lived, imagined, fought over and negotiated in modern and contemporary France. It covers a wide range of overarching concerns: the roles of state policy, the market, political ideologies, changing social contexts and new technologies in the construction of the popular. But it also provides a set of specific case studies showing how popular songs, stories, films, TV programmes and language styles have become indispensable elements of ‘culture’ in France. Deploying yet also rethinking a ‘Cultural Studies’ approach to the popular, the book therefore challenges dominant views of what French culture really means today.French Studies, Cultural Studies, Media Studies, Cultural Sociology, History/Cultural History. Specific chapters will be of relevance to: Cultural Policy, Popular Music Studies, Literary Studies, Film and TV Studies, Linguistics<br>

  Abstract: The ambition of this study has been to explore the diversity of ways in which the popular has been conceptualised and materialised in France. Whereas domestic and external accounts of French culture have spontaneously identified it with élite culture, we have argued that any rigorous analysis of it must integrate and engage with majority cultural practices. The relationship between state, national institutions and cultural production takes very particular forms in France, closely enmeshed as this relationship has been with a specific political history, and with the exceptionally strong presence of linguistic and literary tradition as a prized element of national<br>

  6  Cosmopolitanism from Below: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1w0ddq5">Negative Cosmopolitanism</a><br>
  Author(s) Ugor Paul<br>
  Abstract: Both as a moral and political project, cosmopolitanism is invested in a universalism that promotes the impartial treatment of all human beings, irrespective of one’s place of birth, ethnicity, race, gender/sexuality, or religion. Cosmopolitanism, then, is committed to a process of internationalization in which human beings everywhere are world citizens with basic rights grounded in natural law, that is, with rights which cannot be denied by any person(s), group(s), institution(s), or constituted authority, including the nation-state. Stressing the rights of the individual rather than those of the sovereign state, cosmopolitanism thus favours what Brown and Held call a “non-national sense<br>

  Abstract: In light of the human tragedies of the twentieth century, any historically sensitive engagement with the notion of cosmopolitanism today must to some extent begin

It is not just the case that international institutions such as the League of Nations were “lights” of Enlightenment that failed to provide lasting peace.¹ Cosmopolitan ideals had themselves become instruments of inhuman practice. Leading thinkers of each generation used cosmopolitan ideas of humanity to formulate rival conceptions of cultural hegemony, serving the aims of the Axis powers and the Allies, the states behind the Iron Curtain and those in front of it,<br>

  Abstract: It has often been said that if Nietzsche expresses various views about the state, these do not amount to anything systematic enough to be considered a political theory. Leiter, a prominent commentator on Nietzsche, has written that the “interpretative question” concerning Nietzsche’s political philosophy is whether “scattered remarks and parenthetical outbursts add up to
                  systematicviews on questions of philosophical significance.” His own view is that Nietzsche “has no political philosophy, in the conventional sense of a theory of the state and its legitimacy.” If he “occasionally expresses views about political matters[,] … read in context, they do not add<br>

  Abstract: Drawing on a subset of interviews conducted with fifty-two students from rural Oregon attending eleven public two-and four-year colleges across the state, I focus in this chapter on the diverse sponsorship histories of seven rural, working-class students and the social economies of literacy in which these students participate.¹ I include occasions in which students have been sponsored as well as occasions in which they have served as self-sponsors and actively sponsored the literacies of others.

  The Use of Paratext in Popular Eighteenth-Century Biography from:

  Author(s) Rogers Pat<br>
  Abstract: Why Curll, of all people? A natural reaction to the title of this essay might be to wonder what the rascally publisher Edmund Curll has to do with narratology, the theme of this volume. It might be thought that Curll (1683-1747) was an interesting fellow, no doubt, but scarcely a pioneer of writerly innovation. The case I shall try to make here is that Curll’s most characteristic productions, above all the instant biographies he brought out in the late 1720s and early 1730s, do tell us something about paratext – specifically on the way it constitutes a type of narrative statement<br>

Actually, no clear descriptions of such events in Ñuu Dzaui have come down to us, but they can be reconstructed on the basis of patterns observed in the Classic Maya cities. There, the important historical statements are inscribed as images with hieroglyphic texts on stelae and tablets and are directly related to temples, palaces, and similar structures. Their reading, therefore, always took place in the presence of the Gods, the Ancestors, and those who held important offices in the sovereign community. History was<br>

  Abstract: Plays which deal directly with political life are rare in the Irish canon. Mostly, the emphasis is on family relations, with the direct political context placed in the background, if not almost entirely effaced. But there are those exceptional occasions when contemporary playwrights have felt the need to address the state of the nation more directly by placing politicians squarely on the stage. Brian Friel did so in his 1969 play

Kierkegaard’s opposition to incongruence reveals itself in his career-long indictment of hypocrisy. Caught in the crosshairs of much of Kierkegaard’s work are the pretentious ambitions of Hegelian philosophy, whose practitioners claim to know more than they do,¹ and the insincere conformity of the Danish state church, whose members claim to believe more than they do.² Kierkegaard’s works (published and unpublished, pseudonymous and signed, philosophical and religious) exhort the reader to shun incongruence. Instead, they encourage the reader to be true to the actual, existing “single individual,”<br>

  Abstract: Amonument may never lay claim to artistic autonomy from its social and historical context. It is necessarily a product and reflection of its time, derived from the initiative of an individual, group or state. The production and reception of monuments are determined by three diachronic historical moments. First, the moment of the historical event or figure which it represents or denotes. Second, the moment at which the monument was conceived and constructed. Third, the moment(s) of its reception, when subjected to interpretation or debate due to its renewed political relevance, a decision to renovate or demolish the monument, or even<br>

  Abstract: Controversial ceremonies on the site of a central monument commemorating the deportation of Jews from Paris in 1942 became the focus of presidents Mitterrand and Chirac’s attempts to secure national reconciliation from 1992. Memories of state persecutions and victims of national policy presented an obstacle to the representation of conventional national identity. The monument and related commemorations of Vichy were nevertheless used to legitimate a cohesive official state memory: by rhetorical appeals to humanist traditions and to nationhood as an ideal, almost religious vocation.<br>

Memory cultures are not unique and confined in time and space, but are subject to what the sociologist Ulrich Beck calls ‘polycentric memory, in which non-state, transnational actors (such as social movements) also play a role’¹ – a model which he perceives to be a key to the constitution of a European memory culture. Beck dismisses Christianity, ethnicity or principles of the welfare state as foundations of either national or European heritages. A multinational<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1x76fjn">Toward a Global Civil Society</a><br>
  Author(s) Walzer Michael<br>
  Abstract: There are many definitions of “civil society,” and there is considerable disagreement at the margins about what the concept includes and excludes. I won’t add to that disagreement here (I offer my own, fairly imprecise definition in the first of the papers in this collection). It is enough to say that civil society incorporates many of the associations and identities that we value outside of, prior to, or in the shadow of state and citizenship. The subject is of great interest just now because of the argument that democracy requires a strong and lively civil society—if not for the<br>

  Abstract: “Civil society,” much more than “state,” “government,” “power,” or even “democracy,” is a term of art in political theory. There is no discovering what the concept means, let alone what it “really means.” What instead is to be done is to see if we can forge some conceptualization or reconceptualization of civil society which would be useful, given, on the one hand, some important political or ethical purposes or, on the other, some theoretical purposes.<br>

  Author(s) Altvater Elmar<br>
  Abstract: It is evident that, among other factors, the functioning of the welfare state as well as the institutional richness and democratic reach of the civil society depends heavily on the economic efficiency of a given society. Now, the question is: what does economic efficiency depend on? There are several different answers, each of them depending on their theoretical background. Neoliberals or neo-classical economists stress the meaning of the “invisible hand” of a free-market system as the crucial prerequisite for achieving the best distribution of productive factors, of finding the best path of innovation and evolution, and for realizing the highest<br>

  Author(s) Strasser Johano<br>
  Abstract: Until very recently, there had been a violent discussion going on in all highly developed industrial societies on the limits of the welfare state, and even today the topic plays an important role in the scientific and political debate in Western Europe — and North America. Ironically, this debate was started in the early 1960s (M. Friedman, F.A. Hayek) and resumed with special vehemence in the 1970s (Wilbur J. Cohen/M. Friedman, J.M. Buchanan, etc.) in a country which, compared with the standard of social welfare in, e.g., Sweden or Germany, might perhaps be counted among the “underdeveloped” welfare states: the<br>

  Abstract: The United States, as has been said for at least 100 years, is different from Europe. And it has been different, it has been said over and over again, because of the importance of the doctrine of laissez faire in the United States. This has been a society in which mobility and expansion (perhaps we could call it the frontier thesis in many ways) have played the role that politics and political negotiation and conflict have played in European societies. So, as it has often been noted, even labor in the United States never had an estate consciousness; rarely, in<br>

But on the other side of the coin is supranationalism or transnationalism, that is, the development of an increasingly integrated world economy or, more generally, a world whose problems cannot effectively be tackled let alone solved within the borders of nation states.<br>

As in 1789, 1848, and 1871, cleavages within ruling groups promoted popular revolt. Both student and worker actions were parts of<br>

  Abstract: In the conclusion of his book

And so far as a political theory is concerned, it is there in exposing the symbolic dimensions of state-power.”¹ Commenting, a few pages later, on the classical conceptions of the state, Geertz notes also that “in these views the semiotic aspects of the state remain so much a mummery.”² What seems to me very stimulating in these reflections, as in the whole analysis ofNegara, is that it opens<br>

  Abstract: This book presents a theoretical account of the music of Béla Bartok. Constantly implicit in such an account is the tension between two conflicting demands: that the account be theoretical, that is, composed of (among other things) broadly applicable general statements directed to certain kinds of musical understanding; and that it be firmly situated within the detailed context formed by Bartok’s works and life, as that context has grown in our knowledge over the past fifty years and more. Where it is necessary to choose between these demands, generality must give way to context. But the book attempts to avoid<br>

  Abstract: This paper about my father, the distinguished music historian Paul Nettl, takes its departure from two statements which I heard him make in conversation, after he had been living in America for a good decade. The first, “mir ist der Schnabel deutsch gewachsen,” was his response to a question about his continued desire to publish in German, and relates to his inability to feel at home in English.

  Author(s) MacDonald Heidi<br>
  Abstract: In Canada in the 1960s and 1970s, Roman Catholic congregations of women religious (commonly called nuns) suffered a perfect storm. External social forces such as secularism, feminism, consumerism, the sexual revolution, expanding state initiatives in social welfare, and the Cold War seemed to be attacking them from without by questioning their relevance. The Second Vatican Council (1962–65), called in part to address the Church’s response to these forces, initiated a period of profound self-questioning of women religious’ customs, ministries, governance, and even dress. The often divisive congregational debates associated with the Vatican II era were sometimes perceived by women<br>

  Abstract: The world born of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment is suspicious of our statements about the Holy Spirit. It calls them into question. Indeed, it has learned to mistrust every explanation involving a transcendent, unverifiable “cause.” The spirit it favors is
                     ours, not that unknown One beyond the clouds. Its suspicion takes many forms and I do not claim to deal with all of them. Nevertheless, here are five or six of its principal manifestations, from the most superficial to the most philosophically sophisticated.<br>

  Abstract: Anna’s night journey to St. Petersburg (part 1, chapter 29) is one of the great transitional moments in her drama. Her experience dramatizes a state of intense moral and psychological conflict in which a powerful passion crashes through a barrier of will and conscience. Tolstoy’s account of this internal experience is remarkable for its representation of Anna’s epic crisis. The battle engages her entire being, physical, psychological, moral, and spiritual, drawing in her immediate surroundings and nature in the broadest sense of the term.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxsj7q">The Superstitious Muse</a><br>
  Abstract: “Death,” writes Joseph Brodsky in his 1982 essay on Akhmatova, “is a good litmus test for a poet’s ethics. The ‘in memoriam’ genre is frequently used to exercise self-pity or for metaphysical trips that denote the subconscious superiority of survivor over victim, of majority (of the alive) over minority (of the dead). Akhmatova [in her poetic cycle
                  Requiem] would have none of that.”² This statement, as self-regarding as it is self-effacing, is itself a kind of litmus test for the author’s own ethics and aesthetics. Versions of it reappear at strategic moments in Brodsky’s important essays on Tsvetaeva and on<br>

This statement might be problematic if he were a philosopher, but his consistent incon sistency makes perfect sense to those studying his primary sta tus — that of poet. Stoic toward the arbitrariness of the world order (or disorder), deeply melancholic (if not corrosively skepti cal) about “human nature,” yet passionately be lieving in language’s ontological priority as the only
                  thing(note this word) in human existence approaching a genuine God-term, Brod sky could be maddening in the sheer outrageousness, the “demanding-the maximum-and-the-hell-with-the-rest” quality, of his metaphorical thinking. But that is what poets, especially<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxsj7q">The Superstitious Muse</a><br>
  Abstract: Central to any understanding of Joseph Brodsky as poet and thinker is his myth of language, his belief in words, and not just any words but specifically poetic words, ability to restructure time and to outwit states, tyrants, history itself. “Prosody is simply a repository of time within language,”² writes Brodsky in a statement repeated many times over in different guises and contexts. Poetic words, by their very nature, got there, and are always still getting there, first. Indeed, what makes this idea a myth in the first place, that is, something larger than the life it explains, is these<br>

  Chapter 2  The Novel on Translation and “Über-Translation”: from:

  Abstract: In his 1937 French essay for the
                  Nouvelle Revue française, “Pouchkine, ou le vrai et le vraisemblable” (“Pushkin, or the Real and the Plausible”),³ Nabokov claimed that the truth of another’s life is inaccessible because thought inevitably distorts whatever it tries to encompass. However, the intuitions of a fictionalized biography motivated by love for its subject might convey a “plausible” life bearing a mysterious affinity for “the poet’s work, if not the poet himself.”⁴ This relatively early statement on this subject by Nabokov, made during centennial celebrations of Aleksandr Pushkin’s death, becomes poignant in light of Nabokov’s novel Pale Fire<br>

                  #minor) in m. 8. The transition (TR) then begins immediately (m. 9), opening with a restatement of the P idea on the subdominant E minor and continuing in a normative fashion. The rhetoric suggests tonal and motivic dissolution—as would be expected in a sonata transition<br>

  Author(s) On Bat-Ami Bar<br>
  Abstract: The appropriation of the term “evil” by President George W. Bush’s administration has caused me to hesitate in thinking about terrorism as “evil.” Quite quickly after the Al Qaeda attacks of September 11, 2001, the Bush administration began to deploy the term “evil” in conjunction with the term “axis” and referred, with the phrase “an axis of evil,” to the Al Qaeda network and the weave of individuals, organizations, and especially states that support it (Bush 2002). The connection of “evil” with “axis” in this context is probably intended to evoke memories of World War II and use them to<br>

  Author(s) Card Claudia<br>
  Abstract: Is it justifiable to set aside rules of war in responding to opponents who did the same? Can war on terrorism respond to evil without doing further evil? Such questions invite reflection on the concepts of evil, war, and terrorism. My objectives in so reflecting are: (1) to identify issues that should complicate good answers; and (2) to consider how other nations, whose security may be jeopardized, might justifiably respond to decisions of target nations who do as they see fit to protect themselves. In pursuing the second objective, I explore analogies with the responses of states to women who<br>

  Author(s) Eco Umberto<br>
  Abstract: It is not by chance that modern aesthetics and modern theories of art (and I mean by “modern” those born with Mannerism, developed through Romanticism, and provocatively restated by the early-twentieth-century avant-gardes) have frequently identified the artistic message with metaphor. Metaphor (the new and inventive one, not the worn-out catachresis) is a way to designate something by the name of something else, thus presenting that something in an unexpected way. The modern criterion for recognizing the artistic value was
                  novelty, high information. The pleasurable repetition of an already known pattern was considered, by modern theories of art, typical of Crafts<br>

  Abstract: Reviewing the early works of George Eliot in 1866 Henry James reflected on the possibility of foreshadowing later events in narratives without every describing them. This possibility leads James to make the following statement about the composition of novels: “In every novel the work is divided between the writer and the reader; but the writer makes the reader very much as he makes his characters. When he makes him ill, that is, makes him different, he does no work; the writer does all. When he makes him well, that is, makes him interested, then the reader does quite half the<br>

We are now in a new era.”¹ Warning that the jihadist attacks perpetrated in France in January and November 2015 signaled the advent of an unpre ce dented wave of threats to the nation to which no early end could be foreseen, Valls urged the adoption of constitutional revisions designed to give the state sweeping emergency powers and the right to strip terrorists of French citizenship. It is true that France has never before faced attacks on this scale from<br>

  CHAPTER 4  Russian Resorts and European Leisure: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt20060x8">Migration and Mobility in the Modern Age</a><br>
  Author(s) Hsu Chia Yin<br>
  Abstract: AN ENGLISH-LANGUAGE HANDBOOK of North Manchuria published in 1924 by the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER), the region’s central land transportation network, ran a full-page advertisement for the railway’s “health resorts.” The CER was constructed in the Chinese territory of Manchuria by the imperial Russian state and completed in 1903. As the final stretch of the Siberian Railroad, it linked European Russia to the Pacific Ocean. The advertised resorts were located at various CER train stations and shared their names: Chalantun, Imienpo, Fularki, Hingan, Laosiaokow and Echo. The page offered scenic images of the resorts and descriptions of their surroundings. Chalantun<br>

  Author(s) Moch Leslie Page<br>
  Abstract: WE LIVE IN an age when large undertakings by states are likely to inspire suspicion if not outright hostility, when the fruits of previous state endeavors wither for lack of commitment to their continuation, and when corporate and other private enterprises reap the whirlwind of profit and power from state retrenchment. The only exceptions to these trends might be war and disaster relief, though states increasingly are privatizing and outsourcing war making, and their relief efforts often take second place to those of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) or international bodies.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2050vm2">Socialist Realism in Central and Eastern European Literatures under Stalin</a><br>
  Author(s) Djagalov Rossen<br>
  Abstract: As an heir to the pre-revolutionary Russian intelligentsia, the Bolshevik state, down to its very bureaucracy, was highly literature-centric. From very early on in this state’s existence, it projected in its dealings with foreign countries a belief in literature’s capacity to change society; thus, it tried to organize ‘the progressive forces’ of world literature through international writers’ organizations, writers’ congresses, frequent bilateral visits, multilingual literary magazines and massive translation initiatives. Once developed, these organizing forms stayed relatively constant; what changed was Soviet foreign policy, and with it, Soviet cultural policy abroad. As the sectarian Third Period of the late 1920s<br>

  Author(s) Volokitina Tatiana V.<br>
  Abstract: The history of introducing Soviet-type political regimes in countries along the European border of the USSR has long been the subject of vehement scholarly and journalistic discussions. Historians still cannot agree on what plan exactly Stalin had in mind for Eastern Europe immediately after the war. Remarkably, Soviet and Western assessments of the post-war situation in the region coincided almost completely. The American diplomat George Kennan compared Eastern Europe in the transitional period between war and peace to a ‘malleable and pliant mass’, while Soviet Foreign Minister Viacheslav Molotov spoke of it being in ‘a liquid state’.¹ There was nothing<br>

  Author(s) Norris David<br>
  Abstract: The Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY) came to power in 1945 but, after a short period of close cooperation with the USSR, Yugoslavia was expelled from the Soviet bloc in 1948. This event conditioned much of the development of Yugoslav society over the following decades. In its cultural policy, the relationship between the CPY’s proclaimed socialist ideals and allowing for flexibility and change remained ambiguous throughout the years of the existence of the state. This chapter is specifically concerned with examining official policy towards literature in Yugoslavia, the kind of political and social engagement that was required of literature and<br>

  Author(s) Doinov Plamen<br>
  Abstract: As in most other socialist countries, in Bulgaria the introduction of the socialist regime was accompanied by an imperative to engage in active criticism and, more importantly, self-criticism, often regardless of one’s professional affiliations, status and true political sympathies. The campaign for criticism and self-criticism, initiated almost immediately after the coup d’état in September 1944, continued until the 1960s, with varying degrees of intensity. At first it was ‘alien elements’ who were required to make public self-critical statements – people who had either actively opposed the Bulgarian Communist Party or else refused to cooperate with it.

  Abstract: Hannah Arendt remarked that one of the paradoxes inherent in totalitarian states is that, on the one hand, their professed veneration of transformations induces in them a deep-seated fear of stability and permanence, but on the other hand, for these regimes to function, their institutions require a certain degree of predictability and continuity.¹ The Soviet experience, reproduced in different versions multiple times beyond the borders of the country, is a testimony to the truth of this statement. At the same time, it also points to yet another aporia at the heart of the great political and cultural experiment. As the<br>

  Abstract: Ion Antonescu was the leader of the Romanian state from September 1940 to August 1944. From September 1940 to January 1941 he shared power with the far-right Legionary Movement in what was called the National Legionary State. The collaboration between Antonescu and the legionaries did not last, and conflicts between the two sides became frequent as the abuses of the legionaries were increasingly apparent. In January 1941 Antonescu crushed the attempt of the former government partners to oust him, and, counting on his slightly unclear agreement with Hitler, managed to stay in power.

To state that the common good must a primary concern in architecture may sound hollow in the context of a contemporary practice determined by economic or political forces.

  Abstract: The array of American colleges and universities that like to describe themselves, with more or less justification, as Roman Catholic and that are still sponsored by religious orders, dioceses, or other ecclesiastical authorities continues to be impressive, although periodically, and on one issue or the other, their legitimacy finds itself questioned. Their abundance is still superior, at least quantitatively, to the Catholic university instructional range existing in any other country of the world.

  Abstract: The present chapter starts from deeply felt concerns and deals with matters that are, I am convinced, of the highest importance not only for the profession of humane studies, but for human self-understanding in general. It tries to draw the readers’ attention to gaping rifts in the 
                  studium generale, to define oppositions, and—in a way that may be less than usual nowadays—to take sides and vindicate one set of propositions against the other.

To repeat, aesthetic imagination and literature especially have been regarded with doubt, in fact with hostility, by all kinds of regimes and systems over the centuries, from Mediterranean antiquity and the Middle Ages to “bourgeois” and democratic states, not excluding self-censorship and “political correctness,” and certainly the great totalitarian systems of the twentieth century.

  Abstract: Pope paul vi’s reaffirmation of the constant Church teaching was a surprise and a disappointment to many, though, it might also be said that an abandonment of Church teaching would have been an even greater surprise, even to those who ardently desired a change. Many theologians and lay people registered their dissent from Humanae Vitae nearly before the ink was dry.¹ To this day, Humanae Vitae remains a source of bitter debate within the Church. It was widely observed even at the time that Humanae Vitae was issued that never before had a papal statement met with such a reception.<br>

  Abstract: Kenneth Schmitz has written on a great number of philosophical subjects, often dealing with questions of humanity and its relation to the transcendentals: being, truth, unity, beauty, and goodness. In some of his writings he has focused not just on the metaphysics, but also on the aesthetics of this relationship. For instance, in a recent essay, “The Lustrous Power of Beauty,” he holds that “To claim that being is itself beautiful is a statement about the fundamental character of reality. It is an affirmation of the positive character of existence” (“Lustrous,” 237).¹ Later in the same lecture, he ties the<br>

  Abstract: No question is foreign to metaphysics, Bruaire contends, because metaphysics deals with that most important issue which is presupposed in all the other disciplines.¹ Philosophy addresses the decisive, eternal question: “what is being?”² Yet, according to Bruaire, to ask about “that which is” is to pose the question concerning the nature of the principle that sustains whatever exists, namely, the absolute, which in theological terms is called God.³ This is philosophy’s inevitable prejudice: every philosophy has as its object the absolute, as Schelling stated.⁴ Bruaire considers that the question of the absolute is the question that must be confronted, because<br>

  Abstract: The outcome of Bruaire’s semantic and eidetic analysis of the concept of spirit is the acknowledgment that if the collection of phenomena of spirit “forces us to use the Word gift to name spirit, it is because gift is, from its very beginning, its own essence.”¹ Gift, then, is neither an ontological category that can be enumerated along with others, nor a name capable of describing only the being of the human spirit. Being is gift, in the strongest sense of the term: “esse spirituale et donum convertuntur.”² To affirm that being-of-spirit is given is to state that it is<br>

The topic of this chapter, which is the changed scope of the principle of nonintervention, is rooted in the tradition of ius ad bellum.

  Abstract: Paradoxically, the twentieth century witnessed both the bloodiest and most horrific carnage in the history of humankind and the first global attempts to hold those responsible for the violence accountable. From these unjust wars came a dawning sense that a just peace was necessary to prevent their recurrence and right the scales of injustice.

The governing elites, both the warrior nobility and the bishops themselves, accepted the hieratic vision of a sacred kingdom and the holy purposes of the Carolingian state, a fact that embittered every conflict.

  Abstract: At the end of the fourteenth century, the geography of the pope’s domain was in constant evolution. Despite the great antiquity of its name, we can label the Renaissance Papal State, in Machiavelli’s words, a “new” principality. From decade to decade, its borders, and indeed the whole territory, kept swiftly changing shape. International affairs, the onset of the Italian Wars for instance, contributed to the frontiers’ continual shifting, as did dizzying changes in papal politics. So, for example, the Borgia project to build a “family state” was undone by Julius II (1503–1513), and then Leo X (1513–1521) waded<br>

In Rome, as we have seen, the governor’s claims to primacy fostered endless tensions with other agencies. The Inquisition, with its own ambitions and sweeping prerogatives, stirred up the very same kind of troubles. In the state’s assorted districts, justice’s administrative realignment had to resolve simmering conflicts between the pope’s officials, on the one hand, and local courts on the other. These latter were linked, often, to bishops, who by 1600 or so had been bolstered in their powers by the Council of<br>

  Abstract: Roman congregations, using every device at hand, aimed at forging something more than irreproachable ministers of God well adapted to Trent’s severe discipline and ready for their ordained labors. Churchmen, in the early modern age, were also to be the blood and sinews of temporal governance; in Rome, it was they who held power and went out to far places to represent the state. They were therefore the messengers and witnesses of the double authority upholding papal monarchy, an authority defined and defended in those years by every means at hand.

The phenomenon took many forms and was riddled with contradictions; justice cut a splendid figure but had feet that sometimes looked like clay. So, on the one hand, one reading of the rules, institutions, tribunals, and men of law might portray sovereign justice as sitting easy in the saddle.

  Author(s) Hamilton Douglas<br>
  Abstract: The proposal in this paper is that the development of a prestigious grand theory in the information systems (IS) field is possible, opportune, and would be of considerable benefit to the field. ʹPrestigiousʹ is taken in this context to mean achieving a degree of renown, ideally with the public at large, but at least within the academy. While significant benefits could derive from the application of such a theory in research and practice, its primary value to the discipline would be as a resource contributing to its public image.

  Abstract: In a way our topic is strangely anachronistic: blasphemy is a problematic notion in a professedly secular society like ours. It is true, of course, that laws against it are still on the books in most states and territories. But they are laws inherited from the English legal system, designed to protect the established religion of the Church of England which was ′part and parcel of the laws of England′ and the monarch, ′the defender of the faith′. In that, these laws against blasphemy served to protect the social fabric rather than any particular theological position. Australia, however, has never<br>

  Book Title: Blood in the Sand-Imperial Fantasies, Right-Wing Ambitions, and the Erosion of American Democracy<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Bronner Stephen Eric<br>
  Abstract: Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, clouds of ash blackened the skies over New York City, Washington, D.C., and rural Pennsylvania. In the wake of the destruction, the United States seemingly entered a new era marked by radical changes in the nation's discourse and in the policies of the Bush administration. With the toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the invasion of Iraq, and saber rattling elsewhere, America's global war on terror began to take shape. Lofty rhetoric about expanding democracy and defending freedom filled the halls of elite power and dominated mainstream media coverage of American politics. Blood in the Sand offers both an incisive analysis and a confrontational critique of America's recent international pursuits and its dominant political culture. Stephen Eric Bronner challenges the notion that everything changed in the aftermath of 9/11. He shows instead how a criminal act served to legitimize political manipulation and invigorate traditional nationalistic enthusiasms for militarism and imperial expansion. Employing his own experiences in the Middle East, Bronner acknowledges -- but refuses to overstate -- recent progressive developments in the region. He criticizes the neo-conservative penchant for unilateral military aggression and debunks the dubious notion of fostering democracy at gunpoint. While Bronner analyzes authoritarian repression, human rights violations, shrinking civil liberties, and severe socioeconomic inequalities, Blood in the Sand is neither a narrow political diatribe nor a futile exercise in anti-American negativism. The author honors America by condemning the betrayal of the nation's finest ideals by so many of those who, hypocritically or naively, invoke those ideals the most. Bronner sheds new light on those who insist on publicly waving the flag while privately subverting that for which it stands. Blood in the Sand sounds a clarion call for revitalizing the American polity and reshaping foreign policy along democratic lines. Committed to a political renewal, Bronner urges the American people to recall what is best about their national heritage and the genuine beacon of hope it might offer other countries and other cultures.<br>

  Abstract: September 11 was initially thought to have radically transformed politics. Old categories and ways of thinking about foreign policy seemingly lost their relevance. It became fashionable to speak of a “clash of civilizations,” and suddenly, new forms of violence were apparently acceptable. Terrorism undertaken by suicide bombers, or what Ulrich Beck termed the “individualization of war,” was thought to have supplanted battles between armies. Concrete interests, many believed, had given way before apocalyptic visions. The enemy was no longer a state but self-appointed representatives of a transnational movement inspired by fanatical religious beliefs. With the tragic deaths of 3,000 innocent<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt1cd">The Governance of Common Property in the Pacific Region</a><br>
  Author(s) Larmour Peter<br>
  Abstract: Common property has often been regarded as an obstacle to development and best—or inevitably—replaced by private or state ownership. However, there are now many well-documented examples of successful management of open-access resources, and experiments in ‘co-management’ by users, owners, and government officials. The idea that the government should intervene to remedy the defects of common property, perhaps by registration, is now contested by a celebration of indigenous systems of self-management (Bromley 1989, Bromley and Cernea 1989). Government intervention may sometimes make things worse. Common property claims are also part of indigenous peoples’ defence and reaffirmation of political sovereignty.<br>

  Abstract: Practices in relation to customary land are changing in the Pacific islands. The changes include a tendency for people to want to privatise, or individualise, control of holdings within the realm of customary land; for current practice to diverge from what is stated to be custom; and for practice to diverge from the law where tenure has been codified.<br>

  Author(s) Duncan Ron<br>
  Abstract: The island states in the South Pacific are heavily reliant on their natural resources for output, employment and earnings of foreign exchange. While these countries have had poor growth performance over the past two decades, improvement in access to natural resources is one area where there is potential for significant economic gains. This paper argues that subsistence affluence is non-existent in these countries and that their future prosperity depends on engagement in international trade, including inflows of foreign investment capital. Promotion of land-based investments, such as in agriculture and infrastructure, is one of the preconditions for growth. It is imperative,<br>

  Abstract: In the terms of the Treaty of Waitangi, New Zealand became a British colony and the Maori people, together with their lands and estates, were given Crown protection as well as the rights and privileges of British subjects. In 1975, the New Zealand Parliament, for the first time since 1840, gave statutory recognition to the Treaty by setting up a tribunal to hear claims by Maori people that the Crown had failed to honour its guarantees under the Treaty. Claims lodged since then have been made mostly by kin-based tribal groups. They depend heavily on recitals of history, tradition and<br>

  Abstract: In a world where even nation–states have declining power and authority in the face of global markets, international trade agreements, and harmonised laws and regulations, what does sovereignty mean at the subnational level? And what is the connection between common property and sovereignty at the subnational level? What challenges and opportunities confront minority indigenous populations in these contemporary circumstances? The situation of aboriginal peoples in Canada provides distinctive perspectives on these questions. In our country, new understandings are being reached, new arrangements forged and implemented, but also, new difficulties and challenges are emerging.<br>

  Author(s) Reynolds Henry<br>
  Abstract: The concept of national sovereignty is under siege in many parts of the world as states lose power from above to global markets and global organisations and are challenged from below by regions, minorities and entrapped nations. Such developments are particularly apparent in Europe with the break-up of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, and with the ceding of power within the European Union to the Commission, the Parliament and the Court. At the same time regions are asserting new or rediscovered identities.<br>

  Abstract: New cooperative approaches to the management of marine resources are imperative in the delivery of sustainable incomes and livelihoods in the South Pacific. While recent international agreements have strengthened the sovereignty of states over their adjacent ocean resources, the actual development and implementation of management regimes for tuna, arguably the region’s most important renewable resource in terms of income-generating potential, will require a much more concerted approach by Pacific island states. This will need to be matched by a willingness on the part of the non-coastal states that traditionally harvest the bulk of the region’s oceanic resources to cooperate in<br>

It has become commonplace today to recognize that a significant cultural blinder in the United States is individualism, and that nation-states internationally are all too often guided by narrow national interests rather than what is best for the global community.

  Author(s): Shain Yossi<br>
  Abstract: Only recently have international relations scholars started to seriously examine the influence of collective memory on foreign policy formation and relations between states and peoples. The ways in which the memories of past events are interpreted, misinterpreted, or even manipulated in public discourse create the context that shapes international relations.
      Power and the Pastbrings together leading history and international relations scholars to provide a groundbreaking examination of the impact of collective memory. This timely study makes a contribution to developing a theory of memory and international relations and also examines specific cases of collective memory's influence resulting from the legacies of World War II, the Holocaust, and September 11. Addressing concerns shared by world leaders and international institutions as well as scholars of international studies, this volume illustrates clearly how the memory of past events alters the ways countries interact in the present, how memory shapes public debate and policymaking, and how memory may aid or more frequently impede conflict resolution.<br>

  Author(s) Beker Avi<br>
  Abstract: A unique conference took place in Stockholm at the end of January 2000. Forty-three heads of states and foreign ministers, together with world leading historians and educators, gathered for three days to discuss education and commemoration of the Holocaust. The eight hundred journalists who joined U.S. president Bill Clinton, European leaders, and other world leaders provided an additional dimension to the extraordinary awakening of world interest in the events of the Holocaust, more than fifty years later.<br>

  Abstract: IN THIS CHAPTER I examine the close association of reflection (henceforth R) and self-disclosure (S-D) within biographical studies with the storyteller’s explicit, and by extension “evaluative,” ascriptions and statements about self (cf.

                  propositionalize about their lives? The association of R and S-D is part and parcel of certain assumptions, in particular that, in order for tellers to reflect on their lives and selves and to open up (self-disclose) to an interviewer, they must have a critical distance from the reported events and be given the opportunity to piece them together in<br>

  Abstract: THE CLOSING ARGUMENTS of criminal trials in the United States are both a persuasive and an argumentative genre in which two lawyers take the same defendant, victim, witnesses, and evidence and use their linguistic and communicative skills to create opposing discourses that are intended to make the jurors decide in their side’s favor.

  CHAPTER EIGHT  Reformations: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt78n">Overcoming Our Evil</a><br>
  Abstract: Augustine and Xunzi both aim ultimately at perfection, although how they conceive of such a state differs dramatically. They also focus on rather different issues as they chart the path toward this perfection, which reflect their distinctive worries about the gravest spiritual dangers. Examining their differing interests in mapping these “stages of development” helps to prepare the way for comparing their complex regimes of personal formation. As outlined in chapter 7, early on in his authorship, Augustine develops his sequential account of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, but under the pressure of his debate with Pelagianism he later<br>

  Abstract: It would be futile to search the work of Wittgenstein for a thorough discussion or systematic critique of psychoanalysis. Freud’s theory is not the focus of any carefully argued statement, and the materials available to us on this subject are rather contained in conversations reported by Rush Rhees and in what are often brief, allusive remarks scattered throughout Wittgenstein’s published writings and manuscripts. Psychoanalysis most often serves as an illustration in the context of much broader philosophical discussions concerning questions such as the distinction between reasons and causes, “aesthetic” explanation and causal explanation, the nature of symbolism in general, of<br>

  Abstract: Violence is as inseparable from revolution and counterrevolution as these are from each other. Violence has, of course, many faces and purposes. Certainly not all violence in revolution is ideologically driven and, by that token, excessive and boundless. Although violence is inherent to revolution, it is not unique to it. Nor is it as rare as revolution itself. Violence is basic to society and polity, especially to their foundation and consolidation. At the creation there is often recourse to war, which, like revolution, is “inconceivable outside the domain of violence.”¹ The founding myth of nearly every society or state romanticizes<br>

  Book Title: Being in the World-Dialogue and Cosmopolis<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Dallmayr Fred<br>
  Abstract: In
      Being in the World, noted political theorist Fred Dallmayr explores the globe's transition from the traditional Westphalian system of states to today's interlocking cosmopolitan network. Drawing upon sacred scriptures as well as the work of ancient philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle and more recent scholars such as Martin Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Raimon Panikkar, this book delves into what Dallmayr calls "being in the world," seen as an aspect of ethical-political engagement. Rather than lamenting current problems, he suggests addressing them through civic education and cosmopolitan citizenship. Dallmayr advocates a politics of the common good, which requires the cultivation of public ethics, open dialogue, and civic responsibility.<br>

  Abstract: The legacy of Western “modernity” is ambivalent. On the one hand, it has bequeathed to us the inspiring ideas of global brotherhood and universal justice. On the other hand, in the aftermath of the Peace of Westphalia, it has launched the agenda of a compact, exclusivist nationalism or nation-state, an agenda often copied or supplemented by equally self-contained subnationalities. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the nationalist agenda was steadily on the upsurge, engendering first a series of interstate wars and then the violent paroxysm of two World Wars. In the midst of these conflagrations, the broader civilizational vision was<br>

It was 5 P.M., Wednesday, January 19, 2000, still the dawn of the new millennium in Charleston, South Carolina. Hundreds of battle-ready, black-clad police and highway patrol officers stood in formation, armed with riot helmets, wooden clubs, and plastic shields. A handful rode horses. They carried weapons able to shoot rubber pellets and buckshot. Canine units stood ready with attack dogs.

  Abstract: “I am,” Charles Johnson states, “first and foremost, a writer of philosophical fiction” (McWilliams, “An Interview” 275). This marriage of the art of fiction and the traditions of philosophy stands behind everything Johnson writes, from his novels to his short stories to his essays (both literary and philosophical—they are one and the same to Johnson) to his book reviews. Johnson’s wide-ranging education and background have provided him with a formidable training in these disciplines: raised in the AME Church with a substantial background in Christianity and the Bible, he is also a formal student of western philosophy, holding a<br>

  Abstract: “The highest and, indeed, the truly serious task of art,” states Nietzsche, is “to save the eye from gazing into the horrors of night and to deliver the subject by the healing balm of illusion from the spasms of the agitations of the will” (
                  Birth118). For Nietzsche, this constitutes the supreme achievement of Attic tragedy, in which the frenzied and annihilating power of Dionysus is contained by and expressed through Apollo’s “healing balm of blissful illusion” (127). Consequently Nietzsche defines “the tragic myth” as the “symbolization of Dionysian wisdom through Apollinian artifices” (131). It would seem that the more<br>

If sovereignty rested effectively in the state, then it was at the universal or federal level as a special type of organism that is almost uniquely that of the Americas; and if this sovereignty belonged to the people, then the very concept of “the people” had changed radically in the Americas – from meaning “European and white” to including all<br>

  Abstract: In a famous exchange about the time Canadians were examining the idea of official multiculturalism, two leading theorists – conservative US philosopher Leo Strauss and left-leaning French philosopher Alexandre Kojève – debated about what it took to produce wise and good government in a modern state. Strauss wrestled with the question of the sovereign individual and whether one can remain authentic while living in a society – can he or she live happily ever after? Strauss starts always with the desires of the individual in discussing freedom and tyranny. He sees a “crisis in modernity” because neither the individual nor the state knows<br>

Canadians renewed their social contract to make it more inclusive and less a fragment of Europe.² Pierre Trudeau’s leadership (prime minister 1968–80, 1981–4) featured repatriation of the constitution with, at last, an amending formula, and entrenchment of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Trudeau spoke of a new beginning for Canada, with negotiations among individuals, not groups: “The liberal philosophy sets the highest value on the freedom of the individual, by which we mean the total individual, the individual as a member<br>

  Book Title: Truth Matters-Knowledge, Politics, Ethics, Religion<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Shuker Ronnie<br>
  Abstract: Why should we seek and tell the truth? Does anyone know what truth is? Many are skeptical about the relevance of truth. Truth Matters endeavours to show why truth is important in a world where the very idea of truth is contested. Putting philosophers in conversation with educators, literary scholars, physicists, political theorists, and theologians, Truth Matters ranges across both analytic and continental philosophy and draws on the ideas of thinkers such as Aquinas, Balthasar, Brandom, Davidson, Dooyeweerd, Gadamer, Habermas, Kierkegaard, Plantinga, Ricoeur, and Wolterstorff. Some essays attempt to provide a systematic account of truth, while others wrestle with the question of how truth is told and what it means to live truthfully. Contributors address debates between realists and anti-realists, explore issues surrounding relativism and constructivism in education and the social sciences, examine the politics of truth telling and the ethics of authenticity, and consider various religious perspectives on truth. Most scholars agree that truth is propositional, being expressed in statements that are subject to proof or disproof. This book goes a step farther: yes, propositional truth is important, but truth is more than propositional. To recognize how it is more than propositional is crucial for understanding why truth truly matters.

  AFTERWORD: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b8xg">Configuring Community</a><br>
  Abstract: As the preceding chapters show, this study of community must remain in the interrogative. Attempts to draw clear-cut conclusions on community would result in a discursive stasis, whereby the larger context of modernity and postmodernity—as late modernity or an intensification of the tensions between discourse and practice that characterise modernity—would be lost. The notion of community in postmodern Spain can be seen to be foregrounded in political and cultural contexts over emphases on nation or state. Nevertheless, community is itself a problematic concept: necessarily fluid in order to survive in current contexts, yet loaded with the fixed structures<br>

  Book Title: Rhetoric in an Antifoundational World-Language, Culture, and Pedagogy<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Glejzer Richard R.<br>
  Abstract: In this brilliant collection, literary scholars, philosophers, and teachers inquire into the connections between antifoundational philosophy and the rhetorical tradition. What happens to literary studies and theory when traditional philosophical foundations are disavowed? What happens to the study of teaching and writing when antifoundationalism is accepted? What strategies for human understanding are possible when the weaknesses of antifoundationalism are identified? This volume offers answers in classic essays by such thinkers as Richard Rorty, Terry Eagleton, and Stanley Fish, and in many new essays never published before.The contributors to this book explore the nexus of antifoundationalism and rhetoric, critique that nexus, and suggest a number of pedagogical and theoretical alternatives. The editors place these statements into a context that is both critical and evaluative, and they provide for voices that dissent from the antifoundational perspective and that connect specific, practical pedagogies to the broader philosophical statements. For those with an interest in rhetoric, philosophy, comparative literature, or the teaching of composition, this book sets forth a wealth of thought-provoking ideas.<br>

  1  Rhetoric from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bdzr">Rhetoric in an Antifoundational World</a><br>
  Author(s) Fish Stanley<br>
  Abstract: For Milton’s seventeenth-century readers this passage, introducing one of the more prominent of the fallen angels, would have been immediately recognizable as a brief but trenchant essay on the art and character of the rhetorician. Indeed in these few lines Milton has managed to gather and restate with great rhetorical force (a paradox of which more later) all of the traditional arguments against rhetoric. Even Belial’s gesture of rising is to the (negative) point: he catches the eye even before he begins to speak, just as Satan will in Book IX when he too raises himself and moves so that<br>

  Author(s) Eagleton Terry<br>
  Abstract: A political literary criticism is not the invention of marxists. On the contrary, it is one of the oldest, most venerable forms of literary criticism we know. The most widespread early criticism on historical record was not, in our sense, “aesthetic”: it was a mode of what we would now call “discourse theory,” devoted to analyzing the material effects of particular uses of language in particular social conjunctures. It was a highly elaborate theory of specific signifying practices—above all, of the discursive practices of the juridical, political, and religious apparatuses of the state. Its intention, quite consciously, was systematically<br>

  Author(s) Bizzell Patricia<br>
  Abstract: When students enter college, it soon becomes apparent that some of them are already comfortable with academic discourse, while other students seem quite unfamiliar with academic discourse and resistant to learning it. This state of affairs might not be considered a problem: the academy might simply expel those who do not share its discourse and welcome and reward those who do. Indeed, this is how the situation is handled in many schools today.<br>

  V  Heidegger: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bfxq">Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Abstract: In the nineteenth century, hermeneutic reflection remained peripheral in certain respects (especially to philosophy). Though their founding intuitions were broadly based, the classic figures in hermeneutics who were representative of the century—Böckh, Schleiermacher, Droysen, and Dilthey—did not manage to develop a unified conception of hermeneutics or publish it in systematic form. Indicative of this state of affairs is that their hermeneutic inquiries had to be compiled from posthumous writings edited by their students and published mostly in the form of overviews and fragments. This situation slowly begins to change with Heidegger (1889–1976), who was demonstrably influenced early<br>

  Book Title: Reading Abstract Expressionism-Context and Critique<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Landau Ellen G.<br>
  Abstract: Abstract Expressionism is arguably the most important art movement in postwar America. Many of its creators and critics became celebrities, participating in heated public debates that were published in newspapers, magazines, and exhibition catalogues. This up-to-date anthology is the first comprehensive collection of key critical writings about Abstract Expressionism from its inception in the 1940s to the present day. Ellen G. Landau's masterful introduction presents and analyzes the major arguments and crucial points of view that have surrounded the movement decade by decade. She then offers a selection of readings, also organized by decade, including influential statements by such artists as Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell, Jackson Pollock, and Barnett Newman as well as the commentary of diverse critics. Offering new insights into the development of Abstract Expressionism, this rich anthology also demonstrates the ongoing impact of this revolutionary and controversial movement. Reading Abstract Expressionism is essential for the library of any curator, scholar, or student of twentieth-century art.<br>

  Abstract: […] As the title indicates, the present exhibition is really a double exhibition which not only surveys the present state of the Abstract Expressionists but follows in some detail the direction to which the name “Abstract Imagists” has been applied. It is a fact that from the late Forties to the present day certain painters, loosely grouped with the Abstract Expressionists, have rather been concerned through extreme simplification of their canvases—frequently to the dominant assertion of a single overpowering element—in presenting an all-encompassing presence. This “presence” could be described as an “image” in the sense of an abstract<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bn3t">Pushkin's Historical Imagination</a><br>
  Abstract: As brief as it may be, Pushkin’s lyric poem “The Hero” (“Geroi”), written in 1830, constitutes one of his poetical manifestos.¹ This short poem encapsulates Pushkin’s response to the cultural and historical polemics of his day. Moreover, it is both a metapoetical and metahistorical poem, constituting one of Pushkin’s most controversial statements on the relationship between art and history, the nature of truth, and the status of historical fact. The poem needs to be quoted in full.<br>

                  Poltava(1828), Pushkin’s longest dramatic poem, not only represents Pushkin’s interpretation of the specific historical event but also is a statement on the nature of historical process. Written in a few days, this majestic tour de force of three cantos stands between the two other major Petrine narratives—The Blackamoor of Peter the GreatandThe Bronze Horseman—as a glaring and assertive hymn to Russian nationalism. Indeed, some critics interpret the poem as an unambiguous and almost blatant defense of Russian imperial power and as a categorical condemnation of any revolt that could<br>

  Book Title: Metaphysics in Ordinary Language-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosen Stanley<br>
  Abstract: In this rich collection of philosophical writings, Stanley Rosen addresses a wide range of topics-from eros, poetry, and freedom to problems like negation and the epistemological status of sense perception. Though diverse in subject, Rosen's essays share two unifying principles: there can be no legitimate separation of textual hermeneutics from philosophical analysis, and philosophical investigation must be oriented in terms of everyday language and experience, although it cannot simply remain within these confines. Ordinary experience provides a minimal criterion for the assessment of extraordinary discourses, Rosen argues, and without such a criterion we would have no basis for evaluating conflicting discourses: philosophy would give way to poetry.Philosophical problems are not so deeply embedded in a specific historical context that they cannot be restated in terms as valid for us today as they were for those who formulated them, the author maintains. Rosen shows that the history of philosophy-a story of conflicting interpretations of human life and the structure of intelligibility-is a story that comes to life only when it is rethought in terms of the philosophical problems of our own personal and historical situation.<br>

  Abstract: The passage from Stendhal that serves as our motto is recorded by Nietzsche in a notebook entry dating from 1887–88.¹ It expresses a theme that fascinates Nietzsche at all stages of his productive life. The most powerful statement of that theme occurs in paragraph 30 of
                  Beyond Good and Evil, as part of the climax of Nietzsche’s account of the distance that separates the exceptional human being from the multitude (par. 26–30): “Our highest insights must—and should—sound like follies, perhaps like crimes, when in an impermissible manner they reach ears which are not suited or predetermined<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bsjw">Metaphysics in Ordinary Language</a><br>
  Abstract: It has often been observed that, in describing the transcendental structure of possible experience, Kant has difficulty in preserving the indeterminateness of empirical knowledge. This difficulty centers on the nature of perception.¹ Simply stated, the problem is how to combine a transcendentally imposed necessity with empirical contingency. In my opinion, there is a parallel difficulty that has not received extensive consideration: how to combine transcendental purposiveness with the empirical contingency of reflective judgment.²<br>

  Abstract: I begin with an informal statement of three different theses concerning the relation between freedom and reason. According to the first thesis, freedom is a consequence of the subordination of the intellect to independent formal structure. One finds a version of this thesis, for example, in Plato’s
                     Sophistat 253c6ff, where dialectic, or the science of the combination and separation of forms—also referred to as division in accordance with kinds—is identified by the Eleatic Stranger and the young mathematician Theaetetus as the science that characterizes the free man.<br>

  Book Title: On the Nature of Consciousness-Cognitive, Phenomenological, and Transpersonal Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): HUNT HARRY T.<br>
  Abstract: What is the relation between mystical experience and ordinary consciousness, between the principles of modern physics and the patterns of perception in all moving creatures, between our human self-consciousness and the more primary sentience of protozoa? This book pursues an inquiry into consciousness that ranges from ancient Greece to empirical neuro-psychology to the experiential traditions of introspection and meditation. Harry Hunt begins by reviewing the renewed interest in ordinary consciousness and in altered and transpersonal states of consciousness. He then presents competing views of consciousness in cognition, neurophysiology, and animal psychology, developing a view of perceptual awareness as the core of consciousness potentially shared across species. Hunt next brings together the separate strands of neo-realist approaches to perception and thought, the phenomenology of imagery and synesthesia, and cognitive theories of metaphor. He develops an original cognitive theory of mystical experience that combines Buddhist meditative descriptions of consciousness and Heidegger's sense of Being. In relating both of these to James J. Gibson's views on perception, he avoids the various "new age" supernaturalisms that so often blight the transpersonal literature. Other themes include the relation between consciousness and time; the common perceptual-metaphoric rooting of parallels between consciousness and modern physics; and the communal basis of transpersonal states as reflected in a sociology of mysticism and a reinterpretation of parapsychological research.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32btm9">On the Nature of Consciousness</a><br>
  Abstract: Before proceeding further in exploring the varieties of presentational states and their relation to cognitive theory, we must consider the more ordinary forms of visual-spatial imagery and their place in that wider context. After all, it was the initial attempts at empirical laboratory research on visual imagery that were heralded as a “return of the ostracized” (Holt, 1962) — the beginning of modern psychology’s renewed interest in consciousness. Holt, among many others, hoped for a cognitive theory that would include the full range of phenomenological and clinical studies of imagistic states along with a laboratory science of imagery. That is<br>

                  psycheaion, in contrast to what I have termed the horizontal sensus communis. Just as psyche-aion was described in terms of the same processes of fluidic dynamics as the “thought of the heart,” it also seems entirely plausible from a contemporary cognitive perspective to understand the range of experiences emerging with deep meditation and psychedelic drugs as cross-modal synesthetic translations across the more abstract or formal stages of perceptual microgenesis.

  Abstract: We have been dealing with the cognitive processes that underlie experiences which we have variously termed higher states of consciousness, transpersonal experience, or presentational states. These have been understood as a reconstitution on the level of symbolic cognition of presence-openness as the basic structure of perception in motile sentient creatures. Horizonal openness and the flow gradients of the ambient array are “real,” “existent,” and inherent to the structure of sentience, but would only be realized as such, as felt meaning for its own sake, on the human level. Presence-openness emerges into presentational symbolic cognition through the synesthetic translation of the<br>

  Author(s) Punt Jeremy<br>
  Abstract: This contribution proceeds from the southern African context as its specific social location for reflecting on some aspects of the future of the biblical studies enterprise in light of its past. Cognizant of important changes in the region since the dawn of the post-Apartheid era, the study takes its point of departure from and interacts with the complex settings and legacies of South Africa, given its rich human diversity as a former Dutch settlement, a British colony, and an Apartheid state. In so doing, it attempts to understand the future of biblical studies while recognizing that it does so amid<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32c046">The Future of the Biblical Past</a><br>
  Author(s) Kirova Milena<br>
  Abstract: Every narrative addressing the state of biblical studies in Bulgaria should begin with an odd and traumatic situation in the distant past of the country. Christianity was not at all a popular religion until the mid-ninth century. Each of the two tribes comprising the Bulgarian state, the local Slavs and the old Bulgarians (or Protobulgarians), who had migrated from Asia, had their established pantheon and rituals. In contrast to the aristocratic circles in both tribes, various pagan gods coexisted quite peacefully in the lives of the common people. The situation in question took place in the year 865 c.e.<br>

  Author(s) Ku John Baptist<br>
  Abstract: St. Thomas presents his speculative Trinitarian doctrine as an extension or personal development of the teaching of the Fathers and of St. Augustine in particular. Thus, for example, when he introduces his teaching on Trinitarian relations, St. Thomas explains that he is going to unfold it “by following the statements of the holy [Fathers]”;¹ and when he shows the plurality of the persons, he announces that he is going to do it “especially in accordance with the way by which Augustine manifested it,”² in other words, by means of the analogy of the word and of love.

  Author(s) Veinstein Gilles<br>
  Abstract: Ottoman Jewry, in the centuries preceding the large emigration of Sephardic Jews to Turkey that transformed it, already existed in communities (Romaniote, Ashkenazi, Italiote, Karaite, etc.) composed of the populations of conquered territories or of exiled European Jews. By 1453, most of these Ottoman Jews, either on their own initiative or by force, had moved to the new capital conquered by Mehmed II. The sultan recognized the usefulness of Jewish contributions to his fledgling state, and was particularly appreciative, for his personal use, of the able physicians, whom he on occasion made his advisers.

  Author(s) Veinstein Gilles<br>
  Abstract: The great movement of the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and Portugal, taken up by several Italian states at the end of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth centuries, had important consequences for Ottoman Jewry, which would be the major recipient of these exiles. The Sephardic component, which was layered onto older, preexisting strata of Jewish populations, and would in turn be superseded by other arrivals, was henceforth dominant in population and cultural influence, in keeping with a brilliant, carefully preserved heritage. The favorable reception of Jews by Sultan Bayezid II is not a myth, even if<br>

  Author(s) Moreen Vera Basch<br>
  Abstract: The long and complex history of the Jews in Iran dates as far back as 586 B.C.E., when Nebuchadnezzar exiled thousands of Jews from Judea to Babylonia. The late medieval and premodern period of this sojourn, dating approximately between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries, occurred during formative centuries in Iranian history, characterized primarily by the struggle to define and consolidate the borders and character of the future state of Iran.

  Author(s) Tobi Yosef<br>
  Abstract: According to their own tradition and according to new archaeological findings, Jews lived in the country later known as Yemen at least since the seventh century B.C.E. It seems that trade was the main incentive of Israelites to immigrate to that country. Their position was so strong that around 370 C.E., the major political power in Yemen, the Kingdom of Himyar, adopted Judaism, until the Ethiopian Christians took control of the country and destroyed the Jewish state. Since 629 the country was governed by Islam and the Jews became subject to Muslim discriminatory rules of

  Author(s) Charbit Denis<br>
  Abstract: The Arab-Israeli conflict has lasted a long time: nearly seventy years, if one considers its beginning the outbreak of the war of independence in 1947, which the Palestinians call al-Nakba. And if one situates its origin just after World War I, when the political interests of the two communities found themselves facing off in a mimetic rivalry, whose object of dispute was the same land, it is, so to speak, a hundred-year war. Israeli collective psychology forged a representation of the enemy that was consistent with the collective mobilization of society the state required. Over the course of the conflict,<br>

  Abstract: The Six-Day War of 1967 ought to have been the crowning achievement of the pan-Arab strategy of reconquest: despite their differences of regime, leadership, and diplomatic orientation, and the rivalries between one state and another, a coalition linking Egypt, Syria, and Jordan galvanized the crowds. The response of Israeli public opinion tended toward panic in the face of that increasing tension, that unprecedented anti-Zionist and anti-Semitic provocation, after eleven years of implicit peaceful coexistence. But the top advisers favored a preemptive war (which consisted, in this case, in anticipating the enemy attack by a few weeks, or even a few<br>

  Abstract: The Israeli Declaration of Independence promised that the State of Israel ensures complete social and political equality for its citizens, irrespective of religion, race, or sex, and guarantees freedom of religion. There is no declared official religion, and each religious community has jurisdiction over its internal affairs and matters of personal status.¹ All religious courts are recognized, autonomous, and supported by government budgets; accordingly, Israel funds more than one hundred mosques and their imams. The government also finances numerous extracurricular Islamic studies. Nevertheless, Israel’s definition as a Jewish state implies a privileged link to the faith attached to Jewishness, and<br>

  Abstract: The State of Israel has an Arab minority that represents 20 percent of its total population, which is to say, 1,500,000 people. It is composed of the Palestinians who did not leave the territory of what became Israel in 1948, and of their descendants. The vast majority are Sunni Muslim: 84 percent, versus 8 percent Christian of various denominations and 8 percent Druze. At the institutional and legal levels, Arab citizens of Israel have never enjoyed recognition as a collective entity.

  Abstract: Shari‘a courts are an integral part of the Israeli judiciary.¹ Indeed, Islamic law as applied by the shari‘a courts—and that can be applied at times even by the regular civil courts—is taken to be within the judicial notice of each and every Israeli judge. The jurisdiction accorded to shari‘a courts and issues governed by Islamic law are mainly within the domain of family law pertaining to local Muslim subjects.² Israel’s Jewish state officially recognizes these Muslim institutions. The judicial jurisdiction of shari‘a courts has been brought under statutory regulation in some areas, but in others, Israeli law limits<br>

  Abstract: Within the context of a long-lasting Israeli-Arab conflict, and given the country’s identity as a “Jewish and democratic state,” Judeo-Arab associations play a crucial role in the struggle against inequality and prejudice. Since 1967, some have been involved in the defense of the Palestinians’ rights in the occupied territories. Perceived as an indispensable tool of democratic society, they are also the target of nationalist groups. Community networks are very dense in Israel.

  Author(s) Amirpur Katajun<br>
  Abstract: Iran is a country that eludes any simple explanatory model. This is equally true for the relations that the state and the society maintain with the Jewish minority. Although the positions that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has taken are violently anti-Zionist and openly negationist, Iran remains one of the only countries in the Muslim world to be inhabited by a substantial Jewish community, estimated at about 25,000. That remnant is most certainly linked to the antiquity of the Jewish settlement in Persia, which dates to the sixth century B.C.E., and to the Jews’ active social and cultural involvement and participation.

  Abstract: From their very inception, Jewish-Muslim relations in France were a triangular affair. That is, the French state and questions of national belonging within the republic were always at the heart of these relations. Three components of identity and status defined Jews’ and Muslims’ relations with one another and the French Republic: the place of each group in France’s colonial empire, Jews’ and Muslims’ positions as religious minorities in an officially secular France, and the complex attachments of members of both groups to transnational entities. Jews and Muslims consider one another from various angles: as, for instance, citizens and subjects, fellow<br>

  Author(s) Levy Alex<br>
  Abstract: Many people in Western countries, or at least in the United States , believe that the attitudes of Muslim Arab publics toward Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are one-dimensional and unchanging, and, more specifically, that they are unreservedly and consistently hostile. Frequently associated with this belief is a judgment that antagonism toward Israel is rooted in Arab culture and, even more, in the doctrine and historical experience of Islam. Expressions of this view may readily be found in the writings and statements of many conservative and Christian fundamentalist personalities.¹<br>

  Abstract: Science and philosophy did not develop spontaneously within Judaism. The intellectual activities of traditional Jewish cultures generally focused on the canonical texts of the tradition: the Bible, the Mishnah, the Talmud. Any other type of knowledge, that is, any knowledge not vested with the authority of the canonical texts and of revelation, was considered “foreign.” This point, fundamental for understanding Jewish intellectual history, was forcefully stated in 1933 by the great historian Julius Guttmann: “The history of Jewish philosophy is a history of the successive absorption of foreign ideas.”¹<br>

An assessment of the state of scholarship on the Jewish minority reveals significant differences among the three countries of the Maghreb. Morocco and Tunisia are clearly a step ahead of Algeria. Since the 1980s, special interest in Judeo-Muslim relations has been apparent in Morocco, as illustrated, for example, by Mohamed Kenbib’s remarkable graduate thesis.¹ Several themes of research, such as Zionism, the Jewish press, local monographs, and the relations between the Moroccan nationalist parties and the<br>

  Abstract: There has probably never been a time when issues of nation, language, and translation have been more important or more troubling than they are today. In a world where individual nation-states are increasingly enmeshed in financial and information networks, where multiple linguistic and national identities can inhabit a single state’s borders or exceed them in vast diasporas, where globalization has its serious—and often violent—discontents, and where terrorism and war transform distrust into destruction, language and translation play central, if often unacknowledged, roles. Though the reasons for this are undeniably complex, they are, at least in broad terms, understandable.<br>

  Book Title: Shattered Voices-Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth Commissions<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Phelps Teresa Godwin<br>
  Abstract: Following periods of mass atrocity and oppression, states are faced with a question of critical importance in the transition to democracy: how to offer redress to victims of the old regime without perpetuating cycles of revenge. Traditionally, balance has been restored through arrests, trials, and punishment, but in the last three decades, more than twenty countries have opted to have a truth commission investigate the crimes of the prior regime and publish a report about the investigation, often incorporating accounts from victims. Although many praise the work of truth commissions for empowering and healing through words rather than violence, some condemn the practice as a poor substitute for traditional justice, achieved through trials and punishment. There has been until now little analysis of the unarticulated claim that underlies the truth commissions' very existence: that language-in this case narrative stories-can substitute for violence. Acknowledging revenge as a real and deep human need,
      Shattered Voicesexplores the benefits and problems inherent when a fragile country seeks to heal its victims without risking its own future. In developing a theory about the role of language in retribution, Teresa Godwin Phelps takes an interdisciplinary approach, delving into sources from Greek tragedy toHamlet, from Kant to contemporary theories about retribution, from the Babylonian law codes to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Report. She argues that, given the historical and psychological evidence about revenge, starting afresh by drawing a bright line between past crimes and a new government is both unrealistic and unwise. When grievous harm happens, a rebalancing is bound to occur, whether it is orderly and lawful or disorderly and unlawful.Shattered Voicescontends that language is requisite to any adequate balancing, and that a solution is viable only if it provides an atmosphere in which storytelling and subsequent dialogue can flourish. In the developing culture of ubiquitous truth reports, Phelps argues that we must become attentive to the form these reports take-the narrative structure, the use of victims' stories, and the way a political message is conveyed to the citizens of the emerging democracy. By looking concretely at the work and responsibilities of truth commissions,Shattered Voicesoffers an important and thoughtful analysis of the efficacy of the ways human rights abuses are addressed.<br>

If we or our loved ones are harmed, we call the police and thereafter depend upon the state to investigate, judge, and punish for us. As good citizens and emotionally stable individuals, we are taught to become procedurally and emotionally distanced from both the harm and its perpetrator. Victims who make a fuss about their own needs are treated as emotionally suspect.¹ Feeling and acting have collapsed into one impulse so that even when the state acts in our behalf, we are expected to relinquish an<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fh8vr">Shattered Voices</a><br>
  Abstract: The literary and philosophical traditions of many cultures reveal that the urge for revenge is an ancient, deep-rooted human need that has only tentatively been transferred to central authority in the form of state-sponsored retribution. If that need for revenge is not acknowledged by being in some way incorporated into formal systems of justice, as are the Furies by Athena in the 
                  Oresteia, it reemerges as private vengeance, as it does with Paulina in Death and the Maiden. It has the potentiality of “dripping poison over all the land,” as Athena fears the unsatisfied Furies will do in the Oresteia.<br>

  Abstract: If a state cannot enact traditional retribution for its citizens who were victimized by the former government, is there any point in the gathering and publishing of these victims’ stories? While the story of the evolution from revenge to retribution shows us that a state must do something, must take responsibility to effect a rebalancing for the victims or risk a reversion to personal revenge, our collective imagination has given us little in the way of alternatives to state violence. The pendulum of possible responses swings without pausing from the extreme of traditional retributive justice—requiring investigations, trials, and punishment<br>

Others medicated themselves as well, but usually with pharmaceuticals regulated by the state and prescribed by a psychiatrist. Some were on a fixed and steady plan of antidepressant, antianxiety, or antipsychotic medications; by definition, these antidotes countered some malady or symptom more than they fostered a new state of mind.

Although I did not keep count, overt references to feelings seemed more numerous in the shelter than in most other contexts.

  Book Title: Dreams of Fiery Stars-The Transformations of Native American Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Rainwater Catherine<br>
  Abstract: Selected by
      Choicemagazine as an Outstanding Academic Book for 1999 Since the 1968 publication of N. Scott Momaday'sHouse Made of Dawn, a new generation of Native American storytellers has chosen writing over oral traditions. While their works have found an audience by observing many of the conventions of the mainstream novel, Native American written narrative has emerged as something distinct from the postmodern novel with which it is often compared. InDreams of Fiery Stars, Catherine Rainwater examines the novels of writers such as Momaday, Linda Hogan, Leslie Marmon Silko, Gerald Vizenor, and Louise Erdrich and contends that the very act of writing narrative imposes constraints upon these authors that are foreign to Native American tradition. Their works amount to a break with-and a transformation of-American Indian storytelling. The book focuses on the agenda of social and cultural regeneration encoded in contemporary Native American narrative, and addresses key questions about how these works achieve their overtly stated political and revisionary aims. Rainwater explores the ways in which the writers "create" readers who understand the connection between storytelling and personal and social transformation; considers how contemporary Native American narrative rewrites Western notions of space and time; examines the existence of intertextual connections between Native American works; and looks at the vital role of Native American literature in mainstream society today.<br>

After enjoying a brief era of strong central authority and cultural florescence in the first part of the 3rd/9th century, the ‘Abbâsid empire had begun to experience political decentralization. Given the enormous expanse of the empire, central control from Baghdad was unwieldy at best, and it was not long before it became politically unfeasible as well.

  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Kapteijns Lidwien<br>
  Abstract: In 1991, certain political and military leaders in Somalia, wishing to gain exclusive control over the state, mobilized their followers to use terror-wounding, raping, and killing-to expel a vast number of Somalis from the capital city of Mogadishu and south-central and southern Somalia. Manipulating clan sentiment, they succeeded in turning ordinary civilians against neighbors, friends, and coworkers. Although this episode of organized communal violence is common knowledge among Somalis, its real nature has not been publicly acknowledged and has been ignored, concealed, or misrepresented in scholarly works and political memoirs-until now. Marshaling a vast amount of source material, including Somali poetry and survivor accounts,
      Clan Cleansing in Somaliaanalyzes this campaign of clan cleansing against the historical background of a violent and divisive military dictatorship, in the contemporary context of regime collapse, and in relationship to the rampant militia warfare that followed in its wake.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaalso reflects on the relationship between history, truth, and postconflict reconstruction in Somalia. Documenting the organization and intent behind the campaign of clan cleansing, Lidwien Kapteijns traces the emergence of the hate narratives and code words that came to serve as rationales and triggers for the violence. However, it was not clans that killed, she insists, but people who killed in the name of clan. Kapteijns argues that the mutual forgiveness for which politicians often so lightly call is not a feasible proposition as long as the violent acts for which Somalis should forgive each other remain suppressed and undiscussed.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaestablishes that public acknowledgment of the ruinous turn to communal violence is indispensable to social and moral repair, and can provide a gateway for the critical memory work required from Somalis on all sides of this multifaceted conflict.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhzvq">Clan Cleansing in Somalia</a><br>
  Abstract: This book deals with the changing use of clan- based violence against civilians as a technology of power in the Somali civil war (1978–present). At its center is what I consider the violence of the “key shift,”¹ activated by politico-military leaders in the course of the armed uprising that culminated in the expulsion of President Maxamed Siyaad Barre on January 26, 1991. This study argues that the violence that accompanied and followed the moment of regime and state collapse was analytically, politically, and discursively something new, a transformative turning point and key shift that has remained largely unaddressed (and<br>

  Abstract: The research on which this book is based began as a study of Somali popular songs and poetry as mediations of civil war violence. This is a continuation of my earlier work on Somali popular songs of the nationalist era, a genre that, as I have argued elsewhere, proved to be iconic for this era’s will to modernity—its hopes for national unity and economic development as well as for a “modern,” autonomous, and desiring selfhood.

They have outlined the historical background and contemporary circumstances of what I have called the violence of the key shift, that is to say, a campaign of clan cleansing that turned ordinary civilians, outside any mediating state institutions, into both perpetrators and victims of communal violence.

  Abstract: If the fate of the African continent evokes hopelessness, nowhere is this sense of despair more evident than in former Belgian Africa. No other region has experienced a more deadly combination of external aggression, foreign-linked factionalism, interstate violence, factional strife, and ethnic rivalries. Nowhere else in Africa has genocide exacted a more horrendous price in human lives lost, economic and financial resources squandered, and developmental opportunities wasted. The scale of the disaster is in sharp contrast with the polite indifference of the international community in the face of this unprecedented human tragedy.

  Abstract: Thirty-five years ago Burundi was the scene of a horrific bloodletting when from late April to September 1972 anywhere from 200,000 to 300,000 Hutu were massacred by a Tutsi-dominated army. When the slaughter stopped, most of the educated adult Hutu males were either dead or in exile. From this appalling surgery emerged a state entirely dominated by Tutsi elements from the south, the so-called Tutsi-Hima. For the next seventeen years, Tutsi hegemony remained unchallenged.¹<br>

  Abstract: In an important article, Rowan Greer characterizes early Christianity in terms of what he calls “the marvelous paradox of Christians as alien citizens.”¹ That is, Christians are paradoxically “both involved in and disengaged from society.”² Greer surveys the practical outworking of this paradox in both pre-Nicene writers (
                  Diognetus, Tertullian of Carthage, Clement of Alexandria) and later authors of the fourth-century imperial church (Eusebius of Caesarea, Lactantius, John Chrysostom, Augustine).

In doing so, it draws attention to three interrelated problem areas: 1) the currency of literature is principally shaped by the language of its expression, whereas the currency of memories is principally shaped in societal or political frameworks; 2) the social and political frameworks (i.e. states and institutions) in which cultural memories are current can be less durable and more fluid than the canonicity of certain literary texts; 3) the literary evocation<br>

Among the various instruments of post-Communist transitional justice implemented in the countries of the region, we can distinguish between retributive and reparatory measures. Decommunization and lustration were meant to exclude certain categories of functionaries of the Communist regime from holding important positions in the democratic state, and thus named the perpetrators.

For some this is the inevitable result of a process of integration that is the spill-over effect of economic integration, while for others it is the consequence of the quasisupranational character of the European Union. The current European context is a very interesting case for the study of memory building, both because it is characterized by a complex process of pooling and sharing of sovereignty between nation-states and supranational institutions and because it is a process

Once promoted to Dutch citizenship (or French or whatever), Jews no longer had to rely on the

  Abstract: “Come here! Come here! Ladies and gentlemen, come to see the most surprising and exciting fairground attraction, the cinematograph.” Such was the commentary of dozens, if not of hundreds of barkers (

They invited passers-by to come to experience a “state of shock.” This expression is appropriate to portray the first film spectator because the views represented the quintessence of what art historians have named the distraction, which characterized modernity, and that cinema historians have named “cinema of attractions.”<br>

  Book Title: The Children's Table-Childhood Studies and the Humanities<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): DUANE ANNA MAE<br>
  Abstract: Like the occupants of the children's table at a family dinner, scholars working in childhood studies can seem sidelined from the "adult" labor of humanities scholarship. The Children's Table brings together scholars from architecture, philosophy, law, and literary and cultural criticism to provide an overview of the innovative work being done in childhood studies-a transcript of what is being said at the children's table. Together, these scholars argue for rethinking the academic seating arrangement in a way that acknowledges the centrality of childhood to the work of the humanities. The figure we now recognize as a child was created in tandem with forms of modernity that the Enlightenment generated and that the humanities are now working to rethink. Thus the growth of childhood studies allows for new approaches to some of the most important and provocative issues in humanities scholarship: the viability of the social contract, the definition of agency, the performance of identity, and the construction of gender, sexuality, and race. Because defining childhood is a means of defining and distributing power and obligation, studying childhood requires a radically altered approach to what constitutes knowledge about the human subject. The diverse essays in The Children's Table share a unifying premise: to include the child in any field of study realigns the shape of that field, changing the terms of inquiry and forcing a different set of questions. Taken as a whole, the essays argue that, at this key moment in the state of the humanities, rethinking the child is both necessary and revolutionary.

  Abstract: “Childhood,” writes Joseph M. Hawes, “is where you catch a culture in high relief.”¹ This deceptively simple statement reveals the possibilities created by the merger of childhood studies and history. Although children and youth do not make laws, declare wars, manage corporations, or write books and plays—although they do not feature in traditional measures of progress—they are at the center of many kinds of cultural markers, including support for education, respect for the family, and provision for adequate health care, all of which not only measure the status of children and youth but also reveal the ways in<br>

One such suspended moment is the poem, which freeze-frames the interplay as language so that we can contemplate it, feel it, and concentrate on it.

  Book Title: Seasons of Misery-Catastrophe and Colonial Settlement in Early America<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DONEGAN KATHLEEN<br>
  Abstract: The stories we tell of American beginnings typically emphasize colonial triumph in the face of adversity. But the early years of English settlement in America were characterized by catastrophe: starvation, disease, extreme violence, ruinous ignorance, and serial abandonment.
      Seasons of Miseryoffers a provocative reexamination of the British colonies' chaotic and profoundly unstable early days, placing crisis-both experiential and existential-at the center of the story. At the outposts of a fledgling empire and disconnected from the social order of their home society, English settlers were both physically and psychologically estranged from their European identities. They could not control, or often even survive, the world they had intended to possess. According to Kathleen Donegan, it was in this cauldron of uncertainty that colonial identity was formed. Studying the English settlements at Roanoke, Jamestown, Plymouth, and Barbados, Donegan argues that catastrophe marked the threshold between an old European identity and a new colonial identity, a state of instability in which only fragments of Englishness could survive amid the upheavals of the New World. This constant state of crisis also produced the first distinctively colonial literature as settlers attempted to process events that they could neither fully absorb nor understand. Bringing a critical eye to settlers' first-person accounts, Donegan applies a unique combination of narrative history and literary analysis to trace how settlers used a language of catastrophe to describe unprecedented circumstances, witness unrecognizable selves, and report unaccountable events.Seasons of Miseryaddresses both the stories that colonists told about themselves and the stories that we have constructed in hindsight about them. In doing so, it offers a new account of the meaning of settlement history and the creation of colonial identity.<br>

  Author(s) SPARGO R. CLIFTON<br>
  Abstract: A Holocaust literature that took its imperatives from the existential conditions of the camps would begin always as at the end of culture, in a world of dying, degradation, and atrocity wherein all books and learning exist but as a faint memory of what it meant to be human in some other time, some other place. For Elie Wiesel, there is in fact no other condition from which a literature about the Holocaust might begin, which is to say, there is no way of speaking about the Holocaust in books except from within a state of historically conditioned anxiety about<br>

  The KJV and Anglo-Jewish Translations of the Bible: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjgtt">The King James Version at 400</a><br>
  Author(s) Greenspoon Leonard J.<br>
  Abstract: In a recent study of the relationship between the King James Version and English-language biblical translations by/for Jews, I concluded: “In no other language or culture does a single non-Jewish version exert such influence over Jewish translations.”¹ In order to establish a firm foundation for this declaration, two propositions must be demonstrated. The first, which is implicit in my statement, is that the KJV exerted a significant influence on subsequent Jewish English-language texts. The second, which I might term explicit, is that there are no parallels for such extensive influence by any other non-Jewish version in another language or culture.<br>

  Abstract: This collection is a many-layered conversation on conversations. As the introduction states, it originated in a series of research meetings. The introduction provides pointers to the context and to the main issues discussed; every essay has a response attached to it; groups of essays have their own responses; and I have been asked to reflect on the collection as a whole. In my view the volume’s editors as well as its contributors should be commended for this manner of presenting their deliberations.

  Book Title: Political Creativity-Reconfiguring Institutional Order and Change<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Hattam Victoria<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on the rich cache of antidualist theoretical traditions, from poststructuralism and ecological theory to constructivism and pragmatism, a diverse group of scholars probes acts of social innovation in many locations: land boards in Botswana, Russian labor relations, international statistics, global supply chains, Islamic economics in Algeria, Islamic sects and state authority in Senegal, and civil rights reform, colonization, industrial policy, and political consulting in the United States. These political scientists reconceptualize
         agencyas a relational process that continually reorders the nature and meaning of people and things,orderas an assemblage that necessitates creative tinkering and interpretation, andchangeas the unruly politics of time that confounds the conventional ordering of past, present, and future.Political Creativityoffers analytical tools for reimagining order and change as entangled processes.<br>

  Author(s) Amberg Stephen<br>
  Abstract: The federal government’s rescue of General Motors and Chrysler in 2008–2009 was a dramatic reminder that a liberal state can exert plenary powers to stem a public crisis by controlling the primary agents. Yet federal action came at a moment when social science debates about how institutions shape change had reached a point where government intervention is less significant than the ways that agents are able to innovate from institutional routines.¹ The successful auto bailout raised questions about the evolution of government-market relationships and the capacity of government to improve on market outcomes.

  Chapter 11  Interest in the Absence of Articulation: from:

  Author(s) Harrold Deborah<br>
  Abstract: Several authoritarian regimes in the Middle East and North Africa were taken down in 2011, but this wave of challenges to strong states missed Algeria. In Algeria, large demonstrations in January 2011 and new efforts at political mobilization were overwhelmed by state security and could not continue. What Algeria lacked were the alliances built in other nations. Algeria’s civil war (1993–2000) left deep rifts and mistrust between groups.¹ Profound dissatisfaction with the state and desire for change could not take the place of the political work, underground or in open, of bridging interests and shaping alliances among democratic forces,<br>

  2  Popper and His Followers from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjpmm">How Does Social Science Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: FOR THE LOGICAL empiricists, Popper was simply one of the Vienna Circle, a member who made valuable contributions to analytic philosophy of science. He was a dissenting member who had pointed out some of the difficulties that led to early revisions of doctrine. His most valuable contribution was to emphasize that testing could involve falsification as well as verification. The two kinds of testing are symmetrical (Hempel, 1965, pp. 39–40). An existential statement like “Some ravens in western Manitoba have green heads” could be conclusively verified by going there and finding two or three of them, but could never<br>

  6  Macrosociology of Social Science from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjpmm">How Does Social Science Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: THE MODERN macrosociology of science begins with the work of Robert Merton in the 1930s. The evidence for the above statement consists of citation counts of journal articles (Cole and Zuckerman, 1975), reports of informants (Storer, 1973, esp. p. xi), and acknowledgments and tracing of ideas in leading works such as Hagstrom (1965). Many sociologists of science since 1960 were Merton’s students or students of students (Cole and Zuckerman, 1975, p. 155), and others took up and developed some of his ideas, for instance, Blissett (1972) and Mitroff (1974a).

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjrjj">Dance And Lived Body</a><br>
  Abstract: I have said that dance is an aesthetic expression of the body and that the body is aesthetically constituted in dance. This involves a concern for an aesthetic constitution of the self. I have also held that what can be known and subsequently valued about the body and the self through dance is known and valued aesthetically. Such statements require further explanations of the aesthetic and, more particularly, the aesthetic in dance, which involves the ever-present subjective dimension of embodiment – the body-subject, which is impossible to know as the body-object is known. Our subjectivity is lived rather than known.<br>

  Book Title: Michel Tournier and the Metaphor of Fiction-  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): PLATTEN DAVID<br>
  Abstract: Michel Tournier is a writer who explores complex philosophical questions in the guise of concrete, imagistic narratives. This comprehensive study privileges the notion of literary reference, by which the world of text is understood or experienced in metaphorical relation to the world outside of it. Metaphor, in the context of Tournier’s fiction, shows how the fantastic merges with the real to provide new perspectives on many diverse aspects of the modern world: the Crusoe myth, Nazism, the value to society of art and religion, and the nature of education. This book elucidates an aesthetic of Tournier’s fiction that encompasses the writer’s stated ambition to ‘go beyond literature’.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjbpw">The Cultural Values of Europe</a><br>
  Author(s) Koselleck Reinhart<br>
  Abstract: This statement from Voltaire is readily cited to underline the sovereignty of the human being said to have been unleashed in the eighteenth century, when people broke free of religion and metaphysics. The human being, it is suggested, also determines the position of God and, if needed, for reasons of social control for example, may occupy His position argumentatively. Belief in God is no longer a theologically grounded, self-evident commandment; it is universally useful or, to use more modern language, ideologically fungible.<br>

Despite his efforts to fuse the territories of the peninsula together into a single political order, d’Azeglio did

Its project to break down the “walls” of the title – be they between black and white neighborhoods, different class positions in the African American community, or emotional repression mandated by hegemonic gender discourses – situates the text within modernist economies no longer governed by the imperative to save both money and corporeal capital but rather, as Michael<br>

  Abstract: In the discourse of cultural theory it seems that there is considerable confusion, or at least deep ambivalence, concerning the status and function of maps and mapping. In this context it is important to note that mapping tends to be treated by cultural theorists less in terms of its specific histories and methodological principles than as a set of concepts that are often employed in explicitly metaphorical ways – ‘mapping’, then, rather than strict cartography. On the one hand, there is a tendency to equate mapping with the apparatuses of the state and of social control, as a sort of graphic<br>

  Book Title: American Creoles-The Francophone Caribbean and the American South<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Britton Celia<br>
  Abstract: The Francophone Caribbean and the American South are sites born of the plantation, the common matrix for the diverse nations and territories of the circum-Caribbean. This book takes as its premise that the basic configuration of the plantation, in terms of its physical layout and the social relations it created, was largely the same in the Caribbean and the American South. Essays written by leading authorities in the field examine the cultural, social, and historical affinities between the Francophone Caribbean and the American South, including Louisiana, which among the Southern states has had a quite particular attachment to France and the Francophone world. The essays focus on issues of history, language, politics and culture in various forms, notably literature, music and theatre. Considering figures as diverse as Barack Obama, Frantz Fanon, Miles Davis, James Brown, Edouard Glissant, William Faulkner, Maryse Condé and Lafcadio Hearn, the essays explore in innovative ways the notions of creole culture and creolization, terms rooted in and indicative of contact between European and African people and cultures in the Americas, and which are promoted here as some of the most productive ways for conceiving of the circum-Caribbean as a cultural and historical entity.<br>

  Translations in A Midsummer Night’s Dream from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjj6t">Translating Life</a><br>
  Author(s) WELLS STANLEY<br>
  Abstract: A Midsummer Night’s Dreamis profoundly and constantly—though also delicately and humorously—concerned with processes of change, of translation from one state to another, and its audience is frequently made aware that for human beings translation—any kind of translation—is likely to be a difficult process requiring that obstacles be overcome, and that it may involve loss as well as gain. The most prominent, and most frequently discussed, aspect of translation in the play is from the unmarried to the married state. In no other play by Shakespeare is the process of courtship leading to marriage so central<br>

  Abstract: If it is true, as Dennis Kennedy observes in
                  Looking at Shakespeare, that ‘the visual history of performance ... has been mostly excluded from Shakespeare studies’, then it is even more the case that the history of the music which has accompanied successive productions has been virtually totally ignored. However, if ‘there is a clear relationship between what a production looks like and what its spectators accept as its statement and value’,¹ the same must be true of the aural world generated by musical accompaniment. Less completely pervasive than the visual, physical setting of a performance, and much more prominent<br>

  Author(s) TURNER CHARLES<br>
  Abstract: Many of those who know little of Theodor Adorno’s philosophy know his remark that to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric.² It is a puzzling remark in many respects, not least because of its (largely unstated) assumptions about the effects produced by poetic renderings of unspeakable events. Even if there are events legitimately describable as unspeakable, it is hard to see why poetry deserves more opprobrium than any other way of framing them. Social theory and sociology, for instance, appear prime candidates for the same charge. Indeed, perhaps the only reason that Adorno would not have mentioned them in the<br>

  Abstract: The events of 1845–52 in Ireland known as the ‘Great Famine’ constituted a cataclysm unequalled in Irish history. With more than a million dead from starvation and disease, and more than a million in exodus from Ireland to Britain, North America and Australia, today Ireland remains one of the only European nations whose population is smaller than during the nineteenth century. Precipitated by the potato blight, the Famine was exacerbated by a colonial administration whose failure to alleviate the crisis proved disastrous: the impact of the Famine devastated Irish culture, language, and social demographics, formed the basis for the massive<br>

  Author(s): Worton Michael<br>
  Abstract: French Studies in and for the 21st Century draws together a range of key scholars to examine the current state of French Studies in the UK, taking account of the variety of factors which have made the discipline what it is. The book looks ahead to the place of French Studies in a world that is increasingly interdisciplinary, and where student demands, new technologies and transnational education are changing the ways in which we learn, teach, research and assess. Required reading for all UK French Studies scholars, the book will also be an essential text for the French Studies community worldwide as it grapples with current demands and plans for the future.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjkzw">French Studies in and for the 21st Century</a><br>
  Author(s) Murphy David<br>
  Abstract: Over the past two decades, we have witnessed what Françoise Lionnet has termed the ‘becoming-transnational’ of French Studies.¹ French and the other modern languages had originally been constructed as academic subjects around the framework of the nineteenth-century European nation-state but, as the primacy of the nation state has come to be challenged in the era of globalisation, this structure has been increasingly questioned by scholars working from transnational, global and postcolonial perspectives.² The prominent North American critic Lawrence Kritzman has been prompted to ask, in light of these developments, whether the very existence of French Studies is now in question:<br>

  Abstract: Towards the end of the preceding chapter, I attempted to explain what led the artisan journeymen of Stockholm and Johan Hjerpe to take part in Gustavus III’s showdown with the nobility in the spring of 1789, an episode worthy of a war novel. Although this was not stated, my interpretation was based on a set of general hypotheses about the human mind. The hypotheses underlay the text as its analytical precondition, which perhaps made the interpretation difficult to follow, and possibly also more provocative than it would otherwise have been. At the same time, fuller explanations would have been even<br>

  Author(s) Fraser Nancy<br>
  Abstract: Globalization is changing the way we argue about justice. Not so long ago, in the heyday of social democracy, disputes about justice presumed what I shall call a ‘Keynesian–Westphalian frame’. Typically played out within modern territorial states, arguments about justice were assumed to concern relations among fellow citizens, to be subject to debate within national publics, and to contemplate redress by national states. This was true for each of two major families of justice claims: claims for socioeconomic redistribution and claims for legal or cultural recognition. At a time when the Bretton Woods system of international capital controls facilitated<br>

  Abstract: At the time of writing, it seems that the sceptics have been right. After the referenda on the constitutional treaty of the European Union in France and the Netherlands, the European political project is in disarray. Some of those sceptics will even insist that there never was such a political project anyway. The European Union, in their view, is nothing but an association of states to further their own interests, and the apparent acceleration of political integration over the past fifteen years did not really change its nature. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, so they will underline, explicitly does<br>

  Abstract: That nations dwell in eternal anarchy has been one of the defining assumptions that have shaped the socialization of several generations of students of international relations. While political struggle inside the state takes place in the shadow of the law (conceived as the sovereign’s command), this mediation was thought to be absent in the international arena. However, the demise of the Soviet Union and the increase in the volume, scope and speed of transnational interactions challenged this traditional assumption of anarchy and non-co-operation. Departing from the presumption that war was now a less plausible defining characteristic of the international arena,<br>

Space is one of the ideas listed by Tim Edensor in his discussion of the imbrications of legal frameworks, national identities and everyday life. ‘In a very practical sense, national identity is facilitated by the state’s legislative framework, which delimits and regulates the practices in which people can partake, the spaces in which they are permitted to move, and in many other ways provides a framework for<br>

  Abstract: Adventurous philosophical thought was always at the center of the Pontigny tradition, especially when the philosopher-poet Jean Wahl assumed the direction of Pontigny-en-Amérique after 1942. Wahl invited his favorite American poets, Wallace Stevens and Marianne Moore, along with John Peale Bishop, to speak at Mount Holyoke during the summer of 1943. The topic was to be the relation of poetry and philosophy. Moore lectured on “Feeling and Precision,” carefully choosing her examples of understated eloquence from poetic responses to war. “An unselfish experiment like that of the Pontigny Committee,” she wrote in a letter, “leaves a certain memory of exaltation,<br>

  Abstract: Leading scholars in the fields of philosophy and the sciences of the mind have contributed to this newest volume in the prestigious Pittsburgh-Konstanz series. Among the problem areas discussed are folk psychology, meanings as conceptual structures, functional and qualitative properties of colors, the role of conscious mental states, representation and mental content, the impact of connectionism on the philosophy of the mind, and supervenience, emergence, and realization. Most of the essays are followed by commentaries that reflect ongoing debates in the philosophy of the mind and often develop a counterpoint to the claims of the essayists.<br>

  Abstract: One of the chief characteristics of contemporary philosophy of mind consists in the orientation toward the sciences of the mind. This feature stands in marked contrast to traditional philosophy of mind whose primary allegiance was to philosophy of language. Linguistic analysis was supposed to clarify what could sensibly be meant by the ascription of mental states. The issue was what sort of talk about the mental has a clear meaning and what, by contrast, is to be considered meaningless. This type of philosophical approach to the mind has now gone out of fashion. It was replaced by a science-based approach<br>

  Abstract: Evgeny Irtenev, the recognizably autobiographical hero of Tolstoy’s late unpublished story “The Devil” (1889), is destined for happiness: he has saved his family estate from financial ruin, he has married a woman who loves him, and he even has a lovely new baby girl.¹ One thing alone prevents him from achieving complete happiness: his dire need to continue an affair with a local peasant woman, Stepanida, the “devil” of the story’s title. Ravaged by desire, he ultimately goes insane, vowing in the closing pages of the story either to kill Stepanida or to kill himself in order to end the<br>

  AFTERWORD from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkxkg">Utopia</a><br>
  Author(s) HARP JERRY<br>
  Abstract: Poet, translator, lawyer, statesman, social philosopher, martyr, and (as of 1935) canonized saint, Thomas More remains—in his friend Erasmus’s phrase—a “man for all seasons,” one who in his integrity is suited to all occasions.¹ He was formed to no small degree by the cultural movement known as Renaissance humanism, with its emphases on the study of ancient texts, the deepening of a historical sense, the cultivation of the art of rhetoric, and devotion to active service in the world. The terms “Renaissance” and “humanism” come trailing clouds of ambiguity, so some sorting of their meaning is in order.<br>

  Abstract: The question that arises is how this status is different from the status that accusations or convictions of crime otherwise present. For instance, if someone is labeled a ʺburglarʺ or a ʺthief,ʺ or even—quite generically—a ʺcriminalʺ or a ʺfelon,ʺ those statements clearly confer a status as well. Is there some­thing more essential or more damning about the status that corruption confers than there is<br>

  4  AN EVIL DISPOSITION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vm38s">Captured by Evil</a><br>
  Abstract: As we have already established, the idea of corruption—as commonly understood—is a dispositional idea. It is not a statement, simply, about acts; it is a statement about character. It is about moral degradation and moral failure. To call someone corrupt is to make a statement about the fundamental character of the accused.<br>

  5  CORRUPTION AS CAPTURE-BY-EVIL: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vm38s">Captured by Evil</a><br>
  Abstract: The idea of corruption as capture-by-evil captures many of our intuitions. Its use in law, however, is fraught with problems. As a dispositional concept, the idea of corruption as capture-by-evil potentially contravenes the idea that we should punish
                  acts, notpersons. In addition, invitations to decision makers to implement subjective ideas of evil are arguably invitations toward standardlessness, emotionally driven prosecutions, and other violations of basic guarantees of the rule of law. As Robert Brooks so well stated, ʺPublic anger at some exposed villainy of this sort is apt to be both blind and exacting.ʺ¹ This idea of corruption might<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wp6f3">Preserving and Exhibiting Media Art</a><br>
  Author(s) Marchiori Dario<br>
  Abstract: While the Greek etymology of analysis means “dis-solution,” analysis as a thinking practice (which has been theorized since the ancient times, initially in the realm of geometry¹) involves the related idea of a “breaking up”²: the first experience of it may be considered that of a child breaking a toy to understand its internal structure, and the way it works. Modern thought has reinforced this “decompositional” conception of analysis, which “found its classic statement in the work of Kant at the end of the eighteenth century” and “set the methodological agenda for philosophical approaches and debates in the (late) modern<br>

  Abstract: The Bay of Bengal was once a region at the heart of global history. It was forgotten in the second half of the twentieth century, carved up by the boundaries of nation-states, its shared past divided into the separate compartments of national histories. The regions that gave shape to the postwar organization of academic knowledge—the “areas” of area studies—drew a sharp distinction between “South Asia,” on one hand, and “Southeast Asia,” on the other: the line between them ran right through the middle of the Bay.

  Abstract: In his 1956 song “(How Little It Matters) How Little We Know,” Frank Sinatra aptly poses the. epistemological verity facing every scientific investigator: scientific knowledge eventually fails to explain certain phenomena. Despite voluminous increases in scientific research and publishing, most scientists couch descriptions of the state of their disciplines (which often frame requests for additional funding) in terms of how much there remains to be discovered. Of course, they never intimate (or could even conceive) that their own particular work matters little. However, the Sinatra tune outlines even more vividly the theme of this chapter, late-nineteenth-century unease about the limits<br>

  Abstract: Looming over every positive achievement of the twentieth century is the Nazi Holocaust against the Jewish people, a genocidal explosion that saw a sudden and irrevocable break with all of the secular humanistic traditions that had been developing in Europe over the previous thousand years. The relationship between mass death and the industrial state that became manifested in the Holocaust was both intimate and interdependent, and, as a result of it having taken place, we have forever a yardstick by which all other cases of genocide must be measured. Its message is so powerful that no definition of Western civilization<br>

The nations of the European Union (EU), formerly the European Community (EC), have turned aggressively against Israel, and the post-Holocaust taboo on antisemitic speech and incitement, observed by the mainstream media and responsible political, religious, and intellectual leaders for decades, has been broken. When and why did this happen? How are we to understand the plethora of vulgarly antisemitic cartoons and caricatures, as well as statements by European leaders of a kind not uttered publicly since the fall of the Third Reich?<br>

This process is a rare success story in contemporary postconflict peacebuilding. Because the conflict occurred during a time of statelessness in Bougainville, space was opened for a renaissance of nonstate customary institutions and processes. In the absence of state institutions, local practices resumed their central role in the life of the communities.

  Abstract: The Buddhist term “original enlightenment” plays a special role in the development of Japanese Buddhist thought as a nonsectarian concept that represents specifically Japanese variations on the core theme of realizing “enlightenment.” It is an extension of the ⌜Mahayana⌝ teaching of ⌜buddha-nature⌝, the potential and hope for realizing ⌜buddhahood⌝. Given the ambiguity of the term and differences in interpretation, it can be translated into English in any number of ways. “Original enlightenment” is the most common, but this has a strong temporal connotation, implying some primordial or original state to be recovered or uncovered to fully realize enlightenment or buddhahood.<br>

This is the opening statement of a work that is considered to be the genealogical moment in the creation of aesthetics as an autonomous philosophical field—a creation prompted by the need to rescue the senses from the primacy of reason.

When they have commented at all on the social contexts of the quest for transcendence, it has usually been to point out that histories record a keen interest on the part of certain rulers in esoteric arts, or to note that adepts shunned ordinary society and lived as hermits on mountains, or that in their training they were subject to certain poorly documented ethical rules, or that the only communities they formed were master-disciple lineages.¹ These characterizations (with the exception of the blanket statement that adepts shunned society) are<br>

  3  Ghosts and Historical Time from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqx52">The Phantom Heroine</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter I explored how the ghost was used in Chinese literature to stage a confrontation with mortality. Endowing the ghost with a voice capable of expressing subjective emotion, primarily through the vehicle of lyric poetry, opened a window onto the unknowable: what would it feel like to be dead, to be on the other side? Accordingly, these ghost stories represent death as an interior state of exile in which suffering and longing are intensified rather than annihilated. The paradigmatic sites of such stories are the cemetery, the unmarked grave, uninhabited wasteland; the paradigmatic poetic genres involved are<br>

  Author(s) Solovyov Erikh<br>
  Abstract: Everywhere the process of formation of democratic institutions is accompanied by a severe and demanding moral criticism of political practice.¹ Such was the case in Western Europe in the eighteenth century, such is the case today in those countries that develop a model of a

  Abstract: Postcommunist development followed the demise of monopoly structural control on the part of the communist-statist class over the state and, through it, over the economy and all other sectors. Until the nature of the new social orders crystallizes sufficiently, we have to designate as “postcommunism” a “transition period” in which, along with the supposed break, considerable continuity with the previous situation will persist, particularly as regards cadres and the economy.<br>

  Abstract: The political revolution in 1989 in Eastern Europe and the dramatic events of August 1991 in Moscow did not only mark the end of the Cold War era, but also the beginning of a worldwide wave of democratization. Marc F. Platter hailed the arrival of democracy on the ruins of Leninist Socialism as “the democratic moment” and stated that “we may at last be entering a sustained period of peaceful democratic hegemony—a kind of ‘Pax Democratica’.”¹ Samuel P.

  Abstract: During his tenure as South Korea’s leader (1961–1979), President Park Chung-hee exercised his authority by developing laws and various state apparatuses aimed at controlling all dissident movements. For this end, the Korean military, the national police, and the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) became useful coercive structures Park employed to maintain his rule. In addition to these structures of domination, Park also attempted to legitimize and justify his seizure of power as well as his plans to modernize South Korea. These legitimizing discourses revolved around two main themes. Park initially justified his seizure of power as an issue of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wr2rg">Christianity in Korea</a><br>
  Author(s) Kim Byong-suh<br>
  Abstract: Sociological studies have often found that institutional disorganization and the loss of the social function of religion may occur when society becomes modernized. Peter Berger summed it up thus: “The impact of modernity on religion is commonly seen in terms of the process of secularization, which can be described as one in which religion loses its hold on the level both of institutions and of human consciousness.”¹ Berger’s harsh assessment may well describe the state of the Korean Protestant church today. For the last forty years, a startling wave of modernization accompanied by industrialization, urbanization, and rapid social mobility have<br>

  Abstract: Considerations of center and periphery in Heian Japan involve at the highest level the relationship between the central political apparatus and the hinterlands, the sixty-six provinces and two islands (Iki and Tsushima) that constituted the conceptualized polity. Indeed, the very existence of a state presupposes control over the human and material resources of the space thought to constitute the geographical area of that conceptualized state. This was never an easy task for Japanese rulers, despite the insular character of Japan that seems to lend itself to simple mapping of a discrete geopolitical entity.

  Author(s) SMITS IVO<br>
  Abstract: Unlike those who study Japanese history, scholars of Japan’s literature have long been reluctant to seriously take into account texts written in Chinese, or Sino-Japanese. While this peripheral position of Chinese texts is shifting, it is necessary to restate the obvious: insofar as the written word is concerned, premodern and early modern Japan was a bilingual country. The marginalization of Chinese some two centuries ago resulted in a fading awareness of a large cultural heritage. With the rise of

  Book Title: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains-Culture and Society in the Highlands of Bali<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Reuter Thomas A.<br>
  Abstract: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains is the first comprehensive ethnography of the Bali Aga, a large ethnic minority that occupies the island's central highlands. The Bali Aga are popularly viewed as the indigenous counterparts to other Balinese who trace their origin to invaders from the Javanese kingdom of Majapait, who have ruled Bali from the fourteenth century A.D. Although Bali remains one of the most intensely researched localities in the world, the Bali Aga have long been overshadowed by the more exotic courtly culture of the south. A closer analysis of the changing position of the Bali Aga within Balinese society provides a key to understanding the politics and social process of cultural representation in Bali and beyond. The process is marked by a blend of representational competition and cooperation among the Bali Aga themselves, among the Bali Aga and southern Balinese, and later among the island's aristocratic elites and foreign colonizers or scholars, and state authorities. The study of this process raises important issues about the establishment and maintenance of status and power structures at regional, national, and global levels. Custodians of the Sacred Mountains explores the marginalization of the Bali Aga in light of a critical theory of cultural representation and calls for a morally engaged approach to ethnographic research. It proposes an intersubjective and communicative model of human interaction as the foundation for understanding the relative significance of cooperation and competition in the cultural production of knowledge.<br>

  Abstract: IN the late 1820s, the Cherokee Nation was in the midst of a revolutionary series of sociopolitical changes that would forever change the course of its history. In fifty years, over half of all Cherokee lands had been ceded to the United States and the pressure for them to move to a territory west of the Mississippi River had been steadily increasing.

This remarkable combination of traditionalism and innovation describes a state elusively beyond any linguistic epistemology—yet resident in any experiential event—and offers a method to capture individual experience of “pure immanence.”¹ The emphasis Deleuze placed on event and experience stimulated the energetic analysis of their interrelations by Alain Badiou, turning philosophy away from cognitive mapping through Kantian categorical imperatives and re/turning it to the world.

  Author(s): Burns Robert P.<br>
  Abstract: Burns explores the rich narrative structure of the trial, beginning with the lawyers' opening statements, which establish opposing moral frameworks in which to interpret the evidence. In the succession of witnesses, stories compete and are held in tension. At some point during the performance, a sense of the right thing to do arises among the jurors. How this happens is at the core of Burns's investigation, which draws on careful descriptions of what trial lawyers do, the rules governing their actions, interpretations of actual trial material, social science findings, and a broad philosophical and political appreciation of the trial as a unique vehicle of American self-government.<br>

  Author(s): Burns Robert P.<br>
  Abstract: Burns explores the rich narrative structure of the trial, beginning with the lawyers' opening statements, which establish opposing moral frameworks in which to interpret the evidence. In the succession of witnesses, stories compete and are held in tension. At some point during the performance, a sense of the right thing to do arises among the jurors. How this happens is at the core of Burns's investigation, which draws on careful descriptions of what trial lawyers do, the rules governing their actions, interpretations of actual trial material, social science findings, and a broad philosophical and political appreciation of the trial as a unique vehicle of American self-government.<br>

  The Pianos of Johannes Brahms from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rxmx">Brahms and His World</a><br>
  Author(s) BRADY STEPHEN H.<br>
  Abstract: The pianos Johannes Brahms encountered in Hamburg during his youth would have been essentially the same as the early Romantic fortepianos of Beethoven and Schubert. By the time Brahms wrote his final compositions half a century later, the piano had evolved to a state of construction—if not hammer design and voicing—virtually identical with the modern instrument. The two grand pianos commonly associated with Brahms—the Conrad Graf piano (no. 2616) presented by its Viennese builder to Clara Schumann in 1839 as a “reverential souvenir” and passed on to Brahms in 1856,¹ and an 1868 instrument by Johann Baptist<br>

  Between Work and Play: from:

  Author(s) MOSELEY ROGER<br>
  Abstract: At the beginning of the twenty-first century, we can hear Brahms’s music wherever and whenever we like. But can we locate its source? The composer himself is long dead, even if his defiant gaze and formidable beard still haunt us. His printed musical texts survive, of course, taking up generous shelf space in libraries, music shops, and homes throughout the world, but their circles and lines will always remain mutely imprisoned on the page. Some have preferred this state of affairs, believing that musical notes are better seen than heard. The theorist Heinrich Schenker, for instance, believed that “a composition<br>

  Brahms’s Four Serious Songs, op. 121 (1914) from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rxmx">Brahms and His World</a><br>
  Author(s) KARNES KEVIN C.<br>
  Abstract: Brahms left us several written statements about his
                  Four Serious Songs, the maestro’s final work, designated opus 121. These statements—sometimes running parallel to, other times diverging from his verbal remarks—might seem to contradict each other. At first glance, the contradictions appear to be profound. However, a closer look does away with them completely. The first thing one notes is the jovial, almost frivolous tone with which Brahms speaks of the “godlessSchnadahüpferln,” the “Schnadahüpferlnof May 7,” or simply the “Schnadahüpferln,” as if it were obvious that he could only be referring, with this term, to the Four<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7s6ph">Performing Africa</a><br>
  Abstract: Upon mere mention of the phrase “African music,” a list of features readily comes to the fore. A sampling of comments: “African music is all drumming”; “It’s rhythm”; “It is the heartbeat that just makes you want to get up”; “It is noise and not music”; “African music is so primal.” This brief list of common refrains in no way gives one a sense that informants agree about the value of African music. Yet attentiveness to the ideas behind some of these statements helps illuminate the sedimented logics that hold in place Europe and one of its Others, Africa. Ideas<br>

  Abstract: On February 18, 1965, amid the cautions of many anxious observers, The Gambia raised its flag as an independent nation. The tiny country in transition, so obviously a colonial port of call, with its thin strip of riverside territory, could not present the mass of a former empire or the solidity of an ethnic homeland. Some, no doubt, felt that the country would fold into the encompassing nation of Senegal. A place so small and with so few resources, they reasoned, would by necessity require the protection of a more substantial nation-state. As people wondered about the feasibility of this<br>

During this transition, installed as president was Lieutenant Yahya Jammeh, elected through a peaceful, although not invited, shift in power. The former president, Jawara, had been elected head of state since the end of colonial rule, but the democratic elections that periodically marked the postcolonial political era did not create a shift in political leadership.

  Abstract: An active European site of fiery debates, where stakes in labor migration, immigration, patriation, and national and ethnic identity politics are very high, is the reunified German state. At this historical juncture, over six million foreigners, including Gastarbeiter (guest workers), refugees, asylum seekers, writers, artists, and professionals are permanently settled in Germany. In the embattled Europe of the post-cold-war era, Germany, with its economic power, political stability, generous welfare system, and what until recently were very flexible asylum laws, has become, perhaps quite unwittingly and unwillingly, the destination for a growing body of dis- placed peoples.

  Abstract: How permanent is the nation as an associative form? Do human beings congregate naturally as sovereign states, defining themselves naturally by their membership in nations? Or are there other ties, other loyalties and commitments, based on non-national ideals and flourishing on nonnational platforms? Bruce Ackerman speaks of a “world constitutionalism,”¹ creating a rule of law across national boundaries. Jürgen Habermas argues for a “postnational constellation,” made up of a broad array of nongovernmental forms, an integrated network reflecting the planet as an integrated environment.

  Book Title: Christian Political Ethics-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Coleman John A.<br>
  Abstract: Christian Political Ethicsbrings together leading Christian scholars of diverse theological and ethical perspectives--Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, and Anabaptist--to address fundamental questions of state and civil society, international law and relations, the role of the nation, and issues of violence and its containment. Representing a unique fusion of faith-centered ethics and social science, the contributors bring into dialogue their own varying Christian understandings with a range of both secular ethical thought and other religious viewpoints from Judaism, Islam, and Confucianism. They explore divergent Christian views of state and society--and the limits of each. They grapple with the tensions that can arise within Christianity over questions of patriotism, civic duty, and loyalty to one's nation, and they examine Christian responses to pluralism and relativism, globalization, and war and peace. Revealing the striking pluralism inherent to Christianity itself, this pioneering volume recasts the meanings of Christian citizenship and civic responsibility, and raises compelling new questions about civil disobedience, global justice, and Christian justifications for waging war as well as spreading world peace. It brings Christian political ethics out of the churches and seminaries to engage with today's most vexing and complex social issues.<br>

  Abstract: In its contemporary usage the term

Where such patterns of association, cooperation, and structured relationships are thought to be weak or inconsequential, as in the corporatist East of yesteryear (where individuals are said to have related chiefly to the State) or as in the capitalist and individualistic West (where personal relationships may arguably occur only within the family, and perhaps not even there), it has become commonplace to lament the nonexistence of<br>

                  Staatslehren(where there even is one!) of different Christian theological ʺfamilies,ʺ such as Catholics, Calvinists, Lutherans, Anabaptists, and the Orthodox, do not fully agree or even always converge on their doctrines of the state and society.¹ To avoid this trap of even trying to achieve a fully rounded summary of the varying positions, I will focus primarily on the tradition<br>

According to the dictionary, it is both a descriptive term, ʺthe quality or state of being plural,ʺ and a theoretical or normative term, ʺthe doctrine that there are more than one or two kinds of being or independent centers of causationʺ; ʺopposed to
                  monism, or dualism.ʺ¹ Accordingly, the phrase ʺethical pluralismʺ might designate the simple existence of a diversity or plurality of ethical positions, or it might refer to a doctrine holding that ethics, as the systematic evaluation of human action, isin its natureincapable<br>

  Abstract: It is no accident that the issue of reconstituting international society appears before us today, at a moment when the economic, medical, cultural, and communication structures that play such a critical role in modern society are changing rapidly. Although civil society in the past largely coincided with the boundaries of the state, it is now being reconstructed internationally in ways that strain the capacity of any government to order, guide, or control. In fact, some observers foresee little but chaos since societies are no longer confined within a single legal system and no one seems to be in control.¹ Even<br>

  Author(s) FINNIS JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Law, and a legalistic morality and politics, can define peace and war by their mutual opposition. Any two communities are either at peace or at war with one another. If they are at war, each is seeking a relationship to the other (ʺvictory over,ʺ ʺprevailing overʺ) which that other seeks precisely to frustrate or overcome. If they are at peace, each pursues its own concerns in a state of indifference to, noninterference in, or collaboration with the concerns of the other.<br>

  11  Just War Thinking in Catholic Natural Law from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7t1pt">Christian Political Ethics</a><br>
  Author(s) BOYLE JOSEPH<br>
  Abstract: I am in substantial agreement with the analysis in John Finnisʹs chapter. Indeed, it is as good a short statement of just war theory within the Catholic natural law tradition as I know of. Given this, I think the most useful contributions I can make are to underline certain points that seem to me to be important, to develop some of the distinctions Finnis makes, and to draw out some of the implications of his analysis. I will also say something more than Finnis does about conscientious objection and the duty of citizens to support their nationʹs war efforts.<br>

  Abstract: Understanding war. This book has been asking what war meant to a population whose experience and memory were shaped by warfare, a population whose armies and navies were almost constantly engaged in military conflict across the globe, though rarely, if ever, on home ground. It has asked how war was understood by those who were, at least as subjects of a sovereign state, often at war, though never actually in battle. But it has not yet asked what it meant to make war an object of understanding.<br>

During the first half of the twentieth century, this region was still overwhelmingly rural and Catholic. Politically Meßkirch and its surrounding villages were a bastion of the (Catholic) Center Party, which, together with the SPD, formed one of the central components of the continuing coalition of parties that kept the Weimar Republic in operation during the 1920s. In the elections of 1932 the Center Party received an absolute majority of the votes cast in<br>

  Abstract: In 1818 Keats, in distinguishing the sort of “poetical Character” to which he belonged, contrasted it to “the wordsworthian or egotistical sublime; which is a thing per se and stands alone.”¹ The statement seems to define in an important way a certain irreducible attitude in Wordsworth's life and art. Benjamin Haydon, for instance, said that though Wordsworth was a “great Being,” he could use his intense feelings only “as referring to himself.”² Coleridge, indeed, observed as early as 1799 that “Wordsworth appears to me to have hurtfully segregated & isolated his Being/Doubtless, his delights are more deep and sublime;/but he<br>

                     ständige Unganzheit—that continuing incompleteness—seen by Heidegger as an unavoidable limitation of life itself, we might expect the form and purpose of those strivings to reveal themselves, under inspection, as an attempt to overcome or at least to compensate for such fragmentation. We might expect to find that the ceaseless effort discharged into philosophical formulation, interchangeably with the continuously pulsating transformations of spirit into poetic statement, was somehow prompted by the diasparactive condition of our existence.<br>

Pound and Eliot, like the philosophers, assume that instrumental conventions shape our thoughts and feelings in everyday life.

The present chapter will be devoted to this dialectic of form and flux in Modernist poetics. I will begin with the case of T. E. Hulme, who outlines the essential shape of the new movement.

When we allow a tyrant to get control of our spirits or our cities, the first thing he will do is put us to work at backbreaking and stultifying tasks.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv3n">Contemporary Majority Nationalism</a><br>
  Author(s) NOOTENS GENEVIÈVE<br>
  Abstract: In liberal democratic societies, nationalism has long been associated with minorities and opposition to the state. The phenomenon has indeed often manifested itself most visibly in challenges to the central state. The nationalism projected by states, to the contrary, has either remained relatively hidden or has been granted a legitimacy denied to minority nationalist movements. For example, it typically goes without saying from the perspective of states that they may choose an official language for the public sphere and that this choice is therefore obfuscated as a meaningful expression of nationalism. The legitimacy of a similar choice by minority nations,<br>

  Abstract: Uzbekistan, Eritrea, Moldavia, Slovakia, and East Timor are all new independent states on our world map, but they are by no means the only ones. In the 1990s, no less than twenty new states were created. Most of them emerged out of the ruins of the Soviet Empire, while others were the product of the resumption of a decolonization process interrupted by expansionist neighbours such as Ethiopia and Indonesia. This list, however, takes into account only the criteria of international recognition, which provide a partial and imperfect image of much broader nationalist claims.¹<br>

  Abstract: Acting as midwife for the birth of a new state is a formidable enterprise even for the boldest of revolutionary elites, but creating a new nation is an even more demanding challenge. To quote a much-cited observation from the nationalist writer and former Piedmontese prime minister Massimo d’Azeglio, “Italy is made; now we must make Italians” (Seton-Watson 1967, 13). In many respects, this resembled the challenge that was shortly to be faced by a new empire to the north: how to transform Bavarians, Saxons, Prussians, and others into true Germans.

  Abstract: In her book

The British and French paths became rivalling world views, with antagonistic conceptions of politics and the economy, state organization, the relationship between state and civil society, and, above all, the role of religion within the political system; and they will form the substance of the discussion here.<br>

  Author(s) Woods Gurli A.<br>

  Author(s) JØrgensen Bo Hakon<br>
  Abstract: Isak Dinesen’s youth coincided with the period of Symbolism in Denmark. She was fifteen years old in 1903, and nineteen when her favourite collection of poems
                     Djævlerier[Devilries] (1904) was published,written by the Danish poet she appreciated most of all, Sophus Claussen. Later Dinesen made the statement to Aage Henriksen, one of the young men at Rungstedlund after the Second World War, that Sophus Claussen was theonly one, of all the Danish poets, who was “free.”<br>

  Abstract: The very notion of a genuine postmodernist view of the world would certainly be a
                  contradictio in adjecto. In this paper I shall discuss the criticism of Modernity and the problem of non-simultaneousness in relation to Dinesen's work, and this discussion will in turn be seen in relation to the ideas of postmodernism as a certain state of sign production and receptionon the borderlines, i.e., behind and consequently inside of what we call Modernity. As a start, I shall provide a rough outline of the kind of framework in which we talk about postmodernism. Secondly, I shall try to show<br>

  Author(s) OAKLEY FRANCIS<br>
  Abstract: If the title of this essay suggests the presence of a measure of confusion in the debates of the past decade and more about the state of the humanities, it is intended to do so. It is intended also to signal the fact that a residual undertow of agnosticism still tugs away uneasily even at this rather modest attempt merely to identify the principal changes over the past twenty-five years in
                  whatis actually being taught in the undergraduate humanities classroom and inhowit is being taught. For that is my topic. And yet, to the degree to which<br>

  Abstract: My own quandary is immeasurably less important (except to me) but not less real. When this collection of essays was being bruited, I found myself saying at an explorers’ meeting that instead of everybody’s talking, yet once more, about “the state of the humanities” and the changes and chances of late, those of us who resist the claims of certain recent developments—as not truly or not sufficiently developments at all—would do better to get on with such<br>

  Book Title: I Am You-The Hermeneutics of Empathy in Western Literature, Theology and Art<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Morrison Karl F.<br>
  Abstract: Important trends in contemporary intellectual life celebrate difference, divisiveness, and distinction. Speculative writing increasingly highlights "hermeneutic gaps" between human beings, their histories, and their hopes. In this book Karl Morrison identifies an alternative to this disruption. He explores for the first time the entire legacy of thought revolving around the challenging claim "I am you"--perhaps the most concise possible statement of bonding through empathy. Professor Morrison shows that the hope for thoroughgoing understanding and inclusion in another's world view is central to the West's moral/intellectual tradition. He maintains that the West may yet escape the fatal flaw of casting that hope in paradigms of sexual and aesthetic dominance--examples of empathetic participation inspired by hunger for power, as well as by love.<br>

  Abstract: The end of late antiquity is a period of Jewish history best known for being unknown. Salo Baron emphasizes the darkness of this terra incognita: “In the first three and one half dark and inarticulate centuries after the conclusion of the Talmud (500–850), Jewish intellectual leadership laid the foundations upon which the vocal and creative generations of the following three and one half centuries (850–1200) erected the magnificent structure of medieval Jewish biblical learning.”¹ S.

  Abstract: A stay at Royaumont Abbey, as the original inhabitants intended, is good for the mind and soul. Acquired by King Louis IX in 1228 from nuns of the Saint-Martin-de-Boran priory, the Royaumont estate became the site of a new abbey for the Cistercian order of monks. Subsequently occupied by nuns of the Holy Family of Bordeaux, Royaumont would also become the residence of a wealthy businessman, a hospital for wounded soldiers in World War I, and eventually an international cultural center. The travelers who journeyed in May 1998 to this meeting place of artists and intellectuals were, like Roderick Macdonald’s<br>

  Abstract: Religious crises, political upheaval and decentralization, economic changes, social and scientific discoveries, and print-capitalism contributed to the development of a national consciousness and the formation of a social dynamic based on boundary-oriented and horizontal communities in Western Europe during the Renaissance.¹ The restructuring of the centripetally and hierarchically organized state accompanying the development of the new imagined community challenged the reign of the dominant language that provided “privileged access to onto logical truth” (Anderson 40). Bakhtin claims that the changes in European civilization at this time resulted in Europe’s emergence from a “socially and culturally deaf semi-patriarchal society” into one<br>

  Book Title: Living Prism-Itineraries in Comparative Literature<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KUSHNER EVA<br>
  Abstract: She discusses the current state of comparative literary studies and the renewed role of comparative literature in a world that is at once more plural and more globalized, as well as some of the debates now taking place within literary criticism as a whole, including the interchange between comparative literature and cultural studies, the re-envisaging of the Renaissance, the work of Northrop Frye, myth and literature at the end of the twentieth century, modern drama, and post-colonialism. To play an important role in the human sciences, comparative literature had first to free itself of a number of restrictive habits, such as an insufficiently critical literary history. In order to do this, it had to think theoretically, but without yielding to the temptation of letting theory become an end in itself. Kushner demonstrates that, while under strong pressures to be a more rigourous science, comparative literature has realized that in the human sciences the validation of knowledge has to seek its own tests and criteria, becoming increasingly more open to individuality, difference, and life situations and controlling its tendency to universalize. With its emphasis on whether literary history is possible and the problems it raises for literary theory and for comparative literature in particular, The Living Prism adds an important dimension to the ongoing debate about criticism and comparative literary studies.<br>

It is therefore even more perilous to generalize about the state of a discipline in Canada than in countries where higher education is more evenly dispensed, structured, supported.

  Abstract: The Proustian origin of this title requires no explanation. It expresses a set of creative tensions: the time that is lost is that of life lived and spent in the instant – raw, yet infinitely rich and complex material for retrieval in memory. To live is forever to transform experience into memory; and even this statement oversimplifies, inasmuch as memory re-enters experience and adds to the given that is to be transformed.

  Author(s): BLATTBERG CHARLES<br>
  Abstract: Blattberg's is a genuinely original philosophical voice. The essays collected here discuss how to re-conceive the political spectrum, where "deliberative deomocrats" go wrong, why human rights language is tragically counterproductive, how nationalism is not really secular, how many nations should share a single state, a new approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict, and why Canada might have something to teach about the "war on terror." We also learn about the right way to deny a role to principles in ethics, how to distinguish between the good and the beautiful, the way humor works, the rabbinic nature of modernism, the difference between good, bad, great, and evil, why Plato's dialogues are not really dialogues, and why most philosophers are actually artists.<br>

  Abstract: Even those who accept that a single country can serve as a home for more than one nation are often led astray by the venerable nationstate model of what a country is or should be. Consider what has become a virtual axiom among scholars of nations and nationalism, namely that nationalists’ concern for self-determination invariably leads to a desire for sovereignty, for the complete control over a state. When applied to multinational federations, the axiom supports the assumption that the members of the minority nations will, at the very least, favour decentralization. Here, for example, is Will Kymlicka:<br>

  Abstract: Jonathan Dancy has described his
                     Ethics without Principlesas the culmination of twenty-five years of work, and indeed it is a major statement by a leading contemporary moral philosopher. Dancy’s basic aim is to provide an alternative to those mainstream, principlesbased approaches to ethics, which is why a great deal of his energy in this and previous works has been devoted to criticizing that mainstream. My critique here, however, is different in that it comes from “the other side,” so to speak, for I wish to argue that Dancy’s alternative does not take us far enough.<br>

The essays collected here discuss how to re-conceive the political spectrum, where "deliberative deomocrats" go wrong, why human rights language is tragically counterproductive, how nationalism is not really secular, how many nations should share a single state, a new approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict, and why Canada might have something to teach about the "war on terror." We also learn about the right way to deny a role to principles in ethics, how to distinguish between the good and the beautiful, the way humor works, the rabbinic nature of modernism, the difference between good, bad, great, and evil, why Plato's dialogues are not really dialogues, and why most philosophers are actually artists.<br>

  Abstract: Even those who accept that a single country can serve as a home for more than one nation are often led astray by the venerable nationstate model of what a country is or should be. Consider what has become a virtual axiom among scholars of nations and nationalism, namely that nationalists’ concern for self-determination invariably leads to a desire for sovereignty, for the complete control over a state. When applied to multinational federations, the axiom supports the assumption that the members of the minority nations will, at the very least, favour decentralization. Here, for example, is Will Kymlicka:<br>

  Abstract: Jonathan Dancy has described his
                     Ethics without Principlesas the culmination of twenty-five years of work, and indeed it is a major statement by a leading contemporary moral philosopher. Dancy’s basic aim is to provide an alternative to those mainstream, principlesbased approaches to ethics, which is why a great deal of his energy in this and previous works has been devoted to criticizing that mainstream. My critique here, however, is different in that it comes from “the other side,” so to speak, for I wish to argue that Dancy’s alternative does not take us far enough.<br>

  Author(s) BENJAMIN WILLIAM E.<br>
  Abstract: Over the past half-century, Istvan Anhalt has produced a body of work as technically refined, as rich in meaning, and as fully engaged with musicality as any other from this period. There are reasons why it does not enjoy the wide recognition accorded other oeuvres, of which many have less potential to reward the discerning listener. The professional cost of reaching full production only after the age of fifty can be cited – if easily explained by way of thirty-five years of unstinting devotion to teaching – as can the fractured state of musical politics (like all politics) in Canada,<br>

  Abstract: The Istvan Anhalt fonds comprises one of the largest and most detail-intensive units among the over 300 fonds and collections housed in perpetuity in the Manuscript Section of the Music Division of the National Library of Canada.¹ The Anhalt fonds remains in a state of growth as the composer continues to compose, lecture, and write.

  The Life and Times of K.Z. Paltiel from:

  Author(s) Paltiel Jeremy<br>
  Abstract: My father, K.Z. Paltiel, was born into a well-to-do family in the Jewish neighbourhood of Montreal on March 16, 1922. This was the same neighbourhood evoked by the poet A.M. Klein and later satirized by Richler. His father, Aaron David, who immigrated from Romania just before the turn of the century, had started off as a dry-goods merchant in Northern Ontario in Porcupine and North Bay, but settled down in Montreal around the time of the First World War and built up a successful business as a real estate developer and property manager.

  Author(s) Rowat Donald C.<br>
  Abstract: The topic of this chapter would no doubt have pleased Khayyam Paltiel, because he was intensely interested in the improvement of our democratic institutions and procedures. As is well known, Ontario’s new right of access to governmental and personal documents is an example of a democratic reform that has been adopted in many western democracies. Perhaps I should first explain why I decided to focus on the system established in Ontario. One reason is that it is very recent. The schemes in Quebec, New Zealand, Australia and its state of Victoria, and the federal scheme in Canada, were all adopted<br>

  A Political Economy Approach to Interest Representation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt806sg">Democracy with Justice/La juste democratie</a><br>
  Author(s) Jenson Jane<br>
  Abstract: Thinking about modes of interest representation has undergone several permutations in recent years, as major alterations in post-war electoral coalitions mark the emergence of new political actors, partisan strategies, and forms of state/society and global relations. The diversity of literatures analyzing neo-corporatism, new social movements, New Left and post-modern politics indicates that the theoretical perspectives on liberal democracy which dominated political science and sociology after 1945 required reconceptualization. Moreover, since the political events provoking new theory occurred in conjunction with a profound crisis and restructuring of economic relations, even political economy approaches began to reassess representation.<br>

  New Social Movements and Unequal Representation: from:

  Author(s) Phillips Susan D.<br>
  Abstract: As a scholar of Canadian politics, Khayyam Z. Paltiel was concerned with the appropriate and equitable representation of interests in the policy process. In particular, he addressed the issue of whether interest groups have displaced political parties as the fundamental agents of representation and democratic legitimation in the Canadian political system and he examined the impact of special interest groups on the Canadian state (1989, 1982). Because interest groups of all kinds have proliferated since the 1960s, they now are often in vigorous competition with each other, as well as with political parties, in the policy-making process. However, interest groups<br>

Stevens, on the other hand, is widely assumed — and not without reason — to have adhered to Humanist ideas despite his statements to the contrary. It is certainly true that both poets lived and breathed in an intellectual climate in which Humanism was the most appealing option for those who had lost their religious faith but balked at the bleak prospect of social Darwinism or Socialism/<br>

  Abstract: Caribbean literatures have a long history of using Creole in writing, and more markedly in orature, although the scope and reception of this use has varied, with acceptability and more confident practice growing in the final decades of the twentieth century. One of the pioneering and persistent subgenres associated with orality and the use of Creole is the epistolary exchange or series of epistolary monologues, where a persona, often female and using humour, writes home relating impressions of the new land to family or friends, or abroad to inform émigrés of the state of affairs “back home.” The literary form<br>

  Abstract: NAMES, ACCORDING TO PLATO, ARE INSTRUMENTS that help us distinguish and teach the essence of things.¹ With a similar notion in mind, many of us architects wonder from time to time about the meaning and origins of our architectural expressions. Tracing back terms to their origins offers a way to reach an initial, and perhaps authentic, state of things, to rediscover threads of continuity and to reaffirm their importance. Words such as “architect,” “architecture,” “tectonics,” “technology,” “technic,” “dome,” and “domicile” are among many architectural terms of Greek origin. Among all these technical terms one can also find the oldest (known)<br>

  From Modernity to Postmodernity from:

  Author(s) ILCAN SUZAN<br>
  Abstract: It is not a coincidence that postmodernism and postcolonialism have materialized at the same time as objects of study in the human sciences: the one is a function of the other. The collapse of the
                  grands récitsof the Enlightenment that Jean-François Lyotard (1986) identifies as the signifying mark of postmodernity is contingent upon the end of the great European nation-state empires and of capitalism grounded in nation-states.

  Author(s) RUTLAND BARRY<br>
  Abstract: Is there a subject that is not an ethical subject?¹ To what is any subject subjected if not ethical exigency – by which I mean, not the necessity to choose to follow this or that ethical prescription but, rather, the unrefusable givenness of being-in-the-world-with-other-subjects, the state of affairs summarized negatively in Sartre’s (1962, 91)
                  Huis clos, “L’enfer, c’est les Autres”? The positivities of this situation are explored in the writings of Emmanuel Levinas (1969, 1981): here ethical exigency reduces, in the Husserlian sense of leads back, to the Face – the demand from the other as a physical body for acknowledgment, recognition,<br>

  Abstract: Strangers have become the subjects and objects of intense social, cultural, and political exclusion. We need only recall the discontents of a stranger who is refused entry at a state border, or an exiled subject, a native denied cultural membership, a “foreigner” excluded from public service. These strangers, or marginal others, appear everywhere. It is not their image that is at stake here but, rather, the effect that this otherness implies in the development of specific social practices.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt80m78">Ethics of Catholicism and the Consecration of the Intellectual</a><br>
  Abstract: The last three decades of the nineteenth century in France witnessed a significant interest in ethics.¹ This trend coincided with the onset of the Third Republic. The Third Republic was proclaimed in 1870 but was more officially established through a series of laws which culminated in 1875. Thinkers of the time envisioned the republican era as providing a solid ground on which to build a secularized state. The debate over secularization, which progressively materialized from the early 1880s to the famous Combes legislation of 1904 testifies to the importance of the issue on the political agenda of the time.<br>

An anonymous young intellectual of the Gaullist resistance, describing the state of the leading legal youth organizations in spring 1942, saw the French Scouts as “the conscious or unconscious, admitted or unacknowledged inspiration for everything that the RN did in the area of youth.” He noted that Father Doncoeur’s

  Book Title: Karl Polanyi on Ethics and Economics-Foreword by Marguerite Mendell<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Baum Gregory<br>
  Abstract: Exploring Polanyi's lesser-known works as well as The Great Transformation, Baum provides a more complete and nuanced understanding of Polanyi's thought. He examines Polanyi's interpretation of modern economic and social history, clarifies the ethical presuppositions present in Polanyi's work, and addresses how Polanyi's understanding of the relation between ethics and economics touches on many issues relevant to the contemporary debate about the world's economic future. Baum argues that we should look to Polanyi's understanding of modern capitalism to reinstate the social discourse and, in political practice, the principles of reciprocity and solidarity. He points to examples, both in Canada and abroad, of attempts to formulate alternative models of economic development and to create new forms of institutional and cultural intervention.<br>

  Abstract: The all too brief pages allotted here to Claude Simon’s best-known work will run counter to the critical mainstream, which posits the impracticability of establishing meaning from this novel’s narrative sequences. J.A.E. Loubère offers a tidy summary of the prevailing view of the secondary literature: “Far from bringing elucidation, the text [Simon] elaborates refuses to resolve itself in information. It demonstrates instead that it is the enemy of information, either because of its power to breed new texts ... or because of its tendency to peter out and vanish in the deserts of the imagination” (102).

  Abstract: Though Timothy Findley’s

Following the established conventions of its predecessors, from Poe’s “Murders in the Rue Morgue” onward, it employs a sleuth outside the regulatory powers of the state, in pursuit of a murderer whose motive and means are out of the ordinary. There is a body, a setting which unites all the suspects under one roof, and an Aristotelian structure ofperipeteia(Porter 1983, 331). Like all detective<br>

  Abstract: Discourses of forgiveness and reconciliation have emerged in the past decade as among the most powerful scripts for interracial negotiations in states struggling with the legacies of colonialism. Even more than the kind of political discourse I sampled in the preface, literary texts meditate on the limits and possibilities of forgiveness and reconciliation. I am concerned here with engaging the competing perspectives on forgiveness and reconciliation that literature provides, and with exploring its potential for opening up new perspectives and new worlds, for imagining alternatives, in other words, to normative conceptualizations of justice.

  Abstract: These statements by Paul Ricoeur, a French philosopher, and Joy Kogawa, a Canadian writer of fiction, might profoundly discomfit a postmodern academic audience familiar with the problems of humanism. Both thinkers express faith in the possibility of forgiveness at a time in history when such faith might seem naïvely optimistic and at worst dangerously self-deceptive.

  Author(s) Weston Dagmar Motycka<br>
  Abstract: SURREALISM IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE to twentieth-century culture because of its fruitful efforts both to restore poetic wholeness to a daily reality which had been fragmented and impoverished by nineteenth century positivistic and instrumental attitudes and to reinstate the imagination as the distinctive attribute of human existence.³ The surrealists’ quest to reconcile the seemingly contradictory states of “reality” and “dream” in a poetic state of
                  surreality⁴is powerfully embodied by their urban texts, epitomized by André Breton’sNadjaandL’amour fou, and Louis Aragon’sLe paysan de Paris.⁵These writings are of great interest to anyone thinking about the nature<br>

  Abstract: Preachers often ponder the state of preaching. The influence, methods and reception of mentors are weighed. When this is done, there is frequently fearfulness about the future of preaching. So Tim Keller spoke at the American memorial to John Stott, saying, “John Stott reinvented expository preaching. I’m still worried that younger evangelical leaders are increasingly thinking that they need to get beyond expository preaching.”¹<br>

  Book Title: Kin, Gene, Community-Reproductive Technologies among Jewish Israelis<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Carmeli Yoram S.<br>
  Abstract: Israel is the only country in the world that offers free fertility treatments to nearly any woman who requires medical assistance. It also has the world's highest per capita usage of in-vitro fertilization. Examining state policies and the application of reproductive technologies among Jewish Israelis, this volume explores the role of tradition and politics in the construction of families within local Jewish populations. The contributors-anthropologists, bioethicists, jurists, physicians and biologists-highlight the complexities surrounding these treatments and show how biological relatedness is being construed as a technology of power; how genetics is woven into the production of identities; how reproductive technologies enhance the policing of boundaries. Donor insemination, IVF and surrogacy, as well as abortion, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and human embryonic stem cell research, are explored within local and global contexts to convey an informed perspective on the wider Jewish Israeli environment.<br>

  Author(s) Goldberg Helene<br>
  Abstract: This article explores kinship and fatherhood in light of male infertility and artificial reproductive technologies (ARTs) in the Jewish-Israeli context. I became interested in the male reproductive experience in Israel through a backdoor interest in Jewish identity, and then came across Susan Kahn’s groundbreaking study (2000) of single, secular Jewish women’s reproduction in Israel with the use of sperm donation. It seemed that because of Israeli technological advances in reproductive technologies, the state’s support of fertility treatment, national efforts to increase the Jewish population, and the concept that Jewish identity is passed through the mother, men could be removed from<br>

  Author(s) Carmeli Yoram S.<br>
  Abstract: Infertility affects some 8 to 14 percent of the fertility aged population worldwide (Bentley and Mascie-Taylor 2000). Many of the affected individuals seek medical assistance in their attempts to found families. Others, often after having exhausted and “failed” this option, opt for child adoption. Though popularly perceived of as the heart of one’s private life, both these routes to family founding—fertility treatments and adoption—are tightly regulated by state policies.<br>

  Abstract: Israel, so many scholars claim, is a pro-natal state. But what does that mean in terms of the public imagery of pregnancy? That

One could hypothesize that since such a pregnancy is the height of the pro-natal fantasy, then it should be depicted in the most positive of terms. How then, can one interpret the following scene in which terror is so tightly intertwined into the very fabric of the social imagery of gestation?<br>

  Author(s) Remennick Larissa<br>
  Abstract: Some recent sociological analyses of reproduction approached the relations between women as mothers and various social institutions (legal and medical systems, labor market, social welfare, mass media, etc.) within the continuum between reproductive citizenship, on one hand, and individualism/consumerism, on the other. Thus, Bryan Turner (2001) has defined the concept of reproductive citizenship as a route to active social participation through reproduction, all the more important in the times of general erosion of other traditional forms of citizenship (such as worker-citizen and warrior-citizen). Reproductive citizenship is a reflection of nationalism and demographic interests of the state, which has a stake<br>

  Abstract: The State of Israel has emerged as a leader in the use and development of new reproductive technologies. It is well-known for example, that Israel boasts more IVF clinics per capita than any other country in the world, and is one of the only nations to make this technology available at public expense to women without regard to their marital status or sexual orientation (Kahn 2000). More surprising perhaps is that Israel, where determinations of personal status and the legality of reproductive technologies are subject to veto by state-authorized religious authorities, specifically legalized donor insemination at least a decade before<br>

  Abstract: “Communalism” in the political language of modern India denotes first and foremost the strivings of religious, ethnic, social, or linguistic communities to assert their particularity against the generalizing elements in the concept of the nation.¹ Thus during the course of India’s struggle for independence the communalism of the Muslims in particular distanced itself from the more broadly defined all-Indian nationalism. But other minorities, such as the Sikhs, the Tamils, the lower castes, etc., have also exhibited communalist tendencies out of fear that the postcolonial Indian state would be dominated by the Hindus, the North Indians, the upper castes, leaving them<br>

  Author(s) von Joeden-Forgey Elisa<br>
  Abstract: When Chancellor Bismarck suddenly undertook a policy of overseas expansion in 1884, Germany was almost wholly unprepared for the legal and ideological stresses of colonial domination. Since it was determined from the outset that overseas polities would not be brought into the German federation as member states, the German constitution provided no model for the incorporation of colonial territories and German citizenship law was equally useless for defining the status of Germany’s new subjects. Dominant thinking among officials and the public was very much influenced by the traditions of the old Prussian territorial state, where expansion was generally coupled with<br>

  Abstract: These are not words that can be found in the first edition of Hannah Arendt’s great work
                  The Origins of Totalitarianism, conceived during the Second World War and published in 1951. In it, the continuities between the age of European imperialism and the age of fascism in Europe were traced through theories of race, notions of racial and cultural superiority, and the right of “superior races” to expand territorially. An idiosyncratic history linking the failure of the bourgeoisie, “the decline of the nation state,” and “the alliance between mob and capital” provided some brilliant insights into the newly baptized phenomenon<br>

  Author(s) Stoetzler Marcel<br>
  Abstract: This chapter is about a series of contradictions in Hannah Arendt’s writings, contradictions that she names and explores, and contradictions in her own discourse. Arendt’s writings are a declaration of antipathy to the bourgeoisie by a thoroughly bourgeois writer, a defense of the nation-state based on dislike of nationalism, a defense of traditional bourgeois values from modern bourgeois domination, and an account of the modern state that granted the Jews emancipation at a point when, by becoming national, it was in the process of preparing the renewal of the Jews’ exclusion and persecution.<br>

  Author(s) Paletschek Sylvia<br>
  Abstract: The nineteenth century has many names: the century of the bourgeoisie, the century of nations, the century of industrialization, and the century of natural science and technology.¹ However, it might just as well be called the century of history. From the late eighteenth century on, the engagement with the past, and particularly with ‘patriotic’ history (
                  vaterländischer Geschichte), was an important means of shaping individual and collective identity. After the collapse of theAlte Reich(the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation) in 1803–1806, and following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the German states in their new patchwork<br>

  Book Title: The Rhetorical Emergence of Culture-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Girke Felix<br>
  Abstract: "Just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric" - the first half of this central statement from the International Rhetoric Culture Project is abundantly evidenced. It is the latter half that this volume explores: how does culture emerge out of rhetorical action, out of seemingly dispersed individual actions and interactions? The contributors do not rely on rhetorical "text" alone but engage the situational, bodily, and often antagonistic character of cultural and communicative practices. The social situation itself is argued to be the fundamental site of cultural creation, as will-driven social processes are shaped by cognitive dispositions and shape them in turn. Drawing on expertise in a variety of disciplines and regions, the contributors critically engage dialogical approaches in their emphasis on how a view from rhetoric changes our perception of people's intersubjective and conjoint creation of culture.<br>

  Author(s) Meyer Christian<br>
  Abstract: The International Rhetoric Culture Project has stated in its theoretical outline that “just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric.” The first part of this chiasmus can readily be accepted, since cross-cultural research on speaker performance, memory techniques, social expression of emotion, practical reasoning, and the interrelation between speaking styles and political organization have provided abundant evidence that rhetoric is culture-specific. Extensive research in folklore studies, the ethnography of speaking, and linguistic anthropology have also proved this claim over and over again, the most spectacular cases being the use of parallelism and metaphor (e.g., Fox 1988,<br>

  Author(s) Wilson Thomas M.<br>
  Abstract: Romano Prodi, the then President of the European Commission, made the above statement at the Sixth ECSA-World Conference, Jean Monnet Project, Brussels, 5–6 December 2002. At the time it was clear that the European Union (EU) was expanding, and eastward, to first become a union of twenty-five member states in 2004 and then twenty-seven states in 2007, but the dilemma he posed concerned how to set the limits of the EU, metaphorically and geopolitically. Prodi queried the nature of public participation in the projects of expansion and consolidation – what in other circles has been called ‘widening and deepening’<br>

  Author(s) Suski Laura<br>
  Abstract: Many commentators might agree with Ulrich Beck’s claim that the ‘human condition has itself become cosmopolitan’ (2006:2). There is, however, little agreement as to how this impacts upon the ethical relationship between cosmopolitan subjects. If there is an increase in the transnational flows of people, commodities, labour, and information, and if these trends are accompanied by the declining role of the state and the emergence of international institutions, what does this mean for our moral obligations to those beyond the traditional spaces of family, community, and particularly the nation? My interest in cosmopolitanism lies specifically at the intersection of what<br>

  12  The Sacred in Poststructuralist Thought from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qcrr1">Godless Intellectuals?</a><br>
  Abstract: With the Durkheimian group, it was necessary to do a significant amount of work to demonstrate the ways in which their intellectual work constituted a statement about the role and identity of intellectuals; with the poststructuralists, a good deal of that connection of the work to an autobiographical project is done by the poststructuralists themselves. Foucault spoke frequently of the connection between his intellectual work and his own experience and identity: “I have always held that my books are, in a sense, autobiographical fragments” (2001b: 1566–67). One of Derrida’s close friends and colleagues has argued that “all Derrida’s texts<br>

  Author(s) Pfeil Gretchen<br>
  Abstract: Attempts to discuss the central ritual forms of American Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity, among them conversion narrative and sermon, are troubled by a seeming conflict. They seem to be ritual forms, and at the same time, to be something more, even opposed to ritual action. The urgency and personal quality of these forms of devotional practice lead, sometimes, to readings of them as transparent statements of fact. Conversion narrative, for example, is both clearly a form of devotional practice and also “real,” compelling as autobiography and a source of information about practitioners’ lives. This chapter unpacks this paradoxical quality to<br>

  Book Title: A Lover's Quarrel with the Past-Romance, Representation, Reading<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Ghosh Ranjan<br>
  Abstract: Although not a professional historian, the author raises several issues pertinent to the state of history today. Qualifying the 'non-historian' as an 'able' interventionist in historical studies, the author explores the relationship between history and theory within the current epistemological configurations and refigurations. He asks how history transcends the obsessive 'linguistic' turn, which has been hegemonizing literary/discourse analysis, and focuses greater attention on historical experience and where history stands in relation to our understanding of ethics, religion and the current state of global politics that underlines the manipulation and abuse of history.<br>

On the one hand, European integration has been seen as an essential factor affecting the structures, strategies, and visibility of these actors by opening new opportunity structures and providing supplementary access points that can be used in complementary ways to the pre-existing national ones. At the same time, however, this process is also creating new constraints for participation and collective mobilization and is seen to favor some societal<br>

And what are the specific consequences regarding protest politics? The following chapter presents key ideas of an ongoing research project* that puts globalization in a Rokkanean perspective.¹ It conceives the contemporary opening up of boundaries as a new critical juncture, which induces new structural cleavages, both within and between nation-states.² Using this perspective, the project tries to find novel answers to the transformation of national electoral and protest politics in a globalizing world.<br>

  Author(s): Mycock Andrew<br>
  Abstract: A sustained and systematic study of the construction, erosion and reconstruction of national histories across a wide variety of states is highly topical and extremely relevant in the context of the accelerating processes of Europeanization and globalization. However, as demonstrated in this volume, histories have not, of course, only been written by professional historians. Drawing on studies from a number of different European nation states, the contributors to this volume present a systematic exploration, of the representation of the national paradigm. In doing so, they contextualize the European experience in a more global framework by providing comparative perspectives on the national histories in the Far East and North America. As such, they expose the complex variables and diverse actors that lie behind the narration of a nation.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdcbq">Narrating the Nation</a><br>
  Author(s) Lim Jie-Hyun<br>
  Abstract: Modern historiography has often been a tool to legitimate the nation-state ‘objectively and scientifically’. Despite its proclamation of objectivity and scientific inquiry, modern historiography has promoted the political project of constructing national history. Its underlying logic was to find the course of historical development that led to the nation-state. Thus, national history has made the nation-state both the subject and the object of its own discipline. The ‘Prussian school’ provides a typical example. Not only was Ranke the official historiographer of the Prussian state, Droysen’s distinction between ‘History’ (

Reform policies that opened up the Indian economy to global market forces—colloquially known as “liberalization”—have significantly transformed the political, economic, and cultural landscape of India.

  Abstract: In recent years there has been a renewal of academic and political interest in order and disorder in contemporary cities. Many investigations center on the relationship between levels of deprivation and ethno-racial composition as well as how this relationship shapes perceptions and patterns of disorder in given inner-city areas. The state possesses the right not only to manage immigration into its territories but also to define what is “disorderly” and therefore “inappropriate” conduct.

  Abstract: In the soapbox speeches of politicians, references to Europe have until recently functioned as an institutionalized appeal to overcome the nationstate. Intellectuals like the political scientist Jerzy Mackow have lent weight to this notion by calling for a ‘European idea’—which he aptly calls ‘Europeanism’—analogous to the development of nationalism during the nineteenth century. In order to build a common identity on the basis of history beyond ‘a bunch of national narratives and legends,’ he argues ‘the Europeans need to learn and understand European history.’¹ Even the past chairman of the Association of German Historians Johannes Fried warns that<br>

  Chapter 3  Writing National Histories in Europe: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdff2">Conflicted Memories</a><br>
  Author(s) Berger Stefan<br>
  Abstract: The rise of national identity discourses in Europe accompanied the growing professionalization and institutionalization of history writing in the nineteenth century. Consequently national history writing became, for about one century between 1850 and 1950, the dominant form of history writing across Europe. Of course, national history had been written long before the nineteenth century. Thus we can trace histories of England, for example, to medieval times.¹ And of course, national history continued to be a popular genre after the 1950s, in big nation-states as much as in smaller and reemerging or nascent nation states. National histories thus possess a long<br>

  Abstract: Ideas of European integration are mostly shaped by the image of an increasing merger of distinct states. In this process differences are dissolved to be finally subsumed into one coherent social and political space with one homogenous public sphere inhabited by actors who perceive each other as similar. This idea derives from the common experience of the nation- building process and its homogenizing effects since the nineteenth century: diverse societies built a common new form, where differences were largely extinguished. This perspective has not remained unchallenged: disapproving skeptics highlight the value of European plurality, which should not be pressed into<br>

By the nineteenth century what could be called the European cultural space was global, as opera houses and theatres were built in colonial capitals and outposts from Buenos Aires to Hanoi, and as European educators and performers took ‘Culture’ to the far reaches of empire.

  Abstract: The Europeanization of economic life is not a new phenomenon in recent history. Traders have consistently been connected throughout the various parts of Europe, and the emergence of the modern nation-state did not bring transnational economic activities to an end. The first multinationals emerged in Europe in the second half of the nineteenth century, and their economic importance further increased in the twentieth century. But the attempt to create a transnational economic area with supranational institutions was successful for the first time only after the Second World War.

From the 1920s on, the political scene shifted markedly to the right: theories of the New Order proclaimed the failure of parliamentary democracy, and in Italy Fascism (Mussolini in 1922) and in Germany Nazism (Hitler in 1933) acquired real political power. In both countries, an authoritarian state was established and war was proclaimed against the Red Peril of Communism. The youth, as the future cornerstone of the ideology and the regime, was assigned a central part in this process. Groupings attached to<br>

  Abstract: In several Western societies we witness today an increasing tendency to “educationalize” social problems. As an institution, the school is, among other things, held accountable for solving social inequalities (related to class, race, and gender); for reducing traffic deaths, obesity, teenage sex, and environmental destruction; and for enhancing public health, economic productivity, citizenship, and even performances in sport contests such as the Olympic Games. Pushing these kind of “social” responsibilities on schools is a process that has been under way for a long time and coincides with the role of education in the formation of the modern nation-state.

  Book Title: Islam & Europe-Challenges and Opportunities<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): TIBI Bassam<br>
  Abstract: Dedicated to increasing our knowledge and awareness of the ever-growing diversity and pluralism of global society, Forum A. & A. Leysen has initiated an annual debate/lecture series, beginning with a focus on Islam in today's world and in Europe in particular. Seven well-known influential authorities - each an active participant in the public debate on the global role of Islam past, present and future - recently presented papers at the first Intercultural Relations Conference sponsored by Forum A.& A. Leysen. These important contributions, on the topic Islam and Europe: Challenges and Opportunities, are reprinted in this volume. Although each contributor speaks from his own distinctive point of view, a common message emerges from all seven texts: only dialogue - on the one hand between the West (countries that manifest themselves as Western Democratic constitutional states) and Islam, and on the other hand within and among societies historically identified with Islam- will overcome entrenched confrontation and negative animosity, engender new possibilities and understandings, and, by encouraging free and critical thinking, pave the way to social equity and the scientific innovation that, potentially, can lead to more prosperity. In the course of the conference all seven talks led to fascinating debates. This book includes the most important questions asked and the speakers' responses. Although the question of how to actually construct the dialogue remains unsettled, this ground-breaking book takes a giant step toward an answer.<br>

  Abstract: I believe there is an anti-Muslim wind blowing across the European continent. One factor is the perception that Muslims are making politically exceptional, culturally unreasonable or theologically alien demands upon European states. Against that, I wish to say, that the claims Muslims are making, in fact, parallel comparable arguments about gender or ethnic equality. Seeing the issue in that context shows how European and contemporary is the logic of mainstream Muslim identity politics. Additionally I shall argue that multicultural politics must embrace what I call a moderate secularism, and resist a radical secularism.<br>

  Author(s) Kerslake Christian<br>
  Abstract: From the beginning, Freudian psychoanalysis stood apart from other theories of the unconscious in relating the emergence of unconscious mental formations directly back to events and fantasies that shaped the mind in childhood. Freud decisively rejected all metaphysical and dialectical accounts of the emergence of consciousness from a nebulous unconscious (theories which had their roots in the idealism of Hegel, Schelling and Schopenhauer). He rejected Breuer’s claim (derived from the Janet school) that the presence of ‘hypnoid’ dissociative states was a necessary condition for the repression of a representation.

  Author(s) Van Haute Philippe<br>
  Abstract: It is commonplace to state that the various object-relations theories are more easily reconciled with attachment theory than Freudian psychoanalysis. Freud invariably
                  derivesboth the libidinal directedness towards an object and the attachment tendency from the need for love or food. He fails to posit attachment as a primary tendency which needs no further ontogenetic elucidation. In this way, he inevitably comes into conflict with attachment theory which emphasizes the originality and non-deducibility of this tendency (Geyskens & Van Haute 2003). Object-relations theories, on the other hand, teach us that the libido is first and foremost directed towards finding adequate objects.<br>

  Abstract: This paper concerns what Freud called the ‘special characteristics’ of the unconscious. According to his metapsychological writings, unconscious mental states differ from conscious ones not just in not being conscious, but in having what he calls ‘systematic’ features, such as exemption from mutual contradiction, imperviousness to the influence of external reality, and so forth. Yet he still wants to characterise them as mental states. He is often explicit in his use of psychological language to describe them. Even when he is not, he makes it clear that the mechanistic-sounding language he sometimes uses is to be understood metaphorically. The movements<br>

  The Thanatosis of Enlightenment from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdz7w">Origins and Ends of the Mind</a><br>
  Author(s) Brassier Ray<br>
  Abstract: Myth is already enlightenment, and enlightenment’s destruction of superstition merely reinstates myth: this is the speculative thesis proposed by Adorno and Horkheimer’s
                  Dialectic of Enlightenment¹. My contention here is that this dialectic of myth and enlightenment is structured by an entwinement of mimicry, mimesis, and sacrifice which not only underlies the book’s ‘excursus’ on Odysseus and its celebrated chapter on anti-semitism, but arguably furnishes it with its fundamental conceptual core. Though each of these concepts are undoubtedly complex, mobilized to distinct purposes in different parts of Adorno’s oeuvre in particular, their deployment inDialectic of Enlightenmentseems to harbour the<br>

  Abstract: It goes without saying that neither secular democratic states nor Islam as a religion could be perceived to be homogeneous and immutable in time and space. this paper will firstly focus on misunderstandings relating to secularity and democracy: Contrary to the widespread understanding of secularity among Muslims, secular states open broad space not only for the private exercise of religion, but also for its public practice and appearance. As to democracy, Muslim traditionalists use to juxtapose its mechanisms to the ‘eternal provisions of God-given Sharia’. It will be briefly demonstrated that every norm, being derived from God or a human<br>

  Author(s) Scott Anna<br>
  Abstract: The “Afro” style of movement and performance began in Brazil in the seventies among radicalized sectors of the Black-mixtured community as a way to recuperate and politicize inherited African cultural practices that had been co-opted by the dictatorship as simply folklore, part of “our Brazilian Heritage.” Twenty years later, it appears that this particular style of dance has a fixed set of codes from which the dancer may construct/choreograph meaning into a performance. This position, however, reinstates the paradigm of the “folk” into a dynamic process of identification, communication, and insertion within transnational discourses about the various cultures of people<br>

  Abstract: Revisiting seventies socialism and soul culture from the vantage point of the United States in the nineties raises important questions about the structures of enjoyment embedded in the anticapitalist stance of many emergent socialist states, such as Tanzania during that turbulent time. Most critiques of seventies socialist cultures readily dismiss socialism as having no soul. The inherent assumption of such critiques is that capitalism is the sole arbiter of enjoyment through free and ideologically uncontaminated flow of consumption. Such binary critiques oversimplify the relationship between state formations and citizens as consumers. These critiques further elide the intricate and nuanced strategies<br>

  Abstract: There is by now an overwhelming catalogue of evidence revealing the depth and breadth of the corporate- and state-sponsored assaults being waged against democracy in the United States. Indeed, it appears that the nation has entered a new and more ruthless historical era, marked by a growing disinvestment in the social state, public institutions, and civic morality. The attack on the social state is of particular importance because it represents an attempt to shift social protections to the responsibility of individuals while at the same time privatizing investments in the public good and undermining the bonds of communal solidarity.

  Abstract: Americans seem confident in the mythical notion that the United States is a free nation dedicated to reproducing the principles of equality, justice, and democracy. What has been ignored in this delusional view is the growing rise of an expanded national security state since 2001,¹ and an attack on individual rights that suggests the United States has more in common with authoritarian regimes like China and Iran “than anyone may like to admit.”² I want to address this seemingly untenable notion that the United States has become a breeding ground for authoritarianism by focusing on four fundamentalisms: market fundamentalism, religious<br>

One indication of America’s loss of purchase on a democratic future is the discourse of denial surrounding the crises produced on a daily basis by hyper-punitive casino capitalism.¹ Rather than address the ever-proliferating crises produced by market fundamentalism as an opportunity to understand how the United States has arrived at such a point, the dominant classes now use such crises as an excuse for normalizing a growing punishing and warfare state, while consolidating the power of finance capital and the mega-rich.

At the same time that the forces of privatization, deregulation, and financial marketization tighten their grip on all aspects of society, the social state is transformed into the punishing state and increasingly violates civil liberties as part of an alleged war against terrorism.

  Abstract: Religion, morality, and the law are said by one of our authors (George Kelly) to comprise a three-legged stool, upon which the state rests. Force and authority are not mentioned, but perhaps authoritative force is considered to be a derivative of law in its provisions for sanctions; and all three of the “legs” entail authority in at least one of its varied senses. (See NOMOS I and NOMOS XXIX.) At first glance, it might appear that the relation of law to the state is not on all fours with the relation between the state and religion or that between the<br>

  Author(s) HOLMES STEPHEN<br>
  Abstract: Liberal beliefs about the proper relation among law, morality, and religion first acquired distinct contours during the wars of religion that ravaged France between 1562 and 1598. While recent commentators on the state’s obligatory “neutrality” toward conflicting moral ideals often refer to this bloodily traumatic period,² they usually do so only in passing. We can shed considerable light, however, upon our constitutionally mandated separation of political and religious spheres as well as upon the uneasy relation between law and morals typical of the liberal tradition if we exhume and reexamine one deeply influential argument for religious toleration advanced in late<br>

  Author(s) MACK ERIC<br>
  Abstract: In recent years the increased strength and assertiveness of socially conservative political movements have heightened public debate about the legitimate role of the state in enforcing moral prescriptions that are arguably the product of particular, sectarian, religious or moral perspectives. Social conservatives, motivated by components of their religious commitments, have not only condemned homosexual activity and abortion (to pick the two most prominent issues) but have also argued that these activities ought to be legally prohibited. In opposition to such proposals, there has been a reassertion of the liberal doctrines that political institutions must be neutral between competing conceptions of<br>

  Abstract: There is perhaps no more vexing, fraught, and neglected concept in the study of children’s literature than
                  aesthetics. No doubt the neglect of a serious, theoretical inquiry into the aesthetics of children’s literature stems from our contemporary understandings of the discipline of children’s literature itself. The study of children’s literature has, historically, been the work of librarians and educators of children. Children’s literature came to be seen as an appropriate site of purely literary study only after the rise and fall of mid-twentieth century New Critical and formalist modes of criticism, a state of affairs made possible by the inchoate<br>

  Abstract: According to the

From the first cited use—notably, in Samuel Richardson’sClarissa(1747–48), a novel concerning the paragon of virtuous adolescent girlhood—the term “girlhood” has had a history as an ideologically loaded term in Western culture. As the following brief definitions indicate, several meanings overlap: “The state of being a girl; the time of life during which one is a girl. Also: girls collectively.” Its different denotations and connotations make for a<br>

  Abstract: Although the phenomenon of liminality appears in the earliest children’s texts, it doesn’t appear in children’s literature scholarship until the beginning of the twenty-first century, chiefly in the adjective form, “liminal,” a polyseme whose other meanings relate to psychology and mysticism. “Liminality” is a coinage from the Scottish anthropologist Victor Turner (1969 ), who drew on “liminaire,” a term used by Arnold Van Gennep (1909) in his ethnographical writings on preindustrial societies to designate the middle, transitional stage of a three-stage paradigmatic rite of passage (“rites which accompany every change of place, state, social position and age”).

  Abstract: The word “postcolonial” refers (I) to a period or state following (that is, “post”) colonialism, and (2) to the effects of colonization upon cultures, peoples, places, textuality. The terms most often associated with “postcolonial” are “imperialism,” which denotes the formation of an empire, and “ colonialism,” which refers to the establishment of colonies by an imperial power that maintains control over them. The first usage of “postcolonial” (or “post-colonial”) identified in

  Book Title: 22 Ideas to Fix the World-Conversations with the World's Foremost Thinkers<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Sakwa Richard<br>
  Abstract: The aftershocks of the 2008 financial crisis still reverberate throughout the globe. Markets are down, unemployment is up, and nations from Greece to Ireland find their very infrastructure on the brink of collapse. There is also a crisis in the management of global affairs, with the institutions of global governance challenged as never before, accompanied by conflicts ranging from Syria, to Iran, to Mali. Domestically, the bases for democratic legitimacy, social sustainability, and environmental adaptability are also changing. In this unique volume from the World Public Forum Dialogue of Civilizations and the Social Science Research Council, some of the world's greatest minds - from Nobel Prize winners to long-time activists - explore what the prolonged instability of the so-called Great Recession means for our traditional understanding of how governments can and should function. Through interviews that are sure to spark lively debate,22 Ideas to Fix the Worldpresents both analysis of past geopolitical events and possible solutions and predictions for the future.The book surveys issues relevant to the U.S., Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Speaking from a variety of perspectives, including economic, social, developmental, and political, the discussions here increase our understanding of what's wrong with the world and how to get it right. Interviewees explore topics like the Arab Spring, the influence of international financial organizations, the possibilities for the growth of democracy, the acceleration of global warming, and how to develop enforceable standards for market and social regulation. These inspiring exchanges from some of our most sophisticated thinkers on world policy are honest, brief, and easily understood, presenting thought-provoking ideas in a clear and accessible manner that cuts through the academic jargon that too often obscures more than it reveals.22 Ideas to Fix the Worldis living history in the finest sense - a lasting chronicle of the state of the global community today.Interviews with: Zygmunt Bauman, Shimshon Bichler and Jonathan Nitzan, Craig Calhoun, Ha-Joon Chang, Fred Dallmayr, Mike Davis, Bob Deacon, Kemal Dervis, Jiemian Yang, Peter J.

  Abstract: It is trivial at this point to state that the world is in crisis. The aftereffects of the most recent global financial crisis continue to have major implications for the lives of tens of millions of people around the world, just as they continue to influence the fate of policymakers, political systems, and corporate behavior. Myriad other global crises—of democracy, governance, ecology, and inequality, among others—all contribute to a precarious present. Quite simply, we live in uncertain times—in a sort of ‘inter-regnum’ between old and new ruling paradigms.<br>

  Abstract: Veteran environmental activist Paul Watson offers a provocative, counterintuitive, and iconoclastic view of the state of an environment in crisis. Basing his analysis on a long-term conception of ecological history as well as recent examples of environmental crises, his central premise is that the environmental movement is not about saving the planet itself but saving the planet as it is for future human generations.

  Abstract: A preeminent expert on international political economy, Peter Katzenstein offers a nuanced analysis of the current state of world power. Shying away from both misplaced optimism and economic apocalypticism, he argues that the main trend facing the modern, crisis-riddled world is a diffusion of power around the globe and among a range of actors on the international stage. Starting from such an actor-based approach, he argues that many of the woes facing the world today were not caused by concepts like “the market” or “the crisis” but rather by a set of interactions among actors.

  Abstract: Editors’ Note: Stanton again appeared before the state legislature in February 1860 to deliver one of her most powerful arguments for women’s emancipation. Susan B. Anthony was coordinating a new campaign to follow up on the modest reforms of 1848 and secure a broader package of economic and property rights for married women in New York. The state assembly had passed a second Married Women’s Property Act, and the day after Stanton spoke, so did the state senate. Anticipating victory, Stanton’s remarks look past the granting of equal property rights to the broader challenge of securing equal political rights for<br>

  Abstract: Editors’ Note: Two months after the 1860 passage of a broad Married Women’s Property Act for New York State, Stanton called for radical liberalization in state laws governing divorce. At the time, state laws varied greatly, and only Indiana and Connecticut provided relatively liberal terms for securing divorces. Not only did all of the newspaper coverage and most of Stanton’s male friends criticize her call that her home state of New York follow in this direction, but many in the women’s rights audience disagreed, believing that making marriages easier to dissolve was no way, to use Stanton’s phrase, to “protect<br>

We have shown that this process of ‘othering’ remains central to the current settlement in child protection work. Indeed, it is enjoying a vibrant renaissance.<br>

  Author(s) Barreto Eric D.<br>
  Abstract: The run-up to the 2008 presidential election evoked a great deal of reflection in the U.S. media about the state of race relations in the country. That Barack Obama was eventually victorious suggested to many that the country had now entered a “post-race” era. Even though some problems still lingered, some reasoned that the election of America’s first African American president represented a critical step forward, an epochal hinge leading inexorably toward the decimation of the specter of racism.

  Abstract: In this essay I am attempting a self-definition, which has proven to be a much more difficult task than I ever expected. Perhaps it is because my reluctant metamorphosis to USian¹ Latino is still unfinished, or perhaps because every attempt at self-definition is an attempt to capture just a moment of our continuous identity flow. As Fernando Segovia has stated, “The concept of Latin(o/a)ness … is neither self-evident nor determinate—self-contained and unchanging; readily accessible to and intelligible by all; bearing the same force throughout, regardless of historical situation or social-cultural formation. It is rather a construct” (2009, 199). Segovia<br>

  Book Title: Scientific Understanding-Philosophical Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Eigner Kai<br>
  Abstract: To most scientists, and to those interested in the sciences, understanding is the ultimate aim of scientific endeavor. In spite of this, understanding, and how it is achieved, has received little attention in recent philosophy of science.
      Scientific Understandingseeks to reverse this trend by providing original and in-depth accounts of the concept of understanding and its essential role in the scientific process. To this end, the chapters in this volume explore and develop three key topics: understanding and explanation, understanding and models, and understanding in scientific practice.Earlier philosophers, such as Carl Hempel, dismissed understanding as subjective and pragmatic. They believed that the essence of science was to be found in scientific theories and explanations. In Scientific Understanding, the contributors maintain that we must also consider the relation between explanations and the scientists who construct and use them. They focus on understanding as the cognitive state that is a goal of explanation and on the understanding of theories and models as a means to this end.The chapters in this book highlight the multifaceted nature of the process of scientific research. The contributors examine current uses of theory, models, simulations, and experiments to evaluate the degree to which these elements contribute to understanding. Their analyses pay due attention to the roles of intelligibility, tacit knowledge, and feelings of understanding. Furthermore, they investigate how understanding is obtained within diverse scientific disciplines and examine how the acquisition of understanding depends on specific contexts, the objects of study, and the stated aims of research.<br>

  1  Focusing on Scientific Understanding from:

  Author(s) EIGNER KAI<br>
  Abstract: In the eyes of most scientists, and of educated laypeople, understanding is a central goal of science. In the past centuries scientific research has enormously increased our understanding of the world. Indeed, it seems a commonplace to state that the desire for understanding is a chief motivation for doing science. But despite the prima facie plausibility of these claims, it is not so clear what their precise content is. What do we mean when we say that scientists understand, for example, global climate change? What is involved in achieving scientific understanding of phenomena, be they the origin of the universe,<br>

  Book Title: Liberalism at Its Limits-Crime and Terror in the Latin American Cultural Text<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): RODRÍGUEZ ILEANA<br>
  Abstract: In
      Liberalism at Its Limits,Ileana Rodríguez considers several Latin American nations that govern under the name of liberalism yet display a shocking range of nondemocratic features. In her political, cultural, and philosophical analysis, she examines these environments in which liberalism seems to have reached its limits, as the universalizing project gives way to rampant nonstate violence, gross inequality, and neocolonialism.Focusing on Guatemala, Colombia, and Mexico, Rodríguez shows how standard liberal models fail to account for new forms of violence and exploitation, which in fact follow from specific clashes between liberal ideology and local practice. Looking at these tensions within the ostensibly well-ordered state, Rodríguez exposes how the misunderstanding and misuse of liberal principles are behind realities of political turmoil, and questions whether liberalism is in fact an ideology sufficient to empower populations and transition nation-states into democratic roles in the global order.In this way,Liberalism at Its Limitsoffers a critical examination of the forced fitting of liberal models to Latin American nations and reasserts cross-cultural communication as crucial to grasping the true link between varying systems of value and politics.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qh6vz">Liberalism at Its Limits</a><br>
  Abstract: FEMINIST AND MULTICULTURAL texts inscribe the discussion of feminist and indigenous rights into an old and already occupied hermeneutical place. They write over the already-written script of public sphere and civil society, and by so doing feminism, at least, steps into the terrain of the prophetic. Richard Rorty’s reading of Catherine MacKinnon’s work illustrates this shift in the feminist text, which holds true for the indigenous text as well. MacKinnon states that “unless women [read also indigenous groups] fit into the logical space prepared for them by current linguistic and other practices, the law doesn’t know how to deal with<br>

This is a strategy to engage the propositions of social scientists in their efforts to come to terms with situations that bear little or no resemblance to the refined abstractions of liberalism, where the state represents the condensation of the relations of social forces, organizes the power bloc, and balances sectorial relations to construct a popular national will that displaces class struggle through the construction of a general interest and common sense.

Capital of Catalonia and home to the Catalan regional government, Barcelona is the vortex of debates that question both the Catalan relationship to the Spanish state and to the wider European and world communities. It is these power struggles which will be brought into focus in this chapter, in so far as they have been compounded by the increasingly problematic location of identity in the context of a postmodern, global city.

  Abstract: Throughout his long career as a novelist Emyr Humphreys has been inclined to reuse certain tropes, archetypes and paradigms, albeit in novels of a variety of types.

  CHAPTER 7  The scope and limits of content externalism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.cttq46qk">Externalism</a><br>
  Abstract: Chapter 6 examined the arguments for content externalism and an essentially defensive reaction to those arguments – a reaction that is Cartesian in spirit – based on the dual component theory, along with the associated idea of the mental state narrowly individuated. It was argued that this Cartesian reaction to the arguments for externalism faces serious difficulties. Nonetheless, we have not yet worked out the implications of the arguments themselves. If an essentially Cartesian strategy to limit their scope does not work, we have, as yet, done nothing to work out what that scope is. This is the task of this chapter.<br>

  Abstract: Content externalism, as we have seen, is best understood as the thesis that some of those mental states that possess their content essentially – namely, prepositional attitudes – are individuation dependent on objects, properties, relations and so on occurring outside the skins of the subjects of mental states. As such, content externalism is severely restricted in both its scope and force. It applies neither to cognitive processes nor to the architectures or mechanisms in which those processes are realized. It does not apply to phenomenal states – experiences of various forms – at least not if the essential properties of these states are phenomenal<br>

  Abstract: THE PHENOMENON of the massive transplantation of Latin American intellectuals to other areas of the world, particularly to more economically developed countries, that began in the 1970s has generated a varied literature dealing with the problems of transculturation, exile, and the symbolic relationships of the individual with these diverse societies. Due to its specific original matrix of an English domaine belatedly converted into an independent nation state, Canada has a porous way of absorbing ethnic groups of diverse genesis without completely destroying them. At the beginning, some of the typical cultural traits of these groups were retained, but with time,<br>

  Abstract: FEW ISSUES HAVE GENERATED as much academic interest across disciplines in recent years as the process of globalization. The world’s economic, political, demographic, and socio-cultural geography has radically metamorphosed under the impact of technologies and media that shrink time and space in the quest for rapid turnover of capital (Giddens, 1990). Although the long-term effects of globalization on nation states, futures markets, and the drug trade, etc. are unclear at best, none of these approaches the complexities and the problematic status of cultural identity in the globalizing environment.<br>

  Abstract: WHILE THE ROLE OF EDUCATION in political socialization and the construction of national identity in the Caribbean has been recognized and studied by several scholars (Bell, 1967; Fagen, 1969; Jansen, 1991; Torres, 1991; Miller, 1991), its relationship to popular culture has received considerably less attention. In part, this is due to the tendency of Caribbean scholars to conceive of educational institutions primarily as instruments of the state to propagate and reinforce the hegemony exerted by domestic and foreign elites over political and economic institutions (Carnoy and Samoff, 1989; Henry and Stone, 1983; Miller, 1989).¹ Curriculum content, student assessment and placement,<br>

As children, Katurian and his brother Michal had been the subject of a bizarre educational/artistic experiment.

  Abstract: Arthur Herman has coined the term ‘declinism’ to refer to a species of deep pessimism that represents the West as horribly flawed, in a state of severe decay, usually on the edge of catastrophe. That radical doubt he finds pervasive nowadays and in the recent past. ‘We live in an era in which pessimism has become the norm, rather than the exception.’¹ Perhaps so, especially in circles frequented by the best educated. Herman cites a considerable range of thinkers, profound or otherwise, who believe things are getting worse, and getting worse rapidly.² But what Herman does not consider is the<br>

  Abstract: ‘Let’s Make Things Better.’ So announced Philips, the transnational electronics giant, in a new global ad campaign launched in September 1995. The company explained how the theme and slogan were a far better representation of its purposes than the more obvious brag, ‘We make better things.’¹ In fact, the statement was pathetic: bland, vague, and hackneyed. No wonder it fostered an initial flurry of boring ads which featured a smiling employee saying trite things to magazine readers. More interesting than Philips’s lack of inspiration was its commitment of time and funds to this kind of image campaign. Here it followed<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/9781442676947">Mal'uocchiu</a><br>
  Abstract: Pirandello regards human emotions, feelings, and other sensations as an integral part of an individual’s experience of the
                  flux of life. In order to understand and communicate these sensations, however, the individual must find a way to give them ‘form’ or ‘meaning.’ Speaking through the philosopher in his playAt the Exit, for example, Pirandello (1964a: 179) states: ‘it is not enough for the living tofeel; they want to see their feelings expressed concretely, be able to touch them, and so they build a house for them.’ In the play, the philosopher is referring specifically to the notion that<br>

My concern was, and still is, that certain individuals, people who have not participated in the study, will feel that I am presenting a negative image of Sicilian Canadians – that I am depicting community members as ‘superstitious’ people. This is not my intent, but I obviously have no control over how others will interpret my work. My mother’s response surprised me. She stated:<br>

  Abstract: We began from theology as a dogmatic-theological context, where context is a remainder concept. It denotes the rest.

  Author(s) CHLUP JAMES T.<br>
  Abstract: In ancient Rome the historianʹs reputation rested on his ability to balance the narrative of events at Rome (
                     domi) and those elsewhere (militae).¹ Of the latter wars were particularly worthy of narration. They necessitated the writing down of Roman history with a special focus on short but intense wars of Romeʹs early period in which she fought for survival against other Italian city states (ca 750–300 BCE); wars fought over several years or decades against rival nations as she established and expanded her empire; and civil wars.<br>

  Abstract: The period between the conclusion of hostilities on the Western Front in 1918 and the start of the Second World War twenty years later is one within which several cultural trajectories comprising the subjects of this essay overlap: the reconstruction of the built environment in north-eastern France (the devastated areas known as the ʹRed Zonesʹ); the development and popularization of modernist and avant-garde photography in Europe; and the development and cultural assimilation of the work of Sigmund Freud, both in avant-garde literary and artistic circles and more widely in popular cultural forms such as ʹpulpʹ fiction.

  Abstract: The Renaissance was an important era in Western history because of its immense infl uence on the manner in which individuals conceived of their place in the universe and the way in which this conception facilitated the development of a civility tradition that was not as dependent on theological dogma. The subsequent Protestant Reformation and Enlightenment movements were facilitated by Renaissance interaction values because the Renaissance thinkers set the stage for a reversal in the ideologies that had kept absolutist monarchies in power. Although princes remained all-powerful in the Renaissance city-states, a new appreciation of individualism provided the rationale for<br>

  Abstract: In his
                  Defense of Poesy, Sir Philip Sidney claims that the ‘charming force’ of poetry can lead even ‘hard-hearted evil men’ who enjoy only ‘indulgere genio’ to ‘see the form of goodness (which seen they cannot but love) ere themselves be aware.’Magical Imaginationswas conceived when I became interested in this claim, particularly in the way it afforded literary pleasure ideological efficacy, as if poetic delight could make resistant readers love ‘goodness’ without alerting them that their dispositions were being disciplined.

  Abstract: This book is a conversation between the thought of Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) and recent Anglo-American political theory. Since John Rawls’s critique of utilitarianism and the enormous influence of his
                  Theory of Justice(1971), liberal-communitarian critics have placed firmly on the agenda the notion that individual identity is partly constituted by the cultural community in which one is born and educated. Rawls subsequently came to contend that his once apparently universal principles are only applicable to modern, liberal-democratic states. Postmodernism, too, has had a significant impact with its critique of the one-sided universalism typically associated with ‘the Enlightenment,’ as<br>

  Abstract: Herder has long been seen as a central thinker in the development of a historical and cultural particularity that has fuelled nationalist claims for self-determination. Today his work still provides a powerful theoretical justification for oppressed communities to pursue their cultural and political autonomy. Linguistic and cultural domination of minority communities by the state is conceptualized in Herder’s theory as a fundamental issue of justice. Sovereigns have a duty to tolerate the cultural diversity within their states; indeed, they are obligated to honour that diversity.<br>

  Abstract: It is hardly surprising, given Herder’s views on the state, that he shows relatively little interest in government and administration. But the fact that Herder’s direct engagement with politics in this narrow sense forms only a small part of his extensive intellectual output has meant that it has often been thought that he ‘was not a political thinker in the true sense of the word.’¹ It should be clear that I reject the narrow conception of politics on which this assessment is based, but due to its pervasiveness and misleading nature it needs to be addressed directly.² Viroli in his<br>

  Abstract: With the main tenets of Herder’s moral and political thought now outlined, this chapter applies the central principles of his ontology and his theories of language and culture to a number of issues that have arisen in contemporary political theory with respect to immigrant societies and long-standing communities. It is difficult to dispute that most states in the modern world are multi-cultural in a descriptive sense.¹ Despite the centralizing and homogenizing cultural policies of the modern ‘nation-state’ documented by scholars of nationalism like Gellner, many cultural minorities have been remarkably resilient. Typically states are as they were under the dynastic<br>

Until fairly recently, so the claim goes, they did excellent work, but now they are out of date. For a long time they were active in the general area of social problems; however, in the past few years a number of new organizations with specific objectives have appeared.

  Author(s) Hughes John<br>
  Abstract: Documentary dealing with immigration and the migrant experience in Australia is a continuous thread running through Australian cinema, more recently eclipsed by works equally complex in their articulation of politics and culture, responding in different ways to Australia’s reaction to refugees and the troublesome obsession in Australian domestic political discourse with ‘border protection’. In what follows, we make reference to state-sponsored documentary of the early 1950s supporting immigration in post-war reconstruction, and to a number of recent documentary projects across a spectrum of contemporary forms, projects that respond to public debate around asylum seekers and refugees.

  Author(s) Maasdorp Liani<br>
  Abstract: South African documentary filmmaking has changed substantially since 1990. Repressive state control of the media under the apartheid regime from 1948 to 1990 led to filmmaking that either overtly eschewed the political or made a strong statement on political and social issues. In both cases, personal stories and artistic expression were neglected. Thanks to the official transition to democracy that started in South Africa around 1990, space has been created for a new era in fiction and non-fiction filmmaking.<br>

  Author(s) Pernin Judith<br>
  Abstract: Since the late 1980s, radical transformations of the Chinese film industry and art circles have led to the emergence of a significant body of independent documentary films produced and circulated without the backing of state institutions. This was definitely a breakthrough, since state documentary studios and television stations were the sole producers and broadcasters of non-fiction films in China for more than thirty years. Reforms that gradually adjusted the film and television industries to a market economy in the 1980s and 1990s generated, as a side effect, a grey area in which individual projects could be produced without prior submission<br>

Everything that has existed will always exist. Experiences. Actions. Feelings. Suffering. Love. Ideas. Thoughts. People. The discursive tenor of the director’s statement is philosophical, or perhaps poetic, but it seems that it is also embodied by his film aesthetic, which functions to bracket temporality itself.

There are three principal approaches that this chapter will explore: first, the idea that Levinasian ethics can be embodied within the state apparatus of the judiciary; secondly, that such ethics can inhere in our civil legal relations with other private citizens; and thirdly, we can examine the specific literature, prompted by Levinas’s own writings, that suggests ethical responsibilities can be protected by<br>

  Abstract: This chapter begins with an outline of its central arguments as well as the concluding claims of the book as a whole. As covered in Chapter 4, applications of Levinas to law typically ask us to imagine law as a responsive site for the ethical encounter – whether in its institutions, its procedures, or reflected in its substance. This rests on a typically unstated but nevertheless unavoidable premise, that law operates as the servant of human will. This largely reflects how Levinas understood law himself, as being the necessary framework in which we do the hard work of creating social<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g050g2">From Violence to Speaking Out</a><br>
  Abstract: Foucault, Derrida, and Deleuze have recognized the originality of the idea of the performative (Austin 1962).¹ Chronologically, Foucault comes first. In his 1969
                  The Archaeology of Knowledge, he turns to the “speech act” as “one last possibility, and the most probable of all, of defining the statement [l’énoncé]” (Foucault 1972: 82).² After describing the performative, Foucault concludes that a “bi-univocal relation” between the statement and the performative cannot exist (Foucault 1972: 83). There is one primary reason, according to Foucault, why the performative cannot define the statement. Even if one says that an illocutionary act is complete, one has to<br>

  Abstract: This book proposes a differential theory of narrative. In doing so, it goes against the most basic fundamentals of narratology. These fundamentals seem so self-evident that they are generally assumed as granted and only rarely voiced explicitly. They are exemplarily set out in this covert manner in the following programmatic statement from Roland Barthes’s ‘Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives’:<br>

Where the picture should be, however, there is nothing but an empty frame. The text thus starts with a forceful problematisation of representation as, contrary to Huffman’s statement, Billy isnotdepicted. In addition, the Huffman caption is fictional.The Collected Works of Billy the Kidthus immediately signals that the status of the image, that representation will be an issue both formally and in terms of content.

  Abstract: To rehearse: what has been established under the heading of differential narratology is becoming as it pertains to narrative, narrativity in constant variation generating ever new variants of narrative; the virtual dance of narrative differentials producing actual, numerically differentiated narratives; the intensive sensations and forces of transcendental Narrative (affects, percepts, forces) bringing about the extensive states of affairs and networks of empirical narratives (events, existents, plots). In short, becoming, the dynamic and continuous process of selecting and gathering heterogeneous elements to be expressed, has been revealed as the ontologically primary virtual realm of any given actual narrative.

  Abstract: This chapter aims to address the ways in which the transition from liberation theory to postcolonial theory entails a historical intellectual encounter with poststructuralism, one that may be termed ‘the poststructuralist turn’. However, in broaching this question, the intention is not to propose that postcolonial theory is determined by its poststructuralist influences in a unilateral manner. That this constitutes a particular area of contention becomes apparent in a context where seminal postcolonial theorists attract attention in the light of their being highly influenced by European theory.

  Abstract: Aesthetics is one of the most intellectually stimulating and enriching fields of philosophical inquiry. This statement may sound a bit strange to anyone who is easily impressed by the longevity of ancient metaphysical problems or by the cutting-edge verve of recent empirically informed debates in the theory of consciousness, or by the applicative promise and popular demand of business ethics, and so tends to dismiss aesthetics as peripheral to philosophy. Yet, as Frank Sibley, one of the important early analytic aestheticians of the twentieth century, has observed, aestheticians encounter ranges of concepts wider than and inevitably inclusive of those studied<br>

  Author(s) Gillespie Michael<br>
  Abstract: The term ‘nihilism’ has been used to denote a philosophical concept or position, a psychological or sociological state or mood, a doctrine or agenda for political action and a cultural condition or movement. Moreover, the connotations of the term within each of these areas are multiple, complicated and contested. It is thus not easy to define the term or to determine the nature of the phenomenon that the term describes. This difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that the term has been principally used as a pejorative by opponents to characterise a condition, doctrine, or movement that they fear, disagree<br>

In a letter to his patron, Lord Chesterfield, Johnson outlined the struggle he saw facing him, the possible futility of which he acknowledged, in distinctly biopolitical terms. “It remains”, he wrote, “that we retard what we cannot repel, that we palliate what we cannot cure”<br>

  Abstract: In the fertile floodplains that stretch between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, humankind settled to form perhaps the earliest organised and permanent settlements anywhere in the world. By around 3500 BCE, these relatively simple agricultural societies had evolved into city-states, the first of which was Uruk (modern Al-Warka, Iraq), centred around a temple complex and populated by traders, merchants, farmers and the temple bureaucracy. The need for a sophisticated accounting system led to the development of the world’s first written language, which itself evolved into a rich corpus of literary and bureaucratic texts.

  Abstract: In the period before CE 400, ancient India was home to a variety of self-governing polities using quasi-democratic institutions comparable with those of the Greek city-states of the same era. Indeed, Greek and Roman historians, relying on the reports of Greek visitors, did not hesitate to say that the India they knew was largely democratic. But although the evidence has been carefully analysed and the existence of a multitude of republics has long been established, these republics and the political culture that they represent are little known to anyone but specialists.

  Abstract: Both Western and Chinese analysts often presume that democracy is unique to Western civilisation and alien to the Chinese. The roots of Western dynamism are, in turn, assumed to derive from the political complexity of Europe, whereas those of Chinese stagnation from political unity. However, as this chapter illustrates, China in fact experienced fluctuations between unification and division in history. Intense international competition in the classical era (770–221 BCE) gave rise to citizenship rights defined as state– society bargains over the means of war.

  Abstract: The Middle Ages should be studied and understood in its own terms and on its own premises, but a historian must also be able to explain progress, development and the great lineages of history. One of these great lineages is the history of democracy, in which the ‘Dark Ages’ are assumed to be a black hole. The experience of the Nordic countries during this period provides a worthy case study to test the accuracy of this assessment. The word ‘democracy’ directly translated from the Greek means a form of government where the people rule. In the city state (

But many deputies hoped to make this crisis an occasion for significant reform, especially those who represented the Third Estate.

  Abstract: ‘Australasia’ refers to Australia and New Zealand, two liberal-democratic nation-states arising from British colonisation – beginning in 1788 – of peoples that we now call Aborigines, Torres Strait Islanders and Maori. With Britain’s blessing, by the early twentieth century, the colonists of Australasia had replicated Westminster’s democratic model. However, the two dominions approached differently the enfranchising of Indigenous people. After the Second World War, the United Nations (UN) entrusted the Australasian democracies to establish democratic institutions in Pacific colonies.<br>

  Author(s) Drescher Seymour<br>
  Abstract: During the last three centuries democratisation has occurred at three levels. For individuals, it was a process of extending access to equality of status and the security of liberty under law. Within civil societies, it was the process of extending access to the means of communication and association in economic, social and religious spheres of life. Within polities, it meant the formation of constitutional processes for law making, law enforcement and broadening the access to elections of legislators and executives at all levels of the state. In this perspective anti-slavery was a movement and an ideology primarily concerned with changing<br>

  Abstract: Transnational democracy is an idea whose time has come, but it does not, as yet, have much substance. It is a thing of the future more than the present, but its future is far from assured. Such democracy as we presently enjoy it is mostly national, rather than transnational, and representative, rather than participatory. It is largely monopolised by elected ‘representatives’, rather than politically active citizens and almost entirely circumscribed by the territoriality of national state borders. The social communities, relations and processes beyond and across state borders that would constitute transnational democracy largely elude democracy’s remit. ‘Globalisation’ and<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b6rb">The Edinburgh Companion to the History of Democracy</a><br>
  Author(s) Dahlberg Lincoln<br>
  Abstract: What is radical democracy? Karl Marx’s definition of ‘radical’, from his 1844 ‘Introduction’ to
                  A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right, states that to be radical is ‘to grasp the root of the matter’ (Marx [1844] 1970: 137). Thus, ‘radical democracy’ means to grasp or draw out the root meaning or conditions of democracy that have been obscured in its various historical appropriations. Radical democrats argue that there are two central, intertwined and historically constituted root meanings or conditions of democracy: first, the free and equal participation of ‘the people’ (thedemos) in power (kratos); and,<br>

  Abstract: In
                  Beyond Nature and Culture,¹ Philippe Descola claims that the idea of ‘culture’ arose from a tension between at least two of the 164 meanings of the term catalogued by Alfred Kroeber and Clyde Kluckhorn.² Culture, in the singular, is defined as a distinctive characteristic of humanity, in a sense close to ‘civilisation’. Cultures, in the plural, are defined as a plurality of human modes of organisation. In 1871, Edward Burnett Tylor stated that: Culture or Civilisation, taken in its wide ethnographic sense, is that complex whole, which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and<br>

As is evident, I took subjectivity as my starting premise, in the vein of Marx. Moving beyond the pre-conscious interests of ideology, however, I have sought to provide the conceptual basis for micropolitical unconscious investments of desire. That is, the way in which desire is, though productive, socially produced and managed such that it comes to desire its own repression (capitalism) and/or comes to be shaped in a manner conducive to the continual functioning of capitalism.

  Abstract: One of Michael Jackson’s hit singles has the consistent line in its chorus, ‘It Don’t Matter If You’re Black Or White’: the statement of an ideal rather than a social fact.³ In Western society, white has been generally portrayed as a norm against which blackness is positioned as aberrant threatening and perhaps even monstrous.

  2  The Politics of Neuroscience from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r21s0">The Political Mind</a><br>
  Abstract: The neurological material in the foregoing chapter operates within an ontology and epistemology that many in the social sciences have long fought against. At its hard scientific edge, this belief holds that human behaviour is fully explicable through close study of the operations of the brain. All social science and theory would therefore, in time, be superseded by an all-embracing explanatory vocabulary of neurophysiological brainstates. Before we can proceed to unpack such material for use in a political context, this fundamental concern must first be addressed.<br>

  5  Psychological Revolt from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r21s0">The Political Mind</a><br>
  Abstract: Having constructed a conceptualisation of the mind and its connection to its surroundings as well as having painted a picture of the present environment it finds itself in, the psychological possibility of critique remains to be examined. It is easy to state that the mind is shaped wholly by a combination of neurophysical parameters and social experience, but the very fact that one feels so resistant to this idea shows the merits of deeper examination. Consciousness rebels against the notion that its limits can be so circumscribed and the artistic, cultural and philosophical labour of our species is a record<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r22rz">The World, the Flesh and the Subject</a><br>
  Abstract: In a recent TV drama one of the characters falls in love with another. ‘It’s only chemicals,’ his friend assures him, but when the friend finds himself in the same position he is unable to take the same view of his own situation. It would be a caricature to represent the dominant paradigm in contemporary Anglo-American philosophy of mind as holding of all our psychological states, ‘It’s only chemicals.’ Yet this paradigm – functionalism – does hold that each of them is, in fact, a physiological state, but one individuated in terms of its function in mediating between sensory inputs<br>

  1  The Character of Experience from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r22rz">The World, the Flesh and the Subject</a><br>
  Abstract: For much of the last century philosophy of mind has been dominated by the attempt to give an account of mental states that does not have recourse to the Cartesian picture of them as essentially private, in the sense of being only providentially connected with the behaviour through which they are expressed. The states that have seemed particularly recalcitrant to such attempts are our experiences in perception and bodily sensation; for these paradigmatically have a subjective character – a something it is like to have them, as Thomas Nagel puts it¹ – that apparently eludes explanation in terms of the<br>

  4  Desire from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r22rz">The World, the Flesh and the Subject</a><br>
  Abstract: Within much contemporary analytic philosophy of mind desires are conceived of primarily as the inner states which provide us, together with beliefs, with reasons for forming intentions and consequently acting. When linked with beliefs, such desires then cause us to act in appropriate ways. Desires therefore have a role both in providing premises for practical reasoning and a causal, functional role in terms of the agent’s behaviour. Weaving these two roles together has been one of the challenges of contemporary materialism. Within standard accounts of practical reasoning the agent derives an intention or proceeds to action on the basis of<br>

  Abstract: By the time you have reached this point in the book you may be exasperated, excited, intrigued or merely bored. Whatever your reaction, if you have any reaction at all you will most likely be experiencing some emotion. But what are emotions, and why do we experience them? Could we be much the sort of creatures that we are, with all our other experiences, thoughts and desires, and yet be devoid of emotional feelings? And if we could not, is that because our emotions somehow derive from these other psychological states, or do they add some indispensable element to them?<br>

  Book Title: The Idea of Continental Philosophy-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Glendinning Simon<br>
  Abstract: The idea of Continental Philosophy has never been properly explained in philosophical terms. In this short and engaging book Simon Glendinning attempts finally to succeed where others have failed – although not by giving an account of its internal unity but by showing instead why no such account can be given. Providing a clear picture of the current state of the contemporary philosophical culture Glendinning traces the origins and development of the idea of a distinctive Continental tradition, critiquing current attempts to survey the field of contemporary philosophy.<br>

  Book Title: The Discursive Construction of National Identity-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Unger J. W.<br>
  Abstract: How do we construct national identities in discourse? Which topics, which discursive strategies and which linguistic devices are employed to construct national sameness and uniqueness on the one hand, and differences to other national collectives on the other hand? The Discursive Construction of National Identity analyses discourses of national identity in Europe with particular attention to Austria.In the tradition of critical discourse analysis, the authors analyse current and on-going transformations in the self-and other definition of national identities using an innovative interdisciplinary approach which combines discourse-historical theory and methodology and political science perspectives. Thus, the rhetorical promotion of national identification and the discursive construction and reproduction of national difference on public, semi-public and semi-private levels within a nation state are analysed in much detail and illustrated with a huge amount of examples taken from many genres (speeches, focus-groups, interviews, media, and so forth).In addition to the critical discourse analysis of multiple genres accompanying various commemorative and celebratory events in 1995, this extended and revised edition is able to draw comparisons with similar events in 2005. The impact of socio-political changes in Austria and in the European Union is also made transparent in the attempts of constructing hegemonic national identities. Key Features:*Discourse-historical approach.*Interdisciplinarity (cultural studies, discourse analysis, history, political science).*Multi-method, multi-genre.*Qualitative case studies.<br>

  Author(s) Gilbert Michelle<br>
  Abstract: In the Akwapim kingdom of southeastern Ghana,¹ clothing is used as a form of communication to make statements about personhood and status; to conceal or reveal identity; to express desires and impulses. It may do so directly or indirectly, conventionally or rebelliously. Clothing is owned, bestowed and gives identity. The clothed body expresses the person of the wearer and society’s image of that person. As a result, clothing absorbs the particular times in which it has been worn² and becomes like a relic of these past events.<br>

In 1956, troops of the Warsaw pact states invaded Hungary and cracked down on the Hungarian revolution. This event had heavily dislocating effects on Western political thought – no matter whether Marxist or not. As a reaction, Paul Ricœur published one of his best-known essays, ‘The Political Paradox’, in which he seeks to come to terms philosophically with the exigency of the Hungarian events (1965). Counter to state-Marxism, his aim is to think what he perceives as the<br>

Yet the ‘spaces’ in which virtuous behaviour can flourish are rather different. For Ferguson, civil society constitutes an intermediate realm between the family and the state that in the modern context requires communication among strangers; for Grierson, model citizens effectively become 
                  träger of a top-down discourse of statist democracy. In each case, the cultural validity of the moral sphere of local – that is, place-bound – society is diminished, relegated to being the vestige of a past social order. Recently, scholars have argued<br>

  Author(s): Tynan Aidan<br>
  Abstract: The first study of Deleuze's critical and clinical projectAidan Tynan addresses Deleuze's assertion that 'literature is an enterprise of health' and shows how a concern of health and illness was a characteristic of his philosophy as a whole, from his earliest works to his groundbreaking collaborations with Guattari, to his final, enigmatic statements on 'life'.He explains why alcoholism, anorexia, manic depression and schizophrenia are key concepts in Deleuze's literary theory, and shows how, with the turn to schizoanalysis, literature takes on a crucial political and ethical role in helping us to diagnose our present pathologies and articulate the possibilities of a health to come.Key FeaturesThe first book length study of Deleuze's critical and clinical project and the conceptualisations of health and illness he developed over the course of his careerUses the idea of the literary clinic to unify Deleuze's literary theory with the political critique he developed with Guattari, and argues in this way for a distinctively Deleuzian critical practiceDraws on Deleuze conceptualisations of health and illness to reassess his relationship to key thinkers such as Spinoza, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud and Melanie Klein and literary figures such as Melville F.

A most suggestive global statement of this interpretation is offered by Geoffrey Hartman in “Romanticism and ‘Anti-Self-Consciousness’” when he reminds us “that Romantic art has a function analogous to that of religion.

                  sic– this refers to a longer version of the text] of the blindness of critics with regard to their own insights, of the discrepancy, hidden to them, between their stated method and their perceptions. In the history as well as in the historiography of literature, this blindness can take on the form of a recurrently aberrant pattern of interpretation with regard to a particular writer. The pattern extends from highly specialized commentators to the vagueidées reçuesby means of which this writer<br>

  Abstract: Our report is based on extensive interviews with most of the faculty members involved in the Comparative Literature Program at Rutgers, as well as with numerous graduate and undergraduate students. We consulted the printed material put at our disposal and had conversations with several administrative officers of the University. We also spoke with Professor Guarino, Chairman of the Department of Literatures and Languages, and with Associate Provost Jean Parrish, who is herself closely associated with the program. We were able to get a good overview of the state of the discipline and we are satisfied that none of the strengths<br>

  Abstract: How do street-level workers make sense of their world and account for what they do? These questions guide our inquiry and lie at the heart of scholarship on the state and its workforce. Much of the existing literature converges on a viewpoint of street-level workers that focuses on how they apply the state’s laws, rules, and procedures to the cases they handle. We call this viewpoint the state-agent narrative. We propose an additional viewpoint, a citizen-agent narrative, that is muted in existing scholarship yet prevalent in the stories told to us by street-level workers. The citizen-agent narrative concentrates on the<br>

  Abstract: I was surprised and delighted to be asked to speak on the topic “The Fate of Law.” l I was surprised, because this strikes me as a tall person’s topic, a topic for someone who can survey the entire world of law and comment on its overall development. To discuss “The Fate of Law” is an invitation to make statements that cast shadows. My work tends to look at the margins and corners, especially at people such as women, children, and persons with disabilities. I am interested in people who have not been the central subjects of theories of law,<br>

How should we go about criticizing law, if not by reference to general principles derived from reason? What does it mean, given the “death of reason,” to ask whether a particular law-say, a statute outlawing “surrogacy contracts,” or a judicial decision requiring the busing of schoolchildren to achieve integrated schools, or a law criminalizing sexual sodomy, or a constitutional provision or constitutional interpretation invalidating state statutes that criminalize abortions on demand-is a good law or<br>

  Abstract: Forty-five prominent scholars engage in self-critical, state-of-the-art reflection on international studies to stimulate debates about successes and failures and to address the larger question of progress in the discipline. Written especially for the collection, these essays are in hardcover in the form of an easy-to-use handbook, and in paperback as a number of separate titles, each of which consists of a particular thematic cluster to merge with the range of topics taught in undergraduate and graduate courses in international studies.<br>

  Author(s) Harvey Frank P.<br>
  Abstract: When Michael Brecher was introduced to international relations (IR) at Yale in 1946, the field comprised international politics, international law and organization, international economics, international (diplomatic) history, and a regional specialization. The hegemonic paradigm was realism, as expressed in the work of E. H. Carr, Arnold Wolfers, Nicholas Spykman, W. T. R. Fox, Hans Morgenthau, Bernard Brodie, and others.¹ The unquestioned focus of attention was interstate war and peace.<br>

  Author(s) Holsti K. J.<br>
  Abstract: A long tradition of research, interpretation, and speculation about international politics goes under the name of realism. Although some dispute the pedigree as simply a “construction” of contemporary analysts, in fact a number of writers whose roster includes Machiavelli, Rousseau, Meinecke, von Gentz, Morgenthau, and Waltz, to name just a few, share a number of common themes such as their images of the world, their understanding of historical processes, the dilemmas and paradoxes that are peculiar to states that exist in a condition of anarchy, and the normative primacy of security in such an environment.

  Abstract: This paper offers a necessarily highly condensed argument about what it might mean to make judgments about the state of international relations or international studies as a scholarly discipline from some kind of alternative or critical perspective. I begin by sketching some tentative grounds on which I would presume to make judgments about judgments in this context. I then identify what I take to be four among many possible areas of convergence among the heterogeneous literatures that are currently identified, and disciplined, as alternative and critical.

  Abstract: It is a daunting task to respond to the challenge to assess the state of the art of international studies (IS), or more particularly, feminist IS: to reflect on where we’ve come from and where we are now (and indeed who “we” are); and to ask, What’s at stake here? For me, writing as a feminist in IS, there is always a double edge, asking both what happens to the international when we take feminism seriously in IS and what happens to women, sex, gender, and feminism when we take the international seriously.

  Author(s) Leng Russell J.<br>
  Abstract: One way to provide an accounting of the state of quantitative international politics at the turn of the millennium is by evaluating its record against the skepticism of its early critics. Traditional international relations scholars, in fact, took a rather jaundiced view of the scientific study of world politics when the subfield was in its infancy at the beginning of the second half of the twentieth century. One of the most skeptical critiques came from the British classicist Hedley Bull who argued that the scientific approach was “likely to contribute very little to the theory of international relations, and in<br>

  Abstract: Foreign policy analysis (FPA), broadly defined, is a field of study that describes and investigates the structures, processes, and outcomes of the purposeful policy initiatives and responses that are conceived by sovereign political entities and directed toward other political units (not necessarily sovereign states) beyond their borders. The boundaries of the FPA domain are porous and cannot be strictly drawn, and thus it is not uncommon for some of the literature to belong in more than one field of study (e. g., security studies and FPA). Furthermore, FPA as a field of study emerged over the last four decades unbound<br>

  Abstract: On June 24, 2002, President Bush brought out a new plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. That plan, which became known as the “Roadmap,” was based on a two-state solution and presented two novelties: (1) for the first time, the United States committed itself publicly and officially to an independent Palestinian sovereignty, and (2) for the first time, the United States also conditioned Israeli concessions on Palestinian democratization. This chapter explores the role of the democratic peace thesis in bringing about these novelties: it examines how the thesis was mobilized politically by Israeli politicians to advance their ideological<br>

  Author(s) Liao Ning<br>
  Abstract: The symbolic representation of collective identity—an essential communicative element of nationalism—invariably involves the strategic deployment of narratives. An archetypical example in this regard is the creation and transmission of master commemorative narratives. In the nexus of Chinese domestic politics and foreign relations, such historical accounts are central to the internal and external legitimation of the nondemocratic state. By bestowing determined meanings upon the past, which is causally related to the present and future of the Chinese nation-state, this sort of strategic narrative defines the identity role of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in China’s sociopolitical development and projects<br>

  Abstract: Our quondam certainties about what occurred during the 2011 “Arab Spring” have faded.¹ What even to call the series of events in Tunisia, Egypt, and beyond is increasingly problematic, given the less than rosy aftermath to the initial protests (see for example, “Arab Spring” 2013). The struggle over nomenclature underscores the power of stories and their limitations in policy and political change. The uprisings were replete with projected narratives, narratives whose proponents sought to shape current and future events as protestors took to the streets and state actors dug in their heels to retain power. These strategic narratives were constructed<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3998/mpub.6504652">Forging the World</a><br>
  Author(s) O’Loughlin Ben<br>
  Abstract: Understanding continuity and change in international order is a central question in the study of International Relations. IR theories conceptualize order in different ways. Each theory underpins a narrative about how an effective resolution to obstacles or tensions in the international system can be reached and stability secured. Neorealists conceive order as the result of power balances in the international system between dominant states (Waltz 1979). The English school conceives order being built on a “society of states” (Bull 2002; Linklater and Suganami 2006; Linklater 2007). Koivisto and Dunne (2010, 615) suggest that “for English School internationalists, the problem with<br>

  Book Title: Archives, Documentation, and Institutions of Social Memory-Essays from the Sawyer Seminar<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosenberg William G.<br>
  Abstract: As sites of documentary preservation rooted in various national and social contexts, artifacts of culture, and places of uncovering, archives provide tangible evidence of memory for individuals, communities, and states, as well as defining memory institutionally within prevailing political systems and cultural norms. By assigning the prerogatives of record keeper to the archivist, whose acquisition policies, finding aids, and various institutionalized predilections mediate between scholarship and information, archives produce knowledge, legitimize political systems, and construct identities. Far from being mere repositories of data, archives actually embody the fragments of culture that endure as signifiers of who we are, and why. The essays in A
      rchives, Documentation, and Institutions of Social Memoryconceive of archives not simply as historical repositories but as a complex of structures, processes, and epistemologies situated at a critical point of the intersection between scholarship, cultural practices, politics, and technologies.<br>

  Abstract: “There is no political power without control of the archives,” Jacques Derrida writes.¹ There is no power without archives either. Since the third millennium BC, writing served recording and archiving for kings and gods, in palaces and temples. Etymology links archives to the Greek archeion, the seat of the ruling power. Although the Domesday Book was not used very frequently, as a symbol it associated archiving with royal power, like the Book of Judgment was an expression of divine power.² The early modern states, monarchies, and the church were information societies, their data collection and use, apart from documenting internal<br>

  Abstract: In setting as one of the seminar’s principal goals the exploration of the roles that archives play in the production of knowledge, it was clear to us from the start that we could not cofine our discussions within one specific national framework. The relationship between archives and the constructs of a national past is a very close one. State archives are almost always dependent on governments for their existence. They are sustained to serve the state, however its interests may be defined. Like the interests of society more broadly, these are in constant evolution, as are those of individual citizens<br>

The system is structured and developed according to the principle of a unified leadership and administration at different levels. It consists of three types of archival institutions, each of them having clearly defined, state-mandated functions and responsibilities. These three types include archives administration departments (dangan ju), archives offices within agencies (dangan shi), and archives (dangan guan).

  Author(s) ARRIGO BRUCE A.<br>
  Abstract: Ethnographic studies of “dangerous men” have generally taken us behind bars. Erving Goffman’s (1961) arresting critique of the confinement setting as a generative milieu for the exercise of power helped to spawn a series of monograph-length works recounting life, death, and survival behind prison walls (e.g., Jacobs 1978; Sykes 1971; Toch 1977). A second wave of penological analysis, still concerned with “everyday experience” behind bars, challenged the correctional system as an extension of the state’s regulatory ambit. For example, Irwin’s (1970, 1985) studies of the felon and the jail respectively ushered in a new era of incisive commentary. Crime control<br>

  Abstract: In characterizing the reform talk in elastic narratives as shallow, I mean two particular things. First, accounts of one’s crimes were contradictory, vague, or both. Quite often, one’s life, including but not limited to one’s reform, was broadly described (for example, one previously enjoyed a “fast” lifestyle that was condemned) but specific crimes were neutralized. Second, desistance, like offending, was attributed to vaguely stated factors. In addition, desistance was conceptualized<br>

  Abstract: Dance is usually considered the most ephemeral form of art in Western society. This transitory character of dance dominates both historical and contemporary discourse. Nonetheless, historical investigations trace not only the history of dance, but also demonstrate how dance embodies historic and cultural corporealities. Only in more recent years, however, has a focus on history and memory appeared in research on contemporary European concert dance. As Aleida Assmann states, “Today it is most prominently art, which discovers the crisis of memory as its topic and finds new modes in which the dynamic process of cultural memory and forgetting configures.”¹ For<br>

  Abstract: Cultural studies is going through one of those rarely acknowledged or analyzed “crises” common in the life histories of intellectual formations. Recent attacks on cultural studies, on first glance, echo earlier criticisms: cultural studies stands accused of paying too much attention to culture and not enough to the state and economics, too much to cultural differences and not enough to social commonalities, too much to popular resistance and not enough to political domination. Yet the current discomforts are not the same as earlier ones. Earlier criticisms were often hostile to the very project of cultural studies, whereas the most trenchant<br>

  Abstract: James Carey made it clear that his primary identification, as scholar and citizen, was with the nation-state: “Modern utopians claim that we are now outgrowing the nation-state and that a new form of world order is emerging, a global village, a universal brotherhood, or world government on a shrinking planet– spaceship earth. Most of this is pleasant if not dangerous nonsense” (1989, 170). “I don’t want to be a citizen of the world,” Carey said (2006a, 222). He called his Americanist streak a “useful ethnocentrism,” given that the United States retained a special place in determining political changes. Carey (2006a)<br>

  Book Title: Covering Bin Laden-Global Media and the World's Most Wanted Man<br>
  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): AL-SUMAIT FAHED<br>
  Abstract: Starting in 2001, much of the world media used the image of Osama bin Laden as a shorthand for terrorism. Bin Laden himself considered media manipulation on a par with military, political, and ideological tools, and intentionally used interviews, taped speeches, and distributed statements to further al-Qaida's ends. In Covering Bin Laden , editors Susan Jeffords and Fahed Yahya Al-Sumait collect perspectives from global scholars exploring a startling premise: that media depictions of Bin Laden not only diverge but often contradict each other, depending on the media provider and format, the place in which the depiction is presented, and the viewer's political and cultural background. The contributors analyze the representations of the many Bin Ladens, ranging from Al Jazeera broadcasts to video games. They examine the media's dominant role in shaping our understanding of terrorists and why/how they should be feared, and they engage with the ways the mosaic of Bin Laden images and narratives have influenced policies and actions around the world. Contributors include Fahed Al-Sumait, Saranaz Barforoush, Aditi Bhatia, Purnima Bose, Ryan Croken, Simon Ferrari, Andrew Hill, Richard Jackson, Susan Jeffords, Joanna Margueritte-Giecewicz, Noha Mellor, Susan Moeller, Brigitte Nacos, Courtney C.

  Abstract: As the main enemy of the Western world for nearly a decade, Osama bin Laden was the focus of international news media and the topic of several books about his life before and after exile from his homeland. Several of these stories, particularly in the Anglo-American media, illustrated a significant fascination with the Arab male’s sexuality, mainly in the most authoritarian states, which contributes to the image of the Arab as a neurotic sexual being.¹ Indeed, this fascination was not confined to bin Laden, as other male authoritarian figures received similar attention; for instance, Saddam Hussein was rumored to be<br>

Soon after, when Hurley’s outfit was splashed across the front pages of the English tabloids, Gianni Versace himself described it in rather blasé terms as a remake of the old, classic punk dress. The tone of his remark surely complies with British understatement but is nonetheless an astonishing reference to his safety-pin dress—a bold sartorial experiment in construction.<br>

  Book Title: Life, Emergent-The Social in the Afterlives of Violence<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Arif Yasmeen<br>
  Abstract: Arguing that the "letting die" element of biopolitics has been overemphasized, Yasmeen Arif zeros in on biopolitics' other pole: "making live." She does so by highlighting the various means and the forms of life configured in the aftermath-or after
         lives-of violent events in contexts of law, justice, community, and identity. Her analysis of the social repercussions is both global and local in scope. Arif examines the convictions made in the Special Court of Sierra Leone, the first hybrid court of its nature under international criminal law. Next, she explores the making of a justice movement in the context of Hindu-Muslim violence in 2002 in the state of Gujarat, India. From there she revisits the Sikh carnage in Delhi of 1984. Finally, she explores a span of civil violence in Lebanon, and particularly, its effects on the city of Beirut.<br>

It remains a commonplace not only within art history, but across the humanities in general, that traditional efforts to answer the age-old question “What is art?” are a waste of time at best and an ideological power play at worst. The problem is that a definitive theory of art amounts to a contradiction in terms.

  Book Title: Agitating Images-Photography against History in Indigenous Siberia<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Craig<br>
  Abstract: Agitating Imagesprovides a glimpse into the first moments of cultural engineering in remote areas of Soviet Siberia. The territories were perceived by outsiders to be on the margins of civilization, replete with shamanic rituals and inhabited by exiles, criminals, and "primitive" indigenous peoples. The Soviets hoped to permanently transform the mythologized landscape by establishing socialist utopian developments designed to incorporate minority cultures into the communist state. This book delves deep into photographic archives from these Soviet programs, but rather than using the photographs to complement an official history, Campbell presents them as anti-illustrations, or intrusions, that confound simple narratives of Soviet bureaucracy and power. Meant to agitate, these images offer critiques that cannot be explained in text alone and, in turn, put into question the nature of photographs as historical artifacts.<br>

Behind this haze at the periphery of detective fiction, the dichotomy between hero (detective) and villain (criminal), the genre’s central setup, was also being undermined. Prominent but deranged agents of science—such as research scientists, engineers, and doctors—started to appear more often as serial killers than as models of scientific morality. Such sinister representations of scientists are somewhat at odds with both the contemporary state ideology toward and the popular understanding<br>

Many give preliminary consent to such a dictum. But it quickly runs into difficulties.

  FIVE  Memory Traces, Mystical States, and Deep Pluralism from:

  Abstract: It seems simple. Because life is riddled with mystery and uncertainty, an existential faith may encounter paradoxes that call its claim to universality into question. So a dictum becomes tempting: wherever mystery and freedom meet, a variety of faiths bubble up; wherever, therefore, people prize freedom they will support a significant presumption in favor of honoring that variety. Many give preliminary consent to such a dictum. But it quickly runs into difficulties. Christians have often insisted that because their faith is universal it must be sanctioned by public ethics in the states or civilizations they inhabit. Secularists, while praising religious<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I explore some of Freud’s most famous case histories as foundational texts in the thinkability of the human. In particular, I take “The Wolf Man” (1918) as a locus classicus. Sergei Pankejeff, the patient who came to be known as the Wolf Man, was the son of a rich Russian landowner. He is described in the study as suffering from debilitating compulsions resulting from his sexual development having gone awry during childhood. While growing up on his parents’ estate, Pankejeff developed an animal phobia and had the famous dream of wolves, which for Freud proved invaluable to<br>

  Abstract: Nations, Hobsbawm insists, are the product of territorial states, nationalism, and particular stages of technological and economic development.¹ Before the formation of a state, the elite within a nationalist movement often produces constructs of “the nation-to-be” although in fact the “nation” produced afterward may be quite different. Nationalism as a mass movement, Hobsbawm indicates, is a final stage, coming after the formation of a state. To generate identification with this “imagined community,”² nationalist movements often call upon already existing constructs of community, what we can term “protonationalist” identities generated by discourses of religion, ethnicity, language, kinship, culture, and earlier “historical<br>

Although the two nations are treated separately in each chapter in order to highlight individual particularities, comparative allusions are made in order to illustrate the ways Brazil and Portugal impinge upon each other’s respective national identity formation.

However, national questions have not entirely disappeared from the horizon of interests of the Portuguese and Brazilian fiction writers discussed throughout this study, although they have been progressively deemphasized. Interestingly, throughout their respective writing careers, Vergílio Ferreira and Clarice Lispector tended to avoid an explicit treatment of national questions altogether.<br>

It examines the interaction between the modern enterprise of nation building and the emergence of ethnic conflict in this area by focusing on a specific event: Indian political and military involvement in the struggle between Sinhalese and Tamils in Sri Lanka. It argues that the attempt to construct nation-states on the basis of exclusionary narratives of the past and univocal visions for the future has reached an impasse.

  Abstract: In a sense, to speak of foreign policy presupposes the availability of a given spatialization of the world in terms of us and them. Conventionally, foreign policy is the set of actions by “us” out “there.” In the modern, post-Westphalian world of nation-states, foreign policy constitutes the actions of state elites who try to maintain, at minimum, something called “our national security” and to further at every opportunity something called “our national interest.” This discourse of foreign policy is amnesiac about the relative novelty of its central identities and the dialectical character of its antinomies. It exemplifies the Nietzschean dictum<br>

Any more than the white man” (1967, 231), to indicate the dialectical and mutually constitutive character of ethnicity and nation under the regimes of modernity. Neither nation nor ethnicity is an immanent force, an essence within history, destined for eventual recuperation. Rather, they have to be understood in a relational framework, one that highlights their mutual indispensability and the hierarchizing effects of their interaction (Comaroff 1991).

He meant the rhetorical enactment of still more “agitation” within the abolitionists’ public sphere to signal the incompatibility of the present with a narrative construction of progress and of unseen continuity with the past. Garrison, on the other hand, was so determined to put time on the abolitionists’ side that he actually looked forward to this state of antagonism.

  Abstract: One of the key features of politics in Korea is a persistently recurring state of military tension. The roots of this conflict are historical: as a result of the emerging Soviet-American rivalry at the end of World War II, the Korean peninsula was tentatively divided along the thirtyeighth parallel. With the creation of two politically and ideologically separate Korean states in 1948, and their subsequent confrontation during the Korean War, the patterns for conflict in northeast Asia were set. In 1953 the Armistice Agreement ended three years of intense fighting that killed more than a million people. But the memory<br>

Most state actors entangled in the Korean security situation display a preference for the so-called soft landing scenario, which foresees an incremental rapprochement between North and South. All but the most radical critics of engagement advocate policies that are geared toward avoiding either a direct military conflict with or a sudden collapse of North Korea. Since the late 1990s the South Korean government has been particularly active in promoting such a step-by-step approach toward normalizing political interactions on the peninsula. While<br>

  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Negri Antonio<br>
  Abstract: “Labor is the living, form-giving fire,” Marx wrote. “It is the transitoriness of things, their temporality, as their transformation by living time.” How is it, then, that labor, with all its life-affirming potential, has become the means of capitalist discipline, exploitation, and domination in modern society? The authors expose and pursue this paradox through a systematic analysis of the role of labor in the processes of capitalist production and in the establishment of capitalist legal and social institutions. Critiquing liberal and socialist notions of labor and institutional reform from a radical democratic perspective, Hardt and Negri challenge the state-form itself.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/bron12608">Reclaiming the Enlightenment</a><br>
  Abstract: In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001, amid the intellectual retrenchment consonant with the unending “war against terror,” the Enlightenment legacy has become—more than ever before—a contested terrain. Human rights is often used as an ideological excuse for the exercise of arbitrary power; the security of western states has served as a justification for the constriction of personal freedom; and, with flags flying, Christian fundamentalists have called for the defense of western “values.” The best of them—political liberty, social justice, and cosmopolitanism—are rooted in the Enlightenment, and they retain their radical character.<br>

  Abstract: The specter of totalitarianism still hovered over the political landscape when 
                  Dialectic of Enlightenment was published in 1947. Nazism had conquered Europe and it nearly won the war. But the state structure of the Soviet Union, its secret police, military style, propaganda, and “cult of the personality” were roughly the same as that of its fascist enemy while its anti-fascist ally the United States, whatever of its formal commitment to democracy, was tainted by racism, imperialist ambitions, and the looming specter of McCarthyism. Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno saw the future appearing as present: and it was not the future<br>

  Abstract: A new world presents itself with the new millennium: time is obliterating the limitations of space and the boundaries of community. Globalization is spreading the commodity form to the most remote regions of the world; transnational organizations are dwarfing the nationstate; travel is becoming easier; religions are multiplying; intermarriage is on the rise; new communications and information technologies are rendering the world more transparent. But there is no need to be overly optimistic. Numerous parochial religious, ethnic, and nationalist organizations are arrayed—as they always have been—against the assault on traditionalism. Understandable is their fear of the economic inequality<br>

In the Basic Law (Grundgesetz) (1949), one reads the pithy commandment (article 28, paragraph 1): “The constitutional order in theLändermust conform to the principles of a republican, democratic, and social state governed by the rule of law, within the meaning of this Basic Law.” In similar fashion, article 20, paragraph 1 affirms that the Federal Republic of Germany is “a democratic and social federal state.” Debate concerning the meaning<br>

  Abstract: Since the mid-1990s Habermas has been articulating a project for a future world order involving the “further constitutionalization of international law.” Wed to the Kantian (1991) conception of cosmopolitanism, his goal is nonetheless to show that a global legal system with binding hard law, coupled to a politically constituted world society that is neither a world state nor a loose confederation of states, is conceptually conceivable. The cosmopolitan multilayered global political system he proposes would consist not only of individuals (world citizens) but also of states that would nonetheless not be relegated to mere parts of an overarching hierarchical superstate.<br>

  Abstract: For years now—across the continent, in all languages and lands—talk has been animated: Europe must determine what state it finds itself in, whether its legal system may be understood as a constitutional order, whether it can—indeed, should—be democratic, what democracy in a European union means, and what the chances of this really occurring are. The constitutionalization of Europe involves both the analysis of actual processes that make the phenomenon itself comprehensible and a normative framework offering tools of measurement—and specifying conditions necessary—for determining whether the emergent configurations “deserve recognition.” Yet analytical and empirical questions<br>

  Abstract: Since Max Weber’s well-known theory that characterized the fate of modern societies in terms of the concept of “rationalization,” the relationship between the project of occidental rationalism and the structural problems and contradictions of modern capitalist societies has preoccupied thinkers of the Frankfurt School. The early Frankfurt School’s critique of “instrumental reason” continues the legacy of Weberian-Marxism (Lukács 1971 [1923], Löwith 1993, Merleau-Ponty 1968).

  Author(s) BOHMAN JAMES<br>
  Abstract: From 1999 onward, Habermas has significantly shifted the focus of his political philosophy from questions of democracy and legitimacy within the nation-state to the burgeoning international political domain. In his first such move to international politics, in the mid-1990s, Habermas embraced the “Kantian project” of “Perpetual Peace” and interpreted it as requiring cosmopolitan democracy. In his second phase, in the late 1990s, Habermas began to see difficulties with any attempt to transfer democratic ideals directly to the international system and argued for a more limited conception of a fair negotiating system that cannot in principle attain full democratic legitimacy.

  Abstract: Constitutionality received a central position and a positive definition only in Habermas’s later writings, specifically in the context of his legal theory. In his early discussion of legitimation problems under late capitalism, the author voiced suspicion that “bourgeois constitutions” (Legitimation , 101) harbor ideology, but the matter appeared to be of secondary importance for the task at hand.

  Author(s) BAYNES KENNETH<br>
  Abstract: In an essay (Habermas 1998) marking the two hundredth anniversary of Kant’s essay “Perpetual Peace,” Habermas returns to Kant’s call for a “cosmopolitan condition” (
                  weltbürgerlicher Zustand) that would bring about a definitive end to the bellicose “state of nature” between nationstates. In this essay Habermas suggests that, in his contrast between a global constitutional order or “world republic” and a weaker voluntary federation among sovereign states, Kant was not as unambiguously in support of the latter as is generally assumed. On the one hand, the necessary cultural and social conditions for a legitimate world republic are lacking, and thus the<br>

  Abstract: Habermas’s

However, in presenting this sketch of a comprehensive theory of society, Habermas employs the term “late capitalism” only with restraint. More often, he refers to “state-regulated” or “organized capitalism.” And even when the chapter heading promises “A Descriptive Model of Advanced Capitalism,” what follows speaks primarily of “organized capitalism” (Legitimation, 33).<br>

  Abstract: As a public intellectual, Jürgen Habermas has, from the beginning of his career, taken stands on current events. His political observations have not avoided an especially touchy matter in liberal and democratic public spaces: the justification of military intervention. Since the end of the Cold War, Habermas has—in essays, newspaper pieces, and interviews—articulated positions on three wars involving Western states: the first Gulf War (1991), Kosovo (1999), and Iraq (2003). He has said little, in contrast, about ongoing activities in Afghanistan (Habermas 1991, 1999; Habermas and Derrida 2003;

  Abstract: Over a span of thirty years, twentieth-century French philosophers Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida held a conversation across texts. Sharing a Jewish heritage and a background in phenomenology, both came to situate their work at the margins of philosophy, articulating this placement through religion and literature. Chronicling the interactions between these thinkers, Sarah Hammerschlag argues that the stakes in their respective positions were more than philosophical. They were also political. Levinas's investments were born out in his writings on Judaism and ultimately in an evolving conviction that the young state of Israel held the best possibility for achieving such an ideal. For Derrida, the Jewish question was literary. The stakes of Jewish survival could only be approached through reflections on modern literature's religious legacy, a line of thinking that provided him the means to reconceive democracy. Hammerschlag's reexamination of Derrida and Levinas's textual exchange not only produces a new account of this friendship but also has significant ramifications for debates within Continental philosophy, the study of religion, and political theology.<br>

Levinas's investments were born out in his writings on Judaism and ultimately in an evolving conviction that the young state of Israel held the best possibility for achieving such an ideal. For Derrida, the Jewish question was literary. The stakes of Jewish survival could only be approached through reflections on modern literature's religious legacy, a line of thinking that provided him the means to reconceive democracy. Hammerschlag's reexamination of Derrida and Levinas's textual exchange not only produces a new account of this friendship but also has significant ramifications for debates within Continental philosophy, the study of religion, and political theology.<br>

  Abstract: Despite the constitutional separation of church and state—which Jefferson considered his proudest achievement—religion has always played a role in American political life. And it has not always been the organized religious congregations that have been leaders in crossing the line that the Constitution tries to establish. Religion touches deeper; it affects the language through which people express themselves as well as their vision of the nation to which they belong. What is new in the last two decades is the rise of a religious right that has become an active voting bloc bringing into politics social and cultural<br>

  Book Title: Governance in the New Global Disorder-Politics for a Post-Sovereign Society<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): SASSEN SASKIA<br>
  Abstract: When we talk about globalization, we tend to focus on its social and economic benefits. In
         Governance in the New Global Disorder, the political philosopher Daniel Innerarity considers its unsettling and largely unacknowledged consequences. The "opening" of different societies to new ideas, products, and forms of prosperity has introduced a persistent uncertainty, or disorder, into everyday life. Multinational corporations have weakened sovereignty. We no longer know who is in control or who is responsible. Economies can collapse without sufficient warning, and the effort to rebuild can drag on for years. Piracy is everywhere. Is there any way to balance the interests of state, marketplace, and society in this new construct of power?<br>

  Abstract: In his famous book
                  The History of Piracy, Philip Gosse (1989 [1932], 298) recalls that people, at the end of the nineteenth century, believed the disappearance of pirates was imminent. It was the dream of a world where there is no territory without sovereignty, in other words, no one distanced from the rules of the state (Thompson 1994; Anderson 1997). Subsequent history seems to flatly disprove this prediction. Piracy has stopped being a historical curiosity or a simple metaphor. Pirates are among us and taking on diverse forms in many different realms: pirates of the air and seas, radio pirates,<br>

Is intervention in “other people’s” affairs legitimate or are we compelled to accept anything that is carried out in the name of sovereignty?

Even by the most moderate of estimates, the magnitude of such damage to human life and property is staggering.

This dynamic dialectic should allow us to situate ourselves beyond the paradigm of total despair (the apocalyptic), and beyond the naïve idea that modernity can still entirely hold the pure promise of enlightenment without a critical examination of past atrocities.

The government of the Republic of China (hence-forth, the Nationalist government) took over Taiwan from Japan.¹ During the half-century of colonial rule, the Japanese colonial government aggressively promoted assimilation policies, employing state coercion to transfer Japanese culture to Taiwan in order to make Japanese culture dominant in the colony. Japanese nationalism was introduced through educational institutions on various levels. The assimilation policy was further intensified after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937; the imperial subjugation movement banned<br>

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mandair Arvind-Pal S.<br>
  Abstract: Mandair rethinks the intersection of religion and the secular in discourses such as history of religions, postcolonial theory, and recent continental philosophy. Though seemingly unconnected, these discourses are shown to be linked to a philosophy of "generalized translation" that emerged as a key conceptual matrix in the colonial encounter between India and the West. In this riveting study, Mandair demonstrates how this philosophy of translation continues to influence the repetitions of religion and identity politics in the lives of South Asians, and the way the academy, state, and media have analyzed such phenomena.<br>

  Book Title: Why Only Art Can Save Us-Aesthetics and the Absence of Emergency<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): ZABALA SANTIAGO<br>
  Abstract: The state of emergency, according to thinkers such as Carl Schmidt, Walter Benjamin, and Giorgio Agamben, is at the heart of any theory of politics. But today the problem is not the crises that we do confront, which are often used by governments to legitimize themselves, but the ones that political realism stops us from recognizing as emergencies, from widespread surveillance to climate change to the systemic shocks of neoliberalism. We need a way of disrupting the existing order that can energize radical democratic action rather than reinforcing the status quo. In this provocative book, Santiago Zabala declares that in an age where the greatest emergency is the absence of emergency, only contemporary art's capacity to alter reality can save us.
      Why Only Art Can Save Usadvances a new aesthetics centered on the nature of the emergency that characterizes the twenty-first century. Zabala draws on Martin Heidegger's distinction between works of art that rescue us from emergency and those that are rescuersintoemergency. The former are a means of cultural politics, conservers of the status quo that conceal emergencies; the latter are disruptive events that thrust us into emergencies. Building on Arthur Danto, Jacques Rancière, and Gianni Vattimo, who made aesthetics more responsive to contemporary art, Zabala argues that works of art are not simply a means of elevating consumerism or contemplating beauty but are points of departure to change the world. Radical artists create works that disclose and demand active intervention in ongoing crises. Interpreting works of art that aim to propel us into absent emergencies, Zabala shows how art's ability to create new realities is fundamental to the politics of radical democracy in the state of emergency that is the present.<br>

                  Der Spiegel, many have interpreted the word “God” too literally.¹ They have ignored that to Heidegger “God” was simply another realm where Being takes place, as he had explained thirty years earlier in “The Origin of the Work of Art.”² In that famous essay he indicates not only how art embodies an ontological struggle between the self-concealing earth and the illuminating world but also that the event of truth can happen in different acts, such as the “essential sacrifice,” “founding a state,” or<br>

  Book Title: Healing Dramas-  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): ROMBERG RAQUEL<br>
  Abstract: In this intimate ethnography, Raquel Romberg seeks to illuminate the performative significance of healing rituals and magic works, their embodied nature, and their effectiveness in transforming the states of participants by focusing on the visible, albeit mostly obscure, ways in which healing and magic rituals proceed. The questions posed by Romberg emerge directly from the particular pragmatics of Puerto Rican brujería (witch-healing), shaped by the eclecticism of its rituals, the heterogeneous character of its participants, and the heterodoxy of its moral economy.<br>

  Book Title: Cosmopolitanism in Mexican Visual Culture-  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Fernández María<br>
  Abstract: Since the colonial era, Mexican art has emerged from an ongoing process of negotiation between the local and the global, which frequently involves invention, synthesis, and transformation of diverse discursive and artistic traditions. In this pathfinding book, María Fernández uses the concept of cosmopolitanism to explore this important aspect of Mexican art, in which visual culture and power relations unite the local and the global, the national and the international, the universal and the particular. She argues that in Mexico, as in other colonized regions, colonization constructed power dynamics and forms of violence that persisted in the independent nation-state. Accordingly, Fernández presents not only the visual qualities of objects, but also the discourses, ideas, desires, and practices that are fundamental to the very existence of visual objects.<br>

  Abstract: During the period of December 26, 1999, to January 7, 2000, from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., Mexico’s City’s Zócalo was covered by an enormous canopy of light rays, visible from a distance of 15 kilometers. The rays changed position every six seconds, resulting in a new light design. Thousands of participants from four continents and from all the Mexican states created the patterns by manipulating an array of sophisticated technology.

  Author(s) SABATINO MICHELANGELO<br>
  Abstract: From the early 1920s to the late 1950s the dialectic of modernism and tradition, whether classical or vernacular, characterized the Italian state’s architectural patronage.¹ This essay investigates post–World War II state-sponsored building initiatives, mainly housing, and the architectural debates accompanying their design and realization. It sets them against the backdrop of Italian architectural discourse on identity that surfaced during the Fascist period (1922–1943) and continued to weigh heavily on the decisions of architects and urban designers in postwar democratic Italy. The essay focuses on the role that appropriation of extant vernacular building traditions and the abandonment of classicism<br>

  Abstract: The study of khipu has traditionally reflected the dominant role of Cusco at the center of the Tawantinsuyu, or “Four-fold Whole,” which was the Quechua name used by the Inka for their empire. As a prime instrument of state administration and royal hegemony, the khipu tradition was raised by the Inka to new levels of sophistication, power, and flexibility. Yet khipu predated the Inka Empire by at least a thousand years. Moreover, in the south, whence the Inka came according to their dynastic histories, the khipu tradition of Tiwanaku-Huari (Conklin 1982) had been inherited by the Aymara federations, which developed<br>

  Abstract: The nature of Dutch society and the characteristics of the European state system made the appearance of such newspapers as Jean Luzac’s

To assure its survival and prosperity, Jean Luzac had to find a special place for his journal in the highly competitive international commercial market for political news. In 1772, the prospectus for a new French-language newspaper promised readers that the editors would digest information from more than 200 other European periodicals.¹ Clearly, late-eighteenth-century readers had a wide choice of newspapers and journals; they<br>

  Abstract: The year 1772, in which the elder Etienne Luzac summoned his nephew Jean to take over the editorship of the

  Book Title: Making All the Difference-Inclusion, Exclusion, and American Law<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): MINOW MARTHA<br>
  Abstract: Minow is passionately interested in the people-"different" people-whose lives are regularly (mis)shaped and (mis)directed by the legal system's ways of handling them. Drawing on literary and feminist theories and the insights of anthropology and social history, she identifies the unstated assumptions that tend to regenerate discrimination through the very reforms that are supposed to eliminate it. Education for handicapped children, conflicts between job and family responsibilities, bilingual education, Native American land claims-these are among the concrete problems she discusses from a fresh angle of vision.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt1tm7j8t">Making All the Difference</a><br>
  Abstract: The difference dilemma is a symptom of a particular way of looking at the world. The problem arises only in a culture that officially condemns the assigned status of inequalities and yet, in practice, perpetuates them. This ambivalence is itself sustained by a set of usually unstated assumptions. “Different” traits are regarded as intrinsic to the “different” person, and the norm used to identify difference is assumed to be obvious, needing neither statement nor exposure to challenge. Differences are presumed identified through an unsituated perspective that makes other perspectives irrelevant and sees prevailing social arrangements as natural, good, and uncoerced.<br>

  Abstract: Many observers have described Western intellectual and legal histories as moving from notions of fixed and assigned status to notions of individual freedom and rights. Sir Henry Maine’s famous dictum defined progress as the movement from status to contract.¹ Such broadly gauged summaries risk oversimplification and insensitivity to the variety and contestability of understandings of the past. Nonetheless, the contrast between legal orders premised upon status and those premised upon state-guaranteed rights helps to locate notions of abnormal persons and rights analysis as ways for dealing with differences. And as a historical matter, rights analysis in some ways is a<br>

  Abstract: The case of Phillip Becker is special. It brought together a remarkable judge who felt unusually connected to the people in the litigation, a developmentally disabled youngster, and two volunteers who offered him a better life. What’s more, the unfolding of the case can be described, retrospectively, as a series of challenges to the unstated assumptions common to other cases about mentally retarded persons and about the role of the courts. For example, Judge Fernandez compared the Beckers’ assumption that Phillip’s differences were intrinsic and immutable with the Heaths’ view that Phillip is more like than unlike “normal” people and<br>

After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and during the ten years of Soviet occupation, Pakistan hosted over three million Afghan refugees and resistance fighters. The Afghan refugee camps, situated close to the Afghan border, served a dual purpose as a refuge for victims of conflict and as a sanctuary in which

  Book Title: The Light of Knowledge-Literacy Activism and the Politics of Writing in South India<br>

  Author(s): Cody Francis<br>
  Abstract: The Light of Knowledgeis set primarily in the rural district of Pudukkottai in Tamil Nadu, and it is about activism among laboring women from marginalized castes who have been particularly active as learners and volunteers in the movement. In their endeavors to remake the Tamil countryside through literacy activism, workers in the movement found that their own understanding of the politics of writing and Enlightenment was often transformed as they encountered vastly different notions of language and imaginations of social order. Indeed, while activists of the movement successfully mobilized large numbers of rural women, they did so through logics that often pushed against the very Enlightenment rationality they hoped to foster. Offering a rare behind-the-scenes look at an increasingly important area of social and political activism,The Light of Knowledgebrings tools of linguistic anthropology to engage with critical social theories of the postcolonial state.<br>

How many different ways can people be beaten, assaulted, and killed in the course of fifty minutes or four hundred pages? The cultural hegemony of violent crime in virtually all media (prose fiction, television, and film) creates a self-perpetuating confidence in the corruption and criminalization of both the country and its representations, a hyperreal projection of a terrorized populace consuming narratives about their criminal state.

Viroqua is the seat of Vernon County, and it lies about twenty miles from the Mississippi River, directly east of the Iowa-Minnesota border on the river’s opposite shore. It is a two-hour drive northwest from Madison, Wisconsin’s state capital, and three hours from the Twin Cities in Minnesota, though residents advise allowing four hours if you are catching a flight at the St. Paul–<br>

  Abstract: The first feature of Viroqua to make a deep impression on me was the larger-than-life fiberglass bull that stared sternly out over drivers on Highway 14 as they entered the town from the south. The bull advertised what was, at the time of my first visit in December 2000, a restaurant called Ricky’s. Passing the bull and heading into the downtown proper, I passed the VFW hall on the right, the Century 21 real estate office on the left and, shortly after that, the Latter-day Saints church, the optometry office, the Vernon County Historical Society Museum, and Vernon Memorial Hospital,<br>

  Book Title: Mourning Happiness-Narrative and the Politics of Modernity<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Soni Vivasvan<br>
  Abstract: For Soni, the classical Greek idea of happiness-epitomized by Solon's proverb "Call no man happy until he is dead"-opens the way to imagining a properly secular conception of happiness, one that respects human finitude and mortality. By analyzing the story of Solon's encounter with Croesus, Attic funeral orations, Greek tragedy, and Aristotle's ethics, Soni explains what it means to think, rather than feel, a happiness available for public judgment, rooted in narrative, unimaginable without a relationship to community, and irreducible to an emotional state. Such an ideal, Soni concludes, would allow for a radical reenvisioning of a politics that takes happiness seriously and responds to our highest aspirations rather than merely keeping our basest motivations in check.<br>

  Abstract: The audacity of Solon’s pronouncement is that it imagines a happiness that is possible for finite beings. Solon’s proverb simply requires that we judge a life’s narrative as we find it: is this life happy or unhappy? It does not specify any content to happiness in advance. Nor does it specify any criteria for happiness that would place it out of the reach of a finite being, such as the continuity of pleasure or satisfaction or the optimization of wealth. The hermeneutic of happiness is not a quest for perfection or a pure state, since there is nothing uncontaminated in<br>

  Abstract: Herder’s work on the Bible has a distinctly theological thrust. Thus he asserted in the opening statement of his encyclopedic

  Author(s) Bohm Arnd<br>
  Abstract: Herder’s views on political topics such as liberty and tyranny, sovereignty, the constitutions of states, statecraft, and international relations were largely theoretical, the product of wide-ranging studies in history, theology, philosophy, and the emerging discipline of comparative anthropology. Due to his vocation as a theologian and Protestant clergyman, Herder was virtually precluded from holding political office or commenting frankly on public affairs, except as mediated by the established church. Thus he stands in contrast to Goethe, whose training as a lawyer and long years of service managing the affairs of the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach gave him practical insight into the<br>

  Author(s) CRICK JULIA<br>
  Abstract: Historians of the modern and pre-modern worlds have often sought to make connections between the boundaries of states and the shape of their respective historiographies; in recent years they have scrutinised archival processes and the preservation of artefacts of the past, and they and their literary peers have examined the historical narratives which imposed order on the past and gave meaning to its remains.¹ National historiographies are thus commonly ascribed active properties, as means by which elites might recognise and realise a collective future for their nation, stifle opposing views and assert a common will.

  Abstract: In

He then adds that there is a higher reflectiveness that divides that inner world into two parts: a self and its realm, or the creator and his world. While such statements are intended to describe the inner lives of Romantic geniuses, they are also indicative of an overall understanding of the life of the mind as it was discussed among the German Romantics.

  Abstract: This essay examines the archival practices of German photographers Bernd and Hilla Becher, focusing on their first decade working together beginning in 1959, during which they produced the earliest iterations of and statements about their ongoing project photographing the industrial structures they termed “anonymous sculpture.” It considers what they meant to achieve in this production by systematically documenting these edifices—pit heads, cooling towers, blast furnaces, water towers, and others used in resource extraction and processing—of the Siegerland and Ruhr regions of central and western Germany.

  Abstract: In the
                  Archeology of Knowledge, Michel Foucault identifies in the archive a “particular level” that “between tradition and oblivion, […] reveals the rules of a practice that enables statements both to survive and to undergo regular modification. It isthe general system of the formation and transformation of statements.”¹ Because statements emerge as meaningful discourse at a given time, their appearance is accompanied by the possibility that they might not appear. They thereby point to the ways in which language is an event, the possibility of something being said or not said, a matter of whether enunciations even take place<br>

  Abstract: In the essay “Ruysdael als Dichter” (1816; Ruisdael as Poet), Johann Wolfgang Goethe argues that Jacob van Ruisdael’s images seem to move, and in fact to enact a narrative. Goethe notes that the seventeenth-century painter’s technique is impeccable, but the essay focuses on Ruisdael “as a thinking artist, even as a poet” (als denkenden Künstler, ja als Dichter).¹ “Ruysdael als Dichter” implicitly disputes the conclusions of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing’s
                  Laokoon(1766; Laocoon), which states that painting and sculpture can only imitate plots or narratives, not convey them.² Ruisdael, counters Goethe, indeed can portray movement through time in his painting: his<br>

  Book Title: Engaging Heritage, Engaging Communities-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Whitehead Chris<br>
  Abstract: Across the global networks of heritage sites, museums, and galleries, the importance of communities to the interpretation and conservation of heritage is increasingly being recognised. Yet the very term "meaningful community engagement" betrays a myriad of contrary approaches and understandings. Who is a community? How can they engage with heritage and why would they want to? How do communities and heritage professionals perceive one another? What does it mean to "engage"? These questions unsettle the very foundations of community engagement and indicate a need to unpick this important but complex trend. Engaging Heritage, Engaging Communities critically explores the latest debates and practices surrounding community collaboration. By examining the different ways in which communities participate in heritage projects, the book questions the benefits, costs and limitations of community engagement. Whether communities are engaging through innovative initiatives or in response to economic, political or social factors, there is a need to understand how such engagements are conceptualised, facilitated and experienced by both the organisations and the communities involved.BR> Bryony Onciul is Lecturer in History at the University of Exeter; Michelle Stefano is the Co-Director of Maryland Traditions, the folklife program for the state of Maryland and Visiting Assistant Professor in American Studies at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County; Stephanie Hawke is a project manager and fundraiser, working on a range of projects aiming to engage communities with cultural heritage.

  Book Title: Nation as Grand Narrative-The Nigerian Press and the Politics of Meaning<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Adebanwi Wale<br>
  Abstract: Nation as Grand Narrative offers a methodical analysis of how relations of domination and subordination are conveyed through media narratives of nationhood. Using the typical postcolonial state of Nigeria as a template and engaging with disciplines ranging from media studies, political science, and social theory to historical sociology and hermeneutics, Wale Adebanwi examines how the nation as grand narrative provides a critical interpretive lens through which competition among ethnic, ethnoregional, and ethnoreligious groups can be analyzed. Adebanwi illustrates how meaning is connected to power through ideology in the struggles enacted on the pages of the print media over diverse issues including federalism, democracy and democratization, religion, majority-minority ethnic relations, space and territoriality, self-determination, and threat of secession. Nation as Grand Narrative will trigger further critical reflections on the articulation of relations of domination in the context of postcolonial grand narratives.

  Book Title: Twenty Years On-Competing Memories of the GDR in Postunification German Culture<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Tate Dennis<br>
  Abstract: Twenty years on from the dramatic events that led to the opening of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the GDR, the subjective dimension of German unification is still far from complete. The nature of the East German state remains a matter of cultural as well as political debate. This volume of new research focuses on competing memories of the GDR and the ways they have evolved in the mass media, literature, and film since 1989-90. Taking as its point of departure the impact of iconic visual images of the fall of the Wall on our understanding of the historical GDR, the volume first considers the decade of cultural conflict that followed unification and then the emergence of a more complex and diverse "textual memory" of the GDR since the Berlin Republic was established in 1999. It highlights competing generational perspectives on the GDR era and the unexpected "afterlife" of the GDR in recent publications. The volume as a whole shows the vitality of eastern German culture two decades after the demise of the GDR and the centrality of these memory debates to the success of Germany's unification process.

  Abstract: As early as 1834, two years after Goethe’s death, the apparent resemblance of his Faust figure with Paracelsus led John S. Blackie, in the preface to his rendition of Goethe’s tragedy into English verse, to the following statement: “There is much in all that is told of him [Faust] that recalls to our mind the biography of Paracelsus.”¹ By the end of the nineteenth century, this assumption acquired a degree of certainty for Goethe scholars. In 1870, Gustav von Loeper² remarked that Goethe’s Faust is a physician and a physician’s son, as is Paracelsus. Both figures detested the medicine of<br>

In this standard interpretation, Hanslick’s treatise remains, to the present, the most prominent example of formalism in musical aesthetics.<br>

  Abstract: In the spring of 1715, the day after he celebrated his 55th birthday, King George I attended a service of thanksgiving at St James’s palace chapel. The king’s court had gathered to remember the providential restoration of the established state and Church, heralded by the popular rejoicing that had greeted King Charles II upon his entry into London in May of 1660. The sermon, subsequently published at royal command, was delivered by William Burscough, an Oxford don and one of the new king’s chaplains. Taking as his text Psalm 147.1, ‘For it is Good to sing Praises unto our God’,<br>

  Author(s) Schönfeld Christiane<br>
  Abstract: In the aftermath of the Second World War and the Nazi period, both the Allied occupying powers and the nascent German authorities in the political and cultural spheres sought Germans whose record during the war and the Nazi period could serve as a counterpoint to the notion of all Germans being evil. After the division of Germany in 1949, finding “good Germans” whose record helped legitimize each of the new German states became a core aspect of building a new nation in Germany and of the propaganda battle in this respect between the two German states.

  Author(s) Schönfeld Christiane<br>
  Abstract: The focus of this chapter is on the cinematic representation of the “good German” in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, and the reorientation of defeated, isolated, and morally devastated Germans, not only by addressing the country’s all-too-recent genocidal past, but especially by highlighting the possibility of moral truth, autonomous agency, and ethical action, and thereby, the possibility of a better future. Representations of humanity, decency, and the courage to disobey or change were projected during this early postwar period onto often makeshift cinema screens as seeds lying dormant under thousands of cubic feet of rubble.

  Abstract: The Isle of Man is an independent Crown Dependency, with the Queen as head of state and an ambivalent and at times uncomfortable relationship with the British government. In the early 20th century the Lieutenant Governor was a powerful and significant figure on the island, balancing and indeed controlling the powers of the Tynwald parliament. From 1902 the Lieutenant Governor was Lord Raglan, who had come from the post of Under Secretary for War and been a major organiser of the Boer War campaigns.

Indeed it tends towards the Gordian when there appears to be a well-grounded biological basis to a certain ethnic identity, and questions of ‘race’ and thus of course accusations of ‘racism’, start to raise their head. The Basques are such a case. In this chapter, rather than lunge for a sword, metaphorical or otherwise, I wish to untie this particular knot piece by piece, and to assess the evidence as<br>

  Author(s) Torres Isabel<br>
  Abstract: If poetry plays to the most volatile and malleable part of our nature, then Plato, the philosopher, played poetry beautifully, and at its own game. The exploratory nature of Plato’s writings, as well as their apparent inconsistencies, are well documented.¹ His contradictory attitude, for instance, to poetry’s relationship to the polity has not only dogged disciplinary discourse in terms of a centuries-long quarrel between philosophy and literature, but has also given rise to a provocative paradigm that connects order within the self to the construction of a utopian state. Individual selfhood is symbolically politicised in this process, while the construction<br>

  Abstract: At the end of his analysis of the ‘Vida retirada’ poem, Ricardo Senabre wrote: ‘Urge […] afrontar el estudio del sistema metafórico de fray Luis.’¹ He was arguing against the predominant biographical interpretation of the poem, in which its search for a life of peaceful contentment was read as the poet’s desire to be free of the disputes and conflicts of Salamanca, and the famous garden ‘por mi mano plantado’ was identified with the Augustinian estate of La Flecha or an other such retreat. He demonstrated persuasively that the classical, biblical and Patristic resonances of many of Fray Luis’s metaphors,<br>

  Abstract: Histories are never just neutral accounts of the past. Rather, past events are selected, shaped, and linked into narratives that are told in order to make sense of, and give meaning to, the present. Individuals, families, religious communities, political parties, and other groups use them as vehicles to communicate how they arrived where they are, how they want to be seen and understood. Above all, the cultural construction of these narratives, understood in the broadest possible sense, is one of the central planks in the formation of national identity, the collective myth-making which so often essentializes the otherwise contingent nation-state.<br>

  Abstract: This essay will focus on a conflict between two competing visions of socialist design in the GDR, which drew on different aspects of the German cultural heritage and were based on diverging, untested assumptions about what was suitable for the socialist consumer. Ideologues of the ruling SED championed the doctrine of socialist realism as a suitable starting point, while members of the GDR design community supported a modernist approach to industrial design. In the first fifteen years of the state’s existence this disagreement manifested itself in a considerable divergence between official rhetoric and design practice.<br>

  Author(s) Gosetti-Ferencei Jennifer Anna<br>
  Abstract: There is an undeniably tragic dimension to central motives of postwar German painting, particularly in the works of Anselm Kiefer. The imagery of devastated landscapes, charred fields and forests, empty attics and bunkers, flames, and ashen skies in Kiefer’s paintings evoke the devastation wreaked by Germany during the Second World War and by National Socialism. References to the poetry of Paul Celan and a lost Judaic heritage render such scenes extraordinarily haunting. The use of such materials as ash, lead, burnt canvas, human hair, and straw contribute to both the material innovation and the provocative nature of these works. Invoking<br>

  Abstract: Like most modern nation states, Canada was invented slowly, and like many nation states beyond Europe, it was invented by white colonizers who came from overseas. Indeed, the standard history of the name “Canada” itself retraces the nation’s slow historical emergence as a product of European expansion and colonization. Originally a Huron-Iroquois word meaning “village” or “settlement,” 
                  kanata entered the Euro-American record through Jacques Cartier’s accounts of his explorations in the 1530s and 1540s, and referred to a region in the Laurentians (see ch. 4, Laflèche).

  Abstract: Speaking of the period from 1920 to 1960, Margaret Atwood stated in her introduction to the

These were also, of course, years that were overshadowed by two world wars; and those global events<br>

  Author(s) Oberhuber Andrea<br>
  Abstract: It seems impossible today to discuss Quebec literature without considering its institutions and, in particular, its institutionalization over the past century. This predicament explains Gilles Marcotte’s (1925–) remarks on “Institution et courants d’air” (1989), in which he observes that “the literary institution is not a new topic in Quebec literature. On the contrary, it is our 
                  oldest idea. Just as God exists before creation, the institution predates the works” (26). The narrator of Catherine Mavrikakis’s (1961–) novel Deuils cannibales et mélancoliques (2000) makes a similar statement: “In Quebec, there are more literary prizes than books published. . .<br>

  Book Title: Juan Goytisolo: The Author as Dissident-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): de Menezes Alison Ribeiro<br>
  Abstract: This monograph offers two new perspectives on Spanish writer, Juan Goytisolo. First, under the themes of authorship and dissidence, it integrates his writing across several genres, providing a rounded assessment of his contribution to cultural debates in Spain since the sixties and arguing that resistance to repressive discourses characterizes his essays and autobiographies as much as his fiction. Second, it revises the prevailing critical interpretation of Goytisolo's fiction by building on four premises: that his novels are less clearly oppositional than prevailing interpretations imply; that, in order to engage with discourses of identity, he employs an idiom which, contrary to his own statements, is not a poststructuralist autonomous world of words; that a textual practice grounded in the recognizable experience of post-Civil War Spain, rather than one which seeks out the realm of pure textuality, is essential to Goytisolo's subversive political intentions; and that the autobiographical element of much of his work constitutes a more complex narrative aesthetic than has been appreciated. The book argues that if Goytisolo's work is interpreted as an ethical engagement with postmodernist theory, rather than as an illustration of it, then certain contradictions for which he has been criticized are seen in a new and valuable light.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.cttn332r">A Companion to Friedrich Nietzsche</a><br>
  Abstract: In his notebooks for the period from the end of 1876 to the summer of 1877, we find the following sketch for a section in the first volume of 
                  Menschliches, Allzumenschliches(Human, All Too Human) (MA I §292; KSA 2, 235–37). Where, in the published version of this passage, which is entitled “Forward” (“Vorwärts”), Nietzsche casts his observations in the form of recommendations for the reader, in this draft he states them as his personal ambition. So it seems appropriate, as a conclusion to this Companion to Friedrich Nietzsche, to his life and his works, to this Companion to Friedrich<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I will say a few words about the intellectual origins in Talcott Parsons’s development of the ingredients that were synthesized into a culmination of his most mature theoretical statement in

I will comment on that book’s subsequent “fate” in light of developments within sociology and to some extent economics, and sketch the reinvigoration of economic sociology in the past two decades, and present a critical assessment of work in those decades, partly from a “Parsonian” point of view—an assessment that will yield, finally, a programmatic<br>

  Abstract: This chapter deals with two key issues in the sociology of art, the social construction of the role of the artist and the nature of high culture. It poses the question of how they might be approached differently than they are in currently popular approaches, and attempts to answer it by using the comparative and evolutionary perspective advocated by Parsons as part of action theory. I will briefly sketch the state of play in contemporary sociology of the artist and high culture, and the set of concepts and models from within action theory that I will use to approach these<br>

  Abstract: Although discussions of inequality among families and discussions of inequality between generations of the same family have been almost entirely separated, they are analytically closely related. In particular, regression away from the mean in the relation between the incomes of parents and children would be associated with large and growing inequality of income over time, while regression toward the mean would be associated with a smaller and more stable degree of inequality. These statements are obvious in a simple stochastic model of the relation between parents and children:<br>

  Abstract: Joseph Gusjield:Phenomenology has often been criticized for doing away with any kind of definitive statement that one can make about what is happening and consequently reducing the role of the observer to reporting on what he finds from his relationship to subjects. I am very reluctant to take away from sociologists the kind of activity that tries to give some sense of what are the consequences of actions. What I have been admonishing here (and I do find a link between the interpretive sociology, the phenomenologists, and the symbolic interactionists) is to get as close as we can to<br>

  Book Title: Promises of 1968-Crisis, Illusion and Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): TISMANEANU VLADIMIR<br>
  Abstract: This book is a state of the art reassessment of the significance and consequences of the events associated with the year 1968 in Europe and in North America. Since 1998, there hasn’t been any collective, comparative and interdisciplinary effort to discuss 1968 in the light of both contemporary headways of scholarship and new evidence on this historical period. A significant departure from earlier approaches lies in the fact that the manuscript is constructed in unitary fashion, as it goes beyond the East–West divide, trying to identify the common features of the sixties. The latter are analyzed as simultaneously global and local developments. The main problems addressed by the contributors of this volume are: the sixties as a generational clash; the redefinition of the political as a consequence of the ideological challenges posed to the status-quo by the sixty-eighters; the role of Utopia and the de-radicalization of intellectuals; the challenges to imperialism (Soviet/American); the cultural revolution of the sixties; the crisis of ‘really existing socialism’ and the failure of “socialism with a human face”; the gradual departure from the Yalta-system; the development of a culture of human rights and the project of a global civil society; the situation of 1968 within the general evolution of European history (esp. the relationship of 1968 with 1989). In contrast to existing books, the book provides a fundamental and unique synthesis of approaches on 1968: first, it contains critical (vs. nostalgic) re-evaluations of the events from the part of significant sixty-eighters; second, it includes historical analyses based on new archival research; third, it gathers important theoretical re-assessments of the intellectual history of the 1968; and fourth, it bridges 1968 with its aftermath and its pre-history, thus avoiding an over-contextualization of the topics in question.<br>

  Author(s) Tismaneanu Vladimir<br>
  Abstract: The events of 1968 radically influenced the social, political, and cultural landscape of the post-1945 world. In the context of the Cold War, 1968 was a transnational moment of revolt against the status quo beyond the east-West divide.¹ it represented a turning point in world history that brought about a sweeping axiological reassessment of politics.² More than ten years ago, the editors of a collective volume about 1968 stated that “the memories of witnesses to the events of this

  Author(s) Miller Nick<br>
  Abstract: For Yugoslavia, 1968 did not follow the European script, and its drama lacked clear political and intellectual contours. Between Belgrade’s student movement, tumult in the Serbian league of Communists, the growing national movement in Croatia, and rebellion in Kosovo, the year was one of entirely mixed messages, as the dynamism of Yugoslavia’s partisan experiment began to give way to a new dynamic of ethnic affirmation. Of all these events, only the Belgrade student movement fits comfortably into any generalizable pattern regarding the year itself. The others were just signs of crisis in a state that had yet to determine how<br>

  CHAPTER II.  CULTURAL AND HISTORIOGRAPHICAL NARRATIVES OF IDENTITY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7829/j.ctt1282cj">Late Enlightenment</a><br>
  Abstract: In the second half of the eighteenth century, Austrian state and society experienced a period of profound transformations. In 1749, facing increasing political and social unrest, Empress Maria Theresa (r. 1740–1780) introduced a number of reforms, which would have an enduring effect on the Habsburg Monarchy. The administration of the state was divided among a state chancellery, a state council, and the 
                  Directorium in publicis et cameralibus charged with the management of internal affairs. Other reforms included the introduction of district commissions, the creation of a general land register and the establishment of a military academy in Wiener Neustadt.<br>

  Abstract: The Enlightenment in Austria had two main dimensions: a social and legal reform initiated by the state, and a literary revival. If ‘cameralism’—arguably an internal development within the Austrian political establishment—represented the first aspect (see Joseph von Sonnenfels, 
                  On the love of Fatherland), the second aspect was the result of a combination of exogenous influences and indigenous conditions. As a result, the very notion of ‘Austrian’ literature at the end of the eighteenth century is contested. One of the most important influences on the Austrian cultural context was exerted by the appeal of prominent German writers for the<br>

Arguably, the most important reforms were those aimed at subordinating the church to the authority of the state.<br>

  Book Title: Friendship and Love, Ethics and Politics-Studies in Mediaeval and Early Modern History<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Österberg Eva<br>
  Abstract: Today, friendship, love and sexuality are mostly viewed as private, personal and informal relations. In the mediaeval and early modern period, just like in ancient times, this was different. The classical philosophy of friendship (Aristotle) included both friendship and love in the concept of philia. It was also linked to an argument about the virtues needed to become an excellent member of the city state. Thus, close relations were not only thought to be a matter of pleasant gatherings in privacy, but just as much a matter of ethics and politics. What, then, happened to the classical ideas of close relations when they were transmitted to philosophers, clerical and monastic thinkers, state officials or other people in the medieval and early modern period? To what extent did friendship transcend the distinctions between private and public that then existed? How were close relations shaped in practice? Did dialogues with close friends help to contribute to the process of subject-formation in the Renaissance and Enlightenment? To what degree did institutions of power or individual thinkers find it necessary to caution against friendship or love and sexuality?<br>

  Abstract: On July 6, 1995, a monument of Bulgarian statesman Stefan Stambolov—representing only his head with a deep cut on it—was inaugurated in the garden in front of the Army Club in Sofia, on the spot where he was murdered 100 years before. Insofar as Stambolov had become a symbol of independent national policies, directed against Russia in particular, the newly restored democracy in Bulgaria marked its exit from the Soviet sphere of influence with this monument. The irony is that by vindicating Stambolov, in fact, by giving official sanction to a process that had begun already under communism,<br>

  Abstract: In what follows, I will review the concepts of “objectivity” and “truth” in Bulgarian historical scholarship on the basis of my historiographical research and observations. As will be seen, there is a great difference between theoretical-methodological statements and historiographical practice. However, my purpose is not to blame the presumably “objective” historiography for “lack of objectivity” (especially since I do not believe in this ideal), but to see how things stand on particular issues of the “objectivity and truth” complex. Hence the account is somewhat fragmented. The question will also be posed: why were there, until recently, no relativizations of the<br>

  Author(s): Iacob Bogdan C.<br>
  Abstract: The twentieth century has left behind a painful and complicated legacy of massive trauma, monstrous crimes, radical social engineering, or collective/individual guilt syndromes that were often the premises for and the specters haunting the process of democratization in the various societies that emerged out of these profoundly de-structuring contexts. The present manuscript is a state of the art reassessment and analysis of how the interplay between memory, history, and justice generates insight that is multifariously relevant for comprehending the present and future of democracy without becoming limited to a Europe-centric framework of understanding. The manuscript is structured on three complementary and interconnected trajectories: the public use of history, politics of memory, and transitional justice. Key words 1. Europe, Eastern—Politics and government—1989– 2. Collective memory—Europe, Eastern. 3. Memory—Political aspects—Europe, Eastern. 4. Democratization— Social aspects—Europe, Eastern. 5.

  Abstract: Over the past twenty-five years, the debate about the communist past in Eastern Europe became largely a discussion about the debate itself. In this chapter, I will argue that, in the immediate aftermath of the events of 1989, the main concern of the public actors was not to clarify the nature of the old regime, but to assess its specific elements, to condemn and/or to forget them. Such processes were perceived to be the perquisites of embarking on the project of building a new democratic state.<br>

  Abstract: For much of the Soviet period, party authorities endorsed a single, mobilizational view of USSR history that was supported not only by academia and the censor, but by official mass culture, public educational institutions, and state textbook publishing. Indeed, it was not until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 that the society’s traditional reliance on an “official line” and a handful of prescribed textbooks gave way to a much looser system in which a variety of ideologically diverse titles could vie with one another within a newly competitive public school textbook market.

  Germany’s Two Processes of “Coming to Terms with the Past”—Failures, After all? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7829/j.ctt19z399m">Remembrance, History, and Justice</a><br>
  Author(s) Müller Jan-Werner<br>
  Abstract: Germany’s dealing with its two difficult pasts—the East German state socialist dictatorship and, much more important, Nazism and the Holocaust—has almost globally been considered a success, even a model for others to emulate.¹ Human rights activists and politicians from South Africa, for instance, closely studied what the Germans had done by way of trials, public commemoration and schoolbooks; and the Chinese would at one point admonish Japan that, in dealing with World War II, it should adopt the “German model.” Not surprisingly perhaps, this

  Author(s) Caşu Igor<br>
  Abstract: The history of Communism in the Republic of Moldova is arguably little-known in the West. Most of the Republic of Moldova was a part of Romania in the interwar period and it is historically, linguistically, and ethnically intertwined with that of Romania. However, one cannot ignore the status of Bessarabia as part of the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, Bessarabia was the only Soviet territory belonging historically and ethnically to a neighboring state—Communist Romania. Thus, one needs to make an extensive introduction on the nature of Soviet regime in former Moldavian SSR. One also has to answer a<br>

  Abstract: When applied to explicit or implicit (cognitive) statements about the “placement” of man in his environment, human rational faculties are often inadequate in the decipherment and revelation of an esoteric content. Humanity’s integrative roots with the universe and the creation of a graspable consciousness, as a means of orientation in time and/or space (in the concrete, but also in the dimension of ontological reality) embrace the totality of the past with the help of symbols, rituals, ceremonies and myths. A community could not regard itself as truly constituted until a sacred beginning is ascribed to it and an inseparable, “invisible<br>

  Abstract: The exercise of impetuosity, an instance of devastating and powerful force or an unjust and unwarranted display of physical intention for the purpose of intimidation, injury and destruction, are all aspects of violence, an elusive concept often applied in the description of a recognisable reality and an actual situation. Within the institutional confines and structures of a society, violence is roughly definable as “the illegal employment of methods of physical coercion”³ in the pursuit of individual and collective objectives. Étatist traditions are conterminal with the use of constitutionally sanctioned coercion⁴ in the defence and consolidation of state authority. All human<br>

  Book Title: What Holds Europe Together?-  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Michalski Krzysztof<br>
  Abstract: The book addresses contemporary developments in European identity politics as part of a larger historical trajectory of a common European identity based on the idea of 'solidarity.' The authors explain the special sense in which Europeans perceive their obligations to their less fortunate compatriots, to the new East European members, and to the world at large. An understanding of this notion of 'solidarity' is critical to understanding the specific European commitment to social justice and equality. The specificity of this term helps to distinguish between what the Germans call "social state" from the Anglo-Saxon, and particularly American, political and social system focused on capitalism and economic liberalism. This collection is the result of the work of an extremely distinguished group of scholars and politicians, invited by the previous President of the European Union, Romano Prodi, to reflect on some of the most important subjects affecting the future of Europe.<br>

  Abstract: In enlarging to 25 member-states and beyond, the EU will change its nature. It will move from being a predominantly rich country club to a truly continental union. On what basis will this large community of states live together? Today, European countries are more alike than they have been for 200 years, with nearly all being democracies and market economies. But although the shared values of freedom, democracy and market economics are necessary conditions for harmonious co-existence in the EU, they are not sufficient. The Union needs solidarity as well.<br>

  Abstract: In 1882 the historian Ernest Renan gave a lecture at the Sorbonne on the topic ‘What is a nation?’ in which he stated laconically: “A customs union is not a fatherland.” The European Union of today is more than a customs union, but certainly less than a fatherland. It also does not aspire to be, or to become, the latter. But it is assigning to itself ever more tasks whose completion had in the past required national solidarity.<br>

  Abstract: 1. The starting point is accurately described: After World War II, Europe was destroyed, materially and mentally devastated. The German National Socialists’ (and the Italian Fascists’) plans for Europe were bankrupt. They left behind a field of ruins and inflicted on every nation wounds whose scars have not healed to this day. The almost immediately ensuing Cold War added new injuries and divided Europe into two hostile halves, each armed to the teeth. With massive American financial assistance and political support, the countries of Western Europe managed to achieve economic and political stability.

  Abstract: While this might be true, in the era of globalization we cannot disregard the role that the European Union plays in the world. Armed conflict no longer exists within the EU, yet this is not at all true beyond its borders. The EU must bear a measure of responsibility for what occurs in other parts of the world based on its involvement in the global economy and also due to the colonial past of many of its member states.<br>

  Abstract: The powers of cohesion in an expanded European Union must “be looked for and found in Europe’s common culture” the Reflection Group’s Europe Paper emphasizes. Indeed: “As the old forces of integration—the desire for peace, the existence of external threats, and the potential for economic growth— lose their effectiveness, the role of Europe’s common culture—the spiritual factor of European integration—will inevitably grow in importance as a source of unity and cohesion.” Whether, as stated at the beginning of the paper, a radical re-definition of the EU really is on the agenda, appears to me rather doubtful—I<br>

  Abstract: Whenever I’m invited to say something about the state of European solidarity, I feel the embarrassment of a well-behaved boy forced to do something completely inappropriate in good company: to swear aloud or to unmask the lies of a good and respected uncle. Correspondingly, for some time I have had the strong impression that the idea of solidarity on our continent of Europe serves the same function as the idea of peace did shortly before World War II. The more often politicians call upon it, and the more international conferences and seminars are devoted to it, the less solidarity there<br>

  Abstract: The “Velvet Revolution” in November 1989 brought about enormous changes in the political and social environment: the communist regime was abolished and after forty-one years democracy was reestablished in Czechoslovakia. In art, the most important change brought by the Revolution was the end of censorship. Since 1989 artists have been allowed to do as they wish—as long as they can find the funding. Film in socialism was funded exclusively by the state, but since about 1990 the state has not been responsible for what is produced and, not surprisingly, the authorities have cut the subsidies of the costly film<br>

  Book Title: Hybrid Renaissance-Culture, Language, Architecture<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burke Peter<br>
  Abstract: Hybrid Renaissance presents the Renaissance in Italy, elsewhere in Europe and in the world beyond Europe as an example of cultural hybridization. It is impossible to give a clear definition of either of the two key concepts used in this book, “hybridization" and “Renaissance". Roughly speaking, hybridity refers to something new that emerges from the combination of diverse older elements. The term “hybridization" is preferable to “hybridity" because it refers to a process rather than to a state, and also because it encourages the writer and the readers alike to think in terms of more or less rather than of presence versus absence. The book begins with a discussion of the concept of cultural hybridity and a cluster of other concepts related to it. Then comes a geography of hybridity, focusing on three locales: courts, major cities (whether ports or capitals) and frontiers. There follow six chapters about the hybrid Renaissance in different fields: architecture, painting and sculpture, languages, literatures, music, philosophy and law and finally religion. The essay concludes with a brief account of attempts to resist hybridization or to purify cultures or domains from what was already hybridized<br>

  Book Title: Where Currents Meet-Frontiers of Memory in Post-Soviet Fiction of Kharkiv, Ukraine<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zaharchenko Tanya<br>
  Abstract: Where Currents Meet treats the Ukrainian and Russian components of cultural experience in Ukraine’s East as elements of a complex continuum. This study of cultural memory in post-Soviet space shows how its inhabitants negotiate the historical legacy they have inherited. Tanya Zaharchenko approaches contemporary Ukrainian literature at the intersection of memory studies and border studies, and her analysis adds a new voice to an ongoing exploration of cultural and historical discourses in Ukraine. This scholarly journey through storylines explores the ways in which younger writers in Kharkiv (Kharkov in Russian), a diverse, dynamic, but understudied border city in east Ukraine today come to grips with a traumatized post-Soviet cultural landscape. Zaharchenko’s book examines the works of Serhiy Zhadan, Andrei Krasniashchikh, Yuri Tsaplin, Oleh Kotsarev and others, introducing them as a “doubletake" generation who came of age during the Soviet Union’s collapse and as adults revisited this experience in their novels. Filling the space between society and the state, local literary texts have turned into forms of historical memory and agents of political life.<br>

The defining twentieth-century struggle—between liberal democracies with their apparently superior market economies and authoritarian communist regimes with their ossifying and crumbling command economies—came to a sudden and unexpected demise. The former emperors of the Soviet Bloc were left shivering and cold in their newly-revealed nakedness; the vast political and security apparatus of the party-state crumbled like a house of cards.

First, Polish experiences are seen unique in the region: peculiar factors such as an institutionally strong and independent Catholic Church; the survival of private ownership of land and de-collectivization of agriculture; a history replete with both anti-Russian, anti-Soviet and working class uprisings (in 1831, 1863, 1944, 1956, 1970, 1976, and 1980–1981); the relative power and prowess of intellectuals and the intelligentsia; and the weakness of party-state institutions and elites (Schöpflin, 1983; Ekiert and Kubic, 2001).

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: The necessity of both solidarity and proceduralism thus holds for both distributive and criminal justice. In the end, Ricoeur remains committed to notions that ground the just polity in community and mutual sharing without thinking that these notions require us to dispense with the formalism of procedures of justice. While the latter are not sufficient on their own to create or sustain a just society, while, indeed, formal procedures always presuppose some conception of the good, procedural conceptions allow us to recognize each other as subjects of rights. Although it is not always clear that Ricoeur succeeds in reconciling Rawls and Walzer or Habermas and Gadamer, he does provide a fresh perspective on current debates within his own interesting account of the structure of moral action.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Abstract: In the course of the book, no real convergence is achieved; each one ends where he started, asserting his own beliefs, visions, and concerns. Has anything been gained in the process? The intense and occasionally pointed dialogues bring forth an incremental, but substantial clarification of the issues at hand, the issues at stake, and their potential (but not actual) interaction. The fact of the matter is that neuroscience has no privileged bearing on human affairs simply because it deals with the brain. Why push it to realms in which it does not belong?<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: Theories are always, in some way, about their theorists. While Luhmann’s variant of mutant functionalism is not palatable to American tastes, his theories are as reflective of late‐20th‐century European sensibilities as Parsons’s were of mid‐20th‐century America or Bellah and Geertz’s of the upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, some art critics have warmed to Luhmann’s book as an exemplar of one of the newer “cool” theories of art; that is, those that challenge more subject‐centered and humanist theories and aim to accommodate the growth of new mediums such as digital art and cyberspace. But in any conception of art that includes culture, the medium is only as good as the meaning it conveys. And it is the meaning of art that is sorely lacking in Luhmann’s appraisal. Paul Ricoeur once wrote that “materialism is the truth of a world without truth.” It might then be said of Luhmann’s conception of the art system that it is the truth of art without meaning.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”
            Theological Studies47 (1986): 44–45.<br>

Abstract: Scholars and their students interested in the field would do well to begin with these studies, despite some unevenness in period, place, and theme. Developments in the twentieth century, for example, are not well served, especially as their globalization bursts all traditional boundaries in the discipline, making a historical perspective essential to an understanding of ongoing transformations in literate life everywhere, not just in the West. Similarly, the absence of illustrations undermines the potential value of these books as introductions to the history of reading. Much of the work here depends on the material objects that readers actually had; without images of them, the reader develops less of a sense of the field. Finally, the exclusion of the essays on correspondence from the original collection is deeply regrettable; Chartier’s summary of their implications in the introduction hardly does justice to them, especially to the important study of the 1847 postal survey by Dauphin and two other colleagues. The translations are generally accurate, but the indexes are barely adequate.<br>

Abstract: Hence, our choice of philosophies should not be limited to the two main philosophies identified by Budd but rather could take up ideas from process thinking, which is a quieter but nevertheless relevant philosophy to which LIS should attend. By valuing the processes and articulating this with better abstractions more congruent with our action, we not only further our own project; we also sustain a vital engagement with the projects of individuals. We more clearly articulate the library in the life of the user, to use the words of Wiegand [

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Abstract: While this book will be of great interest to Christian ethicists as well as to religious and moral educators, it should also be read by social scientists, philosophers, and evolutionary psychologists. Browning’s view that nontheological disciplines depend on images of the human that play a guiding role for their research, as well as for the interpretation of their results, points to the continued need for more interdisciplinary work. According to this point of view, theology should play a public role in identifying such prescientific or preempirical images as well as in describing and advancing refined and responsible images based on the Christian tradition. The present volume goes a long way in either direction.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

ROSEMARY MITCHELL University of Leeds J. G. A. POCocK. [[END 06A00070]] [[START 06A00080]] Barbarism and Religion: Volume Three, The First Decline and Fall. New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the last hundred pages of Pocock's volume and therefore serves as both a climax to the Pocockian story so far, and a bridge to the next volume. Volume one of Barbarism and Religion situated Gibbon intellectually within a number of different European "Enlightenments"; volume two located him on a different axis, among the various writers of "narratives of civil government" in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. (We are still missing the parallel vector running through ecclesiastical histori- ography, although Eusebius, Augustine, Orosius, and Otto of Freising figure prominently here. Christianity only begins to signal its importance with chapter fifteen of Gibbon; where he used ecclesiastical author- ities, up to that point, it was to document civil rather than sacred history.) Volume three moves in a third, diachronic dimension, tracing the transformations of key themes, in particular the idea of "decline and fall" itself, from very ancient origins up to the Scot Adam Ferguson's Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic (which appeared seven years after Gibbon's first volume and is thus offered for comparison rather than direct influence). The flight of concepts and motifs is dizzying, the lengthy quotations apposite, and as with the previous volumes, one can scarcely miss a sentence without losing a nuance or a parenthetical qualification. The theme of decline and fall, which informs the conception and beginning of Gibbon's book, would eventually yield to "barbarism and reli- gion" as its principal causes in later volumes (along with over-taxation, which Gibbon mentions at the close of chapter fourteen). But behind that idea, which only gradually emerged from Polybian political cycles via medieval notions of the translatio imperii, lay much else, including sequential recognitions of crucial turn- ing points in Roman history going back to Gracchan land reforms in the late second century B.C.E. The core problem, historiographically, remains how to explain why Gibbon, committed from an early stage to a Tacitean narrative, chose to begin his account not with the Julio-Claudians but instead at the "Antonine moment" of imperial zenith achieved by Trajan. (As he once did with cinquecento Florence, Pocock inclines to define major turning points or episodes, both historical and intellectual, in terms of "moments"-a historical Constantinean and historiographical Zosiman moment lie ahead, and the Machiavellian version even puts in a cameo appearance when this volume reaches the early eighteenth century.) Gibbon knew intimately the char- acter of Augustan rule and the flaws of the late republic; he had read his Sallust as well as Tacitus. The later imperial historians, especially Appian of Alexan- dria and Ammianus Marcellinus, also figure in this account as historians of decline, but of a decline that takes a great deal of time-all the way to the "Illyrian" recovery of the late third century-really to become unmistakeable. The subjects confronted by Gibbon's nearly two millennia of predecessors include the military problem of restless troops settling in an empire that has con- quered all its rivals and closed itself off from further expansion; the civic conflict between virtue and cor- ruption (or rather, the way in which virtue leads to military conquest and empire, which in turn produce an oriental softness); the role of the soldiers in making emperors and especially the legions' realization, in the Year of Four Emperors (68/69 C.E.), that emperors could be made "elsewhere than Rome"; the place of the Augustinian-Orosian "two cities" view of history; the vicissitudes in republicanism (an issue revived in the fifteenth century by Leonardi Bruni, who as a non-Roman concerned mainly with Florence was able to see the empire's longue duree for the first time as declinatio rather than translatio and to initiate, though not complete, a gradual transition in historiography from the latter to the former); and the extension of citizenship to the provinces, along, soon, with the capacity of provincials to be proclaimed emperor. All of these streams converge, not entirely satisfactorily AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 470 APRIL 2004 [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede- cessors and, perhaps because it is as much recit as the others were peintures, it is also rather more compelling a read. More than the first two volumes of his work, volume three of Barbarism and Religion leaves one hanging; like Gibbon and his first readers, we are only at the Milvian Bridge, pondering what will follow with Constantine. One hopes that, unlike those readers, we will not have to wait five years for the next episode. DANIEL WOOLF University of Alberta [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00090]] LAWRENCE W. MCBRIDE, editor.

The academic career of one Galway student, H. Fitzwalter Kirker, is traced in its entirety, but only in a footnote. The reader gets at least something approximating a lifeline in the piece by McBride on the young reader and the teaching and learning of Irish history. That "young people are by nature curious" (p. 114), however, seems an inade- quate point on which to hang a conclusion. The book is at its strongest in the essays by Jose Lanters and Gregory Castle, which focus on the work of T. W. Rolleston and Standish O'Grady, respectively. Both historians are examined in the context of their contemporaries; both essays actually attempt to fulfill the claims they make for themselves in their opening pages. The same cannot be said, however, for Eileen Reilly's piece on J. A. Froude. Its bland rehearsal of his life is punctuated with references to his visits to Ireland and quotations from some of his more offen- sive diatribes on the Irish people. She offers little or no comment on the bigotry that billowed forth from his pen. For example, one is told of Froude's dislike for Daniel O'Connell but not the reason why. Novick's piece on the military education of the Irish Volunteers begins with an interesting description, but it is rather disappointing thereafter. Although the material is fascinating, the author's conclusions are not. At one point, he deduces that "The pattern of military education seen in the Irish Volunteer and the Workers' Republic lends weight to the idea of the Rising as blood sacrifice, since the key strategist, Joseph Plunkett, never wrote military columns for the Irish Volunteer" (p. 198). At no point does it occur to Novick that the rebels might not have printed their plans in the paper because letting the authorities in Dublin Castle know in advance was not really part of the plan. How useful, indeed, is an examination of the Irish Volunteer's role in the training of the rebels when even the author concedes that details of training on urban insurrection were "left to the writers of the Workers' Republic" (p. 210); when the author gives approximately nine lines of consideration to what he adjudges to be the more important source? Through- out there is little sense of the eye of Dublin Castle watching over what was published and curtailing what could be written. This is a worthy but a frustrating book. There is a lot of value in each essay in terms of the material that is brought to light, but there is also the crushing weight of the artificial framework under which the essays are forced to labor. Like Froude, it is perhaps this book's "portion in life to please no one faction" (p. 140). ANNE DOLAN Trinity College Dublin [[END 06A00090]] [[START 06A00100]] COLIN NEWBURY. Patrons, Clients, and Empire: Chief- taincy and Over-Rule in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. New York: Oxford University Press. 2003. Pp. xii, 328. $72.00. It is a brave historian nowadays who admits that his or her current academic preoccupations began in the 1950s, but an unrepentant Colin Newbury tells us that imperial history at Oxford University is peculiarly marked by continuity. He says that literary theory has dominated the study of discourse for too long (al- though presumably not at Oxford), and it is time to get back to the study of political discourse using the time-honored model of patron-client relations. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of African and Pacific imperial history, with the addition of material on South and Southeast Asia, Newbury presents a well researched and cogently argued case for the persis- tence of precolonial clientage networks in certain British and French colonies. Patron-client modeling was refined by social scientists in the 1960s and 1970s, when it became a useful way of explaining why inde- pendence had brought relatively little change to the administrative systems of former colonies. That polit- ical and economic relations in some colonies can be analyzed effectively using this theory is clear; whether the exercise speaks to wider debates about empire is another question. The omission of colonies of settle- ment, along with almost all of the Portuguese, Dutch, and German empires, weakens the case considerably. Newbury draws on a wide, although extremely selec- tive, range of secondary literature to supplement his own research, wisely conceding that authors may not like the use he makes of their material. He feels no need to address the epistemological and methodolog- ical concerns raised by authors whose work he mines for empirical detail. He excludes pioneering cross- disciplinary studies, such as Jean and John Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution (1991) and Nicholas Thomas, Colonialism's Culture: Anthropology, Travel and Government (1994), which have done so much to shape current debates in postcolonial anthropology. Newbury calls for more interaction between social scientists and historians, but he does surprisingly little to encourage it. If patron-client brokerage really is the best model, Newbury should be able to tackle other theories with confidence, demonstrating their inade- quacies through constructive engagement. Instead he revives battles won long ago, such as the critique of "collaboration" and "indirect rule" analysis. There are still some historians who work with these terms, but far more interesting is the much larger number of scholars tackling more recent debates. This book's contribution to imperial historiography is therefore difficult to assess. Newbury hopes that it will help to determine whether imperial rule suc- ceeded or failed "in 'preparing' [its colonies] for the exigencies and responsibilities of devolved govern- ment" (p. viii). One wonders whether this is still a pressing question, however. It has been a long time since independence for many of the countries Newbury discusses. Scholars posing broader questions about colonialism's legacy will wonder about the cost of Newbury's ruthlessly exclusive approach.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] I wish to thank the editors of the AHR, first, for inviting me to consider the issues in this essay, second, for the helpful comments of Acting Editor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, and, third, for the quite stimulating commentary of several anonymous reviewers. 1 See Eric Foner, ed., The New American History (Philadelphia, 1990); Foner, ed., The New American History, rev. and expanded edn.

Beard.4 But during the 1970s, the claims being made for a national mind or culture were challenged by social historians. Intellectual history was chastened and transformed by the confrontation with social history. Eschewing their former embrace of synthesis, intellectual historians pulled back to study more precisely defined themes and thinkers.5 Not only intellectual history but other subfields accommodated social history's provocation to rethink conventional gen- eralizations. In addition, a professional, even "social-scientific," concern for precision and specificity of reference collaborated-sometimes with forethought, often not-with a sharpened awareness of difference and conflict that came from social movements outside the academy to undermine older composite narratives. Neither the frame supplied by Charles and Mary Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927), with its dramatic narrative of conflict between the "people" and the "interests," nor the consensual pluralism that succeeded that interpretation in the 1950s survived.6 If the consensus historians underplayed conflict, the Beards' approach, for all of its sympathy for the dispossessed, was found to be inadequate as well. Their narrative revealed little feel for the diversity of Americans, and it paid scant attention to non-whites. Most important of all, while their narrative voice was sympathetic, one did not discover the quotidian life or hear the voices of those groups that have found voice in more recent historiography. Judged by newer historiographical expectations, The Rise of American Civilization seemed "thin," compared with the increasingly popular "thick" description that was built, in part, on the enormously influential anthropological work of Clifford Geertz.7 In the past quarter century, there has been a proliferation of exciting new research, much of it bringing previously overlooked or explicitly excluded groups and events into the light of history. The number and variety of American stories multiplied. Suddenly, there were histories where there had been none or where the available histories had not been attended to by professional historians: histories of African Americans in the era of slavery and beyond; of Native Americans; of workers at home in their communities, at work, and at play; of women at home and outside of the home and of gender relations more generally; of consumption as well as production; of ethnic minorities and "borderlands"; of popular culture and other "marginal" forms of cultural production; of objects and material culture; of whites and whiteness as historical subjects; of non-state international and intercultural relations; and much more.

These developments were occurring at a moment when the number of American historians was expanding to an unprecedented degree. Disciplinary expansion both allowed and prompted increased specialization. And that worried some, who began to speak of hyperspecialization and fragmentation. The structure of specialization derived in large part from the impact of a social history that often fused the group-based particularity of focus with ideological commitments to class and identity-based social movements. This pattern of work discouraged the integration of particular histories into some kind of synthesis.8 Traditionalists, perhaps not surprisingly, were unnerved by these develop- ments.9 But even some proponents of the newer history worried. Early on, Herbert G. Gutman, one of the leading figures in the movement to write a history that included all Americans and that recognized differences-class, ethnic, racial, gender-was concerned that instead of enriching and enlarging the usable history of the United States, the new scholarship was failing to do that, perhaps making it in fact less usable. The "new social history," he wrote in the introduction to his collection of pioneering essays in the field, "suffers from a very limiting overspe- cialization." Take an Irish-born Catholic female textile worker and union organizer in Fall River involved in a disorderly strike in 1875. She might be the subject of nearly a dozen sub-specializations, which would, he feared, "wash out the wholeness that is essential to understanding human behavior."10 Later, in the wake of a national meeting of writers at which historians and history seemed to be largely ignored in discussions of the political and cultural situation in the aftermath of Richard Nixon, Gutman mused aloud in the pages of The Nation over whether the failure of historians to incorporate social history's findings into a new synthesis had seriously diminished, even evacuated, history's possible contribution to public debate."1 In the mid-1980s, in what turned out to be a controversial pair of articles, I raised a related question: how might one construct the (to my mind) needed synthesis of recent historiography on the United States.12 There was considerable negative reaction to those articles, coming from two different positions.

These arguments were equated with a carelessness about scholarly rigor.13 The other, and more widespread position, focused on the risks of a national narrative itself. It was evidently feared that such a narrative would, by definition, re-exclude those groups and themes that had so recently been brought under the umbrella of history and would re-inscribe a "master narrative" dominated by white, elite males.14 By the end of the 1980s, however, the question of synthesis had become less controversial. The issue became more practical, more professional in some sense: how to do it and how to do it within the parameters of inclusion that had been central to the discussion from the beginning. It was on this note that Alice Kessler-Harris, the author of the chapter on social history in The New American History (1990 edition), addressed the question. In the last section of her essay, with the section title of "The Problem of Synthesis," she acknowledged the problem and explored various possible ways to overcome "fragmentation" and move toward synthesis.15 A different issue emerged in the 1990s. Poststructuralist literary and cultural theory, sometimes broadly and even more vaguely characterized as postmodernism, was and is suspicious of any aspiration toward a comprehensive narrative. It is to this body of theory that we owe the commonplace use and misuse of the epithet "master narrative."16 These theories have been rather slow to penetrate workaday historical practice among American historians. Levels and types of awareness of them vary: from shocked indignation at the whole idea, to vague awareness and thoughtless dismissal, to intellectual fascination largely in isolation from the making of one's own histories. In his recent book, Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (1995), Robert Berkhofer seeks to force more attention to these issues. Insistently, but not always consistently, he urges historians to recognize the dimensions of the postmodern crisis that surrounds them. He seems more interested in sounding the alarm about the quicksand before us than in guiding us [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 13 Eric H.

But either way, he intends to challenge the very possibility of narrative synthesis.17 While these worries, proposals, and polemics were being fashioned, the daily work of historians proceeded. Among the products of that work have been a good number of explicitly synthetic volumes. There is, of course, no clear or settled notion of what defines a work of synthesis. I have used a rather generous definition. Some of the books I am calling synthetic might alternatively be designated as monographs-archivally based but exceptionally ambitious books that tackle big questions and seek to frame a large field or to provide an interpretation for an audience well beyond specialists. Others are more obviously synthetic, relying heavily on secondary literature to establish the state of the art in a broad field for a wide audience, including, often, students and the general public. With this diversity of form, purpose, and audience in mind-as well as a concern for a reasonable distribution of fields and periods-I have, with the help of the editors of the American Historical Review, selected a few recent synthetic works for examina- tion.18 The very existence of these books mutes the question of whether we need synthetic works or whether, under the constraints of present historiographical practice, synthesis is possible. In fact, the seeming proliferation of syntheses at present-and their variousness-suggests that the field of American history is at a formative (or reformative) moment that invites synthesis: the quest for new understandings that has undermined established narratives has now, perhaps, prompted new efforts at crystallizing a very unstable body of historical writing into new syntheses. A different question, however, provides the focus of this essay. What strategies for narrative synthesis are available to historians today? How might we think about the relation between a particular structure of narrative synthesis and the author's purpose or interpretation? How do these different strategies relate to current historiography? What particular work do they do, within the profession and beyond it? And finally I want to ask some questions about the firmness of the boundaries (mostly geographical) that define what is and is not captured in synthetic narratives of U.S. history. These works do not, of course, cover the whole field of synthetic works. More and other books could have been chosen, but these eleven books (and several others mentioned along the way) at least represent different kinds of history, different [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 17 Robert F.

Together, the eleven total nearly 6,000 pages of outstanding historical writing. If nothing else, I can conclude that synthetic narrative invites long books. Because I cannot claim special knowledge in any of the fields being synthesized in these books, I do not propose to do the kind of analysis one would find in specialized reviews. Such criticisms that I have will be framed from the position of my interest in synthetic narrative. I say that in part to be honest about my own limitations in appraising these books but also for another, more positive reason. I want to insist that narrative synthesis is a form of knowledge, indeed, a particularly powerful form of creating, not simply summarizing, knowledge. I hope to get past or under the story enough to probe the implications of different modes of structuring a narrative synthesis. The way different narrative strategies construct that knowledge is important. While inclusion is one of the tests our generation will rightly ask of synthesis, there are other important historiographical issues that are embedded in the question of narrative synthesis.19 The more seriously we consider possible narratives of American history, the more we may be prepared to ask questions that press beyond inclusion. We may even be both bold enough and hopeful enough to worry a little about the language of inclusion, if not the principle. Is there perhaps more than a hint of dominant culture noblesse oblige in the language of inclusion? Might not a more sophisticated notion of the temporal and geographical boundaries of American history, including an awareness of the diasporic stories within American history, complicate and enrich the notion of inclusion?20 Can the historical and historiographical terrain be opened a bit more in a way that enables a deeper, denser, and more complex historiographical exploration of justice and difference at the center of American history? Might democracy be the word, the concept, the commitment that will move us in that direction? As I examine the stack of books before me, I propose to keep these issues in mind and to return to them at the end of this essay. JON BUTLER'S Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (2000) covers the whole mainland British colonial space and history, and it addresses a wide range of themes. In fact, themes, not time or chronology, organize his story. His brief, often one-word, chapter titles reveal a very distinctive type of synthesis, one immediately accessible to the reader, whether professional or lay: Peoples, Economy, Politics, Things Material, Things Spiritual. It is a reasonable progression, and in each case he brings together a good deal of material. Although his theme is transformation, Butler also claims (following recent historiography) a more inclusive geography, making more of the middle colonies than would have been the case a generation ago. In some ways, his manner of organizing the material topically bears a relation to [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 19 I do not propose to go into theories of narrative or even my own notions, but I will here indicate that my understanding has been greatly influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative, Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, trans., 3 vols. (Chicago, 1984-88). 20 Such thinking is not restricted to specialists in the profession exploring the theme of diaspora. The novelist Russell Banks has recently argued that the focus for a synthesis of American history ought to be the African diaspora. See "The Star-Spangled Novel," Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2000.

If Hofstadter's book was intended to provide a snapshot that would serve as a starting point, Butler's title ("Becoming America") and his stated intentions announce change as his theme. He means to persuade the reader of a broad pattern of transformation that produced a distinctive and modern society in advance of 1776 and that in turn spawned the first modern revolution. Such an argument demands more complex and careful attention to process and cause than his framing of the book seems to allow. While he has surely gathered together a considerable body of material (his notes run to fifty pages), he has not produced a synthetic narrative of change over time, one that sketches a develop- mental sequence that integrates disparate elements in the interest of a causal interpretation. By bounding each unit of synthesis, Butler is stuck with a structural isolation of topics that undercuts narrative explanation. Given that Butler's theme is transformation, this narrative structure is crippling. For reasons related to structure and style of argument, Butler's claims for American modernity are quite vulnerable. While there are doubtless some specific ways in which the British North American colonies became "modern" before independence, they were not uniformly modern-over space or in all aspects of life. Many historians would readily grant numerous anticipations of modernity by the middle of the eighteenth century, but few would insist, with Butler, that so much modernity had been achieved so soon, implying that only a few pre-modern anomalies remained on the eve of revolution.22 Most give a significant role to the revolution.23 But the most serious problem is not with the phenomena he notices or does not notice, even if there is some real unevenness on this point. Rather, it is Butler's teleology of the modern, combined with his exceedingly loose, elusive, and, as is so often said today, undertheorized definition of modernity. Add to this an unneces- sary but apparently irresistible tendency to claim American uniqueness and "firsts" for nearly everything he identifies as modern in America. He names a number of phenomena that he considers evidences of the modern-polyglot, slaves, cities, market economy, refined crafts and trades, religious pluralism, and "sophisticated politics." Without further historical specification and theoretical precision, one can indulge in reductio ad absurdum. With the exception of religious pluralism, all of these qualities probably described Athens in the age of Aristotle at least as well as the British colonies. In fact, I suspect that Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, relying on their recent book The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (2000), would argue that the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 21 Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (New York, 1971). 22 Jon Butler, Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (Cambridge, Mass., 2000), 1. 23 See, for example, Gordon S. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York, 1992). Long before, Bernard Bailyn suggested certain developments that Butler would consider modern had developed in the eighteenth century, but he emphasized the unevenness and even paradoxical character of this proto-modernity.

In the end, however, it is diversity, which he tends to equate with multiculturalism, that for Butler makes Americans modern. But if we look around, we cannot but wonder about his claims for a uniquely polyglot society. This assertion may be quite vulnerable from any sight line approaching a global perspective. Can he fairly claim that New York City harbored a level of diversity "never before gathered together"?25 Might not this be as plausibly said of Constantinople during the period covered by Butler's book? And did not the Ottoman Empire-of which Constantinople was the capital-far exceed the religious and ethnic diversity of the British colonies? My point here is partly one of fact, of care in making comparative statements without comparison. More important, however, are the criteria of the modern. Few, if any, major political bodies in the past half millennium more successfully accommodated diversity than the Ottomans, yet that achievement has never brought them recognition for a precocious modernity. One needs greater defini- tional and descriptive specificity to make the argument he claims. Because of the breadth and generality of synthetic narratives, it is especially important to be clear about key concepts. Similarly, he tends to claim the realization of "Americanness"-here equated with some vague notion of modernity-for events that, however interesting in themselves, hardly sustain his assertion that they designated "the American future."26 For example, writing of the French Huguenots, a group he knows well, he notes their assimilation, and he calls this "American."27 Well, of course it is, but so are the endogenous marriages that continue for various groups well into the twentieth century-sometimes because of racial difference and even legislation (as in the case of African Americans) or out of choice, as in the case of Scandinavians in the upper Midwest. Or to take a more ominous subject, it seems a bit fatalistic to say that colonial encroachment on Indian land "predicted" nineteenth-century relations with the Indians.28 Oddly, such a claim, while taking the moral high ground, nonetheless erases the postcolonial history of the United States by denying contingency and thus diminishing both the capacity and moral responsibility of all later actors or potential actors. The twin and linked teleologies of "modern" and "American" produce a distorting and de-historicizing synthesis. If there is a problem with the sort of synthesis Butler has written, what precisely is it? He makes historical claims about patterns and meanings of development on the basis of a narrative structure that effectively isolates and de-historicizes his themes. By not constructing a developmental narrative that integrates the various themes now separated in distinct chapters, the process and complexity of develop- ment is obscured.

In the absence of a narrative of change to explain and interpret, he resorts for a theme to repeated assertions of "modernity." The issue is not so much the claim for an eighteenth-century American modernity-although I am myself drawn to much more complex, nuanced, and contradictory discussions of that theme-as it is the incapacity of the particular model of synthesis he deploys to advance that theme or argument. Philip D. Morgan's Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (1998) is at once similar to Butler's and quite different. Both focus tightly in each chapter on a particular topic or theme; there is little play among the different themes in both cases. While Butler's themes propose a reorganization of material, thus giving an impression of freshness, Morgan's quite important questions are phrased in well-established ways. While Butler's structure works against his theme of transformation, Morgan's similar structure better fits his goals for the book, partly because transformation plays a smaller role in his analysis than one might expect. Slave Counterpoint addresses nearly all the issues raised by a half century of vigorous scholarship on the beginnings of slavery, the practices of racial slavery as a labor and social system, and the nature of African-American culture in early America. It is a book of enviable learning: with a seeming total command of the historiography and an impressive knowledge of a substantial archival base, Morgan proceeds to pose (or re-pose) difficult historiographical issues. Again and again, he offers compelling answers. Want to know what scholarship has disclosed about slavery and African-American culture in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and Lowcountry? Look to Morgan's synthesis of a generation of scholarship. To have done that is to have done a great deal, and he has done it magnificently. Yet one gets the sense of a summary volume, a volume driven by the past, by past questions. Synthesis can either cap a phase of scholarship or initiate another. I think Morgan's book falls into the former category, while Ira Berlin's new book, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (1998), which also relies on a generation of scholarship and addresses many of the same issues, has the potential to become a new starting point. Berlin has captured the shift to an Atlantic perspective that has increasingly characterized scholarship by early modern Europeanists, Africanists, Latin Americanists, and historians of British North America. In this sense, his work, at least the early parts that sketch out and populate the Atlantic littoral, points forward.29 In a dramatic opening section, Berlin, relying more on secondary literatures than does Morgan, locates his story in very broad understandings of time (periodization) and space (the Atlantic world), the dimensions of which are shadowy, almost invisible, in Morgan's account. He locates Africans in an Atlantic history connecting four continents and in a rich and growing historiography reaching out from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America.30 One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 29 Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge, Mass., 1998). 30 Berlin's powerful evocation of the Atlantic builds on many predecessors. At minimum, mention should be made of Philip D.

But even if he narrows the story to the territory that later became the United States and loses the multiple histories implied by his portrait of the Atlantic world, the beginnings of stories, whether novels or histories, are heavy with intention and implication that can, I hope, be built upon.31 In fact, the four Atlantic continents remain an always changing aspect of American and African histories. Attending to, or at least recognizing, that larger and continuing extended terrain of American history would enrich the story of the making of African Americans and America, a historiography that is at present too much captured by an implicit and too simple assimilation or "Americanization" model. Nonetheless, Berlin has provided a powerful image of the creation of the Atlantic world and of the origin of modern slavery within it. Morgan has a quite different strategy. His domain is not the Atlantic but the South, or two regions of the South, which he is anxious to reveal as differentiated. Thus his is a comparative history, comparing two regions within the South. Suggesting a certain scientific aspiration, he refers to his delimited space as a kind of laboratory, a site for an "indirect experiment."32 This approach offers him much. He is able to focus tightly on his questions and generally achieves sharply phrased answers. Yet, like any good scientific laboratory, his field of inquiry is almost hermetically sealed. A two-hundred-page part of the book titled "The Black World" begins with a fifteen-page section on "Africans." Yet it is in only one paragraph at the beginning and a few other scattered references that one reads anything about Africa. His story rarely strays east (or south or north or west) of the Maryland/ Virginia and South Carolina boundaries. His comparative method has impressive rigor. Yet one senses that not only does his approach trap him within a particular place, he is also caught within a very confining net woven from the existing historiography. As Walter Johnson pointed out in a review of the book in this journal, his questions are smaller than the stories he has unearthed.33 Much like another important book on African-American history, Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), this book, for all its synthetic aspirations, cannot capture some of its best material within the tightly bounded historiographical questions and issues that frame it.34 As in the case of Berlin's book, Morgan's is quite explicit about time and space. There is a well-thought-out chronology of change, and one of his major arguments is that the South, and thus the black as well as white experience, was not uniform over space. He shows real and important distinctions between the experience of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex (New York, 1990; 2d edn., 1998); and John K.

Yet by treating both the temporal and spatial aspects of the story as sites (and very limited ones) rather than as processes of historical making, he weakens the capacity of his local analyses to explain change over time and, to a lesser extent, space. His major explanatory claims appear in the introduction. They are not only brief but also separate from the rich stories he tells and the analyses he makes of historiographical questions.35 The expansiveness of Many Thousands Gone, by contrast, evokes a strong sense of change, of process. It achieves a narrative synthesis of the movement of Africans onto the Atlantic and into the Western hemisphere. The difference between this approach and the tightly controlled analysis crafted by Morgan is striking. Like Morgan's, Michael Schudson's book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998), is organized around fairly established questions- especially one big question. Has American civic life deteriorated over the course of the past three centuries? Naturally, the question is of a different order than those driving Morgan's analysis. It has not been generated by disciplinary scholarship. It arose out of American public life. Schudson thus draws on history and other disciplines to address directly a public question, one endlessly repeated today and, as he shows, in the past. Schudson himself, we should note, is not a historian. He was trained as a sociologist, and he teaches in a Department of Communication. While he reveals an impressive command of the relevant historiography, historians are not his primary reference group or audience.36 Although I am sure specialists will find some of his formulations to be of considerable historiographical significance and likely to encourage new lines of research, his intention, again, is different: his audience is a general one, and he seeks to bring historical knowledge to bear on a civic issue. What he is doing points toward the most important work that one kind of successful narrative synthesis can do, for the profession and for the public. By openly declaring his address to a public issue and for a public audience, Schudson participates in a very important tradition of historical writing. Some of the very best professional historians of the United States in this century have done precisely that: Frederick Jackson Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Beard, and Richard Hofstadter all focused on issues, worries, or preoccupations of fairly general interest to write synthetic works that importantly rephrased fundamental themes in American history. This mutual enrichment of public and professional discourse is perhaps the ideal cultural work of narrative synthesis. Let us hope that historians can do this more often and more effectively. Yet as I make this point, I realize that all of the historians just named, including Schudson himself, were either trained as social scientists or did not recognize a significant boundary between history and the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 35Morgan, Slave Counterpoint, xv-xxiv. I should note that my concerns about boundary setting in Morgan's book do not apply nearly so much to Philip D. Morgan, "The Black Experience in the British Empire, 1680-1810," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, Vol. 2: The Eighteenth Century, P. J. Marshall, ed. (Oxford, 1998), 465-86. 36 This command is at once impressive and sometimes puzzling. In discussing the Founding and the Constitution, he does not mention Gordon Wood's The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969). Nor, in writing about the first decades of the nineteenth century, does he mention either of two key books by Robert H. Wiebe, The Opening of American Society: From the Adoption of the Constitution to the Eve of Disunion (New York, 1984); and Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy (Chicago, 1995).

Is this a mere coincidence, or is it an issue to be addressed by the profession? While I would not place Schudson's book in the same class as the scholarship produced by the short list of great historians, he has written a fine book. It is a book about change over time, and he establishes three eras of citizenship and participa- tion, each clearly defined. He does not devote much attention to how each configuration changes into the next, but he effectively characterizes their differ- ences, even in some very brief summaries, as in the following paragraph from early in the book: Another way to characterize the past three hundred years of political change is to say that the type of authority by which society is governed shifted from personal authority (gentlemen) to interpersonal authority (parties, coalitions, and majorities), to impersonal authority (science, expertise, legal rights, and information) ... The geographical center of politics has shifted from the countryside to the cities to the suburbs and perhaps, today, to "technoburbs," "postsuburbs," or "edge cities," or whatever we name our newer habitations. Correspondingly, the kind of knowledge a good citizen requires has changed: in an age of gentlemen, the citizen's relatively rare entrances into public discussion or controversy could be guided by his knowledge of social position; in the era of rule by majorities, the citizen's voting could be led by the enthusiasm and rhetoric of parties and their most active partisans; in the era of expertise and bureaucracies, the citizens had increasingly to learn to trust their own canvass of newspapers, interest groups, parties, and other sources of knowledge, only occasionally supported by the immediacy of human contact; and in the emerging age of rights, citizens learn to catalog what entitlements they may have and what forms of victimization they may knowingly or unknowingly have experienced.37 This paragraph reveals the argument and the narrative strategy that Schudson uses to undercut the widespread notion of civic decline: rather than a story of decline, it is one of restructuring, one that recalibrates citizenship and civic practice in relation to changing values and social experiences. What some, including me, see as the erosion of our public life and the thinning of American political culture, he presents as a complex rearticulation of expectations and institutions. Whether one fully agrees with Schudson or not, the book and the point of view it ingeniously argues constitutes an important contribution of contemporary civic life. And a narrative strategy of restructuring (as opposed to the usual rise or fall scenarios) deserves a place in the historian's menu of narrative types. "Presentist" purposes may, however, carry the danger of anachronistic readings. Schudson is vulnerable on this score, especially in his consideration of the colonial period. He too easily asks how democratic any phase of political life was. A commitment to explore the fate of democracy in our past-something I endorse- surely includes recognizing when democracy is not an available concept. He might better have asked how the legitimation and exercise of power worked. Indeed, such a deeper historicism would complement his anti-anti-Whig approach. Similarly, while a then-and-now binary invites sometimes interesting questions and offers some illumination of past and present, it also invites problems. Again, one sees this risk in Schudson's work. False categories of judgment are explicitly or implicitly brought to bear.

Voters then were expected to have "local knowledge-not of laws or principles, but of men."38 The binary obscures the role of principles in the past and knowledge of men in the present. Most important of all, it diverts our attention from the principles that it was thought would aid voters in judging character.39 Sometimes, by focusing so much on the party system that we worry about today, he overlooks those important issues that eluded the parties or that parties avoided. Substantive issues-the reason citizenship and civic life are important-are marginalized in his account of the different concepts and patterns of public life. The result, whether intended or not, is a form of consensus history.40 "Progress or decline is not the real question," Schudson concludes.41 He converts that question into one of restructuring that points to his core argument: there must be a fit between forms of citizenship and forms of everyday life, between values and institutions, between aspirations and commitments. It is that historically informed understanding that allows him in his conclusion to speculate in quite promising ways about an evolving pattern of citizenship that may yet serve our collective hopes and needs. Still, his conclusion leaves me uneasy. Like the journalistic coverage of politics today, the substance of political conflict is subordinated to discussion of the "health" of the system, of the institutions and practices. By contrast, the tensions, conflicts, and substantive issues that made politics so important in the development of the United States and in the lives of individuals are at the center of Eric Foner's The Story of American Freedom (1998). Foner's book has an uncanny resemblance to one that at first glance might seem utterly unrelated: Richard Hofstadter's The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It.42 Of course, Foner inverts the point Hofstadter sought to make. If Hofstadter famously played down conflict and (less remarked upon) paid little attention to the social making of political ideologies, Foner emphasizes conflict and the changing historical construction and reconstruction of the idea and ideology of freedom. Foner's work is much more explicitly sensitive to social history, even if it parallels Hofstadter's in its interest in ideology and the limits and possibilities of American political culture. While Hofstadter was alternately comic and ironic, bitterly so at times, in The American Political Tradition, Foner's Story of American Freedom is strikingly fair and straightforward. Yet the underlying hope is similar. As James Oakes has perceptively noted, Foner's narrative is undergirded by an unstated but firm liberal ideal of freedom- one that at once shares in an Enlightenment universalism and [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 38 Schudson, Good Citizen, 81. 39 See Joyce Appleby, Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans (Cambridge, Mass., 2000). 40 See, for example, his summary judgment of the party system at Schudson, Good Citizen, 132.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 142 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] accommodates current concerns for inclusion and regard for difference.43 I would even argue that Hofstadter's own liberal position was closer to Foner's than one might at first suspect. Both appraised American political culture and its prospects from the position of a richer, more textured liberalism than we usually recognize in current debates.44 In thinking about the core issue in Foner's narrative, therefore, it seems fair to consider it to be the quest for a democratic liberalism, insisting on the relevance and indispensability of the modifier inserted before liberalism. One might thus characterize Foner's as a democratic synthesis, which, as I suggested above, offers a stronger and more egalitarian standard of judgment than commonplace invoca- tions of inclusion. It offers as well the implication of voice and empowerment. To Foner, as he indicates in his introduction, "abstract definitions" of freedom are not the focus. His concern is "with the debates and struggles through which freedom acquires concrete meanings, and how understandings of freedom are shaped by, and in turn help to shape, social movements and political and economic events."45 The result is a narrative that is at once focused yet always open to an examination of larger issues, structures, and events that intersect with and often drive his story. It is a dynamic story, filled with actors, with agents making freedom and using freedom. He selects key events or controversies of different eras, events that are widely contested (slavery, labor and property, the role of the state, social movements). Of course, coverage is selective; the gain is the richness deriving from a series of concentrated focal points. In each case, he examines the conflict, the parties contending, and the stakes. He does not hesitate to declare justices and injustices, to name winners and losers, and he does so from a consistently democratic perspective. Foner thus achieves inclusion without the dilution conse- quent with the faux openness characteristic of talk radio and without the postmod- ern hesitations that undermine moral judgment.46 The American West: A New Interpretive History (2000) by Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher spans the whole of American history, from "the European invasion" until the present.47 The book is written in the spirit of Frederick Jackson Turner. Instead of lamenting the ambiguity of Turner's conception of the frontier, which after Turner got reduced by rigorous historians to a place, the West, Hine and Faragher embrace its fullness.

Interestingly, this work also comes from a Columbia scholar, however much it is openly acknowledged to have derived largely from his experience at the New School for Social Research.

That openness allows them to tell the history of the United States as a story of successive frontiers, including a fascinating rethinking of American regionalism as urban-centered at the end of the twentieth century.48 In fact, the chapter on the postwar era is a tour de force-imaginative, original, and quite compelling. In Turnerian fashion, they argue that "westering defined America's unique heritage."49 To a very impressive degree, they give substance to this claim, but recent historiography makes that claim, even for western history, problematic. As Hine and Faragher show, in the nineteenth century as well as today, the West (and the United States) was formed by migrations from west to east and south to north, and even in a limited way north to south, as well as east to west. The notion of westering is so strong in American and European history and culture, it is difficult to construct an alternative narrative structure, though no less important for the difficulty.50 This worry does not, however, undercut another summary point they make: the "frontier is our common past."51 The book is grounded in social history. Of all the books under consideration here, The American West is probably the most sensitive to the categories of experience and groups previously excluded from mainstream narratives of Ameri- can history. Their work goes well beyond mere representation of such groups and categories; previously invisible groups, whether Native Americans, migrating women, African-American settlers, working people, or the people of the border- lands, are actors who contributed to the shaping of history. But there are limits to this achievement. While there are multiple positions and voices represented in their narrative, only rarely does their narrative bring the reader inside group life. There is not much inquiry into the interior experience and subjective meanings shared by the various groups identified and recognized.52 While the story could have been situated in a wider context, one that revealed the global reach of the empires or, later, the importance of global markets, in its particular geographical focus the book consistently avoids privileging the English line of settlement. Other settler efforts are considered and sometimes compared. As is often the case with synthetic histories, however, there is a tendency to do the work of inclusion at a particular moment, and then lose the group at issue.

At times, the transnational themes they develop are extremely illuminating. They refer to what would later be characterized by theorists of the global cities as a "dual economy" in describing the role of foreign migrants, especially Chinese, in the nineteenth-century California agricultural economy.53 Likewise the interplay of national and international in their discussion of the Zimmerman telegram inviting Mexico to ally with Germany in World War I and in their discussion of San Francisco's "commercial hinterland."54 But, as in the case of Butler's book, there is a bit of parochialism in making claims of distinction. Perhaps such assertions can be demonstrated, but more rigorous definitions and empirical research than we have here are required to establish, for example, that the United States is today the world's most multicultural society.55 How would it compare with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, whose citizens speak more than 100 languages and live on almost numberless islands? The social-history approach, whatever its success in representing difference, has in this instance under-represented national political institutions and policies. The development of the West, as Richard White and other historians of the West have pointed out, was profoundly indebted to what western Republicans now call "big government," for water, transportation, Indian removal, and, more recently, direct investment, as in defense contracts and installations and aerospace industries.56 The political economy and the role of markets, as has already been suggested, do not get the attention they deserve. We often overlook how much industry was in the West, and how much western industries-from milling and meatpacking to mining-were integral to the industrial system of the United States. And we forget how much the astonishing productivity of western agriculture enabled the formation of a large urban industrial labor supply. More of these dimensions of western history might have been included if only in the interest in enabling the story better to tell the national experience. If Hine and Faragher encompass both the full geographical and temporal dimensions of western history, Linda Gordon's microhistory builds out from a very delimited western space, the Sonoran highlands of Arizona, to develop a highly innovative narrative synthesis that locates itself at the various and causally interrelated scales of town, region, nation, and the transnational. Her work reminds us that there is a difference between a mere local study and a microhistory. The local histories of villages, towns, and cities, so common in the 1970s, tended to use global concepts but within artificially bounded fields of inquiry. One of the most famous of them all, Kenneth Lockridge's study of Dedham, Massachusetts, offered an isolated inwardness as a principal finding, although it was a finding that derived [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 53Hine and Faragher, American West, 358-60. 54 Hine and Faragher, American West, 395-97, 414.

Mostly, her account is the story of the arrival and fate of Catholic orphans from New York who were to be placed in Catholic homes. The homes were Mexican as well as Catholic, and that was the problem and the focus of conflict. The conflict played out along class, ethnic, religious, and gender lines, and it eventually reached the Supreme Court. It is a compelling and very human narrative, but one that also addresses a whole range of analytical and interpretive issues of broader interest to historians. Bringing the issues of gender, class, and race into relation with each other allows for an appraisal of their relative importance in this particular historical explanation. I think that her story reveals class to be more important than her conclusion argues, but the real point to be made is that only a narrative synthesis that brings diverse threads together will enable the historian and the reader to make this kind of judgment. These complex ends are achieved in part by her adoption of an imaginative literary strategy. Gordon's book is constructed of two types of chapters. One is quite often a broad frame for local events. In these chapters, her perspective as narrator is exterior to the action. The issues addressed are frequently structural and, as often as not, extend beyond the community. Here, one gets an analytical explanation of the relation of local experience to larger national and international cultural, political, and economic developments. Between these chapters, she has crafted others that get inside the culture of the community, providing wonderfully rich, thick descriptions of daily life and the development of the conflict. With oral histories as well as fragmentary documentary evidence, she brings the reader very close to the experience and voices of the community. The play between these accounts and the more conventional chapters produces an unusual but powerful synthesis. Whether a microhistory qualifies as a synthesis, even by my generous definition, may be debated. But the singular relevance of this book for the discussion of synthesis concerns not scale but its literary ambition, the literary experiment that gives structure to the book. Those who would write other syntheses-at various scales-will, I hope, be encouraged, even inspired, to experiment with novel narrative strategies in the interest of more powerful representations of the past. Quintard Taylor presents a third version of western history, In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990 (1998). He offers a broad synthetic account that characterizes the experiences of African Americans over a very long period of time.

Drawing on a substantial body of scholarship, most of it published in the past quarter century, he aims to "reconstruct the history of African American women and men" in the West over five centuries, although mostly his focus is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Taylor's central themes are the quest for community by blacks and the relative degrees of freedom and opportunity they find in different times and places. The conjuncture of the map of African-American presence and the conventional history of the West that his story brings out compels rethinking of both African-American and western history. He makes the point, for example, that the issue of Texas independence in 1836 was not simply, as myth, even the more recent multicultural version, would have it: Anglos and Tejanos in Texas confronting a despotic government in Mexico. It was also an Anglo effort to preserve slavery.60 More broadly, the map literally reveals that African Americans in the West were overwhelmingly city and town dwellers, and it is that fact that unifies their experience. The kind of synthetic narrative that he has constructed provides an invaluable service at a particular moment, crystallizing a generation of scholarship, making generalization possible. His work not only informs the public of the dimensions of previously unrecognized histories, it also provides a base for the next generation of scholarship. In a similar way, another recent synthesis, one that focuses on a more narrowly defined but also more developed area of scholarship, reveals the harvest of recent scholarship on work and workers. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and Vhite Labor (1998) by Jacqueline Jones at once brings this rich scholarship to a wider audience and proffers a fresh way of framing the field.61 If The American West, In Search of the Racial Frontier, and American Work cover very long chronological spans, books by David M. Kennedy and Fred Anderson address short periods. Their focus is also quite different, since both concentrate on political and military history. Kennedy's Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) addresses what might well be called "high politics," while Anderson's The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 (2000) brings social history and high politics into fruitful play, finding in that interaction the terms of his central argument about the nature of power in the British Empire. At the outset, both books locate their stories in a broad international context. Kennedy's book begins at the close of World War I, and the first character introduced is Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler, who was in a military hospital recovering from a poison gas attack when he heard the news of Germany's surrender.

The geography of Washington, D.C., even that of the White House, and the biographies of three men-Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Hitler-are more important to Kennedy's story than the world beyond the borders of the United States or, for that matter, than the American people of his subtitle. One of Kennedy's aims is evidently to urge upon Americans a greater attention to and sense of responsibility in the larger world, yet with the exception of the excellent discussion of the differing explanations of the economic crisis offered by Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt, there is surprisingly little incorporation of inter- national elements into the dynamic of the story. For all the importance of the larger world, for Kennedy, as for many Americans, whether professional historians or not, the international is a sort of "other," something "over there," if I may reverse the title of one of Kennedy's earlier books.62 Kennedy- also pays little attention to social history, not even to social histories that have sought to better explain the politics of the interwar years.63 Nor does the book address intellectual history, the history of science and technology (except briefly in connection with war production), the states, education, urban history, and much more. In fact, the book would have been more accurately described by the title of William E. Leuchtenburg's classic, F.D.R. and the New Deal, 1932-1940, which is here superseded and extended into the war years.64 So titled, adding the war to the New Deal, one could have no objection to this extraordinarily well-written, deeply researched, and compellingly argued book. But is it a history of "the American people"? Freedom from Fear is a masterful narrative on the terms it has assumed for itself. Yet having said that, historiographical questions remain. Kennedy apparently assumes that three voices are the important ones; not many other voices are heard, even though each of a small clutch of additional figures is presented very effectively as a full human being: Lorena Hickok, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Raymond Moley, Herbert Hoover, John L. Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph, among a few others. History for Kennedy, unlike for the other authors of these syntheses, is made by select leaders, not by ordinary people. What is remarkable, therefore, is the illusion of synthesis that is achieved. The book was published in a series that promises narrative syntheses of the defining periods of American national history. Most so far published accept traditional definitions of periods, and they are framed as political history, but none is so severely restricted as this one, which won the Pulitzer Prize in part because it was recognized as a work of grand synthesis. Dramatic changes in the historiography of the American field make it seem anachronistic. Yet its success makes the point that political history in the grand [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 62 David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (New York, 1980).

Fred Anderson's Crucible of War again engages us with the question of elites and ordinary people, and it provides -a promising approach. While Kennedy seems quite confident of the importance of a few leaders, Anderson seems to be ambivalent, and that ambivalence enriches his history. Although I think the principal contribution of Crucible of War to our understanding of the British Empire is grounded in the social history of the political and military experience of ordinary Americans, the dramatic focus, as with Francis Parkman's great nineteenth-century narrative, is on two great leaders of the French and Indian War, the marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe.65 Yet, as Alan Taylor has insightfully insisted, Anderson has rewritten the story of their confrontation in a way that diminishes these actors, especially Wolfe.66 To be sure, Anderson's book goes beyond Parkman in its respect for Native Americans, their agency, and their role in the empire (and the role of the empire and war for them). He also modifies Parkman on a point that is central to the book's contribution to imperial history: unlike Parkman, Anderson not only notices but makes much of the division between English colonials and English metropolitans. These differences in expectation and experience make the war in his view a "theatre of intercultural interaction."67 Like Butler, Anderson seeks to diminish the role of 1776 in understanding the development of what became the United States. Historians, he argues, will better understand the creation of the United States by closely examining the Seven Years' War and, more generally, by challenging the usual tendency to "take as our point of reference the thirteen rebelling colonies, not the empire as a whole."68 Yet, even as he argues the importance of getting behind the Revolution of 1776 so that one can discover the eighteenth century as it was experienced, the revolution remains a touchstone for him. More than anything else, he wants the reader to recognize that the shots fired in the Seven Years' War were the ones with implications around the world. But he keeps de-historicizing his story to use it to diminish the shot of lesser implication (in his view) heard 'round the world in 1775. When one begins the book, there is a sense of excitement. Here is a history of the United States ready to take the globe as its context. Before the narrative even begins, the reader is presented with a portfolio of maps. Only two of eight describe the British colonies; no more than four of them consider North America at all. The portfolio begins with a world map, revealing the global distribution of the battles that marked the Seven Years' War. There are also maps of the Indian subcontinent, Central Europe, and the Caribbean. The introduction promises a book that will make the world, or at least the full extent of the British Empire, its context and subject. We are told that "if viewed from Montreal or Vincennes, St. Augustine, Havana, Paris or Madrid-or, for that matter Calcutta or Berlin-the Seven Years' War was far more significant than the War of American Independence."69 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 65 Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 6th edn., 2 vols.

We get very little of Asia (although Manila makes a brief but important comparative appearance), the Caribbean, Africa, and continental Europe. Of course, other European powers are part of the narrative, but they only have walk-on roles. We learn little of them at home or about the ways leaders or ordinary citizens interpret events, while we are, by contrast, led through elaborate accounts of high British politics. The preface, presumably written last, sketches an extraordinary agenda for what would be a stunning book. Unfortunately, Anderson did not write the book he there described. Still, judged in terms of what it did rather than what it proposed to do, it is an outstanding work of craft. It will no doubt be our generation's account of the Seven Years' War. As military history, it is superb, and it contributes importantly-but not so grandly as some of the opening rhetoric promises-to the non-controversial but still unclear issue of the causal relations that connect the Seven Years' War to the coming of the revolution. Anderson in fact offers a rich Anglo-centric narrative that explores and explains the different meaning of the war both as strategic event and as experience for the British of the metropole and in the colonies. It is written with verve and confidence-and a seemingly complete command of the materials, primary and secondary. One of its themes is the misperception of events by political elites; with the exception of William Pitt, surely Anderson's hero in this story, they fail to understand the different meaning of the war and empire for ordinary soldiers and colonial subjects. He thus makes cultural issues the heart of the book. Military and political elites play a dramatic role in the narrative, but causation for Anderson- and here he points to important newer developments in military and diplomatic history-is to be found in the culture of everyday life.70 In making this point, he not only offers an important interpretation of the war (building in part on his previous book on Massachusetts soldiers), he also reveals the empire to be less solid, more a matter of continuous negotiation, than historians often consider such entities, whether empires or nations or states.71 MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN ANDERSON, Ira Berlin, referring to the earliest history of Afro-European North America, and Daniel T. Rodgers, addressing the early twentieth century, incorporate the Atlantic, or at least the North Atlantic, into their narratives of American history. Berlin and Rodgers write very different kinds of history and focus on different periods. Berlin's is a social history, while Rodgers has written an intellectual history, or, perhaps, a history of political culture. Yet both Berlin and Rodgers recognize the complex webs that route movements-of people, of ideas, of money, of things-in the Atlantic world. The transnational terrains that Berlin and Rodgers evoke establish larger and truer frames for national histories than do notions of bounded and self-contained regions or nations. The first section of Berlin's Many Thousands Gone, a portrait of the Atlantic littoral, describes a world framed by cities and the sea, little divided by national [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 70 Anderson, Crucible of War, 453-54. 71 See Fred Anderson, A Peoples' Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the Seven Years' War (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1984).

Berlin's opening tableau describes the emergence of the Atlantic world as an ever- expanding historical terrain, where the African presence is pervasive on the sea and in the cities, including Lisbon, where they made up 10 percent of the population in the sixteenth century. He evokes a world defined by a network of cosmopolitan cities populated by creolized peoples. African people were not only omnipresent, they were often crucial cultural and economic brokers, helping to knit this new world together. Berlin lets go of this powerful frame and image in his later chapters, where he narrows the focus to regional difference within the bounds of British North America. Still, the book's protean beginning remains in the reader's mind, inviting others to realize its narrative logic and moral meaning.72 In Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998), Daniel T. Rodgers also achieves a richer historicism by expanding the space of analysis. One small indication is in the subtitle. He refers to "social politics," not the more usual "welfare state." His approach, examining relations in space as well as over time as fields of contingency, makes the welfare state a problematic common term. When he uses the more general and more mobile term "social politics," he effectively historicizes the concept, lineage, and practice of the welfare state. The development of a social politics has other possible paths and outcomes besides evolution into the national welfare state.73 The national welfare state thus becomes a historically and place-specific invention rather than a universal or, worse, the teleological endpoint of American liberal narratives-an endpoint surely upended by the politics of the last quarter of the twentieth century. Following the pioneering work of James T. Kloppenberg, who also assumed a Euro-American context for progressivism and social democracy, Rodgers ap- proaches this age of reform as at once a transnational and national issue.74 A variety of reforms-from urban planning to social insurance to regulation of capitalism- are examined as products both of general, transnational ideas and of particular, national political cultures. The complex narratives thus developed by Rodgers and Kloppenberg-ones that recognize, especially in the case of Rodgers, the historicity of the balance between national and transnational-are a major advance in the narrative synthesis of a national history. Both Rodgers and Kloppenberg impress on the reader that ideas could cross the Atlantic in either direction. This is salutary; American intellectual history is too often thought by Europeans and Americans as well to be either insignificant or derivative, not quite up to equal participation in an international world of ideas. This common point is handled differently in each book. While Kloppenberg notes [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 72 One hopes this extension of the historiographical terrain will continue and that connections as well as comparisons will be made between the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic and between the Atlantic slave trade and the slave trade that turned to the east, to the Muslim empires of the Mediterranean and today's Middle East. Big as it is, the Atlantic does not capture the logic and dimensions of slavery in this era. 73 See, for example, the argument (somewhat dependent on Rodgers's work) in Thomas Bender, "Cities, Intellectuals, and Citizenship in the United States: The 1890s and 1990s," Citizenship Studies 3 (1999): 203-20. 74 Daniel T. Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (Cambridge, Mass., 1998); James T. Kloppenberg, Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870-1920 (New York, 1986).

Rodgers, by contrast, focuses on the specific transit of ideas and emphasizes the way intellectuals and reformers on either side of the Atlantic drew selectively on these ideas, depending on personal taste and local circumstance. The result is a fundamental and valuable reorientation of the way we might understand intellectual history. The conceptual opening they have created invites a yet more radical under- standing of the territory and movement of ideas. Let me go back to the title of Rodgers's book. I think that "Atlantic Crossings" projects too narrow an under- standing of the implications of the book. It emphasizes the movement of people and ideas back and forth across the Atlantic. To that extent, it recalls a much older Anglo-American historiography of "trans-Atlantic influences."75 Rodgers goes well beyond this historiography in showing that, in important respects, Europe was partly Americanized and the United States was partly Europeanized by the phenomena he describes. But his really important accomplishment is to get away from the "influence" model, to displace the linear A to B notion of intellectual history. But he could have gone farther yet. There is more to the circulation of ideas than this framing recognizes. It is more than an Atlantic crossing, more than a link between Western Europe and the United States. The whole Atlantic, South Atlantic as well as North Atlantic, and, indeed, increasingly, parts of the Pacific world better describe the extent of the intellectual network his book evokes. In regard to urban development and reform, an important theme in Rodgers's book, it is clear that there is a global conversation at work. Rather than the linearity of steamship crossings (the dustjacket illustration) between the port cities of Western Europe and New York, I imagine a Great Bazaar of urban ideas, technology, and aesthetics hovering over the Atlantic, with many traders and buyers. This exchange is not, of course, symmetrical, and that itself is an issue, but participation was nearly global in 1900. Progressive ideas, especially those dealing with urban reform and technologies, traveled through many circuits and with different voltage, but nearly the whole world was connected, not only Western Europe and the United States. Simply look at the cities of Eastern Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, Central and East Asia. Surely, they were part of an international conception of urbanism-and of urban commercial culture. The remnants of the era make it clear that New York and Chicago, no less than Lyons, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Shanghai, were local instances of a global process of city-making. THESE LAST COMMENTS SUGGEST what I take to be the next challenge of narrative synthesis. But before I conclude, let me briefly review what has been accomplished by the cohort of synthetic histories considered here. These books reveal, even verify, the capacity of narrative synthesis to achieve inclusion and to respect issues of identity. Moreover, it seems possible in synthetic narratives to combine structure [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 75 See Frank Thistlethwaite, The Anglo-American Connection in the Early Nineteenth Century (Philadelphia, 1959). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 152 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] and agency and to consider causal explanation without sacrificing the explication of subjective meaning-and vice versa. The volumes here examined reveal many narrative strategies and quite different relations to a wider reading public. There is no single model, and no one volume (yet) does all the things we might fairly expect in a realized synthesis. In addition, these books, both in what they do and do not do, suggest to me the value of embracing a narrative core that is a more explicit and deeper exploration of democracy and difference, freedom and empowerment, contest and justice. Such a focus promises a sharper analytical history, one more historical and less susceptible to teleology, whether of modernity or anything else. It seems plausible to propose that a wider canvas, a supranational context, may in fact enhance the examination of these issues. The work of Hine and Faragher, Berlin, Gordon, and Rodgers in particular enables one to imagine an even more radical synthesis of national history, one that operates on multiple geographical scales, from narratives smaller than the nation to supra-national ones-thus identifying the nation as a product of history as well as an object of historical inquiry. Such a framing of national history will increase awareness of the complexity of the multiple axes of historical interaction, causation, and identity formation. While I mean these concluding comments to suggest an ambitious new agenda for the discipline, we must not overlook an already existing and compelling example. Decades ago, David Brion Davis embarked on a multivolume history that considered all these issues. He brought them together in his majestic synthesis that explores slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world, a history of nearly global reach that is also-and I emphasize this fact-a history of the United States.76 My point, then, is that such histories can be written, have been written, and I trust that more will yet be written. The present moment seems especially propitious for such histories. The relation of the nation to both subnational and transnational solidarities is very much in question. It is a public concern as well as an object of interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry. Historians surely have an open invitation to rethink the boundaries of national histories.77 Colonial historians have been moving in this direction for some time, redefining their field as the Atlantic world long before the globalization talk. Likewise, Rodgers and Ian Tyrrell, both of whom work on the modern period, moved in this direction fairly early and for a different reason: their concern about the claims of American exceptionalism.78 With these various concerns at work, we may fairly expect a movement of American historians and other historians as well toward a wider sense of their fields. National histories will not be so firmly bounded, and the assumption of their national autarky will be softened by the recognition that national histories are [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 76 David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966); The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (Ithaca, 1975), with the final installment yet to come. 77 See Bender, Rethinking American History in a Global Age; and Thomas Bender, The La Pietra Report (Bloomington, Ind., 2000), also available on the World Wide Web at www.oah.org/activities/ lapietra/index.html. 78 Ian Tyrrell, "American Exceptionalism in an Age of International History," AHR 96 (October 1991): 1031-55; Daniel T.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M. Larson, "'Capacities and Modes of Thinking': Intellectual Engagements and Subaltern Hegemony in the Early History of Malagasy Christianity," AHR 102 (October 1997): 969-1002; Richard Elphick and Rodney Davenport, eds., Christianity in South Africa: A Political, Social, and Cultural History (Berkeley, Calif., 1997); and many other works discussed in David Chidester, Judy Tobler, and Darrel Wratten, Christianity in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography (Westport, Conn., 1997). The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86. Those influenced by the Comaroffs in this respect include David Chidester, Savage Systems: Colonialism and Comparative Religion in Southern Africa (Charlottesville, Va., 1996); Leon de Kock, Civilising Barbarians: Missionary Narrative and African Textual Response in Nineteenth-Century South Africa (Johannesburg, 1996); Doug Stuart, "'Of Savages and Heroes': Discourses of Race, Nation and Gender in the Evangelical Missions to Southern Africa in the Early Nineteenth Century" (PhD dissertation, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London, 1994).

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 443 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne does not fail to capture some aspects of social and political reality. This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76. On Tswana views of the firearms frontier, see Robert Moffat to Richard Miles, Lattakoo [Kuruman], December 5, 1827, in Isaac Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman: Being the Journals and Letters of Robert and Mary Moffat, 1820-1828 (London, 1951), 274. Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another. On Cape influence, see also Johannes du Bruyn, "James Read en die Thlaping, 1816-1820," Historia 35 (1990). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 445 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elboume eventually came to be known), some of whom acted as patrons of the early LMS mission to the Tswana. The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people."

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman.

Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work. Taylor is of course a Christian Hegelian, whose view of the emergence of the modern self is certainly influenced by Hegelian dialectics, in however inexplicit a fashion.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Abstract: This second, more normative dimension of Mrozik’s project opens up some challenging questions. If it is the case, as she suggests, that a sympathetic reading of the
   Compendium of Trainingcan provide valuable intellectual resources for contemporary ethical reflection, it remains unclear to me how our engagement with this text should proceed, given the significant disparities in cosmological assumptions (e.g., karmic causation and rebirth) and forms of practice that separate Mrozik’s contemporary readers from the text’s original audience. The text, moreover, appears less concerned with advancing particular truth claims than with creating a distinctive kind of religious subjectivity through ascetic and ritualized practice. Can we assess the value of the text’s ethical ideals apart from the forms of discipline and practice with which they were linked in medieval India? IfVirtuous Bodiesleaves such questions open to further exploration and analysis, its nuanced reading of theCompendium of Trainingbrings into sharper focus the centrality of human embodiment in South Asian Buddhist religious discourses and encourages us to reflect deeply on its implications for our own ethical inquiry.<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: Franke’s book has considerable merit, but I have a theoretical and a practical concern with his appropriation of negative theology. First, negative theology is never entirely negative, and while Franke recognizes that poetic language is both deconstructive and open, he nevertheless insists that our various theologies—literary or religious—finally have no positive content. Perhaps this is the postmodernism in his negative theology because this is not entirely consistent with the theological tradition. A good counterexample is Pseudo‐Dionysius, whose mystical theology seeks finally to overcome the limitations of both positive and negative speaking. Dionysius insists that God is love in a way that is both negative and positive. On this, Franke should consider the work of Jean‐Luc Marion and especially his response to Jacques Derrida on the subject of negative theology, and this omission is a considerable oversight. Second, many people of various faiths will never accept that their understanding of the transcendent has no positive content, and if this is a precondition for dialogue, then it is unlikely to occur. On this, the practical dimension of Franke’s study needs more development, as well as more traditional examples of poetic and theological openness from contemporary religious life.<br>

Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Bowman Sharon<br>
Abstract: In sum, this is one of the most important books on selves or the practical side of personhood in the last decade. It is also well written; the particular arguments are virtually always clear, and it is not too hard to keep track of their role within in the larger argument of the book. Some portions rise to an almost literary style and provide a rich survey of key ideas in twentieth-century French philosophy, while others engage quite originally with scholarship in moral psychology and theories of self-knowledge that will be more familiar to analytic readers. This work also complements the more detailed ethical theory on Larmore’s other books. Despite its relative inattention to volitional aspects of practical identity, and some questionable moves in the critique of authenticity, then, this work is still highly recommended.<br>

Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
Abstract: The Captivity of Innocencesuccessfully concludes an innovative study of primeval myth in J’s Genesis. Its argument about exilic authorship serves as a springboard for a free and erudite exploration of biblical concerns with name, exile, and the paradoxes of divine-human relations. Very few biblical scholars today can compass this range of biblical, literary, and philosophical literature with such finesse. At a time when biblical studies incorporate a wider range of methods than ever, LaCocque, like Roland Barthes (whom he cites), powerfully combines traditional and more contemporary intellectual paradigms. Advanced students and scholars will find inThe Captivity of Innocencea far-reaching and engaging reading of Genesis 11 by a virtuoso of biblical studies.<br>

Abstract: The cultural and social sciences are welcome to examine and critique theology and Christian practice, and theology can profitably learn from these studies, but the studies themselves are not theology. To be theology, even in an interdisciplinary sense, the work must become constructive and speak to the
   religiousthought and practice of specific communities or faith traditions. In any given community, theology can become a displaced language in need of renewal, but theology can also uncover the displaced or implicit religion within the seemingly secular. To do this well, theology must remain in critical tension with the cultural sciences, including literature. The result may well be deconstructive, but such radical critique is necessary for any living tradition.<br>

Abstract: In sum: while it has it flaws, this book is one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date surveys of the field of theories of religion around. It is worth the cover price for that alone, which makes it definitely recommendable. Those who want to learn about the current state of theory, especially if they tend in the realist direction, will find this book very useful. Constructivists acquainted with theory will likely find it less so.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: Critchley uses the term in a discussion of Levinas and politics. Noting that government tends to become tyrannical when left to itself, Critchley commends the way Levinas’s ethical ideas can cultivate forms of “dissensual emancipatory praxis” that “work against the consensual idyll of the state, not in order to do away with the state or consensus, but to bring about its endless betterment” (“Five Problems in Levinas’s View of Politics,” 183).<br>

Author(s): Mooij J. J. A.<br>
Abstract: Closely related to the philosophical problem of consciousness of time was the question of the meaning of time and duration in psychology and in literature. Although Mooij mentions William James's notion of “specious present” in passing, he fails to explicate James's perception of time, which attempted to provide an empiricist account of our temporal concepts through the influence of John Locke (p. 197). Apart from this caveat, the book's strength lies in its perceptiveness and breadth of interpretation of the history of the concept of time. Mooij's accuracy in comprehending and in transmitting the essence of such difficult and complicated philosophies is remarkable.<br>

Author(s): Gutterman David S.<br>
Abstract: Ultimately it is at times unclear what is gained in making these comparisons or if such analysis “enhances our understanding of the relationship between religious narratives and politics” (p. 92). What precisely is revealed in grouping these movements together, other than that political crisis invites prophetic criticism? Gutterman carefully unpacks the readings of shared Biblical texts, and he skillfully details contextual and interpretative differences. But one wishes he had gone beyond these descriptive endeavors to construct a more nuanced account of the relationship between religion and politics and, more importantly, of the specifically religious grounds of the activism he examines. While Gutterman can be theoretically deft—in exploring the relation between narrative and politics (p. 21) or garden/wilderness metaphors (p. 47)—he is not fully engaged with the literature on political religion, often citing unrepresentative figures like William Connolly or Stephen Carter. He is a sharp writer with an eye for interesting problems and material. I applaud his engagement with important issues and also the ambition of his thinking. But his central categories require further explication, and this book speaks to the need for more conversations across disciplines.<br>

Abstract: AbstractThis paper isolates movement as a topic for analysis in Roman imperial history. Movement is regarded under three aspects: translation (of texts, practices, ideas), migration (of officials, merchants, students, etc.), and communication (i.e. the movement of written documents). Interrelationships among the three aspects of movement are identified and discussed, as are the shared impact of translation, migration, and communication on issues of cultural and social identity and political negotiation and control. The article argues that movement changes the role of the state as well as relations between individual and states, augments the use of writing in society, transforms identities, and gives impulse to internal and external regulations. The implications of movement are understood as both pragmatic and formal, altering relations to space and time and influencing ways of organizing and thinking. The author surveys current work in the field and identifies potential areas for future research. The paper draws heavily on both literary and documentary sources and discusses material from the late republic through late antiquity, paying particular attention to continuities and discontinuities between early and later periods of the Roman empire.<br>

Abstract: At the heart of this essay is the suggestion that variation can be understood as a vital mode of Mozart's musical thinking, an impulse evident not merely in movements labeled "theme and variation," but in his output as a whole. Accordingly, I begin by sketching a more general theoretical context for the interaction of this variation impulse with the more teleological formal dynamics of sonata.<br>

Author(s): Abbott Don Paul<br>
Abstract: AbstractBeginning with Roland Barthes' “The Old Rhetoric: an aide-mémoire” (1964–65), semioticians have shown a remarkable interest in the history of rhetoric. Writers like Barthes, Tzevtan Todorov, Gérard Genette, and Paul Ricoeur have offered accounts of rhetoric's past that invariably concluded with rhetoric's demise and its replacement with semiotics. These writers typically portray rhetoric's history as one of a brief rise followed by a very long decline, a pattern, says Todorov, of “splendor and misery.” This essay examines the semioticians' predictions of rhetoric's demise as well as semiotics' attempt to claim elements of rhetoric as its own. The essay concludes by considering the present state of semiotics' aspiration to supersede rhetoric as a theory of language and human affairs.<br>

Author(s): Thompson Jim<br>
Abstract: In the formation and composition of what might be termed personal identity a key but often neglected aspect is ideal identity. While comprising aspirations rather than realities, it makes a major contribution to the definition of self-identity. It does this as a result of: (a) clarifying what kind of person the individual wishes to be; and (b) an interrogation of how she sets about achieving her ideal identity, intimating what kind of person she is at a particular moment by virtue of the way in which she strives to achieve her ideal. The article argues for a re-appraisal of the notion of ideals in education and for its reinstatement as a significant feature of education. Indeed, we argue, children cannot avoid ideals--they are presented to them everyday from a wide variety of sources. But these sources or the ideals that they promote are not necessarily good for the child's well-being or for her fellow citizens. Consequently, teachers as moral agents have an important role in assisting children to acquire ideals that do meet such a criterion of goodness in addition to helping them reflect critically on the range of ideals they may encounter in their communities and society.<br>

Abstract: The introduction of entrepreneurial education (EE) in the Israeli education system is discussed in this article as an example of the introduction of new curriculum. We argue that this introduction should be construed as a consequence of major ideological changes in Israel and its education system, a change from collectivist to individualistic values. We open with an analysis of a Ministry of Education publication that introduces the EE program and find that it is loaded with references to Zionist myths. We suggest that relying on references to these myths in promoting EE reflects a need to disguise the discontinuity between the social values behind the new curriculum and the traditional collectivist values of pioneering Zionism. We note that the Israeli programs exercise EE in groups, whereby the responsibility for the new ventures is shared by the group members. We suggest that adopting the group method indicates a compromise between a completely individualistic and competitive approach to entrepreneurship and a collectivist approach to coping with new tasks-which is more in line with traditional Zionist values. We argue that the change of atmosphere from collectivism to individualism is a result of demographic and economic processes that have occurred since the establishment of the Israeli state, and that these processes may be exposed through observing the Israeli youth movements and the public discourse. We believe that the gradual shift from collectivism to individualism is a central factor in explaining the timing of EE's introduction in Israel.<br>

Abstract: This paper follows two purposes: the first to unpack some of the artistic cargo of symbols as distinct from the more conventional aspects of them (e. g., their ability to refer to other things or events, and their ability to communicate ideas), and the second to show, by means of contrasts, the actual workings of Interpretation Theory as it could be applied to the analysis of art-making and art-viewing. For the first purpose, the author draws material from philosophy, dramatic writings, linguistic theory, and statements of artists in an analytic search for the often intractable character of the artistic image. For the second purpose, the author demonstrates, through the use of logic and the poetic metaphor, how a particular form of hermeneutic inquiry can be applied to assist an understanding of the assumptions upon which research is often built.<br>

Abstract: Recent literature on Heidegger concentrates heavily on his (temporary) involvement in or collusion with Nazi ideology and policies. Without belittling the gravity of the issue, this article shifts the focus somewhat by invoking a distinction which recently has emerged (or reemerged) in political thought: namely, the distinction between "politics" and "the political" or between politics viewed as partisan ideology or policy making, on the one hand, and politics seen as regime or paradigmatic framework, on the other. The main thesis of the article is that Heidegger's promising contributions to political theory are located on the level of ontology or paradigmatic framework rather than that of ideological partisanship. While not neglecting the dismal intrusions of the latter plane, the article probes Heideggerian cues for a "rethinking of the political" by placing the accent on four topical areas: first, the status of the subject or individual as political agent; second, the character of the political community, that is, of the polity or (in modern terms) the "state"; thirdly, the issue of cultural and political development or modernization; and finally, the problem of an emerging cosmopolis or world order beyond the confines of Western culture. In discussing these topics, an effort is made to disentangle Heidegger from possible misinterpretations and to indicate how, in each area, his thought pointed in the direction of an "overcoming" of Western political metaphysics.<br>

Abstract: Economics is privileged in contemporary government policy such that all human transactions are seen as economic forms of exchange. Education has been discursively restructured according to the logic of the market, with education policy being increasingly colonised by economic policy imperatives. This paper explores some of the consequences of this reframing which draws upon metaphors from industrial and business domains. This paper examines a significant dimension of teaching that currently has marginal presence in official discourse: social contingency. We argue that social contingency is characterised by a variety of distinctive features that include unpredictability, relationality and ethical demands. The significance of social contingency is highlighted by a comparison with industrial production, which is organisationally contingent, and craft production, which is characterised as materially contingent. We argue that the different nature of contingency in these domains makes them inappropriate as metaphors for teaching. We explore the nature of social contingency and some of the practical and ethical consequences of the failure to articulate this in official discourse. Its absence in such discourse is illustrated by consideration of competence statements in the Initial Teacher Education context. We argue that the neglect of social contingency is founded on assumptions of teacher sovereignty that are both philosophically and ethically unsustainable.<br>

Abstract: This study of organised political violence in north-central Nicaragua from 1926 to 1934 focuses on the infamous Conservative gang leader Anastacio Hernandez and on Sandino's rebels. The contexts of a weak central state and local-regional caudillismo are outlined. It is shown that after the 1926-27 civil war. Hernandez and others produced ritualised spectacular violence in the service of their Chamorrista caudillo patrons. The language, practices, and characteristics of organised violence are examined. It is argued that Sandino's rebels appropriated these tools of political struggle, and that changes and continuities in the organisation of violence in Nicaraguan history merit greater attention.<br>

Abstract: Notre analyse repose sur deux hypothèses générales complémentaires. La première hypothèse affirme l'existence non pas d'une crise de la pensée politique mais de trois situations critiques auxquelles doit faire face le pensée politique et qui déterminent des formes d'incertitude spécifiques, irréductibles les unes aux autres. La deuxième hypothèse affirme que l'intelligibilité des crises que connaît la pensée politique passe par celle des conditions politiques dans lesquelles s'exerce cette pensée. Pour préciser ces deux hypothèses nous faisons appel à un modèle construit à partir de la structure d'une action. Trois formes d'incertitude sont ainsi repérées: une incertitude concernant les valeurs, une incertitude concernant l'état des choses et une incertitude portant sur les voies d'action. Transposées sur le plan ou la dimension de la structure sociale, ces trois formes d'incertitude sont à saisir et à examiner respectivement comme crise au niveau du système de légitimation et de motivation, comme crise au niveau du système organisationnel ou des institutions et comme crise au niveau des stratégies ou système "opérationnel". Nous localisons la première forme de crise dans les sociétés du capitalisme "central", la deuxième dans les formations sociales socialistes et la troisième dans les sociétés du capitalisme "périphérique". A partir d'une analyse des conditions politiques qui ont rendu possible l'émergence de ces formes spécifiques de crise nous essayons de déterminer au moins certaines conditions nécessaires--mais non pas suffisantes--de leur dépassement. /// Two general complementary hypotheses underlie this analysis. The first contends that, although political science does not confront a crisis, it faces three critical challenges giving rise to uncertainty in the discipline. The second hypothesis asserts that to understand the present challenges testing political theory, it is necessary to relate the latter to the prevailing political context. To clarify the two hypotheses a model is presented, growing out of the structure of action. Three forms of uncertainty are thus identified, relating respectively to values, the state of affairs, and the means of action. These three uncertainties, seen in terms of social structure, are to be understood and examined in turn, in terms, respectively, of questions of legitimization and motivation, at the level of institutional and organizational arrangements, or with respect to strategy and "operational" systems. The first are identified in societies under a "central" capitalism, the second with socialist social organization, and the third with "peripheral" capitalism. On the basis of an analysis of political conditions which have facilitated the emergence of these specific forms of challenges, an effort is made to determine conditions which are necessary--but not sufficient--for these challenges to be dealt with.<br>

Abstract: This paper concerns the problem of how to give historical explanations of scientist's decisions to prefer one theory over another. It is argued that such explanations ought to contain only statements about the beliefs and preferences of the agents involved, and, in particular, ought not to include evaluative premises about the theories themselves. It is argued that Lakatos's attempt to build into such historical explanations premises of an evaluative kind is deficient. The arguments of Laudan to the effect that such explanations depend crucially upon evaluative assumptions about the rationality or irrationality of decisions are examined. It is argued that they do not establish the need for such assumptions. Similar criticisms are then shown to be applicable to a version of the 'hermeneutical' model of explanation for human actions.<br>

Abstract: Using the methods of hermeneutic phenomenology, and against the background of the principle that the real is what is or can be given in a public way in perception as a state of the World, and of the thesis established elsewhere that acts of perception are always epistemic, contextual, and hermeneutical, the writer proposes that objects of scientific observation are perceptual objects, states of the World described by theoretical scientific terms and, therefore, real. This thesis of Hermeneutical Realism is proved by showing how the response of a standard instrument is 'read' as if it were a 'text'. Conclusions are then drawn about a number of topics, including Scientific Realism, Conventionalism, and Cultural Relativism.<br>

Abstract: Rwanda became a Belgian trusteeship under mandate of the Société des Nations after the first World War. With churches playing a prominent role in the political evolution of Rwanda, the two countries were closely bound together. After the 1959 revolution in Rwanda and independence in 1962, development cooperation with strong NGO input still linked them. While the genocide still has tragic influence on the new Rwanda, Belgium has undergone a political process leading to a federal state. The colonial past refers to a national past. Changes in Rwanda and Belgium question any collective attempt of mourning for a past that is very different for all parties involved. /// Le Rwanda devint une possession de la Belgique sous le mandat de la Société des Nations après la Première Guerre Mondiale. La conséquence du rôle proéminent des églises dans l'évolution politique du Rwanda fut la création de liens étroits entre les deux pays. Après la révolution de 1959 au Rwanda et l'indépendance en 1962, la coopération de développement avec l'impact des ONG ont maintenu ces liens entre les deux pays. Alors que le génocide a aujourd'hui toujours des conséquences sur le Rwanda moderne, la Belgique a, elle, a vécu une transformation politique menant à la formation d'un état fédéral. Le passé colonial se mire dans le passé national. Les transformations du Rwanda et de la Belgique mettent en question toute tentative collective de faire l'expérience du deuil d'un passé commun, vécu de manière très différente par les deux cultures.<br>

Abstract: It has recently been claimed (1) that mental states such as beliefs are theoretical entities and (2) that they are therefore, in principle, subject to theoretical elimination if intentional psychology were to be supplanted by a psychology not employing mentalistic notions. Debate over these two issues is seriously hampered by the fact that the key terms 'theoretical' and 'belief' are ambiguous. This article argues that there is only one sense of 'theoretical' that is of use to the eliminativist, and in this sense some kinds of "belief" (dispositional states, infra-conscious states and the Freudian unconscious) are indeed "theoretical" and hence possible candidates for elimination, while others (consciously occurring thoughts like judgements and perceptual Gestalten) are not theoretical and hence not candidates for elimination.<br>

Abstract: This article seeks to explore the act of reading as an essential element of notated musical practices and of the construction of knowledge about them. By examining how musical notations affect their reader-performers (and vice versa) in two different musical contexts in Japan--the Kyoto Gion festival and amateur lessons on the nohkan flute--the article draws attention to the ways in which the act of reading notation is central to the construction of knowledge about such musical practices. With reference to Etienne Wenger's notion of learning as a process of alignment, and to debates in the anthropology of reading, it then argues that, for learners of these musics, reading notations is a practice of reverse tracing towards the bodily practices of the accomplished. In discussing the musicians' concern for the efficacy of reading as a means of achieving a relevant state of understanding, the article also addresses questions on the role of reading as a method of becoming knowledgeable in the practice of anthropological inquiry.<br>

Abstract: The ways in which values are assimilated to social research differ according to the theoretical frame of reference informing the research. An example from the writings of E. Digby Baltzell illustrates how a moral commitment shaped his assumptions about the nature of the social matrix and his research strategies. A Western moral rhetoric fares well if the researcher chooses a methodologically individualist framework. The framework assists a moral rhetoric by providing it with concrete rather than abstract social actors and with a basis for explanation in terms of motive rather than situational forces. Along the way moral statements can appear in the form of empirical generalizations and historical laws. Should sociologists deem ethically neutral social research desirable, this study suggests that concentration on scientific method, without exploring the value bases for selecting a frame of reference, is not a promising approach. A value analysis, especially around Weber's "value relevance," may function propaedeuticly.<br>

Abstract: In the 1950s and 1960s Freudian theory was deemed to be a vital part of the sociological tradition, but since then it has fallen from favor, largely because of the simplifications and misinterpretations both by Freud's sociological critics and by his supporters. Chief among such misunderstandings is the tendency to view Freud's social theory as a variant of that of Hobbes, in which a selfish and asocial human nature is made social through the imposition of external constraints; these constraints, as Durkheim stated, eventually are "internalized" into the personalities of social beings. Against such a claim this paper argues that Freud's views differ profoundly from those of Hobbes and that the myth of the Hobbesian Freud has so distorted Freud's most fundamental concepts that their social theoretical significance has been largely obscured.<br>

Abstract: Euro-American theories of psychotherapeutic intervention focus on therapist behavior or the therapeutic relationship, conceived in dyadic terms. The cultural prototype is individualistic and rationalistic: a one-to-one conversation in which the patient discloses and discusses innermost feelings in regular office visits. This may be appropriate for modern Euro-Americans. However, anthropological research finds that in many traditional healing systems, intervention is communal, it utilizes dramatic ritual ordeals and altered states of consciousness rather than rational conversations, and the healer-patient relationship may be less central. This article argues that the latter approach is not ignorant of psychotherapeutic principles; it has its own (however opposed to Euro-American assumptions they may be). Understanding this paradigm clash broadens our understanding of what psychotherapeutic intervention is. It also allows clinicians and policy makers to support traditional peoples in their own efforts at self-healing. Examples will be drawn from the author's work on the healing ceremonies of the Native American Church among contemporary Navajos.<br>

Abstract: L'AERES dialogue avec certains organismes de recherche pour tenir compte de leurs missions
spécifiques dans le système d'évaluation. Mais cette démarche ne semble pas, au moins pour le moment,
devoir être formalisée ou étendue. Ce dialogue est facilité par le nombre restreint des organismes et c'est
évidemment plus difficile de le mener avec les quelque deux cents autres établissements d'enseignement
supérieur que l'agence doit auditer. Mais on peut imaginer quelques options entre lesquelles les établisse-
ments auraient à choisir. Et ceux qui souhaiteraient une évaluation encore plus spécifique pourraient être
amenés à en assumer une partie du coût.<br>

Abstract: Chile's collective memory has been brutalized by state-implemented terrorism. This historical process has resulted in, among other things, a "torn collective memory." The history and memory of the period of so-called popular power (1970-1973) continue to be largely unknown. Oral history allows us to begin a slow process of historical reconstruction as well as to reflect on the construction of militant memories.<br>

Abstract: This article reviews some new international releases in the field of discourse analysis in the tradition of Michel FOUCAULT. This kind of Foucauldian discourse analysis is related to other forms in the wider interdisciplinary field of discourse analysis. Nonetheless, it can be demonstrated that the Foucauldian form of discourse analysis is the most relevant one for contemporary analysis in the social sciences. It is argued that in the German social sciences the term "discourse analysis" is primarily used for theoretical social research or is used for empirical social research, without disclosing discourse-analytic methodology. Since the 1990s, the development of empirical methodologies for social discourse analysis in Germany has intensified. From it's beginning in the late 1960s, French methodology of discourse analysis has been empirically orientated. Here, the work of Michel PÊCHEUX is the central influence in which the epistemology of discourse analysis is thoroughly discussed and theorized. In France, PÊCHEUX continued the work of Michel FOUCAULT and, since then, one can speak of a Foucauldian tradition of discourse analysis, namely "French Discourse Analysis" (FDA). This review outlines the state-of- the-art of the transformation of Foucauldian discourse theory into a discourse-analytic methodology as a new kind of qualitative social research. For this reason, the influence and the analytic tools of linguistics are critically reviewed and a comparison of FDA in France and Foucauldian discourse analysis in Germany is undertaken. The first book reviewed is a British monograph from Glyn WILLIAMS that describes the development of French discourse analysis in the context of structuralism and post-structuralism. The book contains a thorough update of French discourse analysis and is path breaking for German readers of the discourse-analytic work of Michel PÊCHEUX. The volume comes on the heels of a new German handbook of social discourse analysis (edited by KELLER; HIRSELAND, SCHNEIDER & VIEHÖVER) that continues the thread with additional articles on theory and methodology, mostly in the field of (German) Foucauldian discourse analysis. This handbook presents a collection of articles by the most influential researchers in this field and it can be regarded as representing the state-of-the-art in the German field of discourse analysis. Next, a selection of several articles related to discourse theory from an interdisciplinary conference is reviewed. The content of these papers is mainly the social theory of discourse, not discourse analytic methodology. Following this, a new and clearly written French dictionary, edited by CHARAUDEAU and MAINGUENEAU, is reviewed. It is not only the first dictionary of the French vocabulary (mainly) of FDA, but also very useful for German social research on discourse. Finally, the latest release in this field is a new and very instructive introduction to the field of social research on discourse from KELLER. This book will be very useful not only for beginners—it contains a systematic overview of the research field and discusses strategies for further discourse-analytic research.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur distills this point well: "When we discover that there are
several cultures instead of just one and consequently at the time when we acknowledge
the end of a sort of cultural monopoly, be it illusory or real, we are threatened with the
destruction of our own discovery. Suddenly it becomes possible that there are just
others, that we ourselves are an 'other' among others" (History and Truth [Evanston,
Ill., 1965], p. 278).

Abstract: There exist around the notion of the public three different yet overlapping dichotomies posed on different levels of analysis: public (sphere) versus private (sphere), public versus mass, and publicness versus privacy/secrecy. Habermas's book ([1962]1989) incorporates all the three sets of dichotomy without resolving the contradictory meanings and bridging the gaps among them. As a result, his conception of the public sphere becomes paradoxical in terms, and it undertheorizes the cultural property of publicness. This article proposes an alternative conception of the public that may encompass the structural, institutional, and cultural levels of theorization in a more precise and coherent way. It is argued that the public is an imagined category about citizen membership that is attached to both institutions of state and civil society. In political practices, a symbolic "public" is institutionalized through an open communicative space where it is called upon, constructed, and contested as the central source of cultural references. In this connection, a notion of public credibility is introduced as an attempt to bring forth a richer and more dynamic conception about the role of culture in democratic struggles than that of critical rationality by Habermas.<br>

Abstract: This article draws on ethnographic examples to examine how rural Maya-speakers in the Mexican state of Yucatán ground the experience of identity politics in quotidian engagements with pre-Hispanic objects and utterances in the Maya language. My argument is intended as a revision of models of critical scholarship that have been influenced by poststructuralism and that place an overwhelming emphasis on discourse as a modality through which politically viable identities are created and performed. Specific examples show how vernacular multiculturalism is shaped by the agency of forms of language use and physical objects that have been a part of local life-worlds long before the popularization of Mayan identity politics. This offers some potentials for collaborative work that have not been fully explored in poststructural critiques of representation. L'auteur s'appuie sur des exemples ethnographiques pour étudier la manière dont les locuteurs du maya vivant dans les zones rurales de l'état mexicain du Yucatán fondent leur expérience de la politique identitaire sur une interaction quotidienne avec les objets et énoncés préhispaniques de la langue maya. Son argumentation se veut une remise en cause des modèles universitaires critiques influencés par le poststructuralisme, qui mettent lourdement l'accent sur le discours en tant que modalité permettant de créer et de réaliser des identités politiquement viables. Des exemples concrets montrent comme un multiculturalisme vernaculaire se constitue par l'action des formes d'usage du langage et des objets matériels qui faisaient partie de la vie locale longtemps avant que la politique identitaire maya se popularise. Cette approche offre un potentiel de travail en collaboration qui n'a pas été complètement exploré par les critiques poststructuralistes de la représentation.<br>

Abstract: Building on 25 months of fieldwork in eastern Germany from 1991 to 2003, this article explores the interpenetration of aesthetics and politics, and questions them as theoretical categories. A multilayered description depicts aesthetic perception and action, guided by an imagery of façade, as constituted and reproduced by state policies, positioned experiences, and subversive responses. Moving beyond the Cold War legacy, aesthetics' potency and politicization is dated back to early nation building and Protestant and Romantic influences. Being essential to and controlled by shifting, largely authoritarian regimes, aesthetics simultaneously provided a 'shadow life' and a 'lingua franca', cross-cutting verbal and non-verbal mediums and everyday and high culture, as people juggled with, distrusted, and decoded surfaces, expressing and in search of deeper, hidden truths. I argue that historically generated aesthetic perceptions and praxis not only mark east German political culture but also emerge in Habermas's public sphere theory and, moreover, offer arguments to revise it.<br>

Abstract: This article proposes using the theoretical discussions of Deleuze and Guattari as a means of comprehending the various ways in which individuals speak about their ethnic identity. This is done through a case study of a state-run educational boarding school offered to subjects identified as 'ethnic' in Israel. The findings expose two ways of talking about ethnic identity: 'minor language' and 'major language'. What I term the 'major language of ethnicity' makes substantial use of state language and offers two hierarchical categories that serve as an archetype for classifying groups. The 'minor language of ethnicity', on the other hand, offers multiple local identifications and potential identity alternatives. The article suggests using dynamics at the foundation of these concepts to consider the position of the researcher and to expose existential 'lines of flight' and life inventions of subjects in everyday life.<br>

Abstract: Controlling for insecurities depends on a capacity to make inferences on the basis of experiences about the past, yet the use of knowledge about the past for anticipating and predicting future threats is highly problematic. This article examines the problem of governing individuals on the basis of what is available about their past deeds and social networks in governmental and commercial archives. It highlights the tension between administrative and private narratives about individuals, the former being constructed on the basis of minute details collected and stored about individuals since birth, and the latter referring to the accounts individuals offer of themselves. By applying the notions of ipse and idem identity developed by Paul Ricoeur, the article examines the two-way flow between memory and identity and the consequent concern that administrative narratives are blind to the ethical renewal of individuals, to the capacity of Man to extricate himself from the shackles of his past. To prepare the ground, the article considers some inherent limitations of biopolitics, pointing out that although biopolitics was classically concerned to govern both individual bodies and the body politic, administrative and governmental limitations have led states to govern the "average citizen" rather than individuals in their "individuality."<br>

Abstract: This commentary reflects on the first official visit made by a British monarch to Ireland since its independence. Focusing on three key moments of Queen Elizabeth's itinerary — the Garden of Remembrance, the Irish National War Memorial, Islandbridge, and the state banquet, Dublin Castle — I suggest that efforts to simultaneously honour rebels/soldiers in acts of public remembrance sought to re-position the past between these two islands in ways which recognised conflict but also aspired towards reconciled understandings of how that past could be more peacefully calibrated.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in confusing motives with causes; irrationalism, which advocates a "liberté d'indifférence", basing itself on the same premise as rationalism, and confusing motives with causes, is wrong in seeing the negation of the very existence of motives as the one way of saving human freedom. Both views disregard the fact that human action is impossible and cannot be understood without motives and that this, in turn, does not mean a determination of man in a mechanical way, for motives are not a part of nature but rather an organic element in a specific human situation—voluntary action. Human freedom is the freedom peculiar to a finite being immersed in time. Both those who stress passivity and receptivity and those who stress the dynamic creating ability of the self are wrong; both those who thought that freedom is possible only on the basis of clear and distinct motives and that action is nothing but the end of deliberation (St. Thomas) and those who thought that freedom is possible only by an irrational emergence of the vital ego (Bergson) or by negating the existence of any previous determination of the self (Sartre) are mistaken. A true human decision is composed of two elements; given motives and values on the one hand, and non-intellectualist spontaneous choice on the other. Duality is peculiar to human action. This is made more explicit in dealing with the more fundamental involuntary elements; character, sub-consciousness and life. Man acts freely from a finite and determined point of view; he acts in a clear and transparent way on the basis of confused and amorphous data; he lives his freedom when thrown into life. Necessity is inherent in man; it is one of his modes of being. There is no "inner freedom" on the one hand and "objective" causal necessity on the other. This conception of human action as both activity and passivity is reminiscent of Merleau-Ponty's statement in his "Philosophie du perception": "Le monde est déjá constitué, mais aussi jamais complètement constitué.... Il n'y a donc jamais déterminisme et jamais choix absolu, jamais je ne suis chose et jamais conscience nue". There is no dilemna between determinism and irrationalism, just as there is none between extended substance and thinking substance; there is dialogue.<br>

Abstract: "La dérive d'une vie," that of the hero in En rade, is metaphorized by the dérive of narrative, composed of a complex network of metaphors. In 1893, Paul Souriau proposed that metaphor makes a fleeting representation pass into the unconscious. Dreams and hysteria, states in which the unconscious holds sway, are of considerable importance in this text. An analysis of the way that metaphor works will shed light on the relationships between dream and reality, and between consciousness and the unconscious in general. The double fil of extended metaphor is also metaphorized as a bifurcating road, the road of narrative and the labyrinthine path the hero's thoughts take. In fact, route or chemin is not only a metaphor for the text and for extended metaphor itself, but also for the complex pathways of the nerves and brain. If the road or path of narrative is also a representation of nerves/brain, then retracing these pathways of metaphors would be a way of following the text's attempt to dissect the brain and uncover the links between dream and reality, the double sphere of activity that characterizes this novel.<br>

Abstract: In this article I suggest ways in which rhetorical analysis can complement sociological analysis of early Christianity. On the basis of a universally acknowledged saying of Jesus ("blessed are you poor"), I suggest that those who use social scientific perspectives need to clarify more accurately the levels of data from which they are working (i.e., when they are working with probably early material, possibly the words of Jesus himself, and when they are working with the later elaboration of the traditional material) and to identify the rhetorical value of each level. I then show how, contrary to sociological analysis that depicts Jesus as merely proclaiming reversal, the historical Jesus proclaimed a reversal that had already happened but one that was away from God's intended order: what the historical Jesus was calling for was a future restoration to a state that existed before the reversal. Attention to the rhetorical nature of his follower's use of this proclamation, however, shows that when the author of the Gospel of Luke and the Lukan Acts of the Apostles uses the language of reversal and restoration, he now does so to describe what was happening not primarily vis-à-vis "the world" but in their own, now Christian communities Jesus' message of reversal of the fate of the poor becomes in this way the Lukan message of the apostolic governance of that reversal, that is, the broker's (the apostolic leadership's, after the model of Jesus) dispensation of the patron's (God's) resources.<br>

Abstract: CONTEMPORARY HUMANITARIAN CRISES UNDERSCORE WHAT HANNAH Arendt called the "perplexities" of human rights; the very category "refugee" attests the failure of the global rights regime. Indeed, the "abstract nakedness of being nothing but human" belies the "right to have rights." In light of this criticism, I offer a reconstructive, communitarian interpretation of the rights of the forcibly displaced. The grammar of rights, I argue, presumes the communicative virtues of respect and recognition of the "concrete other." I conclude by showing how biblical narrative "re-inscribes" stateless persons/strangers precisely as neighbor (Lev. 19:18, 33—34) in "anamnestic solidarity."<br>

Abstract: THIS ESSAY EXAMINES THE RELEVANCE FOR RELIGIOUS ETHICS OF BUDDHIST Abhidhamma texts, those dealing with the analysis and systematization of mental states arising in and examined by meditation practice. Developing recent scholarship on the prevalence and significance of interlocking lists in Buddhist canonical texts and commentaries, the Buddhist use of lists in the Abhidhamma constitutes a kind of narrative expression of moral development through the sequential occurrence of carefully defined mental states. Attention to this narrative dimension of the moral life, while related to other recent proposals about the place of narrative in religious ethics, offers a way to employ this underexamined genre of religious literature (lists) drawn from a comparative context (Buddhist and Christian ethics), in service of a more nuanced account of moral development.<br>

Abstract: This article critically revisits the Foucauldian perspective on modernity by exploring the constitutive importance of limits of transparency in relations of power and knowledge. It differentiates between Foucault's Panopticon as a model for modernity, which posits a total visibility of subject under modern gaze, and what I call cybernetic ways of knowing that posit the 'black box' of the inner self that is blocked from visibility. The case in point is a comparative study of two anthropologies — two groups of anthropological cadres — the American anthropologists who in the 1940s were involved in emerging Soviet studies, and Soviet anthropologists of the 1920s and 1930s who took part in Soviet reforms. The article draws attention to similarities in their perspective of images and notions of the enemy: the 'enemy of the people' within Soviet society and the Soviet society as the West's Cold War enemy. In doing so, the aim of this article is to develop an ethnographic perspective on state socialism that does not depend on a foundational dualist distinction between 'Soviet' and 'Western' or 'socialist' and 'capitalist' modernity as a starting point.<br>

Abstract: »Die räumlichen und zeitlichen Schichten der Globalgeschichte: Überlegungen zu einer globalen Begriffsgeschichte anhand der Ausweitung von Reinhart Kosellecks Zeitschichten in globale Räume«. Recent debates on global history have challenged the understanding of history beyond the nation-state. Simultaneously, they search for non-Eurocentric approaches. This has repercussions on the relation between historical space and time in both historical interpretation and in research design. This article reflects on the possibilities of a global conceptual history by expanding Reinhart Koselleck's theory of temporal layers (Zeitschichten) into global spaces. To this end, it introduces the notion of spatial layers (Raumschichten). First, historicisation and its relation to and interaction with spatialisation and temporalisation is pondered; then, the impact of global spatial and temporal complexities on comparative and conceptual history is considered, before, thirdly, a framework of three tensions of global history - normative, temporal and spatial - is introduced as a way to concretely unfold historical research questions through global conceptual history. Regarding time and space, the main lines of argument in global history have focused either on the question of whether or not European powers were ahead of non-European ones or on the supposedly Western linearity of time as opposed to a non-Western cosmology or circularity of time. Taking its point of departure in Zeitschichten, which break from the linear-vs.-circular logic, this article instead proposes to foreground an actor-based, multi-lingual, global conceptual history to better understand spatio-temporal practices.<br>

Abstract: History is not neutral. It is rendered ideological by the very act of being conveyed in a narrative form, for language is both the purveyor of meaning and the principle locus of ideology. This paper explores the idea of history as discourse, and its deployment in the cultural-symbolic construction of the Singapore nation. To this end, I have chosen to analyse a key moment for Singapore history, the years 1963-65, when Singapore was first merged with the nation of Malaysia, and then separated from it. The way that these events are described in official histories is used by the government of Singapore to justify its policy of multiracialism, which also serves as a legitimating device confirming the state in its political and ideological hegemony. I have examined the events through analysis of local newspapers, The Straits Times and Berita Harían, to see in what ways their reporting may have helped to mould popular understandings of what was happening.<br>

Abstract: This paper, a reply to Professor R. S. Downie's criticisms of our paper 'A Political Critique of Kantian Ethics in Social Work', both appearing in BJSW 19, 6, tries to answer the main charge against us of illegitimately bridging the logical gap between statements of value and statements of fact. In addition to this, we explicate further our original arguments that language and power are indissolubly bound to each other, and that a Kantian approach to social work theory and practice fails in trying to dissolve that relationship by finding a neutral, universal ground from which to derive ethical principles and judgements.<br>

Abstract: In the world of Korean shamanism, there is a particular god, called taegam, which is allegedly famous for its love of money and its abundance of greed for material wealth. During the shamanic ritual of chaesu-kut, the rites for good fortune and luck, this god is popularly worshipped as the Deity of Wealth and is typically symbolized by money placed all over its face and spirit costumes. Nonetheless, as money has the two sides of heads and tails, taegam also has two very different faces—so-taegam and taegam. This article explores the ambiguity of the two taegam gods, focusing on the symbolic action of money-offerings and how its meaning is taken from the perspective of the ritual actors, in the hope of shedding light on the place of Korea's traditional popular religion of shamanism in today's transformed urban landscape. By discussing the semantics of "money is the filial child" (a remark made by so-taegam) and "money is the enemy" (as remarked by taegam), statements I often heard during my fieldwork in Seoul, I suggest that the ambivalent symbolic nature of taegam should be seen as an indispensible vehicle for understanding ritual life, as well as everyday life, of urban Korean people since it is closely related to both normative orientations and the contradictory aspects of the material culture of contemporary urbanites inhabiting the borderless, globalized, and fluctuating modern capitalist market. This conclusion is reached partly with reference to existing sociological theories of money and anthropological inquiries into the ambivalent aspects of taegam.<br>

Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object here. It contributes to the matter of the article and its interpretation is interwoven with the theoretical substance. The story is shown to be an integrated narrative abounding in sophisticated linguistic techniques which show a delight in language. The traditional Christian and Western interpretation of Babel – as an affront to God which results in the curse of multilingualism – is challenged. A re-constructed interpretation informed by intertextual evidence reads the fault of Babel to be the people's refusal to spread through the earth. Babel can be interpreted as a manifesto against the monolingual and monocultural impetus of empires ancient and contemporary. The multilingual outcome is a positive affirmation of sociocultural and linguistic diversity.<br>

Abstract: J'ai remarqué que, dans les congrès, qu'ils soient médicaux, juridiques ou «psy », il est
fréquent d'entendre l'orateur parler du «père biologique», voire de vrai père pour désigner le
donneur de sperme... puis, se rendant compte de son lapsus au vu de quelques sourires dans la
salle, tâche de se rattraper - mal, comme dans toutes les gaffes - parlant alors de « père social »
pour désigner le vrai père, ce qui constitue tout autant un lapsus que le premier...<br>

Abstract: Daß die Verstiegenheiten und Mißbräuche, welche die Scholiasten der Spätantike seit
der Kaiserzeit mit der Etymologie getrieben haben, aller ernsten Grundlagen entbehrten
und reine Fabrikation ebenso mittelmäßiger wie phantasievoller Wichtigtuer darstellten,
die sich „Philologen" und „Grammatiker" nannten und noch bis in die byzantinische Epoche
hinein fortwirkten, ist allgemein bekannt (s. zum Beispiel die vielfachen Entlarvungen dieses
durch die Jahrhunderte mitgeschleppten Ballastes von Pseudogelehrsamkeit bei W. G. Ruther-
ford, A Chapter in the History of Annotation, Being Scholia Aristophanica, Bd. III, London
1905, S. 392 etc). Daß die ebenso irrationalen und vielleicht noch geschmackloseren ety-
mologischen Spekulationen, die man im 20. Jahrhundert auf die Wortgruppe έρμηνεία, έρμη-
νεύειν, ερμηνευτικός anwendete und immer noch anwendet, im gängigen akademischen Lehr-
betrieb heute ernst genommen werden und sich professoraler Autorität erfreuen, ist nicht
nur ein bildungsgeschichtliches curiosum, sondern ein Zeugnis irrationaler Aushöhlung der
„geisteswissenschaftlichen" Fakultäten. Als Beispiel seien nur erwähnt Karl Kerényi, Her-
meneia und Hermeneutike, Ursprung und Sinn der Hermeneutik in ders., Griechische Grundbegriffe,
Fragen und Antworten aus der heutigen Situation, Zürich 1964, 42-52, und F. K. Mayr, Der
Gott Hermes und die Hermeneutik in Tijdschrift voor Filosofie, 30, 1968, 525-635. Wie der Autor
des zuletzt genannten Artikels selbst, auf Heideggers Formulierung zurückgreifend, sagt,
ist das „Spiel des Denkens verbindlicher als die Strenge der Wissenschaft"... Wohin eine
im Banne Heideggers stehende „Begriffsgeschichte" führt, kann man bei der Lektüre dieses
Schwalls besser „verstehen"... Wie wenig Tragweite die immer wieder angeführte (Techné)
hermeneutike in der Epinomis 975 c hat, sagt der Text selbst: bei der Kunst Orakel zu inter-
pretieren, die weder Seelengröße noch Weisheit hervorbringt, weiß der „Interpret" nur,
was er sagt, ob es jedoch wahr ist, hat er nicht gelernt (τό λεγόμενον γάρ οίδεν μόνον, εΐ
δ' αληθές, ούχ έμαθεν). Übrigens kommt das Wort έρμηνευτική in den pseudo-platonischen
Definitiones in seiner sonst gebräuchlichen Bedeutung vor, 414 d 4: "Ονομα διάλεκτος άσιλιθετος
έρμηνεντική τοϋ τε κατά τής ουσίας κατηγορουμένου και παντός του μή καθ' έαντοϋ λεγομένου.
(Nomen, zuzusammengesetzte Ausdrucksweise für etwas seinem Wesen entsprechend
Bezeichnetes, sowie auch für alles von diesem Ausgesagtes). — Pierre Chantraine, Dictionnaire
Etymologique de la Langue Grecque, Histoire des Mots, Paris, 1970, S. 373, sagt ausdrücklich,
„Terme technique sans étymologid'. Vgl. auch F. Solmsen, Ein dorisches Komödienstück in Rheinisches
Museum für Philologie NF 63, 1908, 329-340. (dort s. 336 f über den ionischen Ursprung
der Worte έρμηνεΰσα, έρμηνεύς).<br>

Abstract: Public administration is inherently an interdisciplinary field, prominently incorporating theory and methods from economics, political science, and sociology. Less obviously, however, MPA curricula include historical treatments of particular policy arenas, institutions, the administrative state, and the professions of policy analyst and public management. In addition, the case method that figures prominently in MPA pedagogy and the research MPA students perform depend on doing history. Yet, history as a scholarly endeavor is rarely included in basic courses, much less instruction in research methods. This essay explores the use of history in MPA curricula and how MPA students might acquire a deeper appreciation of history and how historians ply their craft.<br>

Abstract: Having a voice, either at the level of the individual or the community, has been one of the atavistic ways of defining or asserting humanity. This allows for the inscription of the twin-capped hegemony of successes or victories and frustrations at both the private locus and the public sphere. The disruptions of this possibility by rifts between natives in pre-colonial South Africa were aggravated in the heat of the colonial suppression it suffered, and was compounded by the operation of apartheid rule. By reason of this misrule, voices were suppressed, with a few cacophonies of dissention breaking forth. The culmination of these disenchantments into the demise of apartheid significantly presaged the need for reconstruction and redefinition of citizenship and cohabitation, and hence the necessity for establishing a public sphere, or put alternatively, a public domain in the form of the Archbishop Desmond Tutu's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This paper, therefore, seeks to interrogate the dramatic world(s) created using the material properties of the TRC in John Kani's Nothing but the Truth and Zakes Mda's The Bells of Amersfoort. The paper argues that the domination and manipulation of this public realm by the state at the expense of the individual is not only counterproductive, but constitutes a denial of the relevance of such spheres. The paper, going by indices in the plays, therefore, concludes that every individual should not only be: given a voice, and be heard, but be allowed equal unbiased participation. Otherwise, the public sphere would not just be impotent, but the idea of nation-building and desirable citizenship would be a mere ruse. Avoir une voix, que ce soit au niveau individuel ou communautaire, a été l'un des moyens ataviques de définition et d'affirmation de l'humanité. Cela tient compte de l'inscription de l'hégémonie à double face des succés ou victoires et des frustrations tant au niveau de l'espace privé que de la sphère publique. Les parturbations de cette possibilité par des clivages entre les autochtones en Afrique du Sud précoloniale ont empiré sous le feu de la répression coloniale que ce pays a subie et ont été aggravées par le régime d'apartheid. En raison de cette mauvaise administration, des voix ont été réprimées, avec quelques cacophonies de dissension. Le paroxysme de ces désenchantements vers la fin de l'apartheid présageait significativement la nécessité de la reconstruction et la redéfinition de la citoyenneté et de la cohabitation, et donc la nécessité d'établir une sphère publique, ou sinon établir un domaine public, sous la forme de la Commission vérité et réconciliation de l'archevêque Desmond Tutu. Cet article vise donc à examiner le (s) monde (s) dramatique (s) créé (s) à l'aide des propriétés matérielles du TRC dans Nothing but the Truth de John Kani et The Bells of Amersfoort de Zakes Mda. L'article soutient que la domination et la manipulation de ce domaine public par l'État au détriment de l'individu n'est pas seulement nuisible, mais constitue un rejet de la pertinence de telles sphères. Cet article, en parcourant les indexes de ces pièces, conclut donc que tout individu doit non seulement avoir une voix et être entendu, mais aussi jouir de son droit à une participation égale impartiale. Sinon, la sphère publique ne serait impuissante et l'idée de construction de la nation et de la citoyenneté souhaitable ne serait rien d'autre qu'un simple stratagème.<br>

Abstract: Evoquant l'habitude, Ricœur constate qu'elle donne une histoire au
caractère : « une histoire dans laquelle la sédimentation tend à recouvrir et, à la
limite, à abolir l'innovation qui l'a précédée [...]. C'est cette sédimentation qui
confère au caractère la sorte de permanence dans le temps que j'interprète ici
comme recouvrement de Y ipse par l'idem ». In Soi-même comme un autre,
Paris, Seuil, 1990, p. 146.
L'ipseque Philippe Corcuff synthétise comme « la part subjective de l'identité
personnelle » (« Figures de l'individualité, de Marx aux sociologies
contemporaines », Espacestemps.net, web : http://www.espacestemps.net/

partiellement investi dans un rôle. On glisse ici du caractère à l'appartenance
pour amener cette idée d'un retrait ou d'une déprise de l'identité stabilisée
autour de symboles rigides en faveur de moments de mise en avant d'une
identité personnelle répondant à un besoin d'individualisation.<br>

Abstract: This article examines Gadamer's claim that language is fundamentally metaphorical from the perspective of Ricoeur's complementary analysis of metaphor. I argue that Gadamer's claim can only be understood in relation to a broader understanding of metaphor in which metaphor is not regarded as secondary to literal meaning. From this context one is better able to understand the connection Gadamer makes between language and ontology, which is found in his statement "Being that can be understood is language."<br>

Abstract: Official collective statements of Catholic bishops construct and promote the imaginary of the Philippines as "Catholic nation." This conflation of the body Catholic and the body politic has served as the church's platform for defending its interests in education against perceived nationalist threats and for engaging social issues. This article traces the genealogy of this discourse and uncovers its distorted account of the Filipino nation's emergence and its deductive pastoral logic. Given the inevitable link between "the religious" and "the secular," the imaginary is challenged today by the call for greater inclusivity and the impact of digital connectivity on community, whether religious or national.<br>

Abstract: Ernst Troeltsch distinguished between naive, apologetic and evolutionistic absoluteness.
From the original spontaneity of 'naive absoluteness' and its artificial (partly super-
naturalistic, partly rationalistic) defence as 'apologetic absoluteness' (in the Middle Ages and
in the Enlightenment, respectively) there came forth in Hegel the idea of 'evolutionistic
absoluteness' — an ingenious but untenable attempt to reconcile the solid apologetic
conception of absoluteness of that day with the dynamics of history by presenting it as the
outcome and terminus of historical progression. See Troeltsch, Die Absolutheit des Christen-
tums, 87ff. Cf. J. Klapwijk, Tussen historisme en relativisme, 222-29. At present the belief in
progress and thus also the mix of it with the idea of absoluteness is no longer a subject of
discussion.<br>

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-
versed version of the structural features of evil. Resolving the evil I do toward the other re-
quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

Abstract: Desmond is certainly not blind to the risks of such an endeavor: God and the Betioeen
mentions on the one hand a loss of faith in case of the forlorn mystic who in his 'ardor for the
divine other' is confronted with his own 'lack and nothing' (GB 266), and on the other a
possible usurpation of divine sovereignty (GB 268).<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: Broad definitions are often used in Christian apologetics. One example: 'Everyone has a
worldview. Whether or not we realize it, we all have certain presuppositions and biases that
affect the way we view all of life and reality. A worldview is like a set of lenses which taint our
vision or alter the way we perceive the world around us.' (http://christianworldview.net/,

Abstract: The main aim of this article is to offer a critical reflection on the need of rethinking the teachers' professional skills and their academic pathway, given the changes and current transformations (crisis, in its etymological sense). In fact, a series of changes, transformations, are identified and affect directly the educator's comprehension. Amongst others: the transformation of work bound up with the processes of the economic globalization, and the transformation of the learning environments imbued by the TICs; the population growth, a demographic transformation with geopolitics relevance, and finally, as a result from the previous ones, the raise in the migratory flows. Under this context, this paper tries to reconceptualize teachers' training and their depiction as professionals from the view of Gustav Mahler in his statement Tradition is the spreading of fire and not the veneration of ashes. Thereupon, some categories that help in the teaching update, are proposed and explained; such as authority (as reputation or moral authority, role model and, hence, less so as bare exercise of power), the personalization of education, the importance of home community (society), and, lastly, the alternation within school-society and work-study. El objetivo de este trabajo es ofrecer una reflexión acerca de la necesidad de re-pensar la profesionalidad de los docentes y de su itinerario formativo, a la luz los cambios y transformaciones actuales (crisis, en sentido etimológico). En efecto, se identifican una serie de cambios, de transformaciones, que afectan directamente a la comprensión del docente, del enseñante. Entre otros: la transformación del trabajo vinculada a los procesos de la globalización económica y la transformación de los entornos de aprendizaje imbuidos en las TICs; el aumento de la población, la transformación demográfica con trascendencia geopolítica; y por último, y como confluencia de las dos anteriores, el aumento de los flujos migratorios. En este contexto, el trabajo trata de reconceptualizar la formación de los profesores y de su imagen como profesionales desde el enfoque que era expresado por Gustav Mahler en la frase la tradición es el mantenimiento del fuego y no la adoración de sus cenizas. Así, se proponen y se explican algunas categorías que ayudan a la actualización de la docencia hoy, tales como: la autoridad (como prestigio o autoridad moral, ejemplo, y no tanto como mero ejercicio del poder), la personalización de la enseñanza, la trascendencia de la comunidad de origen (a la sociedad) y por último, la alternancia entre escuela y sociedad, trabajo y estudio.<br>

Abstract: This article considers the legacies of Jacques Derrida in and for Anglo-American sociocultural anthropology. It begins with a survey of Derrida's own engagement with themes that have historically been foundational to the field: (a) the critique of sign theory and, with it, the questions of language and law in Lévi-Straussian structuralism; (b) the question of the unconscious; (c) the critique of the performative and its consequences for the idea of ritual; (d) the rereading of Marcel Mauss's concept of the gift, and of economy more generally; and (e) the analysis of the metaphysical basis of law, in both religious and ostensibly secular formations. It then considers the state of the field at the time when it was being infused with different forms of poststructuralism and explores the competing claims made by these discourses in relation to deconstruction. Finally, after tracing the convergences and divergences between Derridean deconstruction and theory in sociocultural anthropology, it treats two main examples of works produced against and under the influence of Derrida's thought, respectively.<br>

Abstract: Much light can be shed on events which characterize or underlie scandals at firms such as Enron, Arthur Andersen, Worldcom, ImClone, and Tyco by appealing to the notion of ethical distance. Various inquiries have highlighted the difficulties in finding or identifying particular individuals to blame for particular events, and in the context of situations as complex as these it can sometimes be helpful to investigate the comparative ethical distance of various participants in these events. In this essay I offer a characterization of ethical distance in terms of moral responsibility, and in doing so I describe and illustrate the rough inverse correlation between moral distance and degrees of moral responsibility. I urge that the concept of ethical distance is capable of shedding light upon situations in which several people are involved in bringing about a state of affairs. I then argue that moral responsibility cannot do justice to all situations involving ethical distance. When the distance between a person and a state of affairs grows sufficiently large, a different type of treatment is called for, and I introduce the notion of moral taint to describe the moral status of agents in these situations.<br>

Abstract: The focus of this article is the theory of integration advanced by Alan Cairns in his book, "Citizens Plus: Aboriginal peoples and the Canadian State". Cairns' theory has had a mixed reception since its publication. Like much scholarship and public policy in the Aboriginal rights field, "Citizens Plus" has attracted strong proponents and opponents. At present "Citizens Plus" remains one of the primary competitors vying for influence in guiding the postcolonial reconfiguration of the relationship between Aboriginal peoples, the Canadian state and civil society on terms of justice that may be perceived as legitimate by both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples. The prime alternative, as conceived by both Cairns and his critics, is the nation-to-nation constitutional vision of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. The author provides a political theoretical reading of "Citizens Plus". She seeks to disclose the normative and conceptual structure of Cairns' argument and to situate Cairns' theory in the context of debates concerning the future of Aboriginal peoples and the constitution of Canada. This reading foregrounds an alternative interpretation of the relationship between "Citizens Plus" and the constitutional vision of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, which makes it possible to see them as complementary rather than opposed constitutional visions. The author also raises broader questions concerning the reasons for continuing the search, at the heart of Cairns' work, for a post-colonial theory and praxis of normative integration in diverse societies, and the conditions of the possibility of such a theory and praxis. Ultimately the author argues that whether one agrees or disagrees with Cairns' prescription, at a minimum "Citizens Plus" should be understood as raising a fundamental question to which multinational constitutional theory must respond. /// Le présent article a pour objet d'examiner la théorie avancée par Alan Cairns dans son ouvrage, "Citizens Plus: Aboriginal Peoples and the Canadian State". Cette théorie est loin de faire l'unanimité; comme beaucoup d'autres ouvrages ou initiatives dans le domaine des droits autochtones, "Citizens Plus" a ses partisans et ses détracteurs. À l'heure actuelle, "Citizens Plus" demeure l'une des principales approches possibles de la redéfinition postcoloniale des relations entre les peuples autochtones et l'État et la société civile canadiens sur le fondement de conditions justes dont la légitimité est susceptible d'être reconnue autant par les peuples autochtones que par les non-autochtones. La vision de relations de nation à nation, telle qu'exprimée par la Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones, est, selon Cairns ainsi que ses détracteurs, la principale alternative à "Citizens Plus". Dans le présent article, l'auteure interprète "Citizens Plus" dans une optique de théorie politique. Elle cherche à faire ressortir la structure normative et conceptuelle de l'argument de Cairns et à situer la théorie de Cairns dans le contexte des débats concernant l'avenir des peuples autochtones et de la constitution canadienne. L'auteure veut ainsi attirer l'attention sur une autre interprétation possible de la relation entre "Citizens Plus" et la vision de la Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones. Selon cette interprétation, il s'agit de visions complémentaires plutôt que contradictoires. L'auteure soulève également des questions plus générales, concernant les raisons de poursuivre la recherche d'une théorie et d'une praxie d'intégration normative au sein de sociétés empreintes de diversité, ainsi que les conditions de la possibilité d'une telle théorie et d'une telle praxie. Cette recherche est, par ailleurs, au cœur de l'œuvre de Cairns. En dernière analyse, l'auteure soutient que, peu importe que l'on souscrive ou non à ce que Cairns propose, "Citizens Plus" soulève, à tout le moins, une question fondamentale à laquelle la théorie constitutionnelle multinationale doit répondre.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines how activists in rural southern India have sought to reshape the field of political communication by encouraging lower-caste women to submit written, signed petitions to district-level government offices, and so represent themselves to the state. I argue that contradictions between democratic recognition and the will to development that inhere to the political structure of contemporary governance in rural India correspond to tensions within the semiotic structure of signature itself, between constative representation and performative creation. Governmentality and the forms of communication that it requires often rest on the notion that written self-representation constitutes an act of political agency. But the limits of a governmental communicative reason that would conflate written subject and agent become especially clear in postcolonial contexts where the construction of those citizens that would be represented is in fact a product of the very act of representation. It is the narrative of development-as-pedagogy that holds out the promise of a future alignment of communicative frameworks, technologies, and participant roles, allowing for the transparent self-representation of an already-constituted citizen. By tracking the ambivalent experience of one group of women in particular, this account focuses on how the logic of signature as self-representation has served to recontextualize the marginality of petitioners as something within the state's broader field of power.<br>

Abstract: How does international interaction shape states' patterns of thought, emotion, and action? This paper examines the processes by which motives and practices feed each other in reproducing historical structures. An artificial intelligence model defines state-subjects as cultures combining special meanings that produce causal attribution, state self-identification, emotions, and action motives. These special meanings are built from subjective cultural categories describing social acts and group character of the self and others. Anger, pride, fear, and relief motivate action. A collection of such subject-cultures may produce a pattern of actions that reiterates the cultures. The model discriminates between those combinations of elements in special meanings which reproduce subjects and historical structures, and those which do not. The meanings discovered in such reproduction analysis can be validated by discourse analysis.<br>

Abstract: Este trabajo está dedicado a todos los que, como Maximilian M. Kolbe (1894-1941), son capaces e dar su vida por otros, sin pedir nada a cambio, sin furia y sin rencor, tan sólo porque su idea de Dios omprende a la humanidad. Kolbe murió en un «búnker de inanición» del campo de exterminio de uschwitz. Entregó voluntariamente su vida a cambio de la de otro prisionero que era padre de familia. l suplicio del hambre (inanición absoluta) duró catorce días, en los que fallecieron seis condenados; uego, una inyección letal liquidó a los tres moribundos restantes, que «tardaban» demasiado. Así acabó olbe. La pena se dictó como castigo colectivo por la fuga de otro preso del bloque

Abstract: The past decade has brought advanced information technologies, which include electronic messaging systems, executive information systems, collaborative systems, group decision support systems, and other technologies that use sophisticated information management to enable multiparty participation in organization activities. Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose adaptive structuration theory (AST) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. AST examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of AST, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system (GDSS). A GDSS is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the GDSS is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied. We begin by positioning AST among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to GDSS use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of AST. We outline an analytic strategy for applying AST principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of AST is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization relationships. We can attain a better understanding of how to implement technologies, and we may also be able to develop improved designs or educational programs that promote productive adaptations.<br>

Abstract: International and national agendas are redesigning the terms of intellectual-property (IP) Laws to create cultural property for developing nations. Debates over IP and cultural-property "rights" or legal needs for "protection" are critical to anthropology's effort to reflect on how the production of knowledge, even culture itself, is variously construed to originate with, or "belong to," particular individuals, ethnic communities, or nation-states. We explore the implications of two Indonesian legal documents to show the disjunction between discourses of regional artists who describe the ritual exchanges, relationships, and transgenerational messages their arts shape and (inter)nationalists legal initiatives that bypass artists' concepts of process, access, and authority in an effort to disembed and control ritual-based expressions as products with exclusive owners.<br>

Abstract: Riprendo, ampliando i conte-
sti di riferimento, la complessa
nozione demartiniana di mun-
dus (De Martino 1977:11-282)
che comprende il mondo inte-
riore, come vissuto psicopatolo-
gico e di alienazione, e il mondo
esterno spazio-temporale e sim-
bolico per analizzare il rapporto
discorso-mondo. Mi allontano
dalla nozione di Searle (2001,
trad. it. 2003: 117-137) in cui la
direzione d' aggiustamento ri-
guarda un mondo come real-
tà supposta data. Mi accosto,
invece, a Vernant (1997: 49) il
cui approccio pragmatico con-
duce non solo a moltiplicare i
mondi - mondo esterno comu-
ne, mondo interno del locuto-
re, differenti mondi costituenti
ciascuno il risultato di un pro-
cesso specifico d'interazione e
di transazione-, ma anche ad
individuare senso e finalità dei
discorsi e potenza interazionale
e transazionale dei soggetti.<br>

Abstract: « Le temps présent est devenu éphémère, irréversible et insaisissable »,
dit A. Y. Gourevitch. Il est aussi homogène et orienté. L'historien sovié-
tique ajoute : « Pour la première fois, l'homme a constaté que le temps dont
il ne décelait le cours qu'à travers les événements, ne s'arrête pas, même en
l'absence d'événement. » A. Y. Gourevitch réintroduit ici une acception
métaphysique du temps, s'il entend bien par événements des phénomènes,
alors que dans le reste de sa contribution, il paraît convaincu de la maté-
rialité du temps. La preuve expérimentale de l'existence du temps hors des
phénomènes n'a pas été fournie et ne peut l'être. Les temps dans lesquels
nous vivons, sont celui de notre existence même, celui de notre société, celui
des mouvements des astres, etc. L'homme ne « constate » donc pas que le
temps ne s'arrête pas même en l'absence d'événement, ces événements lui
sont cachés par l'usage d'un temps quantitatif qui se réfère à l'un d'entre
eux exprimé par les horloges, devenu la référence unique, apparemment
« dématérialisé » par son omnipotence et occultant l'existence des autres
temps.<br>

Abstract: Oral traditions can contain elements of historical evidence and convey meaning. The narrative pattern of oral epics serves not merely as "a mnemonic device" that aids in recalling significant historical events but makes meaningful connections to the cultural experience of identity politics. On Cheju Island, a volcanic island located some fifty miles below the southernmost tip of the Korean peninsula, the indigenous sense of identity and history is expressed and accentuated in the fate of the shrine deities who are portrayed as exiles in shamanic epics such as ponhyang ponp'uri. The tragic heroism in the cliché of exile and return of the shrine deities recapitulates the historical identity of Cheju people as "exiles at the frontier." After Cheju Island lost political autonomy as an independent kingdom, Tam-ra, in the early twelfth century, the Cheju people's cultural memory of isolation and redemptive desire for liberation from the mainland state's domination becomes intelligible and justifiable textually through the heroic acts of exiled deities.<br>

Abstract: After some initial remarks on the ongoing historiographic debates regarding experience as an analytical category, the article first tries to show, through a concise survey of J. G. Herder's essays on Ossian and Shakespeare, that Herder cannot be claimed as a source for the notion of historical experience in the sense of an immediate access to the past, as the theorist of history F. R. Ankersmit has stated. Instead, this article argues, experience can be understood as one of the key terms of Herder's historical view of modernity, whose development he describes as involving a paradigmatic change in the character of human experience itself. For Herder, the shift from primary to secondary experience in the modern historical process results in the necessity of an aestheticization of historiography. In this respect, the article briefly concludes, Herder inspired 19thcentury historians such as G. G. Gervinus.<br>

Discourse:
I propose, without insisting on the obvious reasons for my choice of terms, to
use the word story for the signified, or narrative content (even if this content
turns out, in a given case, to be low in dramatic intensity or fullness of incident),
to use the word narrative for the signifier, statement, discourse or narrative text
itself, and to use the word narrating for the producing narrative action and, by
extension, the whole of the real or fictional situation in which that action takes
place. (27)<br>

Issue: i274773<br>
Date: 1 1, 1969<br>
Author(s): Wolf Robert C.<br>
Abstract: Many contemporary sources, including anthropological, define politics as the vying for power that occurs in the public domain, the goverance of the body politic, or strategies for advancing particular interests as general. While not inaccurate in terms of reflecting politics in the modern state, the instrumental notion often excludes a sense of politics that involves a struggle for mutual recognition or consensus through the medium of discourse. Discourse becomes the central concept in grasping the relation between politics and secret societies among the peasantry. It is argued in this essay that politics displayed through discourse goes a long way towards defining the public in peasant societies. In terms of augmented repression, either from a centralized state or local elites, the sense of public submerges itself in the hidden discourse or code of the secret society. This theme is examined with respect to the Mau Mau of Kenya and late nineteenth and twentieth-century Chinese secret societies.<br>

Abstract: Essentialist and postmodern feminisms are often regarded as incompatible. I propose that Buddhist theories of subjectivity change the nature of the tension between them as presently construed because Buddhist traditions describe a mind not wholly governed by language, and a subjective mental dimension that is entirely integrated with the body and its sensations. A corollary is the compatibility Buddhists perceive between conditioned subjective states (akin to postmodern feminisms) and the unconditioned (akin to essentialist feminisms).<br>

Abstract: Recent discussions of religious, cultural, and/or moral diversity raise questions relevant to the descriptive and normative aims of students of religious ethics. In conversation with several illustrative works, the author takes up (1) issues of terminology, (2) explanations or classifications of types and origins of plurality and pluralism, (3) the relations between pluralism as a normative theory and the aims of a liberal state, and (4) the import of an emphasis on plurality or pluralism for the comparative study of religious ethics.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I develop a phenomenology of falling ill by presenting, interpreting and developing the basic model we find in Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1956). The three steps identified by Sartre in this process are analysed, developed further and brought to a five- step model: (1) pre-reflective experience of discomfort, (2) lived, bodily discomfort, (3) suffered illness, (4) disease pondering, and (5) disease state. To fall ill is to fall victim to a gradual process of alienation, and with each step this alienating process is taken to a new qualitative level. Consequently, the five steps of falling ill have not only a contingent chronological order but also a kind of logical order, in that they typically presuppose each other. I adopt Sartre's focus on embodiment as the core ground of the alienation process, but point out that the alienation of the body in illness is not only the experience of a psychic object, but an experience of the independent life of one's own body. This facticity of the body is the result neither of the gaze of the other person, nor of a reflection adopting the outer perspective of the other in an indirect way, but is a result of the very otherness of one's own body, which addresses and plagues us when we fall ill. I use examples of falling ill and being a patient to show how a phenomenology of falling ill can be helpful in educating health-care personnel (and perhaps also patients) about the ways of the lived body.<br>

Abstract: By focusing on children involved in the ritual practices in Ambonwari village, East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea, this essay compares two types of ritual: that of healing and that of male initiation. Like other life crisis rituals both deal with two dimensions of the Ambonwari life-world, that is with the living and the dead and, in a broader sense, with people and spirits. Though both are based upon the same cosmology there are fundamental differences between them. First, healers in healing ceremonies treat uninitiated children as 'non-beings'. From the perspective of Ambonwari 'selves' or 'beings', children belong to this domain. They exist as extensions of their parents or carers, from whom they cannot be separated conceptually. Second, by examining the Ambonwari concepts of negation I show that healers do not approach the domain of cosmological non-existence: they are not concerned with the cosmogony of the Ambonwari life-world. The male initiation rituals do just the opposite, however. It is only in the male initiation ritual, seen as a cosmogonic event, that young boys are cut off from their parents and 'thrown' abruptly into a state of becoming. Unlike the healing rites, these rituals treat young boys as both Ambonwari beginnings and Ambonwari beings. I argue that Ambonwari initiation rituals are not concerned with symbolic death followed by rebirth, but with states of being. Initiation means that death becomes possible for a child. The initiated boy will now be able to die as an Ambonwari being.<br>

Abstract: It is here proposed the elimination of the concept of truth in analytical construction by substituting for it the concept of terminal evidence of an assertion. Terminal evidence is in turn explained in terms of anschauliche non-deterministic sequences and portions of finitist logic generated by these sequences are sketched both for statements without quantifiers and statements with first order quantifiers. Emphasis is given to the nature of negation and existence in the proposed elimination. /// Es wird vorgeschlagen, die Eliminierung des Wahrheitsbegriffes in der analytischen Konstruktion durch die Einsetzung des Begriffes der endgultigen Evidenz einer Aussage durchzufuhren. Bei der Einfuhrung von anschaulichen akausalen Folgen lasst sich der Begriff der endgultigen Evidenz erklaren und Teile der finiten Logik, die solche Folgen erzeugen, werden skizziert sowohl fur Aussagen ohne Quantoren als auch fur solche, bei denen nur Quantoren der ersten Stufe vorkommen. Die Natur der Negation und des Existenz-Begriffes ist insbesondere hervorgehoben. /// É proposto efectuar-se a eliminação do conceito de verdade na construção analitica pela introdução do conceito da evidência terminal de uma asserção. Com a introdução de sucessões não-deterministas é elucidado o conceito de evidência terminal e os fragmentos de lógica finitista que estas sucessões originam são esboçados quer para o caso de asserçães sem quantores quer para aquelas asserções em que só ocorrem quantores de 1.a ordem. A natureza da negação e do conceito da existência são especialmente destacados.<br>

Abstract: J. Robert Oppenheimer was among the most important and enigmatic figures in 20th century science. He is best known for successfully directing the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan at the end of World War II. Subsequently, he became a scientist and statesman who advised the United States government in the areas of atomic weapons development and public policy. He later became subject to an investigation in 1954 into his previous political affiliations and his personal behavior that ended in the revoking of his security clearance. This essay seeks to chronicle Oppenheimer's coming of age as a public intellectual with a view toward his own psychological history and most especially in relationship to the stages of faith development articulated by James Fowler and colleagues. Moreover, though not conventionally religious, Oppenheimer's life and thought were permeated with themes and ideas of a religious and ethical nature that shaped his adult character and informed his view of the world. This essay was originally presented at The Richardson History of Psychiatry Research Seminar at Weill Cornell Medical College.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we use concepts from actor-network theory (ANT) to interpret the sequence of events that led to business process change (BPC) failure at a telecommunications company in the United States. Through our intensive examination of the BPC initiative, we find that a number of issues suggested by ANT, such as errors in problematization, parallel translation, betrayal, and irreversible inscription of interests, contributed significantly to the failure. We provide nine abstraction statements capturing the essence of our findings in a concrete form. The larger implication of our study is that, for sociotechnical phenomena such as BPC with significant political components, an ANT-informed understanding can enable practitioners to better anticipate and cope with emergent complexities.<br>

Abstract: Analysis of the Turkish state in the 20th century both draws upon and supports Gramsci's definition of the state as "dictatorship + hegemony." Both the form of the capitalist state and its activities rest upon the hegemony of the dominant class. The importance of society and class conflicts in understanding the capitalist state suggests a critical position vis-à-vis the state autonomy tradition. The history of the Turkish state provides support for the argument that the dominant class must have established hegemony in the state in the first place, since without this there is no guarantee of successful use of the coercive power of the state on behalf of the sectional interests of the dominant class.<br>

Abstract: The paper considers the map and the milieu of Europe. Five distinguishing characteristics are discussed. Special attention is given to the "states system" of Europe, the intensity of the boundary network and the increasing tendency from the point of view of human geography to treat the continent as divided rather than as unitary. The first post-war generation of British geographers tended to neglect Europe in favour of North America. Sweden and France have been important in restoring the connection. Those whose research focuses on European topics will encounter bibliographical, linguistic and other problems; but these will be offset by the cordial working relationships among European geographers which, as among colleagues in the English-speaking world, seem to spring from the nature of the subject itself.<br>

Abstract: Closely linked to the increase in psychotropic pill consumption, forgetting and remembering emerged from devastated social scenarios as a new local idiom among poor youth in the late 1990s and the new millennium. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork carried out during the years of the deepest economic crisis in Argentina (2001-03), I argue that psychotropic pill consumption is associated with not only deteriorating economic conditions but also changes in the quality and price of cocaine, and in the scarcity and subsequent change of status of medications during the economic breakdown. Taking into account developments in the field of memory studies, I examine the relationship among political economy, social memory work, and changing drug-use practices. Regarding memory as a social practice, I argue that the growth of psychotropic pill consumption in the late 1990s can be understood through the interplay of Paul Ricoeur's notions regarding different kinds and levels of forgetting. By analyzing changing survival strategies, social network dismantlement, changing mortality patterns, and abusive police repression, I discuss how social fragmentation engendered by structural reforms has modified social memory work.<br>

Abstract: While concepts of a postinternational politics properly highlight the constant variance of entities in play in international relations, the approach lacks an ontology that shows how such an unstable variety of types of players can coexist in a common field in the first place. This article draws upon Deleuze's philosophy to set out an ontology in which the continual reformulation of entities in play in "postinternational" society can be grasped.This entails a strategic shift from speaking about the "borders" between sovereign states to referring instead to the "margins" between a plethora of entities that are ever open to modifications of identity. The concept of the margin possesses a much wider reach than borders, and focuses continual attention on the meetings and interactions between a range of indeterminate entities whose interactions may determine both themselves and the types of entity that are in play.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyze how Brazilian trade unions are using social memory as a tool to build up workers' collective identities, in an attempt to fight the fragmentation resulting from the impact of the industrial restructuring of the 1990s. We will draw upon two ongoing programs conducted by the ABC Metal Workers Union (SMABC) and the Oil Workers Union of Brazil's state oil company Petrobras (Sindipetro). The SMABC and Sindipetro have recently been addressing the issue of workers memory with social and public projects. These projects are building up memories, which in spite of being institution-based are also collective, framed by the unions through the use of new types of communication and electronic media.<br>

Abstract: Given World and Time is a collection of essays that summarizes much of the recent work on the theory of time, including cultural, political, and social conceptualizations of temporality. The grounding narrative of this collection, roughly stated, leads from the German and German-Jewish ideas of a temporality of crisis developed in the 1920s, to the French poststructuralism of the 1960s and 1970s, and concludes with the American syntheses of the 1980s and 1990s. Methodologically, the book weaves together different historical narratives with a new emphasis on their temporal dimension, all seen from the perspective of critical theory and recent cultural critique. However, it is interesting to point out that the majority of the articles do not challenge the classic critical tools of modernism, in spite of the frequent reference to poststructuralist critique. The volume editor has also not acknowledged more recent work that treats similar topics and themes through the application of a radical political critique, most significantly the work associated with biopolitics and the so-called theological turn.<br>

Abstract: Within the last 2000 years the land demarcated by the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Jordan Valley to the east has been one of the most disputed territories in history. World powers have redrawn its boundaries numerous times. Since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 within British Mandate Palestine, Palestinians and Israelis have disagreed over the national identity of the land that they both inhabit.The struggles have extended from the battlefields to the classrooms. In the process, different national and ethnic groups have used various sciences, ranging from archeology to history and geography, to prove territorial claims based on their historical presence in the region. But how have various Israeli social and political groups used maps to solidify claims over the territory? In this paper we bring together science studies and critical cartography in order to investigate cartographic representations as socially embedded practices and address how visual rhetoric intersects with knowledge claims in cartography. Before the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the Israeli government and the Jewish National Fund produced maps of Israel that established a Hebrew topography of the land. After 1967, Israel's expanded territorial control made the demarcation of its borders ever more controversial. Consequently, various Israeli interest groups and political parties increasingly used various cartographic techniques to forge territorial spaces, demarcate disputed boundaries, and inscribe particular national, political, and ethnic identities onto the land.<br>

Abstract: This paper looks at how "official" memories are produced in state-sponsored public spaces and how a multi-ethnic, multicultural north-east India responded to it. Official memory sites like museums, monuments and memorials not only reflected but also shaped ethnic relations to a great extent. The emerging states in the region have assiduously favoured the historical imagination of a politically dominant community, which is masculine, and remains persistently insensitive to the marginal "others" in the state. This, on the one hand, encouraged the dominant community to assimilate and thereby produced ethnonationalism around that notion of shared pasts. On the other, it generated a sense of neglect in the minorities who responded with vernacular memorials to embody their historical imagination and likewise developed their own ethnic nationalism around it. This parallel rise to prominence of often competing ethnonationalisms within the region, or sometime within the state, has thereby produced violent forms of contestation often dangerously imbued with fissiparous tendencies.<br>

Abstract: Il s'agit d'éclairer plusieurs déplacements qui se sont produits dans les trente dernières années. Tout d'abord la création d'un milieu d'experts intermédiaires entre la politique, l'administration et la recherche. Ensuite un changement du cadre à l'intérieur duquel se situe la réflexion. Il s'agit moins de penser la cohésion d'une société dans un cadre national qu'à la manière dont le pays peut maintenir son rang dans la compétition internationale. Enfin un changement d'orientation politique : le souci de la formation de l'élite redevient primordial même s'il ne s'agit plus de maintenir une tradition culturelle mais de sauvegarder ses parts de marché. Le texte étudie ces évolutions en France en distinguant trois périodes : une période de « politique à l'état gazeux » où la gauche tente de transformer les idéaux libertaires de 1968 en programme de gouvernement ; une tentative de passage à l'état solide avec la loi d'orientation de 1989 et la création de la Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective ; une déstabilisation de ce système par le ministre Claude Allègre qui jette le système éducatif français dans le grand bain de la concurrence internationale. Il s'ensuit une période à la fois « sous influence » et d'incertitude. The idea is to explain several moves that have happened in the last thirty years. First of all, the creation of a body of experts, middlemen between politics, government and research. Then a change in the setting of the thinking process. It is less to think about social cohesion within a national setting than the way the country can live up to its ranking when competing at the international level. Finally, a change in political orientations: teaching the elite becomes a crucial problem again even if it does not mean keeping cultural traditions alive any more but securing market shares. This article studies those changes and defines three periods: firstly, a period of politics in "gaseous-state" in which the left tried to change 1968's libertarian ideals into a political agenda; secondly, an attempt to change to solid state with the 1989's Orientation Act (act laying down the basic principles for government action in education) and the creation of the "Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective" (assessment & futurology office); finally, the destabilisation of this system by Claude Allègre, the then French education secretary who put the French educational system into the picture of international competition. A period of doubts "under influence" followed right after. Es handelt sich darum, mehrere in den letzten 30 Jahren vorgefundenen Verwandlungen aufzuklären: zunächst die Gründung eines Expertenmilieus zwischen Politik, Verwaltung und Forschung. Dann einen Wandel des Rahmens, in dem die Überlegung stattfindet: es geht nämlich weniger darum, über den Zusammenhalt einer Gesellschaft in einem internationalen Rahmen nachzudenken als über die Art und Weise zu überlegen, wie das Land seinen Platz im internationalen Wettbewerb behalten kann. Schließlich einen Wandel der politischen Orientierung: die Bemühung um die Bildung einer Elite wird wieder vorrangig, auch wenn es nicht mehr darauf ankommt, eine kulturelle Tradition zu behalten, sondern seinen Marktanteil zu retten. Der Text bearbeitet diese Entwicklungen in Frankreich und unterscheidet dabei drei Perioden: erstens eine Zeit der „gasförmigen” Politik, in der die Linksparteien versuchen, die anarchistischen 1968er Ideale in ein Regierungsprogramm umzusetzen; zweitens ein Versuch der Verfestigung mit dem Orientierungsgesetz 1989 und die Gründung des Bewertungs- und Forschungsamtes (Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective); drittens eine Destabilisierung dieses Systems durch den Erziehungsminister Claude Allègre, der das französische Schulsystem mit der internationalen Konkurrenz konfrontiert. Darauf folgt eine „unter Einfluß" stehende und zugleich unsichere Periode. Se trata de aclarar varios desplazamientos que se produjeron en los treinta últimos años. Primero, la creación de un medio de expertos intermediarios entre la política, la administración y investigación. Después, un cambio del marco dentro del que se sitúa la reflexión. No se trata tanto de pensar la cohesión de una sociedad en un marco nacional como de la manera en que el país puede mantener su rango en la competencia internacional. Por fin, un cambio de orientación política : la preocupación por la formación de lo más selecto vuelve a ser primordial aunque ya no se trata de mantener una tradición cultural sino de proteger sus cuotas de mercado. El texto estudia estas evoluciones en Francia distinguiendo tres períodos : un período de « política en estado gaseoso » en el que la izquierda intenta transformar los ideales libertarios de 1968 en programa de gobierno ; un intento de pasar al estado sólido con la ley de orientación de 1989 y la creación la Dirección de la evaluación y de la prospectiva ; una destabilización de este sistema por el ministro Claude Allègre que echa el sistema educativo francés en el gran baño de la competencia internacional. De ahí resulta un período a la vez «bajo influencia » y de incertidumbre.<br>

Abstract: On the U.S.-Mexican border, the label "Mexican" refers simultaneously to both nationality and ethnicity. Playing with the multiple meanings of the word, border actors construct narratives about themselves and Others to deal with a local hegemonic discourse that states that "poverty is Mexican." Thus, while border identities are constructed within a culturally specific system of classification, people also develop a sense of themselves as subjects by imagining themselves as protagonists in stories. To know border narratives is important because people generally act according to how they understand their place in any number of social relations whose meaning is narratively constructed.<br>

Abstract: The Play About the Baby remains neglected by interpreters of Albee's work because its austerely schematic mode of presentation seems to keeps everything on the surface, making acts of interpretation seem superfluous. Therefore, rather than trying to interpret the play, it is more useful to ask, following the suggestion of Gilles Deleuze, what it does. The play is a dramamachine that produces loss and asserts the centrality of loss to the constitution of selfhood. This loss is achieved by the deployment of perversion, both sexual and linguistic, against Boy and Girl's innocence. The use of perversion ultimately even questions whether there was ever any state of presence that preceded loss. These tactics seem to suggest a wider set of sexual possibilities, but the tactics are ultimately subordinated to the production of melancholia though loss, a subordination that traps the work in a world of severely limited possibilities and encounters.<br>

Abstract: The article asserts that a search for truth ought to be carrying out in such a way as to preserve or enhance solidarity. It demonstrates the necessity and the difficulties of making atrocious and traumatic historical events legally accountable. The necessity and difficulties have been recently fuelled by the trends towards the openness of modern identity and the growing importance of human rights, both of them demanding settling conflicts in the context of the multiplication of particularistic memories, yet without undermining social solidarity constructed on liberal foundations. The article argue that because of the hybrid nature of the task, unresolved tensions between memory and history, the erosion of the state's ability to impose unitary and unifying framework of memory, there is no simple and quick solution to tensions between memory, solidarity, and therefore to manage these strains we need to rely a plurality of contending narratives and civility of rules.<br>

Abstract: Individual behaviors, such as loss-coping and “grief work” are affected in organizational contexts. In everything pertaining to coping with trauma in general, and loss more particularly, the individual is “trapped” within a political psychology that enforces the habitus and expectations of institutional dominance on the ostensibly intimate and private response. Regimes have perceived bereavement over battlefield deaths as a form of social capital that can be mobilized to enhance national loyalty and political support. Employing both existential/hermeneutic and institutional analysis, this study examines three diachronic models of bereavement — hegemonic, political and civil — and their political ramifications in the Israeli context.Drawing on changing parental conceptual orientations towards fallen sons and their role as cultural and ideological agents in public sphere, the article traces the movement of bereavement from its capture by the hegemonic state institutions to its creations under the domination of others institutions: political and civic and ultimate use in critiquing the political and military echelon. The article indicates the powerful impact of the social institutional-organizational context on the intimate-psychological context of coping with loss, by illustrating this phenomenon in the Israeli society.<br>

Abstract: I begin by introducing the Ilongots and some of their attitudes toward speech. Whereas most modern theorists think of language as a tool designed primarily to "express" or to "refer," Ilongots think of language first in terms of action. They see commands as the exemplary act of speech, displaying less concern for the subjective meanings that an utterance conveys than for the social contexts in which utterances are heard. An ethnographic sketch thus outlines how Ilongots think of words and how their thought relates to aspects of their practice -- providing an external foil for theorists found closer to home. Speech Act Theory is discussed and questioned first on internal grounds, as an approach that recognizes but slights important situational and cultural constraints on forms of language use. A consideration of the application of Searle's taxonomy of acts of speech to Ilongot categories of language use then leads to a clarification of the individualistic and relatively asocial biases of his essentially intra-cultural account. Last, I return to Ilongot directives. A partial analysis of Ilongot acts of speech provides the basis for a statement of the ways in which indigenous categories are related to the forms that actions take, as both of these, in turn, reflect the sociocultural ordering of local worlds.<br>

Abstract: In 1884 an Ottoman public prosecutor and fellow officials stood trial for abusing their official authorities when attending to an incident in one of Istanbul's neighborhoods. A published verbatim report of the proceedings is used in this article for discussing Ottoman socio-legal change in the late nineteenth century, employing a microhistorical perspective. Following a major reform in the new court system, which was established in the 1860s (the Nizamiye courts), the judicial authorities used the trial in question for transmitting the commitment of the modernizing state to the rule of law, exhibited by the principle of officials' accountability. Features of the reformed judicial system and its distinctive legal culture are demonstrated in this article by unfolding the judicial aspects of this episode and by discussing connections between them and the immediate socio-political and socio-legal contexts of the trial.<br>

Abstract: This review article discusses the emergence of the subsequent proceedings before the US Military Tribunals from the shadows of the trial of 'Major War Criminals' at the International Military Tribunal as explored in Kevin Jon Heller's The Nuremberg Military Tribunals and the Origins of International Criminal Law. The article applauds Heller's efforts in producing a detailed examination of an understudied aspect of the origins of international criminal law. The essay suggests that given the specific focus of the author on the genealogy of international criminal law, important legal historical questions are left unexamined. It suggests a research agenda that would focus more specifically on the centrality of the Shoah to National Socialism and argues that the current trend in historical scholarship focusing on war crimes trials as a distinct subject of inquiry could provide a fruitful basis for future socio-legal research into the Nazi state and its legal apparatus.<br>

Abstract: This article challenges the assumption that "tradition" is a quality pertaining chiefly to objects, stylistic conventions, or the use of materials. Equally, it refutes the notion that tradition is merely the perpetuation of ritualized practices or skilled techniques. By considering the complex relation between vocational migration, heritage, and identity among contemporary fine woodworkers at London's Building Crafts College, it argues that tradition is a state of mind — a recurring nostalgia for an idealized past, or the desire for a Utopian future. More specifically, the article investigates a "tradition of longing" for engagement in nonalienating modes of production, aesthetic work, and an authentic way of living.<br>

Abstract: Moving from repression or tyranny toward the rule of law and reason is fraught with difficulties. One question of transitional justice is whether those responsible for the horrors of the previous régime should be punished or whether those involved in the transition should travel a path toward forgiveness and unity. Within this article, it is urged that in the (re-)establishment of the rule of reason among all involved there is a commitment to peace as opposed to force. This commitment marks retribution and utilitarian punishment as incoherent and normatively indefensible. Resorting to punishment is the abandonment of reason, not its reinstatement. Indeed, the point can be generalized. Punishment, as resorting to force, is a move away from establishing or sustaining a framework of justification and its commitment to peace.<br>

Author(s): Zollmann Mary Ann<br>
Abstract: This article explores the thesis that educators are called to define and describe truth morefoundationally than we have ever done before if tve are to facilitate existence that is right, just, correct on both a personal and communal level. This thesis is sourced in ever-deepening attentiveness to, appreciation for, and affirmation of this statement of Adrian van Kaam: "The work of reformation starts in the heart by means of the human spirit; it is the reclamation of the soul, via the spirit, of its innermost form direction. " Suggesting that education which would be truly correctional must, therefore, reach into the very heart of being, the author describes the current paradigm shift from the Newtonian model of what it means to be human with its positivistic approaches to learning to a more Einsteinian or fullfield understanding of human being and its requirement of more formative learning processes. In consonance with the truth of being as full-field, formative correctional education is reflective and experiential, dialogical, narrative in form, and globally inclusive. In her discussion of each of these methodologies, the author illustrates how each one draws us deeper into the truth of who we are and inspires us to be the unique presence that we are in the world. Through such methods and processes, individuals are formed, reformed, and transformed not only in self-appreciation and openness to their own possibilities, but in appreciation for the meaning and value of their existence with others in the world.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the interplay of dystopian and utopian themes in Terry Bisson's "Pirates of the Universe," utilizing Tom Moylan's concept of "critical dystopia." In the novel, Bisson maps out a number of discontinuous dystopias in a near-future US marked by rampant capitalist enterprise, out-of-control bio-technology, ecological decay, and a weak central state. These dystopias generally produce citizens with fragmented personal experiences, disinterest in social issues, and limited aspirations. Towards the end of the novel, when free and clean energy becomes available to all, Bisson explores continuing dystopian trends, articulates utopian possibilities, and emphasizes the importance of individual and collective imagination for choosing among alternatives.<br>

Abstract: This article focuses on a close reading of Rey Ventura's autobiographical narrative of his experience as an illegal migrant worker in Japan in order to unsettle the dominant paradigm of the overseas Filipino worker as hero(ine) and martyr. It examines the ways in which both the Philippine and Japanese states have acted as apparatuses of labor capture; the various discourses of nationness which inform the political construction of the OFW as "labor," "foreign," "illegal" and "depoliticized"; and the strategies of survival used by OFWs to negotiate with, and make claims on, the labor-sending and -receiving states.<br>

Abstract: This study represents a Chapter from a section devoted to the composition of a literary work and is part of a larger project called ‘The Poetics of a Work of Literature in the Twentieth Century’, which is being undertaken by the Theory Department of the Institute of Czech Literature. The fragment and fragmentariness in a twentieth-century literary work are a manifestation of a marked tendency towards discontinuity or in some cases towards continuity of a certain kind. There exist works of art that for various reasons remain fragments without, however, being preceived as such (the novels of Kafka and Ladislav Klíma’s Velký román, are cases in point); on the other hand, the fragment, that is to say an intentional fragment (such as a sketch or a synopsis), becomes an independent genre whose roots go back to Romanticism (for instance Novalis’s fragment). The fragment and fragmentarieness that manifests itself in the text in the widest possible number of ways (intentional incompleteness and sporadicity, ‘blank spots’ in the Story, the mixing of heterogeneous elements, the alternating of various genres within one work, and so on), we understand as a reaction to the idea about the work as a complete, inlernally unified and accomplished whole with a clear and single Sense, an idea that Classicism molleyeoddled, which was then to a large exient done by Realism and with it all so-called decadent literature (including tendencious, Socialist-Realist literature). The fragment and fragmentariness (with which is linked the idea of a sense that continuously defies being pinned down to any one definition, which follows from its quality of not being fully told, from suggestion, hints, silence, gaps and ‘ holes’) are, in the literature of the twentieth century, perceived as both a genre and also as approaches that can express the open nature of being and of the world better than the whole work can. Because fragmentary works often represent a work in a nascent state or in a state of transformation, they become a picture of a world that is, as Ladislav Klíma pointed out, ‘continuously creating itself’.<br>

Abstract: In societies coming to terms with historical injustices, public apology has recently emerged as a potent trend. This is particularly true of France, where the state served as a catalyst for a wave of public apologies for acts of intolerance committed during the Second World War. Following Jacques Chirac's 1995 official apology for Vichy's anti-Semitic policies, various groups in civil society publicly atoned for their particular Vichy roles in discrimination against Jews: the medical profession, the law bar, the Catholic Church, and the police. How does public apology, as distinct from court trials, historical commissions, and reparations, affect contemporary France's reconciliation with its past? This article also analyzes how apologizing for Vichy has created demand for an official French apology for the Algerian War. By 2006, the politics of memory in French society decidedly shifted attention from Vichy to post-colonialism: in both cases, the apology turn imposes new dynamics of remembering and forgetting.<br>

Abstract: The winter of discontent continues to exert a powerful hold over the British political imaginary. It acts as a discursive key to a collective mythology seemingly appealed to, and conjured, in each wave of industrial unrest, in each hint of political turmoil and, until recently, whenever the election of a Labour Government looked credible. In this paper I consider the rhetorical strategies and linguistic devices deployed by the tabloid media in the narration of the events of the winter of 1978-79. I argue for an interpretation of the winter of discontent as a moment of state crisis. By crisis however I do not refer to the mere accumulation of contradictions but rather to a moment of transition, a moment of decisive intervention. Within such a framework, the winter of discontent emerges as a strategic moment in the transformation of the British state, and perhaps the key moment in the pre-history of Thatcherism. For, as I hope to demonstrate, the initial appeal of the New Right was premised upon its ability to offer a convincing construction of the winter of discontent as symptomatic of a more fundamental crisis of the state. In such a moment of crisis, a particular type of decisive intervention was called for. In this discursive construction of crisis the New Right proved itself capable of changing, if not the hearts and minds of the electorate, then certainly the predominant perceptions of the political context. It recruited subjects to its vision of the necessary response to the crisis of a monolithic state besieged by the trade unions. This was perhaps the only truly hegemonic moment of Thatcherism. It occurred well before Mrs Thatcher entered Number 10. It is thus not surprising that one of the most enduring and distinctive legacies of Thatcherism has been the new political lexicon of crisis, siege and subterfuge born of the winter of discontent.<br>

Abstract: The entire medieval period is dominated by an eschatological textuality which posits for the history of salvation a singulative movement through time, from creation to eschaton. In book 12 of De civitate Dei, Augustine provides theoretical background for this epochal model; the most cogent statement of its content is found in book 6 of Hugh of Saint Victor's Didascalicon. This type of textuality, whose formal properties are identified, is already marked in Augustine by its exclusion of the purely iterative view of time held by pagan philosophers. From the twelfth century, however, singulative eschatological textuality assimilates an iterative model of the progression of time as it finds expression in metaphorically informed statements concerning the liturgical year. From Jean Beleth to Jacobus de Voragine, the figure of assimilatio facilitates the conflation of a discretelinear and an iterative model of temporality in such representations, the logical relations within which are analyzed here.<br>

Abstract: The narratological category "person" needs to be replaced by a different conceptual framework. The traditional distinctions between narrative levels and between story and discourse are inadequate to an explanation of much postmodernist writing. Classic narratological categories correlate with a realist understanding of story and with a realist conceptualization of story telling with some postmodernist techniques of writing, such as second-person fiction, refusing to play by such conceptualizations. Gabriel Josipovici's Contre-jour is an instance of a radical deconstruction of realist parameters. Realist recuperations or naturalizations of intractable writing have to be evaluated as readings against the anti-mimetic grain of such texts, and the possibility of such narrative recuperation does not provide evidence for the reinstatement of traditional narratological distinctions. The failing of current narratology to account for second-person narrative is due to the inapplicability of traditional narratological categories, a break-down that is motivated by the ideological commitments of much postmodernist, and especially second-person, fiction since these deliberately question realistic frames of cognition and story understanding.<br>

Abstract: In this paper some elements of the reading process of Luke 12:35-48 are analysed according to the theory of Wolfgang Iser. Two problems are stated in the introduction, namely the impossibility of accounting for the reading process exhaustively in one all-encompassing theory, and the difficulty of "applying" Iser's theory, which is proposed as a theory of the reading process and not a method for analysing the reading process of an actual text. After a short exposition of the philosophical background and the main elements of the theory, a description of some elements of the reading process of this particular text is given. The paper concludes with a short reflection on the viability of this theory for a practical reception analysis.<br>

Abstract: Giuseppe Capograssi (1889-1956) was an important legal philosopher and had a lively influence on the development of legal studies. The centre of his reflections lay in his many investigations into the concept of experience, which aimed to supersede the prevalent orientation in Italy, focussed on vertexes, emphasizing instead the importance of practices, both on the theoretical level and in the analysis of legal activity and political reality. Capograssi therefore paid great attention to the relationship between state and society viewed in a dynamic and pluralist perspective. No less illuminating are Capograssi's investigations into the value of the constitution and the principle of legality. During the Fascist period, Capograssi upheld the values of individual liberty and democratic principles, seeing as indispensable the continual involvement of citizens in the development of political action. This perspective played a further, particularly important role in the "ideas of Capograssi", after the war and the advent of the republican legal order. According to Capograssi, more space needed to be given to social life and to the spiritual links on which political community is based. In this sense, Capograssi found the teachings of Catholicism fundamental. His Catholicism placed great emphasis on freedom and solidarity and contained a lively, underlying sense of the cultural and spiritual, inspired by the ideal of "charity".<br>

Abstract: Seeking to understand the manifest in relation to the implicit and the unstated-the unconscious of the conscious-this paper focuses on the elusiveness of social consciousness in a transitional colonial society with a rich heritage of its own. The issue chosen for examination is that of widow marriage and the period is confined to the last three decades of the nineteenth century. Progressively convulsing the upper caste, mainly middle class, Hindu society, the issue was one that epitomised the interplay of conflicting emotions, values and ideas that characterised men's consciousness about women during this seminal phase of Indian history.<br>

Abstract: In attempting to achieve some form of mapping between consciousness (specifically, consciousness₆) and cognition, I distinguish between a weak and a strong version of the hypothesis, indicating a change in mode of thinking of a metaphoric-symbolic nature (Glicksohn, 1993). The weak version would claim that metaphors, symbols, analogies and images are used in an attempt to depict the experience, which is not easily translatable into words. The strong version would claim that metaphoric thinking is one of the hallmarks of the experience, and is used both in an attempt to depict the experience and also to convey to the reader, and possibly to induce in the reader, some of the qualities of that experience. My discussion of these two options is preceded by some comments on problems inherent in studying altered or alternate states of consciousness. I also discuss the relationships among physiognomic perception, cognitive dedifferentiation, and symbolic cognition.<br>

Abstract: Disciplinary specialties and boundaries may impede as well as facilitate understanding. Standard scholarly orientations to the study of Navajos and other ethnic populations manifest many biases of ethnocentrism and a general tendency to stereotype. Specific observer-related tendencies to distort are noted, among them tendencies to understate social dynamics and the degree to which Navajos are functioning parts of wider social systems. The literature on Navajos is a product of changing tools in the hands of changing observers applied to changing communities in the context of ongoing change in the wider societies of both observer and observed. It is argued that "multiplying glimpses," or increasing the number and types of observers and the variety of disciplines and paradigms represented, may reduce observer and position biases that distort existing views of Navajo society. An overview of the massive literature on the Navajo leads to the identification of 21 distinct genres. These genres and other Navajo texts may profitably be viewed in the perspective of textual analysis, broadly defined. Issues of meaning and interpretation are considered, including the reality-language-text nexus, construction of texts, text-context patterns, and the interaction of text, situation, and analyst in interpretation. Appropriate use of existing texts is socially responsible "green research" and should not be professionally stigmatized. It substitutes resource-efficient recycling of discarded and underanalyzed texts for the old expensive, obtrusive colonial patterns of work.<br>

Abstract: If nations are "imagined communities" as many theorists like to define them, then they need an ideology to create a cohesive imagination. In modern times, the project of writing "history" has been an important instrument in the service of this ideological purpose of justifying and reproducing the modern nation-state as the predestined and legitimate container of collective consciousness. School textbooks, at least in South Asia, have long been among the most exploited media for the presentation of the history of the national collective. This essay is a study of school textbooks in Bangladesh. It looks at narrative representations of selected episodes from the past, both pre- and postindependence, in order to reflect on how they construct "history". Through this work I endeavor to relate textual images to issues of community relations and identity by identifying and sharing the ways in which the audience for nationalist discourse is created, nurtured, and secured through symbolic means.<br>

Abstract: This paper seeks to contribute to the growing body of literature on interpretive policy inquiry. As such, its specific focus is the presentation of the interpretive approach as a corrective for the shortcomings inherent in the standard view. Following an outline of the problems facing the received view, a systematic, philosophically grounded, statement of the interpretive position is developed. Thereafter, the tangible positive consequences for policy making of this approach are further discussed. The paper concludes with some reflections on the relationship between the positivistic and interpretive paradigms.<br>

Abstract: Northrop Frye's recent criticism confronts the contemporary problem raised most powerfully by the Vietnam War-can we find a telos or definition of man on which we can ground our moral reactions and our visions of human development. Frye establishes this telos by an analysis of origins. Contained in a civilization's statements of "concern," in its imaginative treatments of its own condition, one can find an underlying structure of desire which defines the ends of man. This structure and the recurrent images it produces then can serve as the middle terms people use to justify and value their actions. Frye shares his treatment of mediation with contemporary Hegelians like Sartre, Lukács, and Ricoeur, but grounds his absolute in tradition rather than in ideal absolutes or posited evolutionary patterns. Frye's idea of mediation also provides an ethical model for literary criticism: the critic tries to combine literature as product and as cultural possession by interpreting his materials as projections of imaginative desire. Furthermore, we can use Frye to criticize the relativist denial of origins in structuralist critics like Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.<br>

Abstract: This article is an ethnographic exploration of the process through which citizens come to conceptualize their identities as political subjects in rapidly changing contexts. The focus of the article is the lifting, in 2003, of a ban on crossing between the northern and southern parts of the island of Cyprus, which had been instituted in 1974. The article examines how this new political change affected state rhetoric, and concentrates on the reactions of Greek-Cypriot citizens to this shift. These data are related to the wider discussion on the political theory of subjectivity and the concept of 'event', where, it is argued, anthropology has a significant contribution to make. / Le présent article est une exploration ethnographique des processus par lequel les citoyens en viennent à conceptualiser leurs identités comme sujets politiques dans des contextes de changements rapides. Il est centré sur l'abolition, en 2003, de l'interdiction de passage imposée en 1974 entre les parties Nord et Sud de L'île de Chypre. L'auteur examine la manière dont ce nouveau changement politique a affecté la rhétorique étatique, et se concentre sur les réactions des Chypriotes Grecs à cette évolution. Ces données sont replacées dans un cadre de discussion plus large sur la théorie politique de la subjectivité et le concept « d'événement », auquel l'anthropologie peut, selon l'auteur, apporter une contribution importante.<br>

Abstract: The Mexican state's use of revolutionary history to invoke nationalistic sentiments nurtures a lively tradition of storytelling. Ironically, Buena Vista's storytellers criticize the inauthenticity of official representations of the past even as they draw on the images and ideals of "official" history to weave their own tales. This article argues that discourses of authenticity reinscribe historic distinctions between the community and the state in a language which evokes modern notions of purity and truth. The article highlights the political role of discourses of authenticity within the hegemonic structures of modern state power in Mexico.<br>

Abstract: This article develops parallels between how individuals make sense of both lived experience and narrative performance in order to suggest how the process of following a narrative can give rise to affectively engaging states of mind or flows of thought that I term experiential meanings. Although potentiated through the artistry of performance, these meanings result from listeners' own interpretational processes and therefore become experiential resources available for use in their lives.<br>

Abstract: An approach to sociocultural analysis based on the ideas of Vygotsky, Bakhtin, and others is used to provide the foundation for discussing narratives as "cultural tools." The production of official, state sponsored historical narratives is examined from this perspective, and it is argued that this production process may be shaped as much by dialogic encounters with other narratives as by archival information. These claims are harnessed to examine the production of post-Soviet Russian history textbooks, especially their presentation of the events surrounding the Russian Civil War of 1918-20.<br>

Abstract: Most students of Javanese culture and society have used a few crucial native terms and concepts to analyze aspects of traditional etiquette, statecraft, and mysticism. A unitary approach to priyayi ethics, aesthetics, and power is developed here by synthesizing themes common to earlier treatments. Several points of disagreement with Geertz's (1960, 1973) descriptions are discussed in conclusion as a way of drawing out lexicographic aspects of the methodology of interpretive anthropology.

Abstract: The aim of the article is to present some aspects of Paul Ricœur’s thought, especially his reflection on the servile will. Firstly I present Ricœur’s philosophy of will (in the context of phenomenology of the voluntary and involuntary) and the concept of fallibility. Then I demonstrate the main aspects of Ricœurian rethinking and enlarging of Husserl’s phenomenology what leads to hermeneutic formula: the symbol gives rise to thought. Eventually, I argue that Ricœur’s hermeneutic phenomenology creates a specified anthropological view and understanding of the human condition. This understanding will later become a part of the ‘hermeneutics of the self.’<br>

Abstract: Since the founding of this nation, the theater metaphor has had an influence on political discourse. Politicians often invoke the metaphor when they enact political dramas to construct themselves in the image of leader. An argument is presented that former President Ronald Reagan and his political strategists made extensive use of this strategy and were effective in portraying public administrators as evil villains. It is also argued that supporters of the administrative state relied on the theater metaphor as well. In an effort to counter Reagan's negative image of villain, supporters responded by portraying public administrators as heroes and innocent victims. This article suggests that the theater metaphor is problematic when viewed from the perspective of public administration theory and practice. The images of villain, hero and innocent victims emanating from the theater metaphor are troublesome and deserve scrutiny.<br>

Abstract: This article analyzes “Rotología del poroto” by Pablo de Rokha. Our contention states that the bean works as a multiple and complex metaphor, allowing the poetic voice to refer to the nation, the working-class subjects and the political project of the revolution. Each of these categories takes place in a production context marked by the presence of the hacienda and the Cold War scenario. Additionally, the article analyzes how the poem, at the time of enunciation by the speaker, builds a counterpoint between the Chile of yesterday and today to articulate a social protest speech in favor of the working-class subjects of the national community.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the connection between state order and selfunderstandings in everyday life through a case study of the “Boarding School for Gifted Disadvantaged” in Israel. It includes content analysis of governmental protocols that documented the establishment of the boarding school (governmental constitution of a new self-concept) and interviews with sixty of its graduates (self-understandings in everyday life). The findings reveal how the new cultural order invented a new selfhood, “gifted disadvantaged,” previously unknown in Israel. This category is based on structural distinctions between being “naturally” gifted versus the governmental constitution of gifted status. Interviews with graduates indicate that they experience selfhood as a philanthropic gift bestowed on them by the state of Israel and voice their gratitude toward the state. The concluding discussion suggests that the graduates experience their selfhood as “public property.” The self, perceived as having been constructed from outside, is in a continuous dialectic between the presence and the absence of certain personal qualities.<br>

Abstract: Is the most important function of education to provide students with basic skills and useful knowledge in order to eventually become employable? In many parts of the world knowledge league tables and policy documents inform us this is the case. As the question of what should form the educational content seems to be answered, teachers can concentrate on how they should teach, and researchers can concentrate on what method is the most effective. In the current rhetoric, however, many vital pedagogical issues have been placed in the background and the aesthetic subjects are downgraded. These tendencies worried Frede V. Nielsen who stated that didactic studies and philosophical inquiries yet again are needed to explore and give substance to the content dimension. Nielsen's writings on didactics form the basis for this essay, where we highlight which perspectives and dilemmas could be placed on a critical, philosophical didactic study agenda. The starting point is the field of tension between the what and the why of education.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: No doubt the rise of religion has not only posed a particular dilemma for critical theory but also provided a curious place to end this reflection. Having started my career doing philosophy of religion it is somewhat surprising to meet religion again as I turn to what surely must be at least a later phase of my career. I am reminded of Antonio's line from the Italian film
            C'eravamo Tanto Amati, translated asWe All Loved Each Other So Much: “We thought we could change the world, but the world changed us.” “Philosophers only interpret the world, the point is to change it,” so said Marx. But in a curious way those who would change the world are changed by it.<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: I want to conclude with one more argument from my own work. I have very often argued that philosophers of technology, regarding the expectations of society and their own traditions and habits, may come “too late” to technologies. They too often undertake their reflections
            afterthe technologies are in place. Rather, I argue, they should reposition themselves at what I call the “R&D” position where technologies are taking developmental shape, in think tanks, in incubator facilities, in research centers. Only then can truly “new” and emerging technologies be fully philosophically engaged.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: The recent pragmatic-contextual theory of fiction entails the possibility of changes between fact and fiction over the course of time. It is also perhaps commonplace to state that this process can be reversed—that fictional texts may cease to be fictional. The question of generic fiction-to-fact transition, however, is rarely confronted in the theory of fiction. This essay investigates the generic expectations attached to texts that make a full-scale transition from fiction to nonfiction difficult, both culturally and psychologically. “Fiction” is understood here in a limited, pragmatic sense of a work of fiction, a text known and categorized as fiction. The discussion is structured around five interrelated reasons that contribute to the difficulty: (1) the commonness of as-if structures in everyday life; (2) the generic combinations among literature, fiction, factual representation, and narrative; (3) the relative stability of the communal values and ways of checking facts that determine the categories of fiction and fact (the fact convention); (4) the popularity, in fiction, of metalepsis and the theme of transworld travel between different ontological spheres; (5) and the fictionalization of literature in the historical perspective.<br>

Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>

Abstract: Liudmila Ulitskaia’s 2006 novel, Daniel’ Shtain, pervodchik (Daniel Stein, Translator), explores the experience of the Russian-speaking diaspora in the aftermath of World War II through a focus on Jewish immigrants in Israel who convert to Christianity. The novel’s treatment of the divisive topic of Jewish to Christian conversion is enabled by the author’s reliance on the theoretical and allegorical values of translation. Evoking advancements in twentieth-century translation studies through its broad treatment of translation and critique of the investment in the notion of fidelity to the original, be it language or identity, the novel advocates for the acceptance of the transformations and the resulting hybridity of the Jewish diasporic self. Daniel Stein, Translator specifically highlights the influence of the Soviet nationalities policies and the Nazi occupation of eastern Europe on the identity metamorphoses of Soviet Jews. By promoting the legitimacy of the expressions of Jewish identity by immigrants from the USSR through her novel, Ulitskaia proposes an expanded and anti-essentialist view of Jewish identity that would include individuals traditionally viewed as apostates.<br>

Abstract: R.A. Lafferty's reputation for rollicking humor and poetic verve, as demonstrated in such stories as “Narrow Valley” (1966) and “Slow Tuesday Night” (1965) belies the considerable theoretical and narratological complexity of his entire body of work. This article draws on the vocabulary developed by Paul Ricoeur in
         Interpretation Theory(1966) andTime and Narrative(1983–85) to explore Lafferty's process of world creation in light of his startling 1979 announcement that the cognitive world of humanity had come to an end. Thus, in this post-conscious state, it was left to science fiction to develop potential replacements. In his writings Lafferty seeks not only to project new worlds but also to reconstruct the world-building capacity in others, enabling readers and writers alike to collaborate toward a future for humanity.<br>
