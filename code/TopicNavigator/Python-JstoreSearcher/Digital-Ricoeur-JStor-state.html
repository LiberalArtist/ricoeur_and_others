  Abstract: On September 10, 1573, Francisco Cabral (1533–1609), superior of the Jesuit mission in Japan, informed the superior general in Rome (Francisco de Borja [1510–72], who had already died by that time) that the ship of Visitor Gonçalo Álvares (1527–73) had sunk in front of the port of Nagasaki, with immense loss of lives and funds.

  Abstract: In
                  The Public and Its Problems(1927), John Dewey defended the ideal of strong publics. Challenging Walter Lippmann’s pessimistic assessment that modern states were far too complex to be managed by their citizens, Dewey offered a fluid understanding of democracy and the state that highlighted the critical role of robust “public interests.”¹ Yet, as his title suggests, Dewey’s optimism was tempered by a sense that the modern public was in trouble. In the context of expanding technology, bureaucratization, and a dehumanizing standardization of action and association, the public, he argued, was fragmenting. The problem for Dewey, as Robert Asen argues,<br>

  Abstract: A new millennium brought a shift in the privatization debates. In the political realm, the year 2000 ended with great controversy as the winner of the November presidential election remained in doubt even after the polls had closed and the ballots had been counted. The nation focused its attention on the state of Florida, where reported problems with cast ballots placed in doubt the very outcome of the presidential election. Dramatic public statements and courtroom arguments by representatives of both campaigns ended only when the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of

  Abstract: After the armistice, a number of legislative and other endeavors increased Americanization initiatives. In New York, Governor Al Smith composed a Reconstruction Commission to shepherd the state through the postwar period. One of the proposals included in reconstruction enlarged funding and opportunities for Americanization. Proponents, progressive state legislators Abram Elkus and Felix Adler, sought to Americanize the least educated residents of the state. Their Americanization plans remained in keeping with the emotional nationalism of wartime programs. As they wrote in 1919,<br>

  Abstract: From the perspective of realism, writing policy is the least of the tasks of statecraft. Action, not words, is the credo, and written statements are incidental accoutrements/or means of deception/or the hallmark of institutions that lack the force to back up their pronouncements. Once again, however, the realist is caught unaware. As the essays in this section demonstrate, foreign policy is a mixture of manifold practices of composition.

  Abstract: The Oslo Accords could not have occurred without a transformed Palestinian symbol system. Palestinians involved in the Oslo talks recounted that the terms used in describing the Palestinians and the contested land were in dispute at Oslo. However, the Israelis came to accept the phrase “Palestinian people” and the words “West Bank” and “Gaza” rather than “Judea” and “Samaria” to describe a common reality. In turn, the Palestinians recognized the state of Israel.

  Abstract: In 1936 General Francisco Franco and other military leaders revolted against the Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic, plunging the country into a devastating civil war that would last until 1939. American Roman Catholics faced divided loyalties in trying to stake out positions in the public discourse about the war. Hoping that the Republic would become more democratic, and fearful of Francoʹs ʺcrusade,ʺ some Catholics argued for supporting the new Republican government even in the face of its violence against clerics of the state church.

  Abstract: In this chapter we examine the problem of subjectivity as a transformation of lived experience in the wake of civil warfare and formation of the postcolonial nation-state. The specific terms of subjective alteration—collectively imprinted as a clash of political ethos¹ and personally imprinted as a shattering of identity and sentiment—are considered in relation to a culturally produced anguish in the aftermath of a conflict. Our ethnographic illustration of this process is the well-known case of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.² Prior to this political formation in 1975, multiparty warfare was waged throughout a fractured nation, as anticommunist armies<br>

  Abstract: In “The Art of Allusion: Hans-Georg Gadamer’s Philosophical Interventions under National Socialism,” Teresa Orozco accuses Gadamer of having written “Plato and the Poets” to justify Nazi suppression of liberal humanist education and “Plato’s Educational State” to support national conservative efforts to reform the regime. Geoffrey Waite repeats her accusation in “Radio Nietzsche.” Whereas most twentieth-century readers of Nietzsche have unintentionally fostered his elitist politics by adopting a perspectivist reading, Waite charges, Orozco shows that Gadamer did so intentionally.

Considering the narrative utopia from its earliest manifestation in Thomas More's sixteenth-century work
      Utopiato some of the most influential utopias of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this book is an astute study of a literary genre as well as a nuanced dialectical meditation on the history of utopian thinking as a quintessential history of modernity. As he unravels the dialectics at work in the utopian narrative, Wegner gives an ambitious synthetic discussion of theories of modernity, considering and evaluating the ideas of writers such as Ernst Bloch, Louis Marin, Gilles Deleuze, Walter Benjamin, Martin Heidegger, Henri Lefebvre, Paul de Man, Karl Mannheim, Mikhail Bakhtin, Jürgen Habermas, Slavoj Zizek, and Homi Bhabha.<br>

  Book Title: Reconfiguring Modernity-Concepts of Nature in Japanese Political Ideology<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Thomas Julia Adeney<br>
  Abstract: Julia Adeney Thomas turns the concept of nature into a powerful analytical lens through which to view Japanese modernity, bringing the study of both Japanese history and political modernity to a new level of clarity. She shows that nature necessarily functions as a political concept and that changing ideas of nature's political authority were central during Japan's transformation from a semifeudal world to an industrializing colonial empire. In political documents from the nineteenth to the early twentieth century, nature was redefined, moving from the universal, spatial concept of the Tokugawa period, through temporal, social Darwinian ideas of inevitable progress and competitive struggle, to a celebration of Japan as a nation uniquely in harmony with nature. The so-called traditional "Japanese love of nature" masks modern state power. Thomas's theoretically sophisticated study rejects the supposition that modernity is the ideological antithesis of nature, overcoming the determinism of the physical environment through technology and liberating denatured subjects from the chains of biology and tradition. In making "nature" available as a critical term for political analysis, this book yields new insights into prewar Japan's failure to achieve liberal democracy, as well as an alternative means of understanding modernity and the position of non-Western nations within it.<br>

  Author(s): Steedly Mary Margaret<br>
  Abstract: On August 17, 1945, Indonesia proclaimed its independence from Dutch colonial rule. Five years later, the Republic of Indonesia was recognized as a unified, sovereign state. The period in between was a time of aspiration, mobilization, and violence, in which nationalists fought to expel the Dutch while also trying to come to grips with the meaning of "independence."
      Rifle Reportsis an ethnographic history of this extraordinary time as it was experienced on the outskirts of the nation among Karo Batak villagers in the rural highlands of North Sumatra. Based on extensive interviews and conversations with Karo veterans,Rifle Reportsinterweaves personal and family memories, songs and stories, memoirs and local histories, photographs and monuments, to trace the variously tangled and perhaps incompletely understood ways that Karo women and men contributed to the founding of the Indonesian nation. The routes they followed are divergent, difficult, sometimes wavering, and rarely obvious, but they are clearly marked with the signs of gender. This innovative historical study of nationalism and decolonization is an anthropological exploration of the gendering of wartime experience, as well as an inquiry into the work of storytelling as memory practice and ethnographic genre.<br>

  Abstract: The evacuees’ return to their homes after the Renville Accord was not the end of the struggle, though it does provide a convenient stopping point for my story of Indonesian independence. The events that followed had more to do with the consolidation of the state than with the idea of independence. During the yearlong hiatus in the fighting, Indonesians turned their attention to matters of administration and governance, political routinization, and military reorganization. The army set up new training programs emphasizing guerrilla warfare, clarified and strengthened its chain of command, and endeavored to enhance the discipline and esprit of the<br>

  Abstract: Fiction and history in the era after World War II are interlocking journeys by immigrants to America’s shores. This immigrant tide in contemporary American fiction is global, flowing across diasporas, borders, and postcolonial terrains. From the Holocaust to the Haitian and Cuban boatlifts, many of the departures and arrivals are reflections of recent historical traumas, creating in fiction what Bharati Mukherjee terms “odysseys of dislocation” (Woodford 2). Immigration for America’s short story writers and novelists today is the representation of radically new desires by the world’s uprooted peoples, an allegory chronicling the evolution of a multicultural nation-state.<br>

  Abstract: The whole of creation history includes, among other things, human history. Perhaps the emerging field of Big History is the closest secular counterpart to the theologian’s creation history. Within the cosmic hsitory of creation, systematic theologians commonly include an anthropology—an explication of what is human—in their explication of Christian doctrine. Sometimes the anthropology appears between expositions of the First and Second Articles of the creeds—that is, between explications of God as Father and God as Son. The sorry state of the human condition explains why the good creation is in need of redemption. So theological anthropology fits<br>

  Book Title: Questioning the Human: Toward a Theological Anthropology for the Twenty-First Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Van Stichel Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology is being put to the test: in the face of contemporary developments in the spheres of culture, politics, and science, traditional perspectives on the human person are no longer adequate. Yet can theological anthropology move beyond its previously established categories and renew itself in relation to contemporary insights? The present collection of essays sets out to answer this question. Uniting Roman Catholic theologians from across the globe, it tackles from a theological perspective challenges related to the classical natural law tradition (part 1), to the modern conception of the subject (part 2), and to the postmodern awareness of diversity in a globalizing context (part 3). Its contributors share a fundamental methodological choice of a critical-constructive dialogue with contemporary culture, science, and philosophy. This collection integrates a wider range of approaches than one usually finds in theological volumes, bringing together experts in systematic theology and in theological ethics. Authors come from different American contexts, including Black and Latino, and from a European context that include both French and German. Moreover, the interdisciplinary insights upon which the different contributions draw stem from both the natural sciences (such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and ethology) and the humanities (such as cultural studies, philosophy, and hermeneutics). This volume will be essential reading for anyone seeking a state-of-the-art account of theological anthropology, of the uncertainties it is facing, and of the responses it is in the process of formulating. The shared Roman Catholic background of the authors of this collection makes this volume a helpful complement to recent publications that predominantly represent views from other theological traditions.<br>

  Book Title: Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatter Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Tocqueville suggested that the people reign in the American political world like God over the universe.This intuition anticipates the crisis in the secularization paradigm that has brought theology back as a fundamental part of sociological and political analysis. It has become more difficult to believe that humanity's progress necessarily leads to atheism, or that it is possible to translate all that is good about religion into reasonable terms acceptable in principle by all, believers as well as nonbelievers. And yet, the spread of Enlightenment values, of an independent public sphere, and of alternative projects of modernitycontinues unabated and is by no means the antithesis of the renewed vigor of religious beliefs.The essays in this book shed interdisciplinary and multicultural light on a hypothesis that helps to account for such an unexpected convergence of enlightenment and religion in our times: Religion has reentered the public sphere because it puts into question the relation between God and the concept of political sovereignty.In the first part, Religion and Polity-Building,new perspectives are brought to bear on the tension-ridden connection between theophany and state-building from the perspective of world religions. Globalized, neo-liberal capitalism has been another crucial factor in loosening the bond between God and the state, as the essays in the second part, The End of the Saeculum and Global Capitalism,show.The essays in the third part, Questioning Sovereignty: Law and Justice,are dedicated to a critique of the premises of political theology, starting from the possibility of a prior, perhaps deeper relation between democracy and theocracy. The book concludes with three innovative essays dedicated to examining Tocqueville in order to think the Religion of Democracybeyond the idea of civil religion.<br>

  Abstract: Some scholars and laypersons alike worry aloud about the current state of African American Christianity. They witness, especially on television, what many take to be peculiar performances of African American religiosity often draped in tailor-made suits with matching alligator shoes. They see enormous sanctuaries and massive gatherings of worshippers enraptured by very charismatic personalities who proclaim the word of God and offer a blueprint for individual healing. For some, these events—and they are events in scale and in emotion—confirm the somewhat standard claim that the tone and timbre of Pentecostalism have come to dominate African American religious expression,<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking God as Gift: Marion, Derrida, and the Limits of Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Horner Robyn<br>
  Abstract: Rethinking God as Gift is situated at the intersection of philosophy, critical theory and theology. The first sustained study of the work of Jean-Luc Marion in English, it offers a unique perspective on contemporary questions and their theological relevance. Taking its point of departure from the problem of the gift as articulated by Jacques Derrida, who argues that the conditions of possibility of the gift are also its conditions of impossibility, Horner pursues a series of questions concerning the nature of thought, the viability of phenomenology, and, most urgently, the possibility of grace. For Marion, phenomenology, as the thought of the given, offers a path for philosophy to proceed without being implicated in metaphysics. His retrieval of several important insights of Edmund Husserl, along with his reading of Martin Heidegger and Emmanuel Lvinas, enables him to work out a phenomenology where even impossiblephenomena such as revelation and the gift might be examined. In this important confrontation between Marion and Derrida issues vital to the negotiation of postmodern concerns in philosophy and theology emerge with vigour. The careful elucidation of those issues in an interdisciplinary context, and the snapshot it provides of the state of contemporary debate, make Rethinking God as Gift an important contribution to theological and philosophical discussion.<br>

  Book Title: Finding God in All Things: Celebrating Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stagaman David<br>
  Abstract: Three of the most influential Catholic theologians of the twentieth century-Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-were all born in 1904, at the height of the Church's most militant rhetoric against all things modern. In this culture of suspicion, Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner grew in faith to join the Society of Jesus and struggled with the burden of antimodernist policies in their formation. By the time of their mature work in the 1950s and 1960s, they had helped to redefine the critical dialogue between modern thought and contemporary Catholic theology. After the dtente of the Second Vatican Council, they brought Catholic tradition into closer relationship to modern philosophy, history, and politics. Written by leading scholars, friends, and family members, these original essays celebrate the legacies of Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner after a century of theological development. Offering a broad range of perspectives on their lives and works, the essays blend personal and anecdotal accounts with incisive critical appraisals. Together, they offer an accessible introduction to the distinctive character of three great thinkers and how their work shapes the way Catholics think and talk about God, Church, and State.<br>

  Book Title: Reading the Allegorical Intertext: Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: Judith H. Anderson conceives the intertext as a relation between or among texts that encompasses both Kristevan intertextuality and traditional relationships of influence, imitation, allusion, and citation. Like the Internet, the intertext is a state, or place, of potential expressed in ways ranging from deliberate emulation to linguistic free play. Relatedly, the intertext is also a convenient fiction that enables examination of individual agency and sociocultural determinism. Anderson's intertext is allegorical because Spenser's Faerie Queene is pivotal to her study and because allegory, understood as continued or moving metaphor, encapsulates, even as it magnifies, the process of signification. Her title signals the variousness of an intertext extending from Chaucer through Shakespeare to Milton and the breadth of allegory itself. Literary allegory, in Anderson's view, is at once a mimetic form and a psychic one-a process thinking that combines mind with matter, emblem with narrative, abstraction with history. Anderson's first section focuses on relations between Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Spenser's The Faerie Queene, including the role of the narrator, the nature of the textual source, the dynamics of influence, and the bearing of allegorical narrative on lyric vision. The second centers on agency and cultural influence in a variety of Spenserian and medieval texts. Allegorical form, a recurrent concern throughout, becomes the pressing issue of section three. This section treats plays and poems of Shakespeare and Milton and includes two intertextually relevant essays on Spenser.How Paradise Lost or Shakespeare's plays participate in allegorical form is controversial. Spenser's experiments with allegory revise its form, and this intervention is largely what Shakespeare and Milton find in his poetry and develop. Anderson's book, the result of decades of teaching and writing about allegory, especially Spenserian allegory, will reorient thinking about fundamenta~<br>

  Author(s) Hershock Peter D.<br>
  Abstract: Developments in science, medicine, technology, and national economies have rapidly resulted in aging societies in both developed and developing countries around the world. The increasingly large number of elderly people has caused various problems to the political and economic systems of societies, including family structure, ethical relationships, lifestyles, and values, as well as to the emotional state of their members. Neither the spontaneous capitalistic market nor a state welfare system can easily resolve these issues. In a modern market economy ruled by the logic of capital and profit, elderly people, who, usually unemployed, are considered mere consumers, thus present a<br>

  Book Title: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan-Modernity, Loss, and the Doing of History<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Karlin Jason G.<br>
  Abstract: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan is a historical analysis of the discourses of nostalgia in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japan. Through an analysis of the experience of rapid social change in Japan’s modernization, it argues that fads (ryūkō) and the desires they express are central to understanding Japanese modernity, conceptions of gender, and discourses of nationalism. In doing so, the author uncovers the myth of eternal return that lurks below the surface of Japanese history as an expression of the desire to find meaning amid the chaos and alienation of modern times. The Meiji period (1868–1912) was one of rapid change that hastened the process of forgetting: The state’s aggressive program of modernization required the repression of history and memory. However, repression merely produced new forms of desire seeking a return to the past, with the result that competing or alternative conceptions of the nation haunted the history of modern Japan. Rooted in the belief that the nation was a natural and organic entity that predated the rational, modern state, such conceptions often were responses to modernity that envisioned the nation in opposition to the modern state. What these visions of the nation shared was the ironic desire to overcome the modern condition by seeking the timeless past. While the condition of their repression was often linked to the modernizing policies of the Meiji state, the means for imagining the nation in opposition to the state required the construction of new symbols that claimed the authority of history and appealed to a rearticulated tradition. Through the idiom of gender and nation, new reified representations of continuity, timelessness, and history were fashioned to compensate for the unmooring of inherited practices from the shared locales of everyday life. This book examines the intellectual, social, and cultural factors that contributed to the rapid spread of Western tastes and styles, along with the backlash again~<br>

  Abstract: I began this book by considering how the Meiji Restoration had nurtured the sentiment that the revolution was incomplete. The calls to action that adhered around the notion of the “incomplete Restoration” in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were (re)productive of the myth of the Meiji Restoration. For both the state and its critics, revolutionary action was legitimized by invoking the Restoration: the state pursued the modernization of all aspects of social life, denouncing customs and practices incompatible with its ideology of progress as backward and barbarous, while its opponents condemned the state for its decadence and superficiality arising from<br>

In large part, the breakdown of the Confucian order stemmed from the gradual decline of the Chosŏn state (1392–1910) during the nineteenth century, a period when the government showed signs of failing to live up to its role as the benevolent Confucian leader that provided for the<br>

  Abstract: Most current talk of forgiveness and reconciliation in the aftermath of collective violence proceeds from an assumption that forgiveness is always superior to resentment and refusal to forgive. Victims who demonstrate a willingness to forgive are often celebrated as virtuous moral models, while those who refuse to forgive are frequently seen as suffering from a pathology. Resentment is viewed as a negative state, held by victims who are not "ready" or "capable" of forgiving and healing.<br>

  Book Title: The Executed God-The Way of the Cross in Lockdown America<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Taylor Mark Lewis<br>
  Abstract: The new edition of Mark Lewis Taylor’s award-winning The Executed God is both a searing indictment of the structures of “Lockdown America" and a visionary statement of hope. It is also a call for action to Jesus followers to resist US imperial projects and power. Outlining a “theatrics of state terror," Taylor identifies and analyzes its instruments—mass incarceration, militarized police tactics, surveillance, torture, immigrant repression, and capital punishment—through which a racist and corporatized Lockdown America enforces in the US a global neoliberal economic and political imperialism. Against this, The Executed God proposes a “counter-theatrics to state terror," a declamation of the way of the cross for Jesus followers that unmasks the powers of US state domination and enacts an adversarial politics of resistance, artful dramatic actions, and the building of peoples’ movements. These are all intrinsic to a Christian politics of remembrance of the Jesus executed by empire. Heralded in its first edition, this new edition is thoroughly revised, updated, and expanded, offering a demanding rethinking and recreating of what being a Christian is and of how Christianity should dream, hope, mobilize, and act to bring about what Taylor terms “a liberating material spirituality" to unseat the state that kills.<br>

  Book Title: Britain and Africa Under Blair-In pursuit of the good state<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gallagher Julia<br>
  Abstract: Africa was a key focus of Britain’s foreign policy under Tony Blair. Military intervention in Sierra Leone, increases in aid and debt relief, and grand initiatives such as the Commission for Africa established the continent as a place in which Britain could ‘do good’. Britain and Africa under Blair: in pursuit of the good state critically explores Britain’s fascination with Africa. It argues that, under New Labour, Africa represented an area of policy that appeared to transcend politics. Gradually, it came to embody an ideal state activity around which politicians, officials and the wider public could coalesce, leaving behind more contentious domestic and international issues. Building on the story of Britain and Africa under Blair, the book draws wider conclusions about the role of ‘good’ and idealism in foreign policy. In particular, it discusses how international relationships provide opportunities to create and pursue ideals, and why they are essential for the wellbeing of political communities. It argues that state actors project the idea of ‘good’ onto idealised, distant objects, in order to restore a sense of the ‘good state’. The book makes a distinctive and original contribution to debates about the role of ethics in international relations and will be of particular interest to academics, policy-makers and students of international relations, Africa and British foreign policy, and to anyone interested in ethics in international affairs.<br>

  Abstract: This book has been about the way in which Britain under New Labour ‘did good’ in Africa as a way of creating a central core of ideal activity for the state. The themes and approaches contained within this trend were not new, but drew on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century ideas about the continent and Britain’s role there. I have suggested that the creation of a good project formed an important part of protecting the state from internal ambiguity and decay, by creating a utopian core at the heart of what it does.<br>

Inherently interdisciplinary, his work ranges widely through Caribbean and Haitian thought, historiography, political discourse, literature, film, religion, and ecocriticism in its exploration of whether culture in these various forms can shape the future of a country.<br>

  Book Title: Child Sexual Abuse, Society, and the Future of the Church-  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Regan Hilary D<br>
  Abstract: In November 2012 the Australian federal government announced the establishment of a ‘Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse’. This Royal Commission was set up after many years of reports of sexual abuse in Australia within religious institutions of various Christian churches, some state government inquiries and in the context of inquiries in other countries, most notably Ireland. The Royal Commission began its first hearing in April 2013. It has been forecast that the Commission will be hearing submissions for a number of years from witnesses, both from those who ask to speak to the Royal Commissioners and from those who will be asked to appear before the Commission. At the same time as the establishment of the Royal Commission, the Catholic Church in Australia established a Truth, Justice and healing Council to oversee the Catholic Church’s engagement with the Royal Commission. This collection brings together essays from biblical scholars, a church historian, theologians, ministers of religion from a number of churches, lawyers and a psychologist. They each address the issues of sexual abuse, society and the church in the context of the Australian inquiries. The volume ends with an overview of the processes engaged with by the Catholic Church and the State in the Republic of Ireland and reactions to these inquiries. The volume of essays considers sexual abuse from the perspective of the victims. What is to be done about the mess we are in over clerical sexual abuse?

  Abstract: The Catholic Church in the Republic of Ireland would seem to be the most closely investigated of all the entities that make up the Catholic Church worldwide. Over a period of just over ten years, many of its dioceses, religious orders, and child-care institutions have been closely examined in reports issued by judicially-lead teams appointed by the state. Most of these investigations arose in response to information uncovered and published in some pioneering television programmes.<br>

Born not of woman but created by God on the sixth day, Adam and Eve live in the Garden of Eden in a state that knows no sorrow, no toil, and, above all, no death. Already freed from the human condition of being born an infant, Edenic humanity is also missing the fundamental characteristic recognized as human by nearly all cultures: mortality.

The army was on the front lines of these events. The whole army. Not just a group of specialized troops. In Algeria, the first units to disembark in 1830 belonged to troops that would later be called “metropolitans.” The state’s will under the Third Republic to associate the nation with conquest explains the decision to send draftees to Madagascar in 1895.

If such an undertaking might be deemed risky, it is because of Cavell’s own repeated resistance toward certain Christian depictions of the human state as helpless, fixed, awaiting supernatural aid, pursuing untimely theologizing, and the like. This resistance has been emphasized by his commentators and has often been taken as Cavell’s prevalent attitude.

  Book Title: Cities of Affluence and Anger-A Literary Geography of Modern Englishness<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): KALLINEY PETER J.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a compact literary history of the twentieth century in England, Cities of Affluence and Anger studies the problematic terms of national identity during England's transition from an imperial power to its integration in the global cultural marketplace. While the countryside had been the dominant symbol of Englishness throughout the previous century, modern literature began to turn more and more to the city to redraw the boundaries of a contemporary cultural polity. The urban class system, paradoxically, still functioned as a marker of wealth, status, and hierarchy throughout this long period of self-examination, but it also became a way to project a common culture and mitigate other forms of difference. Local class politics were transformed in such a way that enabled the English to reframe a highly provisional national unity in the context of imperial disintegration, postcolonial immigration, and, later, globalization.Kalliney plots the decline of the country-house novel through an analysis of Forster's Howards End and Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, each ruthless in its sabotage of the trope of bucolic harmony. The traditionally pastoral focus of English fiction gives way to a high-modernist urban narrative, exemplified by Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, and, later, to realists such as Osborne and Sillitoe, through whose work Kalliney explores postwar urban expansion and the cultural politics of the welfare state. Offering fresh new readings of Lessing's The Golden Notebook and Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, the author considers the postwar appropriation of domesticity, the emergence of postcolonial literature, and the renovation of travel narratives in the context of globalization. Kalliney suggests that it is largely one city--London--through which national identity has been reframed. How and why this transition came about is a process that Cities of Affluence and Anger depicts with exceptional insight and originality.<br>

  Abstract: I turn now from these performances of memory by state or cultural institutions to look at embodied repertoires in the public sphere and in theatres. While the TRC clearly attempted to hear hidden stories and renegotiate the perceptions and values of South Africans, its effect was limited because a state of mind, values, and peoples’ views cannot be easily changed. Thus the extent to which the creative arts can facilitate further dialogue on the past and what the ‘rainbow nation’ means for individual people are important insofar as the arts can reach local communities in spaces outside of everyday reality.<br>

  Book Title: Truth Commissions-Memory, Power, and Legitimacy<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Bakiner Onur<br>
  Abstract: Bakiner demonstrates how truth commissions have recovered basic facts about human rights violations, forced societies to rethink the violence and exclusion of nation building, and produced a new dynamic whereby the state seeks to legitimize its central position between history and politics by accepting a high degree of societal penetration into the production and diffusion of official national history. By doing so, truth commissions have challenged and transformed public discourses on memory, truth, justice, reconciliation, recognition, nationalism, and political legitimacy in the contemporary world.<br>

  Book Title: Chora 7-Intervals in the Philosophy of Architecture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Parcell Stephen<br>
  Abstract: For over twenty years, the Chora series has received international acclaim for its excellence in interdisciplinary research on architecture. The seven volumes of Chora have challenged readers to consider alternatives to conventional aesthetic and technological concepts. The seventy-eight authors and eighty-seven scholarly essays in the series have investigated profound cultural roots of architecture and revealed rich possibilities for architecture and its related disciplines. Chora 7, the final volume in the series, includes fifteen essays on architectural topics from around the world (France, Greece, Iran, Italy, Korea, and the United States) and from diverse cultures (antiquity, Renaissance Italy, early modern France, and the past hundred years). Thematically, they bring original approaches to human experience, theatre, architectural creation, and historical origins. Readers will also gain insights into theoretical and practical work by architects and artists such as Leon Battista Alberti, Peter Brook, Douglas Darden, Filarete, Andy Goldsworthy, Anselm Kiefer, Frederick Kiesler, Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, and Peter Zumthor. Contributors to Chora 7 include Anne Bordeleau (University of Waterloo), Diana Cheng (Montreal), Negin Djavaherian (Montreal), Paul Emmons (Washington-Alexandria Architecture Center of Virginia Tech), Paul Holmquist (McGill University), Ron Jelaco (McGill University), Yoonchun Jung (Kyoto University), Christos Kakalis (Edinburgh School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture), Lisa Landrum (University of Manitoba), Robert Nelson (Monash University), Marc J Neveu (Woodbury University), Alberto Pérez-Gómez (McGill University), Angeliki Sioli (Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education), Nikolaos-Ion Terzoglou (National Technical University of Athens), and Stephen Wischer (North Dakota State University).<br>

  Abstract: The gnostic movement that, in Irenaeus’s day, threatened to engulf Christianity subsided gradually into an underground current that would rise to the surface but sporadically in subsequent Christian history. Meanwhile, the Christian church soon advanced from being a persecuted minority to become the state religion of the Roman Empire, and eventually, in many ways, its successor. Once the age of martyrs gave way to Christendom, the sacralized political order on which Christendom rested would create tensions of its own and these, nine centuries after Irenaeus, provide the setting for the next work to claim our attention, Anselm of Canterbury’s

  Abstract: This important volume investigates the many forms of Catholic activism in Latin America between the 1890s and 1962 (from the publication of the papal encyclical Rerum Novarum to the years just prior to the Second Vatican Council). It argues that this period saw a variety of lay and clerical responses to the social changes wrought by industrialization, political upheavals and mass movements, and increasing secularization. Spurred by these local developments as well as by initiatives from the Vatican, and galvanized by national projects of secular state-building, Catholic activists across Latin America developed new ways of organizing in order to effect social and political change within their communities.<br>

  Book Title: Grand Hotel Abyss-Desire, Recognition and the Restoration of the Subject<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Safatle Vladimir<br>
  Abstract: Long-expected translation of the Portuguese academic bestseller Grande Hotel Abismo. In the last two decades recognition - arguably one of the most central notions of the dialectical tradition since Hegel - has once again become a crucial philosophical theme. Nevertheless, the new theories of recognition fail to provide room for reflection on transformation processes in politics and morality. This book aims to recover the disruptive nature of the dialectical tradition by means of a severe critique of the dominance of an anthropology of the individual identity in contemporary theories of recognition. This critique implies a thorough rethinking of basic concepts such as desire, negativity, will and drive, with Hegel, Lacan and Adorno being our main guides. The Marxist philosopher György Lukács said that the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer, Adorno, etc.) left us with nothing but negativity towards the state of the world. Their work failed to open up a concrete possibility of practical engagement in this world. All too eager to describe the impasses of reason, the Frankfurt philosphers remained trapped in a metaphorical Grand Hotel Abyss (Grand Hotel Abgrund). It was as living and being guardian of lettered civilization in a beautiful and melancholy grand hotel, of which the balconies face a gaping abyss. But perhaps in this way Lukács gave – and no doubt without realizing it himself – a perfect definition of contemporary philosophy, namely to confront chaos, to peer into what appears to a certain rationality as an abyss and to feel good about it. Touching Hegelian dialectics, critical theory and psychoanalysis, Grand Hotel Abyss gives a new meaning to the notion of negativity as the first essential step for rethinking political and moral engagement.<br>

Then, a third textual movement attempted an articulation of subjectivity, history and infinity, the foremost aim of which was to show that the Hegelian subject exceeds all egological reductions, analytics of finitude or anthropological limitations. That is to say, Hegel leaves us with a subject sufficiently inclusive to allow for both reflections on models of institutional association, as well as modes of determination or the process of<br>

  Abstract: The present state of memory studies requires a particular attention to the transmission of what has been accumulated in this field since the 1970s. That was a decade in which many of the energies that had been employed in direct political activism during the previous decade were translated into cultural terms, opening up new areas of research, in which memory was central. I am thinking of the role memory has played over the past four decades in the constitution of cultural history and cultural studies in general, and more specifically of gender studies, cinema and literary studies, area studies, age<br>

  Book Title: Provocations to Reading: J. Hillis Miller and the Democracy to Come-J. Hillis Miller and the Democracy to Come<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kujundžić Dragan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a marker of the state of theorytoday. Its rich array of wideranging essays explores the dimensions and implications of the work of J. Hillis Miller, one of the most eminent literary scholars in America. For nearly half a century, Miller has been known for his close and imaginative engagement with the implications of European philosophical thought and for his passionate advocacy of close reading.Building on this intellectual legacy, the contributors instantiate and extend the practice and ethics of sustained close reading that is Miller's hallmark. The book culminates in a moving piece by Jacques Derrida, Miller's close friend of forty years, who engages Miller's readings of Gerard Manley Hopkins in a historic encounter between French philosophy and American reading practices.A provocation to reading for new generations of students and teachers, these essays offer important resources for grasping the question of language in historical perspective and in contemporary life-a task essential for any democratic future. Barbara Cohen is Director of HumaniTech at the University of California, Irvine. She is co-editor of Material Events: Paul de Man and the Afterlife of Theory. Dragan Kujunzic is Professor of Russian and Comparative Literature and Director of Russian Studies at the University of California, Irvine.

Out of the flat geometrical order, war emerges as a fully formed three-dimensional world governed by an operational dynamic that allows only hypothetical scenarios, average truths, a spectrum of probabilities. In its tremendous complexity, war is a blurry object in which a pervasive disorder obtains.

  Abstract: Freud’s reading of Jewish history, centered around the return to group consciousness of the long repressed memory of the primeval Father, did not end with Moses or the Hebrew prophets. Yes, Moses created the Jews and Judaism by restoring the Father to them alone, through his own person and in the teaching of the one omnipotent God of the universe. Following his death this revelation was repressed in turn, only to reemerge from its state of unconscious latency in the teachings of the prophets, which would become the common patrimony of the entire Jewish people.<br>

  Abstract: The present book is an attempt to grapple with Yoder’s critics in order to decide how to move forward with a revised “Yoderian" theology. Pitts suggests how that revision should be accomplished by first providing an overview of the current state of Yoder scholarship and this book’s place within it; then proposing an argument that Yoder’s theology can profitably read as a “sociological theology" that exhibits reductive tendencies, but which can be revised to be non-reductive; and finally offering an outline and justification of the proposed method of revision, which involves putting Yoder’s theology of the principalities and powers into conversation with the reflexive sociology of Pierre Bourdieu.<br>

In imitation of the politics of Jesus, Christian communities are to share goods, welcome the excluded, and practice reconciliation, servant leadership, and the priesthood of believers.¹ When it does these things, the church becomes “a proclamation of the lordship of Christ to the powers from whose dominion the church has begun to be liberated.”² Through faithfulness to its master, not compromise, the church fulfills its call “to contribute to the creation of structures more worthy of human society.”³<br>

  Book Title: Dealing with Dictators-The United States, Hungary, and East Central Europe, 1942-1989<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): VINCZ JASON<br>
  Abstract: Dealing with Dictators explores America's Cold War efforts to make the dictatorships of Eastern Europe less tyrannical and more responsive to the country's international interests. During this period, US policies were a mix of economic and psychological warfare, subversion, cultural and economic penetration, and coercive diplomacy. Through careful examination of American and Hungarian sources, László Borhi assesses why some policies toward Hungary achieved their goals while others were not successful. When George H. W. Bush exclaimed to Mikhail Gorbachev on the day the Soviet Union collapsed, "Together we liberated Eastern Europe and unified Germany," he was hardly doing justice to the complicated history of the era. The story of the process by which the transition from Soviet satellite to independent state occurred in Hungary sheds light on the dynamics of systemic change in international politics at the end of the Cold War.<br>

Although it is hard to pinpoint why one country remains docile under tyrannical rule while another revolts, historians have dedicated years of research to identifying the specific factors that led to the only armed uprising against Soviet rule. Because virtually all segments of Hungarian society had suffered various forms of repression, unrest was not confined to the capital city. Centrally engineered “circular social mobility” failed to satisfy even the social groups whose aspirations the regime had privileged.¹ Grievances included foreign military occupation, state terror that sometimes exceeded even the limits of Soviet tolerance, serious<br>

These authors make it seem nearly impossible to be a postmodern atheist—that atheism goes when theism does. Of course, unbelief is surely still possible, but it takes an altogether different form, in this version of the postmodern story.

  Author(s): Adams Edward<br>
  Abstract: In his work 'Deliverance of God' Douglas Campbell presents what Chris Tilling considers a "complete rereading of Paul’s letters that genuinely offers a way beyond problems associated with old and new perspectives. And his resultant picture of Paul’s theology generally, and the Apostle’s soteriology particularly, is beautiful, liberating, consistent, exegetically rigorous, theologically aware and pastorally compelling. It captures, I think, the best of the old perspective, with its concern to speak energetically about the God who saves, and it takes seriously the concerns of the new perspective on Second Temple Judaism. But in remarkable and jarringly elegant ways, it moves beyond them both." This collection of essays is divided into two sections. Part One analyses key aspects of Campbell’s account of the problem confronting readers of Paul. Part Two analyses key aspects of Campbell’s proposed solution to to the current confused state of Pauline interpretation. This book is essential reading for anyone involved in the study of Paul.<br>

  Abstract: Who or what determines the credit granted to Houellebecq’s work and to himself, as a writer? Is it appropriate to ask about the sincerity or authority of his novel’s denunciation of the rotten state of Western culture? What clues would we have to answer this question, or does trust come before the clues? What is the role in such an ethos attribution of clues derived from an author’s public image? Drawing on a combination of approaches and models, this chapter engages with the social fabrication of meaning and the literary value of narratives and with the role of authorial ethos<br>

  Abstract: Loneliness is an unnatural and unwanted state of isolation in which the individual cannot thrive.¹ It is not to be confused with solitude, which may be sought and savored. Loneliness is often seen as a feature of modernity, associated with the breakdown of traditional communities and extended family structures. In the second half of the twentieth century it was identified more as a product of Western capitalist societies, which tend to atom ize individuals, than of Eastern bloc societies. The latter attempted to unite their citizens through socialist values and central planning, while in practice often uniting them in disaffection.<br>

  Abstract: The Grecanici of Southern Italyprovides a comprehensive ethnography that examines the ways the minority developed and sustain enduring cultural forms of solidarity and relatedness. Stavroula Pipyrou proposes the concept of "fearless governance" to describe overlapping and sometimes contradictory systems of power, authority, and relational networks that enable the Grecanici to achieve political representation at the intersection of local, national, and global encounters. Refuting easy assumptions of top-down governmental influence, Pipyrou shows how the Grecanici find political representation through the European Union and UNESCO, state policy, civic associations, family networks and illegal organizations; not being afraid to take risks, incur wrath, lose friends, or risk death in challenging the political status-quo.<br>

  Abstract: A prolific number of studies on minorities have shed light on the historical and political genealogies of what is meant by minority status in Europe (see Cowan 2000, 2010). Scholars such as Jennifer Jackson Preece (1997), Mark Mazower (2004), and Jane Cowan (2010) examine the historical predicament of developing a comprehensive UN framework toward the protection of minority populations after 1918. Looking at the issue of the minorities from a top-down perspective, these studies delve deeply into the logics of treaties and the thorny position of minority recognition on a pan-European level. Subsequently, nation-state recognition of minorities was a criterion<br>

  Author(s): Curtis Sarah A.<br>
  Abstract: What does it mean to be French? What constitutes "Frenchness"? Is it birth, language, attachment to republicanism, adherence to cultural norms? In contemporary France, these questions resonate in light of the large number of non-French and non-European immigrants, many from former French colonies, who have made France home in recent decades. Historically, French identity has long been understood as the product of a centralized state and culture emanating from Paris that was itself central to European history and civilization. Likewise, French identity in terms of class, gender, nationality, and religion mainly has been explained as a strong, indivisible core, against which marginal actors have been defined.<br>

  Abstract: Based on a decade's work in Ginzburg's archives, the book discusses previously unknown manuscripts and uncovers a wealth of new information about the author's life, focusing on Ginzburg's quest for a new kind of writing adequate to her times. She writes of universal experiences-frustrated love, professional failures, remorse, aging-and explores the modern fragmentation of identity in the context of war, terror, and an oppressive state. Searching for a new concept of the self, and deeming the psychological novel (a beloved academic specialty) inadequate to express this concept, Ginzburg turned to fragmentary narratives that blur the lines between history, autobiography, and fiction.<br>

  Book Title: Firewalking and Religious Healing-The Anastenaria of Greece and the American Firewalking Movement<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Danforth Loring M.<br>
  Abstract: "If the Saint calls you, if you have an open road, then you don't feel the fire as if it were your enemy," says one of the participants in the Anastenaria. This compelling work evokes and contrasts two forms of firewalking and religious healing: first, the Anastenaria, a northern Greek ritual in which people who are possessed by Saint Constantine dance dramatically over red-hot coals, and, second, American firewalking, one of the more spectacular activities of New Age psychology. Loring Danforth not only analyzes these rituals in light of the most recent work in medical and symbolic anthropology but also describes in detail the lives of individual firewalkers, involving the reader personally in their experiences: he views ritual therapy as a process of transformation and empowerment through which people are metaphorically moved from a state of illness to a state of health. Danforth shows that the Anastenaria and the songs accompanying it allow people to express and resolve conflict-laden family relationships that may lead to certain kinds of illnesses. He also demonstrates how women use the ritual to gain a sense of power and control over their lives without actually challenging the ideology of male dominance that pervades Greek culture. Comparing the Anastenaria with American firewalking, Danforth includes a gripping account of his own participation in a firewalk in rural Maine. Finally he examines the place of anthropology in a postmodern world in which the boundaries between cultures are becoming increasingly blurred.<br>

  Book Title: Taking Hold of the Real-Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Profound Worldliness of Christianity<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Harvey Barry<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer writes in one of his last prison letters that he had “come to know and understand more and more the profound this-worldliness of Christianity." In Taking Hold of the Real, Barry Harvey engages in constructive conversation with Bonhoeffer, contending that the “shallow and banal this-worldliness" of modern society is ordered to a significant degree around the social technologies of religion, culture, and race. These mechanisms displace human beings from their traditional connections with particular locales, and relocate them in their “proper places" as determined by the nation-state and capitalist markets. Christians are called to participate in the profound this-worldliness that breaks into the world in the apocalyptic action of Jesus Christ, a form of life that requires discipline and an understanding of death and resurrection. The church is a sacrament of this new humanity, performing for all to hear the polyphony of life that was prefigured in the Old Testament and now is realised in Christ. Unable to find a faithful form of this-worldliness in wartime Germany, Bonhoeffer joined the conspiracy against Hitler, a decision aptly contrasted with a small French church that, prepared by its life together over many generations, saved thousands of Jewish lives.<br>

  Author(s) NIELSEN HENRIK SKOV<br>
  Abstract: Part of the present “state of the art” of contemporary narratology seems to be a paradox, for rather than presenting a static profile, this “state” of the art is characterized by a highly dynamic situation. Indeed, narratology currently appears to be undergoing a major paradigm shift: most narratologists have recently announced the demise of classical, structuralist narratology and proclaimed the emergence of a “post-classical” era.¹ The manifold alleged or genuinely new developments in this post-classical narratology fall into three categories. There is firstly, as the most radical and also most questionable development, the deconstruction of narratology as a logocentric enterprise,<br>

  Abstract: If in Javanese families potency should concentrate in the person of the father, in larger realms, such as the village and the state, potency should concentrate in males of similarly elevated status. Efforts to protect and magnify impressions of a leader’s potency, efforts to benefit by it, and efforts to escape any control it might imply mark political relations in these domains much as they do in the family. As a result, m all these political relations, the paradoxical concept of quiescent power influences everyone’s behavior.<br>

  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLEY DONALD R.<br>
  Abstract: This book, the third volume of Donald Kelley's monumental survey of Western historiography, covers the twentieth century, especially Europe. As in the first two volumes, the author discusses historical methods and ideas of all sorts to provide a detailed map of historical learning. Here he carries the survey forward to our own times, confronting directly the challenges of postmodernism and historical narrative. Kelley offers highly original discussions of historians of the last half century (including friends and mentors), the "linguistic turn," the "end of history," the philosophy of history, and various new methods of histories.The book focuses first on the state of the art of history in France, Germany, Britain, and the United States on the eve of World War I. Kelley then traces every important historiographical issue and development historians have encountered in the twentieth century. With the completion of this trilogy, Kelley presents the only comprehensive modern survey of historical writing. He provides an unparalleled portrait of the rich variety of historical method along with an insider's view of the challenges of capturing history on the written page.<br>

  Book Title: Engaging the Moving Image-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Carroll Noël<br>
  Abstract: Noël Carroll, a brilliant and provocative philosopher of film, has gathered in this book eighteen of his most recent essays on cinema and television-what Carroll calls "moving images." The essays discuss topics in philosophy, film theory, and film criticism.Drawing on concepts from cognitive psychology and analytic philosophy, Carroll examines a wide range of fascinating topics. These include film attention, the emotional address of the moving image, film and racism, the nature and epistemology of documentary film, the moral status of television, the concept of film style, the foundations of film evaluation, the film theory of Siegfried Kracauer, the ideology of the professional western, and films by Sergei Eisenstein and Yvonne Rainer. Carroll also assesses the state of contemporary film theory and speculates on its prospects. The book continues many of the themes of Carroll's earlier work
      Theorizing the Moving Imageand develops them in new directions. A general introduction by George Wilson situates Carroll's essays in relation to his view of moving-image studies.<br>

  Book Title: The Only Mind Worth Having-Thomas Merton and the Child Mind<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Williams Rowan<br>
  Abstract: In The Only Mind Worth Having, Fiona Gardner takes Thomas Merton’s belief that the child mind is “the only mind worth having" and explores it in the context of Jesus’ challenging, paradoxical, and enigmatic command to become like small children. She demonstrates how Merton’s belief and Jesus’ command can be understood as part of contemporary spirituality and spiritual practice. To follow Christ’s command requires a great leap of the imagination. Gardner examines what it might mean to make this leap when one is an adult without it becoming sentimental and mawkish, or regressive and pathological. Using both psychological and spiritual insights, and drawing on the experiences of Thomas Merton and others, Gardner suggests that in some mysterious and paradoxical way recovering a sense of childhood spirituality is the path towards spiritual maturity. The move from childhood spirituality to adulthood and on to a spiritual maturity through the child mind is a move from innocence to experience to organised innocence, or from dependence to independence to a state of being in-dependence with God.<br>

It is seen as a space where there is little if any self-consciousness; there is no judgment of others. It is a time of humility. It involves an awareness of the person’s nothingness—where the person is no -thing.

Even though migration constitutes the ‘normality’ of many societies to a greater or lesser degree, the public and, not least, the sociopolitical discourses of migration, are still predominantly shaped by the view that the large-scale movement of people somehow constitutes a problem.

  Book Title: Localism and neighbourhood planning-Power to the people?<br>

  Author(s): Bradley Quintin<br>
  Abstract: A critical analysis of neighbourhood planning. Setting empirical evidence from the UK against international examples, the Editors engage in broader debates on the purposes of planning and the devolution of power to localities.Governments around the world are seeing the locality as a key arena for effecting changes in governance, restructuring state/civil society relations and achieving sustainable growth. This is the first book to critically analyse this shift towards localism in planning through exploring neighbourhood planning; one of the fastest growing, most popular and most contentious contemporary planning initiatives. Bringing together original empirical research with critical perspectives on governance and planning, the book engages with broader debates on the purposes of planning, the construction of active citizenship, the uneven geographies of localism and the extent to which power is actually being devolved. Setting this within an international context with cases from the US, Australia and France the book reflects on the possibilities for the emergence of a more progressive form of localism.<br>

  Abstract: Localism is often used in confusing and contradictory ways in Australian political debate and policy discourse. While many state and territory governments extol the virtues of devolving responsibility for planning and service delivery down to local governments, they show no sign of relinquishing their constitutional authority over local government or of pressing for further devolution to more localised communities. State and territory governments continue to exercise their constitutional authority over local government in regulating their powers, responsibilities and finances, and, most symbolically, in enforcing the amalgamation of local councils in the name of efficiency and effectiveness, often in the face<br>

  Book Title: The Qing Formation in World-Historical Time-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Struve Lynn A.<br>
  Abstract: For many years, the Ming and Qing dynasties have been grouped as “late imperial China," a temporal framework that allows scholars to identify and evaluate indigenous patterns of social, economic, and cultural change initiated in the last century of Ming rule that imparted a particular character to state and society throughout the Qing and into the twentieth century. This paradigm asserts the autonomous character of social change in China and has allowed historians to create a “China-centered history." Recently, however, many scholars have begun emphasizing the singular qualities of the Qing. Among the eight contributors to this volume on the formation of the Qing, those who emphasize the Manchu ethos of the Qing tend to see it as part of an early modernity and stress parallel and sometimes mutually reinforcing patterns of political consolidation and cultural integration across Eurasia. Other contributors who examine the Qing formation from the perspective of those who lived through the dynastic transition see the advent of Qing rule as prompting attempts by the Chinese subjects of the new empire to make sense of what they perceived as a historical disjuncture and to rework these understandings into an accommodation to foreign rule. In contrast to the late imperial paradigm, the new ways of configuring the Qing in historical time in both groups of essays assert the singular qualities of the Qing formation.<br>

  Book Title: Imagining the popular in contemporary French culture-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): LOOSELEY DAVID<br>
  Abstract: This groundbreaking book is about what ‘popular culture’ means in France, and how the term’s shifting meanings have been negotiated and contested. It represents the first theoretically informed study of the way that popular culture is lived, imagined, fought over and negotiated in modern and contemporary France. It covers a wide range of overarching concerns: the roles of state policy, the market, political ideologies, changing social contexts and new technologies in the construction of the popular. But it also provides a set of specific case studies showing how popular songs, stories, films, TV programmes and language styles have become indispensable elements of ‘culture’ in France. Deploying yet also rethinking a ‘Cultural Studies’ approach to the popular, the book therefore challenges dominant views of what French culture really means today.French Studies, Cultural Studies, Media Studies, Cultural Sociology, History/Cultural History.

The relationship between state, national institutions and cultural production takes very particular forms in France, closely enmeshed as this relationship has been with a specific political history, and with the exceptionally strong presence of linguistic and literary tradition as a prized element of national<br>

  Book Title: Negative Cosmopolitanism-Cultures and Politics of World Citizenship after Globalization<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): TOMSKY TERRI<br>
  Abstract: From climate change, debt, and refugee crises to energy security, environmental disasters, and terrorism, the events that lead nightly newscasts and drive public policy demand a global perspective. In the twentieth century the world sought solutions through formal institutions of international governance such as the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, and the World Bank, but present-day responses to global realities are often more provisional, improvisational, and contingent. Tracing this uneven history in order to identify principal actors, contesting ideologies, and competing rhetoric, Negative Cosmopolitanism challenges the Kantian ideal of cosmopolitanism as the precondition for a perpetual global peace. Uniting literary scholars with researchers working on contemporary problems and those studying related issues of the past – including slavery, industrial capitalism, and corporate imperialism – essays in this volume scrutinize the entanglement of cosmopolitanism within expanding networks of trade and global capital from the eighteenth century to the present. By doing so, the contributors pinpoint the ways in which whole populations have been unwillingly caught up in a capitalist reality that has little in common with the earlier ideals of cosmopolitanism. A model for provoking new and necessary questions about neoliberalism, biopolitics, colonialism, citizenship, and xenophobia, Negative Cosmopolitanism establishes a fresh take on the representation of globalization and modern life in history and literature.

  Abstract: Proclamations of reason’s eclipse, like many a categorical dismissal, have shown themselves to be a bit hasty. Perhaps the life of practical reason, as a mode of reflection open to the collectivity, may be thought of as a generational phenomenon.¹ In any historical period, there are likely to be cultures in which reason and rhetoric have been poisoned. But it seems premature to pronounce any state of affairs, however extreme, as having eliminated forever the prospects for recovery. In the retrospection of dark times, utopian thought can appear foolish. But some such thought may be necessary if possibilities for reflection<br>

  Author(s) Smyth Elizabeth M.<br>
  Abstract: In Canada in the 1960s and 1970s, Roman Catholic congregations of women religious (commonly called nuns) suffered a perfect storm. External social forces such as secularism, feminism, consumerism, the sexual revolution, expanding state initiatives in social welfare, and the Cold War seemed to be attacking them from without by questioning their relevance. The Second Vatican Council (1962–65), called in part to address the Church’s response to these forces, initiated a period of profound self-questioning of women religious’ customs, ministries, governance, and even dress. The often divisive congregational debates associated with the Vatican II era were sometimes perceived by women<br>

  Abstract: Anna’s night journey to St. Petersburg (part 1, chapter 29) is one of the great transitional moments in her drama. Her experience dramatizes a state of intense moral and psychological conflict in which a powerful passion crashes through a barrier of will and conscience. Tolstoy’s account of this internal experience is remarkable for its representation of Anna’s epic crisis. The battle engages her entire being, physical, psychological, moral, and spiritual, drawing in her immediate surroundings and nature in the broadest sense of the term.<br>

  Abstract: This cross-disciplinary exploration of the role of the sacred, blasphemy and sacrilege in a multicultural society brings together philosophers, theologians, lawyers, historians, curators, anthropologists and sociologists, as well as Christian, Jewish and Islamic and secular perspectives. In bringing together different disciplinary and cultural approaches, the book provides a way of broadening our conceptions of what might count as sacred, sacrilegious and blasphemous, in moral and political terms. In addition, it provides original research data on blasphemy, sacrilege and religious tolerance from a range of disciplines. The book is presented in four sections: Section I: Religion Sacrilege and Blasphemy in Australia. Section II: Sacrilege and the Sacred Section III: The State, Religion and Tolerance Section IV: The Future: Openness and Dogmatism. The book will appeal to both those actively involved in religious negotiation and to scholars and students of religion in history, philosophy, anthropology, sociology and political science.<br>

The second conception, most prominently formulated by Saint Augustine, assumes a duality of membership: that is, membership in the earthly city (

However, there are now many well-documented examples of successful management of open-access resources, and experiments in ‘co-management’ by users, owners, and government officials. The idea that the government should intervene to remedy the defects of common property, perhaps by registration, is now contested by a celebration of indigenous systems of self-management (Bromley 1989, Bromley and Cernea 1989). Government intervention may sometimes make things worse. Common property claims are also part of indigenous peoples’ defence and reaffirmation of political sovereignty.<br>

Nor is it as rare as revolution itself. Violence is basic to society and polity, especially to their foundation and consolidation.

  Abstract: The first sign of trouble ahead was the swelling crowd of police at the entrance of the Columbus Street Terminal off Morrison Drive. It was 5 P.M., Wednesday, January 19, 2000, still the dawn of the new millennium in Charleston, South Carolina. Hundreds of battle-ready, black-clad police and highway patrol officers stood in formation, armed with riot helmets, wooden clubs, and plastic shields. A handful rode horses. They carried weapons able to shoot rubber pellets and buckshot. Canine units stood ready with attack dogs. The officers on the ground, summoned from across the state, formed a solid, impregnable phalanx. Parked<br>

  Abstract: In the 1950s, William Faulkner was finally famous. The Noble Prize in 1950 and the National Book Award and Pulitzer several years later had given him a celebrity at home he had long enjoyed abroad. On a State Department trip to Brazil, Faulkner eloquently argued that the world needed to address racial conflict, its most pressing problem. For a moment, that elusive identity, the public man of letters, seemed within his grasp.²<br>

Canadians renewed their social contract to make it more inclusive and less a fragment of Europe.² Pierre Trudeau’s leadership (prime minister 1968–80, 1981–4) featured repatriation of the constitution with, at last, an amending formula, and entrenchment of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Trudeau spoke of a new beginning for Canada, with negotiations among individuals, not groups: “The liberal philosophy sets the highest value on the freedom of the individual, by which we mean the total individual, the individual as a member<br>

  Book Title: Truth Matters-Knowledge, Politics, Ethics, Religion<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Shuker Ronnie<br>
  Abstract: Why should we seek and tell the truth? Does anyone know what truth is? Many are skeptical about the relevance of truth. Truth Matters endeavours to show why truth is important in a world where the very idea of truth is contested. Putting philosophers in conversation with educators, literary scholars, physicists, political theorists, and theologians, Truth Matters ranges across both analytic and continental philosophy and draws on the ideas of thinkers such as Aquinas, Balthasar, Brandom, Davidson, Dooyeweerd, Gadamer, Habermas, Kierkegaard, Plantinga, Ricoeur, and Wolterstorff. Some essays attempt to provide a systematic account of truth, while others wrestle with the question of how truth is told and what it means to live truthfully. Contributors address debates between realists and anti-realists, explore issues surrounding relativism and constructivism in education and the social sciences, examine the politics of truth telling and the ethics of authenticity, and consider various religious perspectives on truth. Most scholars agree that truth is propositional, being expressed in statements that are subject to proof or disproof. This book goes a step farther: yes, propositional truth is important, but truth is more than propositional. To recognize how it is more than propositional is crucial for understanding why truth truly matters.

  Abstract: As the preceding chapters show, this study of community must remain in the interrogative. Attempts to draw clear-cut conclusions on community would result in a discursive stasis, whereby the larger context of modernity and postmodernity—as late modernity or an intensification of the tensions between discourse and practice that characterise modernity—would be lost. The notion of community in postmodern Spain can be seen to be foregrounded in political and cultural contexts over emphases on nation or state. Nevertheless, community is itself a problematic concept: necessarily fluid in order to survive in current contexts, yet loaded with the fixed structures<br>

  Abstract: When students enter college, it soon becomes apparent that some of them are already comfortable with academic discourse, while other students seem quite unfamiliar with academic discourse and resistant to learning it.

  Abstract: In the nineteenth century, hermeneutic reflection remained peripheral in certain respects (especially to philosophy). Though their founding intuitions were broadly based, the classic figures in hermeneutics who were representative of the century—Böckh, Schleiermacher, Droysen, and Dilthey—did not manage to develop a unified conception of hermeneutics or publish it in systematic form. Indicative of this state of affairs is that their hermeneutic inquiries had to be compiled from posthumous writings edited by their students and published mostly in the form of overviews and fragments. This situation slowly begins to change with Heidegger (1889–1976), who was demonstrably influenced early<br>

Christianity was not at all a popular religion until the mid-ninth century. Each of the two tribes comprising the Bulgarian state, the local Slavs and the old Bulgarians (or Protobulgarians), who had migrated from Asia, had their established pantheon and rituals. In contrast to the aristocratic circles in both tribes, various pagan gods coexisted quite peacefully in the lives of the common people. The situation in question took place in the year 865 c.e.<br>

  Abstract: There has probably never been a time when issues of nation, language, and translation have been more important or more troubling than they are today. In a world where individual nation-states are increasingly enmeshed in financial and information networks, where multiple linguistic and national identities can inhabit a single state’s borders or exceed them in vast diasporas, where globalization has its serious—and often violent—discontents, and where terrorism and war transform distrust into destruction, language and translation play central, if often unacknowledged, roles. Though the reasons for this are undeniably complex, they are, at least in broad terms, understandable.<br>

Given the enormous expanse of the empire, central control from Baghdad was unwieldy at best, and it was not long before it became politically unfeasible as well. The governing families of provinces far from the capital (Aghlabids in Ifrîqiya, Ṭûlûnids in Egypt, Ṭâhirids in Khurâsân) naturally wished to achieve the greatest possible freedom of action, and they strove toward a state in which<br>

  Book Title: Clan Cleansing in Somalia-The Ruinous Legacy of 1991<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Kapteijns Lidwien<br>
  Abstract: In 1991, certain political and military leaders in Somalia, wishing to gain exclusive control over the state, mobilized their followers to use terror-wounding, raping, and killing-to expel a vast number of Somalis from the capital city of Mogadishu and south-central and southern Somalia. Manipulating clan sentiment, they succeeded in turning ordinary civilians against neighbors, friends, and coworkers. Although this episode of organized communal violence is common knowledge among Somalis, its real nature has not been publicly acknowledged and has been ignored, concealed, or misrepresented in scholarly works and political memoirs-until now. Marshaling a vast amount of source material, including Somali poetry and survivor accounts,
      Clan Cleansing in Somaliaanalyzes this campaign of clan cleansing against the historical background of a violent and divisive military dictatorship, in the contemporary context of regime collapse, and in relationship to the rampant militia warfare that followed in its wake.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaalso reflects on the relationship between history, truth, and postconflict reconstruction in Somalia. Documenting the organization and intent behind the campaign of clan cleansing, Lidwien Kapteijns traces the emergence of the hate narratives and code words that came to serve as rationales and triggers for the violence. However, it was not clans that killed, she insists, but people who killed in the name of clan. Kapteijns argues that the mutual forgiveness for which politicians often so lightly call is not a feasible proposition as long as the violent acts for which Somalis should forgive each other remain suppressed and undiscussed.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaestablishes that public acknowledgment of the ruinous turn to communal violence is indispensable to social and moral repair, and can provide a gateway for the critical memory work required from Somalis on all sides of this multifaceted conflict.<br>

  Book Title: The Children's Table-Childhood Studies and the Humanities<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): DUANE ANNA MAE<br>
  Abstract: Like the occupants of the children's table at a family dinner, scholars working in childhood studies can seem sidelined from the "adult" labor of humanities scholarship. The Children's Table brings together scholars from architecture, philosophy, law, and literary and cultural criticism to provide an overview of the innovative work being done in childhood studies-a transcript of what is being said at the children's table. Together, these scholars argue for rethinking the academic seating arrangement in a way that acknowledges the centrality of childhood to the work of the humanities. The figure we now recognize as a child was created in tandem with forms of modernity that the Enlightenment generated and that the humanities are now working to rethink. Thus the growth of childhood studies allows for new approaches to some of the most important and provocative issues in humanities scholarship: the viability of the social contract, the definition of agency, the performance of identity, and the construction of gender, sexuality, and race. Because defining childhood is a means of defining and distributing power and obligation, studying childhood requires a radically altered approach to what constitutes knowledge about the human subject. The diverse essays in The Children's Table share a unifying premise: to include the child in any field of study realigns the shape of that field, changing the terms of inquiry and forcing a different set of questions. Taken as a whole, the essays argue that, at this key moment in the state of the humanities, rethinking the child is both necessary and revolutionary.

  Publisher: University Press of Colorado<br>
  Author(s): McGuire Randall H.<br>
  Abstract: The Archaeology of the Colorado Coalfield War Project has conducted archaeological investigations at the site of the Ludlow Massacre in Ludlow, Colorado, since 1996. With the help of the United Mine Workers of America and funds from the Colorado State Historical Society and the Colorado Endowment for the Humanities, the scholars involved have integrated archaeological finds with archival evidence to show how the everyday experiences of miners and their families shaped the strike and its outcome.The Archaeology of Class War weaves together material culture, documents, oral histories, landscapes, and photographs to reveal aspects of the strike and life in early twentieth-century Colorado coalfields unlike any standard documentary history. Excavations at the site of the massacre and the nearby town of Berwind exposed tent platforms, latrines, trash dumps, and the cellars in which families huddled during the attack.

  Book Title: Seasons of Misery-Catastrophe and Colonial Settlement in Early America<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DONEGAN KATHLEEN<br>
  Abstract: The stories we tell of American beginnings typically emphasize colonial triumph in the face of adversity. But the early years of English settlement in America were characterized by catastrophe: starvation, disease, extreme violence, ruinous ignorance, and serial abandonment.
      Seasons of Miseryoffers a provocative reexamination of the British colonies' chaotic and profoundly unstable early days, placing crisis-both experiential and existential-at the center of the story. At the outposts of a fledgling empire and disconnected from the social order of their home society, English settlers were both physically and psychologically estranged from their European identities. They could not control, or often even survive, the world they had intended to possess. According to Kathleen Donegan, it was in this cauldron of uncertainty that colonial identity was formed. Studying the English settlements at Roanoke, Jamestown, Plymouth, and Barbados, Donegan argues that catastrophe marked the threshold between an old European identity and a new colonial identity, a state of instability in which only fragments of Englishness could survive amid the upheavals of the New World. This constant state of crisis also produced the first distinctively colonial literature as settlers attempted to process events that they could neither fully absorb nor understand. Bringing a critical eye to settlers' first-person accounts, Donegan applies a unique combination of narrative history and literary analysis to trace how settlers used a language of catastrophe to describe unprecedented circumstances, witness unrecognizable selves, and report unaccountable events.Seasons of Miseryaddresses both the stories that colonists told about themselves and the stories that we have constructed in hindsight about them. In doing so, it offers a new account of the meaning of settlement history and the creation of colonial identity.<br>

  Abstract: Drawing on the rich cache of antidualist theoretical traditions, from poststructuralism and ecological theory to constructivism and pragmatism, a diverse group of scholars probes acts of social innovation in many locations: land boards in Botswana, Russian labor relations, international statistics, global supply chains, Islamic economics in Algeria, Islamic sects and state authority in Senegal, and civil rights reform, colonization, industrial policy, and political consulting in the United States. These political scientists reconceptualize
         agencyas a relational process that continually reorders the nature and meaning of people and things,orderas an assemblage that necessitates creative tinkering and interpretation, andchangeas the unruly politics of time that confounds the conventional ordering of past, present, and future.Political Creativityoffers analytical tools for reimagining order and change as entangled processes.<br>

  Abstract: Several authoritarian regimes in the Middle East and North Africa were taken down in 2011, but this wave of challenges to strong states missed Algeria. In Algeria, large demonstrations in January 2011 and new efforts at political mobilization were overwhelmed by state security and could not continue. What Algeria lacked were the alliances built in other nations. Algeria’s civil war (1993–2000) left deep rifts and mistrust between groups.¹ Profound dissatisfaction with the state and desire for change could not take the place of the political work, underground or in open, of bridging interests and shaping alliances among democratic forces,<br>

  Abstract: In the discourse of cultural theory it seems that there is considerable confusion, or at least deep ambivalence, concerning the status and function of maps and mapping. In this context it is important to note that mapping tends to be treated by cultural theorists less in terms of its specific histories and methodological principles than as a set of concepts that are often employed in explicitly metaphorical ways – ‘mapping’, then, rather than strict cartography. On the one hand, there is a tendency to equate mapping with the apparatuses of the state and of social control, as a sort of graphic<br>

  Abstract: Over the past two decades, we have witnessed what Françoise Lionnet has termed the ‘becoming-transnational’ of French Studies.¹ French and the other modern languages had originally been constructed as academic subjects around the framework of the nineteenth-century European nation-state but, as the primacy of the nation state has come to be challenged in the era of globalisation, this structure has been increasingly questioned by scholars working from transnational, global and postcolonial perspectives.² The prominent North American critic Lawrence Kritzman has been prompted to ask, in light of these developments, whether the very existence of French Studies is now in question:<br>

  Abstract: That nations dwell in eternal anarchy has been one of the defining assumptions that have shaped the socialization of several generations of students of international relations. While political struggle inside the state takes place in the shadow of the law (conceived as the sovereign’s command), this mediation was thought to be absent in the international arena. However, the demise of the Soviet Union and the increase in the volume, scope and speed of transnational interactions challenged this traditional assumption of anarchy and non-co-operation.

Because the conflict occurred during a time of statelessness in Bougainville, space was opened for a renaissance of nonstate customary institutions and processes.

Given the ambiguity of the term and differences in interpretation, it can be translated into English in any number of ways. “Original enlightenment” is the most common, but this has a strong temporal connotation, implying some primordial or original state to be recovered or uncovered to fully realize enlightenment or buddhahood.<br>

Endowing the ghost with a voice capable of expressing subjective emotion, primarily through the vehicle of lyric poetry, opened a window onto the unknowable: what would it feel like to be dead, to be on the other side? Accordingly, these ghost stories represent death as an interior state of exile in which suffering and longing are intensified rather than annihilated. The paradigmatic sites of such stories are the cemetery, the unmarked grave, uninhabited wasteland; the paradigmatic poetic genres involved are<br>

  Abstract: Sociological studies have often found that institutional disorganization and the loss of the social function of religion may occur when society becomes modernized. Peter Berger summed it up thus: “The impact of modernity on religion is commonly seen in terms of the process of secularization, which can be described as one in which religion loses its hold on the level both of institutions and of human consciousness.”¹ Berger’s harsh assessment may well describe the state of the Korean Protestant church today. For the last forty years, a startling wave of modernization accompanied by industrialization, urbanization, and rapid social mobility have<br>

  Author(s) BORGEN ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: Considerations of center and periphery in Heian Japan involve at the highest level the relationship between the central political apparatus and the hinterlands, the sixty-six provinces and two islands (Iki and Tsushima) that constituted the conceptualized polity. Indeed, the very existence of a state presupposes control over the human and material resources of the space thought to constitute the geographical area of that conceptualized state. This was never an easy task for Japanese rulers, despite the insular character of Japan that seems to lend itself to simple mapping of a discrete geopolitical entity.

  Book Title: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains-Culture and Society in the Highlands of Bali<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Reuter Thomas A.<br>
  Abstract: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains is the first comprehensive ethnography of the Bali Aga, a large ethnic minority that occupies the island's central highlands. The Bali Aga are popularly viewed as the indigenous counterparts to other Balinese who trace their origin to invaders from the Javanese kingdom of Majapait, who have ruled Bali from the fourteenth century A.D. Although Bali remains one of the most intensely researched localities in the world, the Bali Aga have long been overshadowed by the more exotic courtly culture of the south. A closer analysis of the changing position of the Bali Aga within Balinese society provides a key to understanding the politics and social process of cultural representation in Bali and beyond. The process is marked by a blend of representational competition and cooperation among the Bali Aga themselves, among the Bali Aga and southern Balinese, and later among the island's aristocratic elites and foreign colonizers or scholars, and state authorities. The study of this process raises important issues about the establishment and maintenance of status and power structures at regional, national, and global levels. Custodians of the Sacred Mountains explores the marginalization of the Bali Aga in light of a critical theory of cultural representation and calls for a morally engaged approach to ethnographic research. It proposes an intersubjective and communicative model of human interaction as the foundation for understanding the relative significance of cooperation and competition in the cultural production of knowledge.<br>

The young state was determined to have the institutions of higher education function as the meeting place of the working class and its consciousness. Inevitably, the old intelligentsia proved an obstacle, insisting on civic liberties, occupying the universities, and refusing to turn them over to the proletariat.

The nation-state too promises to bring forth order out of disorder, mold form from that in which form is absent. But even though this order may be posited as a future hope, something to be achieved in the making, this hope is drenched in nostalgia, the imagined glory that once was. In South Asia<br>

Nevertheless, a different type of relation exists between them, having to do with the importance and quality of the services they render.

  Book Title: Christian Political Ethics-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Coleman John A.<br>
  Abstract: Christian Political Ethicsbrings together leading Christian scholars of diverse theological and ethical perspectives--Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, and Anabaptist--to address fundamental questions of state and civil society, international law and relations, the role of the nation, and issues of violence and its containment. Representing a unique fusion of faith-centered ethics and social science, the contributors bring into dialogue their own varying Christian understandings with a range of both secular ethical thought and other religious viewpoints from Judaism, Islam, and Confucianism. They explore divergent Christian views of state and society--and the limits of each. They grapple with the tensions that can arise within Christianity over questions of patriotism, civic duty, and loyalty to one's nation, and they examine Christian responses to pluralism and relativism, globalization, and war and peace. Revealing the striking pluralism inherent to Christianity itself, this pioneering volume recasts the meanings of Christian citizenship and civic responsibility, and raises compelling new questions about civil disobedience, global justice, and Christian justifications for waging war as well as spreading world peace. It brings Christian political ethics out of the churches and seminaries to engage with today's most vexing and complex social issues.<br>

  Abstract: Law, and a legalistic morality and politics, can define peace and war by their mutual opposition. Any two communities are either at peace or at war with one another. If they are at war, each is seeking a relationship to the other (ʺvictory over,ʺ ʺprevailing overʺ) which that other seeks precisely to frustrate or overcome. If they are at peace, each pursues its own concerns in a state of indifference to, noninterference in, or collaboration with the concerns of the other.<br>

Ferment is healthy when it calls into question the assumptions that we have never articulated or that we have forgotten we ever made. One’s assumptions perhaps depend ultimately on one’s temperament or even one’s faith, but that is all the more reason for articulating them. In this book I shall try to articulate certain assumptions about literary works and the nature and ends of criticism, and I shall try to see what consequences follow.<br>

  Abstract: The opposite of liberty, Christian or civil, is slavery, but slavery is also the antithesis of creative labor. When we allow a tyrant to get control of our spirits or our cities, the first thing he will do is put us to work at backbreaking and stultifying tasks. Blake felt the tyranny of the English Church and state not only in its censorship and prosecution of radical writers but also in the way it governed public taste, driving radical artists to drudgery for the market.

  Abstract: In her 1964 essay, “Against Interpretation,” Susan Son tag sounded the keynote of a neoformalism, a new wave of French criticism that was about to sweep over modern language departments, wreaking havoc with the traditional interpretive positions standing in its path. In order to assess the current state and status of interpretation, that is of hermeneutics in the wake of structuralism, I should like to recall very briefly the main points of Sontag’s essay, for they retain even today their polemical freshness. What must first be noted is Sontag's definition of interpretation, for her assault on hermeneutics is grounded in<br>

  Abstract: In her book

The British and French paths became rivalling world views, with antagonistic conceptions of politics and the economy, state organization, the relationship between state and civil society, and, above all, the role of religion within the political system; and they will form the substance of the discussion here.<br>

For much of the preceding half-century, under the influence of logical heavy emphasis on empirical verifiability, much of moral philosophy was taken up with metaethics (e.g. the semantics of moral discourse), with little attention given to normative moral theories. Moreover, to the extent that normative theories were considered, utilitarianism was the centre of attention.

  Book Title: Living Prism-Itineraries in Comparative Literature<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KUSHNER EVA<br>
  Abstract: She discusses the current state of comparative literary studies and the renewed role of comparative literature in a world that is at once more plural and more globalized, as well as some of the debates now taking place within literary criticism as a whole, including the interchange between comparative literature and cultural studies, the re-envisaging of the Renaissance, the work of Northrop Frye, myth and literature at the end of the twentieth century, modern drama, and post-colonialism. To play an important role in the human sciences, comparative literature had first to free itself of a number of restrictive habits, such as an insufficiently critical literary history. In order to do this, it had to think theoretically, but without yielding to the temptation of letting theory become an end in itself. Kushner demonstrates that, while under strong pressures to be a more rigourous science, comparative literature has realized that in the human sciences the validation of knowledge has to seek its own tests and criteria, becoming increasingly more open to individuality, difference, and life situations and controlling its tendency to universalize. With its emphasis on whether literary history is possible and the problems it raises for literary theory and for comparative literature in particular, The Living Prism adds an important dimension to the ongoing debate about criticism and comparative literary studies.<br>

We also learn about the right way to deny a role to principles in ethics, how to distinguish between the good and the beautiful, the way humor works, the rabbinic nature of modernism, the difference between good, bad, great, and evil, why Plato's dialogues are not really dialogues, and why most philosophers are actually artists.<br>

  Abstract: Even those who accept that a single country can serve as a home for more than one nation are often led astray by the venerable nationstate model of what a country is or should be. Consider what has become a virtual axiom among scholars of nations and nationalism, namely that nationalists’ concern for self-determination invariably leads to a desire for sovereignty, for the complete control over a state. When applied to multinational federations, the axiom supports the assumption that the members of the minority nations will, at the very least, favour decentralization.

The Third Republic was proclaimed in 1870 but was more officially established through a series of laws which culminated in 1875. Thinkers of the time envisioned the republican era as providing a solid ground on which to build a secularized state. The debate over secularization, which progressively materialized from the early 1880s to the famous Combes legislation of 1904 testifies to the importance of the issue on the political agenda of the time.<br>

  Book Title: Kin, Gene, Community-Reproductive Technologies among Jewish Israelis<br>

  Author(s): Carmeli Yoram S.<br>
  Abstract: Israel is the only country in the world that offers free fertility treatments to nearly any woman who requires medical assistance. It also has the world's highest per capita usage of in-vitro fertilization. Examining state policies and the application of reproductive technologies among Jewish Israelis, this volume explores the role of tradition and politics in the construction of families within local Jewish populations. The contributors-anthropologists, bioethicists, jurists, physicians and biologists-highlight the complexities surrounding these treatments and show how biological relatedness is being construed as a technology of power; how genetics is woven into the production of identities; how reproductive technologies enhance the policing of boundaries. Donor insemination, IVF and surrogacy, as well as abortion, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and human embryonic stem cell research, are explored within local and global contexts to convey an informed perspective on the wider Jewish Israeli environment.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter is about a series of contradictions in Hannah Arendt’s writings, contradictions that she names and explores, and contradictions in her own discourse. Arendt’s writings are a declaration of antipathy to the bourgeoisie by a thoroughly bourgeois writer, a defense of the nation-state based on dislike of nationalism, a defense of traditional bourgeois values from modern bourgeois domination, and an account of the modern state that granted the Jews emancipation at a point when, by becoming national, it was in the process of preparing the renewal of the Jews’ exclusion and persecution.<br>

The Enlightenment values of neutrality and objectivity in scholarship, of methodological rigor and purity, of scientific method, of disciplinarity, of professionalism, of progress narratives, of grand narrative and grand theory, but also of a static, clearly demarcated, and bounded subject, who acts as a kind of atom of a similarly static, clearly demarcated, and bounded nation-state—all are in question.

  Author(s) Skinner Jonathan<br>
  Abstract: Many commentators might agree with Ulrich Beck’s claim that the ‘human condition has itself become cosmopolitan’ (2006:2). There is, however, little agreement as to how this impacts upon the ethical relationship between cosmopolitan subjects. If there is an increase in the transnational flows of people, commodities, labour, and information, and if these trends are accompanied by the declining role of the state and the emergence of international institutions, what does this mean for our moral obligations to those beyond the traditional spaces of family, community, and particularly the nation? My interest in cosmopolitanism lies specifically at the intersection of what<br>

  Book Title: A Lover's Quarrel with the Past-Romance, Representation, Reading<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Ghosh Ranjan<br>
  Abstract: Although not a professional historian, the author raises several issues pertinent to the state of history today. Qualifying the 'non-historian' as an 'able' interventionist in historical studies, the author explores the relationship between history and theory within the current epistemological configurations and refigurations. He asks how history transcends the obsessive 'linguistic' turn, which has been hegemonizing literary/discourse analysis, and focuses greater attention on historical experience and where history stands in relation to our understanding of ethics, religion and the current state of global politics that underlines the manipulation and abuse of history.<br>

  Author(s) Lim Jie-Hyun<br>
  Abstract: Modern historiography has often been a tool to legitimate the nation-state ‘objectively and scientifically’. Despite its proclamation of objectivity and scientific inquiry, modern historiography has promoted the political project of constructing national history. Its underlying logic was to find the course of historical development that led to the nation-state. Thus, national history has made the nation-state both the subject and the object of its own discipline. The ‘Prussian school’ provides a typical example. Not only was Ranke the official historiographer of the Prussian state, Droysen’s distinction between ‘History’ (
                  die Geschichte) and ‘private transactions’ (Geschäfte) also reveals the hidden politics that<br>

  Abstract: In recent years there has been a renewal of academic and political interest in order and disorder in contemporary cities. Many investigations center on the relationship between levels of deprivation and ethno-racial composition as well as how this relationship shapes perceptions and patterns of disorder in given inner-city areas. The state possesses the right not only to manage immigration into its territories but also to define what is “disorderly” and therefore “inappropriate” conduct. In contrast, teenage boys may have their own notions and experiences of propriety.<br>

  Abstract: In several Western societies we witness today an increasing tendency to “educationalize” social problems. As an institution, the school is, among other things, held accountable for solving social inequalities (related to class, race, and gender); for reducing traffic deaths, obesity, teenage sex, and environmental destruction; and for enhancing public health, economic productivity, citizenship, and even performances in sport contests such as the Olympic Games. Pushing these kind of “social” responsibilities on schools is a process that has been under way for a long time and coincides with the role of education in the formation of the modern nation-state.

  Abstract: It is commonplace to state that the various object-relations theories are more easily reconciled with attachment theory than Freudian psychoanalysis. Freud invariably
                  derivesboth the libidinal directedness towards an object and the attachment tendency from the need for love or food. He fails to posit attachment as a primary tendency which needs no further ontogenetic elucidation. In this way, he inevitably comes into conflict with attachment theory which emphasizes the originality and non-deducibility of this tendency (Geyskens & Van Haute 2003). Object-relations theories, on the other hand, teach us that the libido is first and foremost directed towards finding adequate objects.<br>

Most critiques of seventies socialist cultures readily dismiss socialism as having no soul. The inherent assumption of such critiques is that capitalism is the sole arbiter of enjoyment through free and ideologically uncontaminated flow of consumption. Such binary critiques oversimplify the relationship between state formations and citizens as consumers. These critiques further elide the intricate and nuanced strategies<br>

  Book Title: 22 Ideas to Fix the World-Conversations with the World's Foremost Thinkers<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Sakwa Richard<br>
  Abstract: The aftershocks of the 2008 financial crisis still reverberate throughout the globe. Markets are down, unemployment is up, and nations from Greece to Ireland find their very infrastructure on the brink of collapse. There is also a crisis in the management of global affairs, with the institutions of global governance challenged as never before, accompanied by conflicts ranging from Syria, to Iran, to Mali. Domestically, the bases for democratic legitimacy, social sustainability, and environmental adaptability are also changing. In this unique volume from the World Public Forum Dialogue of Civilizations and the Social Science Research Council, some of the world's greatest minds - from Nobel Prize winners to long-time activists - explore what the prolonged instability of the so-called Great Recession means for our traditional understanding of how governments can and should function. Through interviews that are sure to spark lively debate,22 Ideas to Fix the Worldpresents both analysis of past geopolitical events and possible solutions and predictions for the future.The book surveys issues relevant to the U.S., Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Speaking from a variety of perspectives, including economic, social, developmental, and political, the discussions here increase our understanding of what's wrong with the world and how to get it right. Interviewees explore topics like the Arab Spring, the influence of international financial organizations, the possibilities for the growth of democracy, the acceleration of global warming, and how to develop enforceable standards for market and social regulation. These inspiring exchanges from some of our most sophisticated thinkers on world policy are honest, brief, and easily understood, presenting thought-provoking ideas in a clear and accessible manner that cuts through the academic jargon that too often obscures more than it reveals.22 Ideas to Fix the Worldis living history in the finest sense - a lasting chronicle ~<br>

  Book Title: Scientific Understanding-Philosophical Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Eigner Kai<br>
  Abstract: To most scientists, and to those interested in the sciences, understanding is the ultimate aim of scientific endeavor. In spite of this, understanding, and how it is achieved, has received little attention in recent philosophy of science.
      Scientific Understandingseeks to reverse this trend by providing original and in-depth accounts of the concept of understanding and its essential role in the scientific process. To this end, the chapters in this volume explore and develop three key topics: understanding and explanation, understanding and models, and understanding in scientific practice.Earlier philosophers, such as Carl Hempel, dismissed understanding as subjective and pragmatic. They believed that the essence of science was to be found in scientific theories and explanations. In Scientific Understanding, the contributors maintain that we must also consider the relation between explanations and the scientists who construct and use them. They focus on understanding as the cognitive state that is a goal of explanation and on the understanding of theories and models as a means to this end.The chapters in this book highlight the multifaceted nature of the process of scientific research. The contributors examine current uses of theory, models, simulations, and experiments to evaluate the degree to which these elements contribute to understanding. Their analyses pay due attention to the roles of intelligibility, tacit knowledge, and feelings of understanding. Furthermore, they investigate how understanding is obtained within diverse scientific disciplines and examine how the acquisition of understanding depends on specific contexts, the objects of study, and the stated aims of research.<br>

Indeed, it seems a commonplace to state that the desire for understanding is a chief motivation for doing science. But despite the prima facie plausibility of these claims, it is not so clear what their precise content is. What do we mean when we say that scientists understand, for example, global climate change?

  Book Title: Liberalism at Its Limits-Crime and Terror in the Latin American Cultural Text<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): RODRÍGUEZ ILEANA<br>
  Abstract: In
      Liberalism at Its Limits,Ileana Rodríguez considers several Latin American nations that govern under the name of liberalism yet display a shocking range of nondemocratic features. In her political, cultural, and philosophical analysis, she examines these environments in which liberalism seems to have reached its limits, as the universalizing project gives way to rampant nonstate violence, gross inequality, and neocolonialism.Focusing on Guatemala, Colombia, and Mexico, Rodríguez shows how standard liberal models fail to account for new forms of violence and exploitation, which in fact follow from specific clashes between liberal ideology and local practice. Looking at these tensions within the ostensibly well-ordered state, Rodríguez exposes how the misunderstanding and misuse of liberal principles are behind realities of political turmoil, and questions whether liberalism is in fact an ideology sufficient to empower populations and transition nation-states into democratic roles in the global order.In this way,Liberalism at Its Limitsoffers a critical examination of the forced fitting of liberal models to Latin American nations and reasserts cross-cultural communication as crucial to grasping the true link between varying systems of value and politics.<br>

It was argued that this Cartesian reaction to the arguments for externalism faces serious difficulties. Nonetheless, we have not yet worked out the implications of the arguments themselves. If an essentially Cartesian strategy to limit their scope does not work, we have, as yet, done nothing to work out what that scope is. This is the task of this chapter.<br>

  Abstract: The apostle Paul would do well in today’s Israeli parliament, the Knesset, because he understood the full weight and meaning of the word
                  Israel,whether state of . . . , land of . . . , people of . . . , or God of . . . And because of that fact, Paul will have put forth ferocious arguments in the angry debate, perennially at the head of the political agenda, concerning who is a Jew, which is to say who is Israel. That issue comes to the fore whenever the Israelis have to organize a new Knesset,<br>

  Abstract: WHILE THE ROLE OF EDUCATION in political socialization and the construction of national identity in the Caribbean has been recognized and studied by several scholars (Bell, 1967; Fagen, 1969; Jansen, 1991; Torres, 1991; Miller, 1991), its relationship to popular culture has received considerably less attention. In part, this is due to the tendency of Caribbean scholars to conceive of educational institutions primarily as instruments of the state to propagate and reinforce the hegemony exerted by domestic and foreign elites over political and economic institutions (Carnoy and Samoff, 1989; Henry and Stone, 1983; Miller, 1989).¹ Curriculum content, student assessment and placement,<br>

Set in an interrogation room in an unnamed, apparently eastern-European totalitarian state, the play centres on the writer Katurian Katurian, whose violent short stories seem to have inspired a local wave of copy-cat crimes. As children, Katurian and his brother Michal had been the subject of a bizarre educational/artistic experiment. Their parents systematically tortured Michal to inspire their younger son’s storytelling skills. Katurian has become a writer and discovers that Michal has committed<br>

  Abstract: Arthur Herman has coined the term ‘declinism’ to refer to a species of deep pessimism that represents the West as horribly flawed, in a state of severe decay, usually on the edge of catastrophe. That radical doubt he finds pervasive nowadays and in the recent past. ‘We live in an era in which pessimism has become the norm, rather than the exception.’¹ Perhaps so, especially in circles frequented by the best educated. Herman cites a considerable range of thinkers, profound or otherwise, who believe things are getting worse, and getting worse rapidly.² But what Herman does not consider is the<br>

It is difficult to dispute that most states in the modern world are multi-cultural in a descriptive sense.¹ Despite the centralizing and homogenizing cultural policies of the modern ‘nation-state’ documented by scholars of nationalism like Gellner, many cultural minorities have been remarkably resilient.

  Abstract: Since the late 1980s, radical transformations of the Chinese film industry and art circles have led to the emergence of a significant body of independent documentary films produced and circulated without the backing of state institutions. This was definitely a breakthrough, since state documentary studios and television stations were the sole producers and broadcasters of non-fiction films in China for more than thirty years. Reforms that gradually adjusted the film and television industries to a market economy in the 1980s and 1990s generated, as a side effect, a grey area in which individual projects could be produced without prior submission<br>

It is easy to think, on the one hand, that Meillassoux’s arguments are all spectacular, unheard-of and revolutionary, or to assume, on the other hand, that he is playing a game with his reader, and cannot possibly mean what he says in earnest.

First, he is looking for other dissident interlocutors than those ofSocialisme and Barbarie– the group with whom he shared the Marxist critique of Stalinism, Trotskism and Maoism, as well as militant activism, in particular during the Algerian war. Then, he sets out to guide the radicalism of Deleuze and Guattari back to a less simplistic conception of institutions (family, State, money), which supposedly immobilise the nomadism of flows. Finally, Lyotard starts to suspect his own ‘critical’ position. The history of revolutions and of<br>

  Abstract: The term ‘nihilism’ has been used to denote a philosophical concept or position, a psychological or sociological state or mood, a doctrine or agenda for political action and a cultural condition or movement. Moreover, the connotations of the term within each of these areas are multiple, complicated and contested. It is thus not easy to define the term or to determine the nature of the phenomenon that the term describes. This difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that the term has been principally used as a pejorative by opponents to characterise a condition, doctrine, or movement that they fear, disagree<br>

It is a thing of the future more than the present, but its future is far from assured. Such democracy as we presently enjoy it is mostly national, rather than transnational, and representative, rather than participatory. It is largely monopolised by elected ‘representatives’, rather than politically active citizens and almost entirely circumscribed by the territoriality of national state borders. The social communities, relations and processes beyond and across state borders that would constitute transnational democracy largely elude democracy’s remit. ‘Globalisation’ and<br>

  Book Title: The Discursive Construction of National Identity-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Unger J. W.<br>
  Abstract: How do we construct national identities in discourse? Which topics, which discursive strategies and which linguistic devices are employed to construct national sameness and uniqueness on the one hand, and differences to other national collectives on the other hand? The Discursive Construction of National Identity analyses discourses of national identity in Europe with particular attention to Austria.In the tradition of critical discourse analysis, the authors analyse current and on-going transformations in the self-and other definition of national identities using an innovative interdisciplinary approach which combines discourse-historical theory and methodology and political science perspectives. Thus, the rhetorical promotion of national identification and the discursive construction and reproduction of national difference on public, semi-public and semi-private levels within a nation state are analysed in much detail and illustrated with a huge amount of examples taken from many genres (speeches, focus-groups, interviews, media, and so forth).In addition to the critical discourse analysis of multiple genres accompanying various commemorative and celebratory events in 1995, this extended and revised edition is able to draw comparisons with similar events in 2005. The impact of socio-political changes in Austria and in the European Union is also made transparent in the attempts of constructing hegemonic national identities. Key Features:*Discourse-historical approach.*Interdisciplinarity (cultural studies, discourse analysis, history, political science).*Multi-method, multi-genre.*Qualitative case studies.<br>

The state of nature, in which sovereign states still find themselves, is reinforced by predatory doctrines of pre-emption in the area of national security and of relentless expansion in the area of economic activity, itself continuously dominated by security interests.¹ This analysis may not be disputed by legal internationalists or constitutionalists.

  Abstract: Politics, as Paul Ricœur once remarked, ‘only exists in great moments, in “crises”, in the climactic and turning points of history’ (1965: 255). In 1956, troops of the Warsaw pact states invaded Hungary and cracked down on the Hungarian revolution. This event had heavily dislocating effects on Western political thought – no matter whether Marxist or not. As a reaction, Paul Ricœur published one of his best-known essays, ‘The Political Paradox’, in which he seeks to come to terms philosophically with the exigency of the Hungarian events (1965). Counter to state-Marxism, his aim is to think what he perceives as the<br>

For Ferguson, civil society constitutes an intermediate realm between the family and the state that in the modern context requires communication among strangers; for Grierson, model citizens effectively become 
                  träger of a top-down discourse of statist democracy. In each case, the cultural validity of the moral sphere of local – that is, place-bound – society is diminished, relegated to being the vestige of a past social order. Recently, scholars have argued<br>

  Book Title: Cops, Teachers, Counselors-Stories from the Front Lines of Public Service<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Musheno Michael<br>
  Abstract: Whether on a patrol beat, in social service offices, or in public school classrooms, street-level workers continually confront rules in relation to their own beliefs about the people they encounter. Cops, Teachers, Counselors is the first major study of street-level bureaucracy to rely on storytelling. Steven Maynard-Moody and Michael Musheno collect the stories told by these workers in order to analyze the ways that they ascribe identities to the people they encounter and use these identities to account for their own decisions and actions. The authors show us how the world of street-level work is defined by the competing tensions of law abidance and cultural abidance in a unique study that finally allows cops, teachers, and counselors to voice their own views of their work.Steven Maynard-Moody is Director of the Policy Research Institute and Professor of Public Administration at the University of Kansas.Michael Musheno is Professor of Justice and Policy Studies at Lycoming College and Professor Emeritus of Justice Studies, Arizona State University.<br>

  Abstract: How do street-level workers make sense of their world and account for what they do? These questions guide our inquiry and lie at the heart of scholarship on the state and its workforce. Much of the existing literature converges on a viewpoint of street-level workers that focuses on how they apply the state’s laws, rules, and procedures to the cases they handle. We call this viewpoint the state-agent narrative. We propose an additional viewpoint, a citizen-agent narrative, that is muted in existing scholarship yet prevalent in the stories told to us by street-level workers. The citizen-agent narrative concentrates on the<br>

  Author(s) Kearns Thomas R.<br>
  Abstract: Leviathan, a sea monster symbolizing evil in the Old Testament and in Christian literature generally,¹ was the figure famously chosen by Thomas Hobbes to symbolize the State. Still under Hobbes’s influence, we might today—perhaps in a fitful, nightmarish sleep—conjure up similar images of law as a frightening, bloodthirsty beast, but with this difference: the modern Leviathan would be as intent on concealing its bloodletting activities, on covering its bloody tracks, as on slaking its deadly thirst. That these images seem to apply to contemporary law, that law seems intent on (and is largely successful at) threatening violence while<br>

                  convention. From the sociological standpoint of Elizabeth Burns the “theatrical metaphor” generated conventions that served as constitutive agreements for knowledge.¹ Yet this metaphor is also, for her, a “mode of perception,” a basic phenomenological category like those described by Ernst Cassirer or Susanne K. Langer, which produces the social concepts that make theater—and any other concomitant forms of analogical “theatricality” in other contexts—possible.² Theater for Burns, then, is not a kind of knowledge<br>

That plan, which became known as the “Roadmap,” was based on a two-state solution and presented two novelties: (1) for the first time, the United States committed itself publicly and officially to an independent Palestinian sovereignty, and (2) for the first time, the United States also conditioned Israeli concessions on Palestinian democratization.

The struggle over nomenclature underscores the power of stories and their limitations in policy and political change. The uprisings were replete with projected narratives, narratives whose proponents sought to shape current and future events as protestors took to the streets and state actors dug in their heels to retain power.

  Abstract: Ethnographic studies of “dangerous men” have generally taken us behind bars. Erving Goffman’s (1961) arresting critique of the confinement setting as a generative milieu for the exercise of power helped to spawn a series of monograph-length works recounting life, death, and survival behind prison walls (e.g., Jacobs 1978; Sykes 1971; Toch 1977). A second wave of penological analysis, still concerned with “everyday experience” behind bars, challenged the correctional system as an extension of the state’s regulatory ambit. For example, Irwin’s (1970, 1985) studies of the felon and the jail respectively ushered in a new era of incisive commentary. Crime control<br>

Arif examines the convictions made in the Special Court of Sierra Leone, the first hybrid court of its nature under international criminal law. Next, she explores the making of a justice movement in the context of Hindu-Muslim violence in 2002 in the state of Gujarat, India. From there she revisits the Sikh carnage in Delhi of 1984. Finally, she explores a span of civil violence in Lebanon, and particularly, its effects on the city of Beirut.<br>

  Book Title: Agitating Images-Photography against History in Indigenous Siberia<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Craig<br>
  Abstract: Agitating Imagesprovides a glimpse into the first moments of cultural engineering in remote areas of Soviet Siberia. The territories were perceived by outsiders to be on the margins of civilization, replete with shamanic rituals and inhabited by exiles, criminals, and "primitive" indigenous peoples. The Soviets hoped to permanently transform the mythologized landscape by establishing socialist utopian developments designed to incorporate minority cultures into the communist state. This book delves deep into photographic archives from these Soviet programs, but rather than using the photographs to complement an official history, Campbell presents them as anti-illustrations, or intrusions, that confound simple narratives of Soviet bureaucracy and power. Meant to agitate, these images offer critiques that cannot be explained in text alone and, in turn, put into question the nature of photographs as historical artifacts.<br>

Behind this haze at the periphery of detective fiction, the dichotomy between hero (detective) and villain (criminal), the genre’s central setup, was also being undermined. Prominent but deranged agents of science—such as research scientists, engineers, and doctors—started to appear more often as serial killers than as models of scientific morality.

  Abstract: The preceding chapters stress the weakening of the nation-state at the dawn of the twenty-first century in a multiplicity of arenas such as the economic, the political, and the cultural. However, national questions have not entirely disappeared from the horizon of interests of the Portuguese and Brazilian fiction writers discussed throughout this study, although they have been progressively deemphasized. Interestingly, throughout their respective writing careers, Vergílio Ferreira and Clarice Lispector tended to avoid an explicit treatment of national questions altogether.<br>

Neither nation nor ethnicity is an immanent force, an essence within history, destined for eventual recuperation.

He meant the rhetorical enactment of still more “agitation” within the abolitionists’ public sphere to signal the incompatibility of the present with a narrative construction of progress and of unseen continuity with the past. Garrison, on the other hand, was so determined to put time on the abolitionists’ side that he actually looked forward to this state of antagonism. In his first public appearance on behalf of the cause, he presented the inevitable outcome of antislavery agitation—the virulent<br>

Most state actors entangled in the Korean security situation display a preference for the so-called soft landing scenario, which foresees an incremental rapprochement between North and South. All but the most radical critics of engagement advocate policies that are geared toward avoiding either a direct military conflict with or a sudden collapse of North Korea. Since the late 1990s the South Korean government has been particularly active in promoting such a step-by-step approach toward normalizing political interactions on the peninsula. While<br>

  Abstract: “Labor is the living, form-giving fire,” Marx wrote. “It is the transitoriness of things, their temporality, as their transformation by living time.” How is it, then, that labor, with all its life-affirming potential, has become the means of capitalist discipline, exploitation, and domination in modern society? The authors expose and pursue this paradox through a systematic analysis of the role of labor in the processes of capitalist production and in the establishment of capitalist legal and social institutions. Critiquing liberal and socialist notions of labor and institutional reform from a radical democratic perspective, Hardt and Negri challenge the state-form itself.<br>

More often, he refers to “state-regulated” or “organized capitalism.” And even when the chapter heading promises “A Descriptive Model of Advanced Capitalism,” what follows speaks primarily of “organized capitalism” (Legitimation, 33).<br>

  Book Title: Broken Tablets-Levinas, Derrida, and the Literary Afterlife of Religion<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): HAMMERSCHLAG SARAH<br>
  Abstract: Over a span of thirty years, twentieth-century French philosophers Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida held a conversation across texts. Sharing a Jewish heritage and a background in phenomenology, both came to situate their work at the margins of philosophy, articulating this placement through religion and literature. Chronicling the interactions between these thinkers, Sarah Hammerschlag argues that the stakes in their respective positions were more than philosophical. They were also political. Levinas's investments were born out in his writings on Judaism and ultimately in an evolving conviction that the young state of Israel held the best possibility for achieving such an ideal. For Derrida, the Jewish question was literary. The stakes of Jewish survival could only be approached through reflections on modern literature's religious legacy, a line of thinking that provided him the means to reconceive democracy. Hammerschlag's reexamination of Derrida and Levinas's textual exchange not only produces a new account of this friendship but also has significant ramifications for debates within Continental philosophy, the study of religion, and political theology.<br>

The "opening" of different societies to new ideas, products, and forms of prosperity has introduced a persistent uncertainty, or disorder, into everyday life. Multinational corporations have weakened sovereignty. We no longer know who is in control or who is responsible. Economies can collapse without sufficient warning, and the effort to rebuild can drag on for years. Piracy is everywhere.

  Book Title: Why Only Art Can Save Us-Aesthetics and the Absence of Emergency<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): ZABALA SANTIAGO<br>
  Abstract: The state of emergency, according to thinkers such as Carl Schmidt, Walter Benjamin, and Giorgio Agamben, is at the heart of any theory of politics. But today the problem is not the crises that we do confront, which are often used by governments to legitimize themselves, but the ones that political realism stops us from recognizing as emergencies, from widespread surveillance to climate change to the systemic shocks of neoliberalism. We need a way of disrupting the existing order that can energize radical democratic action rather than reinforcing the status quo. In this provocative book, Santiago Zabala declares that in an age where the greatest emergency is the absence of emergency, only contemporary art's capacity to alter reality can save us.
      Why Only Art Can Save Usadvances a new aesthetics centered on the nature of the emergency that characterizes the twenty-first century. Zabala draws on Martin Heidegger's distinction between works of art that rescue us from emergency and those that are rescuersintoemergency. The former are a means of cultural politics, conservers of the status quo that conceal emergencies; the latter are disruptive events that thrust us into emergencies. Building on Arthur Danto, Jacques Rancière, and Gianni Vattimo, who made aesthetics more responsive to contemporary art, Zabala argues that works of art are not simply a means of elevating consumerism or contemplating beauty but are points of departure to change the world. Radical artists create works that disclose and demand active intervention in ongoing crises. Interpreting works of art that aim to propel us into absent emergencies, Zabala shows how art's ability to create new realities is fundamental to the politics of radical democracy in the state of emergency that is the present.<br>

  Author(s): Fernández María<br>
  Abstract: Since the colonial era, Mexican art has emerged from an ongoing process of negotiation between the local and the global, which frequently involves invention, synthesis, and transformation of diverse discursive and artistic traditions. In this pathfinding book, María Fernández uses the concept of cosmopolitanism to explore this important aspect of Mexican art, in which visual culture and power relations unite the local and the global, the national and the international, the universal and the particular. She argues that in Mexico, as in other colonized regions, colonization constructed power dynamics and forms of violence that persisted in the independent nation-state. Accordingly, Fernández presents not only the visual qualities of objects, but also the discourses, ideas, desires, and practices that are fundamental to the very existence of visual objects.<br>

  Abstract: From the early 1920s to the late 1950s the dialectic of modernism and tradition, whether classical or vernacular, characterized the Italian state’s architectural patronage.¹ This essay investigates post–World War II state-sponsored building initiatives, mainly housing, and the architectural debates accompanying their design and realization. It sets them against the backdrop of Italian architectural discourse on identity that surfaced during the Fascist period (1922–1943) and continued to weigh heavily on the decisions of architects and urban designers in postwar democratic Italy. The essay focuses on the role that appropriation of extant vernacular building traditions and the abandonment of classicism<br>

  Abstract: The study of khipu has traditionally reflected the dominant role of Cusco at the center of the Tawantinsuyu, or “Four-fold Whole,” which was the Quechua name used by the Inka for their empire. As a prime instrument of state administration and royal hegemony, the khipu tradition was raised by the Inka to new levels of sophistication, power, and flexibility. Yet khipu predated the Inka Empire by at least a thousand years. Moreover, in the south, whence the Inka came according to their dynastic histories, the khipu tradition of Tiwanaku-Huari (Conklin 1982) had been inherited by the Aymara federations, which developed<br>

  Abstract: Many observers have described Western intellectual and legal histories as moving from notions of fixed and assigned status to notions of individual freedom and rights. Sir Henry Maine’s famous dictum defined progress as the movement from status to contract.¹ Such broadly gauged summaries risk oversimplification and insensitivity to the variety and contestability of understandings of the past. Nonetheless, the contrast between legal orders premised upon status and those premised upon state-guaranteed rights helps to locate notions of abnormal persons and rights analysis as ways for dealing with differences. And as a historical matter, rights analysis in some ways is a<br>

  Abstract: The Light of Knowledgeis set primarily in the rural district of Pudukkottai in Tamil Nadu, and it is about activism among laboring women from marginalized castes who have been particularly active as learners and volunteers in the movement. In their endeavors to remake the Tamil countryside through literacy activism, workers in the movement found that their own understanding of the politics of writing and Enlightenment was often transformed as they encountered vastly different notions of language and imaginations of social order. Indeed, while activists of the movement successfully mobilized large numbers of rural women, they did so through logics that often pushed against the very Enlightenment rationality they hoped to foster. Offering a rare behind-the-scenes look at an increasingly important area of social and political activism,The Light of Knowledgebrings tools of linguistic anthropology to engage with critical social theories of the postcolonial state.<br>

  Book Title: Mourning Happiness-Narrative and the Politics of Modernity<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Soni Vivasvan<br>
  Abstract: For Soni, the classical Greek idea of happiness-epitomized by Solon's proverb "Call no man happy until he is dead"-opens the way to imagining a properly secular conception of happiness, one that respects human finitude and mortality. By analyzing the story of Solon's encounter with Croesus, Attic funeral orations, Greek tragedy, and Aristotle's ethics, Soni explains what it means to think, rather than feel, a happiness available for public judgment, rooted in narrative, unimaginable without a relationship to community, and irreducible to an emotional state. Such an ideal, Soni concludes, would allow for a radical reenvisioning of a politics that takes happiness seriously and responds to our highest aspirations rather than merely keeping our basest motivations in check.<br>

  Abstract: The audacity of Solon’s pronouncement is that it imagines a happiness that is possible for finite beings. Solon’s proverb simply requires that we judge a life’s narrative as we find it: is this life happy or unhappy? It does not specify any content to happiness in advance. Nor does it specify any criteria for happiness that would place it out of the reach of a finite being, such as the continuity of pleasure or satisfaction or the optimization of wealth.

  Book Title: Engaging Heritage, Engaging Communities-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Whitehead Chris<br>
  Abstract: Across the global networks of heritage sites, museums, and galleries, the importance of communities to the interpretation and conservation of heritage is increasingly being recognised. Yet the very term "meaningful community engagement" betrays a myriad of contrary approaches and understandings. Who is a community? How can they engage with heritage and why would they want to? How do communities and heritage professionals perceive one another? What does it mean to "engage"? These questions unsettle the very foundations of community engagement and indicate a need to unpick this important but complex trend. Engaging Heritage, Engaging Communities critically explores the latest debates and practices surrounding community collaboration. By examining the different ways in which communities participate in heritage projects, the book questions the benefits, costs and limitations of community engagement. Whether communities are engaging through innovative initiatives or in response to economic, political or social factors, there is a need to understand how such engagements are conceptualised, facilitated and experienced by both the organisations and the communities involved.BR> Bryony Onciul is Lecturer in History at the University of Exeter; Michelle Stefano is the Co-Director of Maryland Traditions, the folklife program for the state of Maryland and Visiting Assistant Professor in American Studies at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County; Stephanie Hawke is a project manager and fundraiser, working on a range of projects aiming to engage communities with cultural heritage.

  Book Title: Secret Police Files from the Eastern Bloc-Between Surveillance and Life Writing<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Petrescu Corina L.<br>
  Abstract: The communist secret police services of Central and Eastern Europe kept detailed records not only of their victims but also of the vast networks of informants and collaborators upon whom their totalitarian systems depended. These records, now open to the public in many former Eastern Bloc countries, reflect a textually mediated reality that has defined and shaped the lives of former victims and informers, creating a tension between official records and personal memories. Exploring this tension between a textually and technically mediated past and the subject/victim's reclaiming and retrospective interpretation of that past in biography is the goal of this volume. While victims' secret police files have often been examined as a type of unauthorized archival life writing, the contributors to this volume are among the first to analyze the fragmentary and sometimes remedial nature of these biographies and to examine the subject/victims' rewriting and remediation of them in various creative forms. Essays focus, variously, on the files of the East German Stasi, the Romanian Securitate (in relation to Transylvanian Germans in Romania), and the Hungarian State Security Agency.

  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Adebanwi Wale<br>
  Abstract: Nation as Grand Narrative offers a methodical analysis of how relations of domination and subordination are conveyed through media narratives of nationhood. Using the typical postcolonial state of Nigeria as a template and engaging with disciplines ranging from media studies, political science, and social theory to historical sociology and hermeneutics, Wale Adebanwi examines how the nation as grand narrative provides a critical interpretive lens through which competition among ethnic, ethnoregional, and ethnoreligious groups can be analyzed. Adebanwi illustrates how meaning is connected to power through ideology in the struggles enacted on the pages of the print media over diverse issues including federalism, democracy and democratization, religion, majority-minority ethnic relations, space and territoriality, self-determination, and threat of secession. Nation as Grand Narrative will trigger further critical reflections on the articulation of relations of domination in the context of postcolonial grand narratives.

  Book Title: Twenty Years On-Competing Memories of the GDR in Postunification German Culture<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Tate Dennis<br>
  Abstract: Twenty years on from the dramatic events that led to the opening of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the GDR, the subjective dimension of German unification is still far from complete. The nature of the East German state remains a matter of cultural as well as political debate. This volume of new research focuses on competing memories of the GDR and the ways they have evolved in the mass media, literature, and film since 1989-90. Taking as its point of departure the impact of iconic visual images of the fall of the Wall on our understanding of the historical GDR, the volume first considers the decade of cultural conflict that followed unification and then the emergence of a more complex and diverse "textual memory" of the GDR since the Berlin Republic was established in 1999. It highlights competing generational perspectives on the GDR era and the unexpected "afterlife" of the GDR in recent publications. The volume as a whole shows the vitality of eastern German culture two decades after the demise of the GDR and the centrality of these memory debates to the success of Germany's unification process.

  Author(s): Gross Ruth V.<br>
  Abstract: Franz Kafka's literary career began in the first decade of the twentieth century and produced some of the most fascinating and influential works in all of modern European literature. Now, a hundred years later, the concerns of a new century call for a look at the challenges facing Kafka scholarship in the decades ahead: What more can we hope to learn about the context in which Kafka wrote? How does understanding that context affect how we read his stories? What are the consequences of new critical editions that offer unprecedented access to Kafka's works in manuscript form? How does our view of Kafka change the priorities and fashions of literary scholarship? What elements in Kafka's fiction will find resonance in the historical context of a new millennium? How do we compose a coherent account of a personality with so many contradictory aspects? All these questions and more are addressed by the essays in this volume, written by a group of leading international Kafka scholars.

  Book Title: The Faustian Century-German Literature and Culture in the Age of Luther and Faustus<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Weeks Andrew<br>
  Abstract: The Reformation and Renaissance, though segregated into distinct disciplines today, interacted and clashed intimately in Faust, the great figure that attained European prominence in the anonymous 1587 'Historia von D. Johann Fausten'. The original Faust behind Goethe's great drama embodies a remote culture. In his century, Faust evolved from an obscure cipher to a universal symbol. The age explored here as "the Faustian century" invested the 'Faustbuch' and its theme with a symbolic significance still of exceptional relevance today. The new essays in this volume complement one another, providing insights into the tensions and forces that gave the century its distinct character. Several essays seek Faust's prototypes. Others elaborate the symbolic function of his figure and discern the resonance of his tale in conflicting allegiances. This volume focuses on the intersection of historical accounts and literary imaginings, on shared aspects of the work and its times, on concerns with obedience and transgression, obsessions with the devil and curiosity about magic, and quandaries created by shifting religious and worldly authorities.

  Abstract: In his review of Johann Strauss Jr.’s 1881 operetta 
                  Der lustige Krieg, Hanslick critiqued the current state of Viennese operetta as follows: “This is what makes most of our Viennese operettas so intolerable: they earnestly ape Verdi and Meyerbeer. Your Sepperl and Leni sing like Raoul and Valentine, so that every squabble at the inn becomes a St. Bartholomew’s Night. At any moment, naturally, the composer can leap down from his tragic throne into the most trivial yodeling; Raoul and Valentine get transformed back into Sepperl and Leni, the Huguenots into tailor’s apprentices; and the rest of us get seasick<br>

  Abstract: The Isle of Man is an independent Crown Dependency, with the Queen as head of state and an ambivalent and at times uncomfortable relationship with the British government. In the early 20th century the Lieutenant Governor was a powerful and significant figure on the island, balancing and indeed controlling the powers of the Tynwald parliament. From 1902 the Lieutenant Governor was Lord Raglan, who had come from the post of Under Secretary for War and been a major organiser of the Boer War campaigns.

  Abstract: If poetry plays to the most volatile and malleable part of our nature, then Plato, the philosopher, played poetry beautifully, and at its own game. The exploratory nature of Plato’s writings, as well as their apparent inconsistencies, are well documented.¹ His contradictory attitude, for instance, to poetry’s relationship to the polity has not only dogged disciplinary discourse in terms of a centuries-long quarrel between philosophy and literature, but has also given rise to a provocative paradigm that connects order within the self to the construction of a utopian state. Individual selfhood is symbolically politicised in this process, while the construction<br>

  Abstract: This essay will focus on a conflict between two competing visions of socialist design in the GDR, which drew on different aspects of the German cultural heritage and were based on diverging, untested assumptions about what was suitable for the socialist consumer. Ideologues of the ruling SED championed the doctrine of socialist realism as a suitable starting point, while members of the GDR design community supported a modernist approach to industrial design. In the first fifteen years of the state’s existence this disagreement manifested itself in a considerable divergence between official rhetoric and design practice.<br>

  Book Title: Arno Schmidt's 'Zettel's Traum'-An Analysis<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Langbehn Volker Max<br>
  Abstract: Arno Schmidt (1914-1979) is considered one of the most daring and influential writers of postwar Germany; the Germanist Jeremy Adler has called him a "giant of postwar German literature." Schmidt was awarded the Fontane Prize in 1964 and the Goethe Prize in 1973, and his early fiction has been translated into English to high critical acclaim, but he is not a well-known figure in the English-speaking world, where his complex work remains at the margins of critical inquiry. Volker Langbehn's book introduces Schmidt to the English-speaking audience, with primary emphasis on his most famous novel, 'Zettel's Traum'. One reviewer called the book an "elephantine monster" because of its unconventional size (folio format), length (1334 pages and over 10 million characters), and unique presentation of text in the form of notes, typewritten pages, parallel columns, and collages. The novel narrates the life of the main characters, Daniel Pagenstecher, Paul Jacobi and his wife Wilma, and their teenage daughter Franziska. In discussing the life and works of Edgar Allan Poe, the four engage in the problems connected with a translation of Poe. Langbehn's study investigates how literary language can mediate or account for the world of experiences and for concepts. Schmidt's use of unconventional presentation formats challenges us to analyze how we think about reading and writing literary texts. Instead of viewing such texts as a representation of reality, Schmidt's novel destabilizes this unquestioned mode of representation, posing a radical challenge to what contemporary literary criticism defines as literature. No comprehensive study of 'Zettel's Traum' exists in English. Volker Langbehn is associate professor of German at San Francisco State University.<br>

  Book Title: Afro-Cuban Diasporas in the Atlantic World-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Otero Solimar<br>
  Abstract: ‘Afro-Cuban Diasporas in the Atlantic World’ explores how Yoruba and Afro-Cuban communities moved across the Atlantic between the Americas and Africa in successive waves in the nineteenth century. In Havana, Yoruba slaves from Lagos banded together to buy their freedom and sail home to Nigeria. Once in Lagos, this Cuban repatriate community became known as the Aguda. This community built their own neighborhood that celebrated their Afrolatino heritage. For these Yoruba and Afro-Cuban diasporic populations, nostalgic constructions of family and community play the role of narrating and locating a longed-for home. By providing a link between the workings of nostalgia and the construction of home, this volume re-theorizes cultural imaginaries as a source for diasporic community reinvention. Through ethnographic fieldwork and research in folkloristics, Otero reveals that the Aguda identify strongly with their Afro-Cuban roots in contemporary times. Their fluid identity moves from Yoruba to Cuban, and back again, in a manner that illustrates the truly cyclical nature of transnational Atlantic community affiliation. Solimar Otero is assistant professor of English and folklore at Louisiana State University and is research associate and visiting professor at the Women's Studies in Religion Program at the Harvard Divinity School from 2009 - 2010.<br>

  Abstract: The ‘Goethe Yearbook’ is a publication of the Goethe Society of North America, encouraging North American Goethe scholarship by publishing original English-language contributions to the understanding of Goethe and other authors of the ‘Goethezeit’ while also welcoming contributions from scholars around the world. Volume 19 of the ‘Goethe Yearbook’ continues to investigate the connection between Goethe's scientific theories and his aesthetics, with essays on his optics and his plant morphology. A special section examines the central role that Goethe philology has had in establishing practices that shaped the history of ‘Germanistik’ as a whole. The yearbook also includes essays on legal history and the novella, Goethe ‘Lieder’, esoteric mysticism in ‘Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre’, and Werther's sexual pathology. The volume also includes three essays re-examining Goethe's aesthetics in the context of the history of deconstruction, as well as the customary book review section.

  Book Title: Promises of 1968-Crisis, Illusion and Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): TISMANEANU VLADIMIR<br>
  Abstract: This book is a state of the art reassessment of the significance and consequences of the events associated with the year 1968 in Europe and in North America. Since 1998, there hasn’t been any collective, comparative and interdisciplinary effort to discuss 1968 in the light of both contemporary headways of scholarship and new evidence on this historical period. A significant departure from earlier approaches lies in the fact that the manuscript is constructed in unitary fashion, as it goes beyond the East–West divide, trying to identify the common features of the sixties. The latter are analyzed as simultaneously global and local developments. The main problems addressed by the contributors of this volume are: the sixties as a generational clash; the redefinition of the political as a consequence of the ideological challenges posed to the status-quo by the sixty-eighters; the role of Utopia and the de-radicalization of intellectuals; the challenges to imperialism (Soviet/American); the cultural revolution of the sixties; the crisis of ‘really existing socialism’ and the failure of “socialism with a human face”; the gradual departure from the Yalta-system; the development of a culture of human rights and the project of a global civil society; the situation of 1968 within the general evolution of European history (esp. the relationship of 1968 with 1989). In contrast to existing books, the book provides a fundamental and unique synthesis of approaches on 1968: first, it contains critical (vs. nostalgic) re-evaluations of the events from the part of significant sixty-eighters; second, it includes historical analyses based on new archival research; third, it gathers important theoretical re-assessments of the intellectual history of the 1968; and fourth, it bridges 1968 with its aftermath and its pre-history, thus avoiding an over-contextualization of the topics in question.<br>

  Book Title: Friendship and Love, Ethics and Politics-Studies in Mediaeval and Early Modern History<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Österberg Eva<br>
  Abstract: Today, friendship, love and sexuality are mostly viewed as private, personal and informal relations. In the mediaeval and early modern period, just like in ancient times, this was different. The classical philosophy of friendship (Aristotle) included both friendship and love in the concept of philia. It was also linked to an argument about the virtues needed to become an excellent member of the city state. Thus, close relations were not only thought to be a matter of pleasant gatherings in privacy, but just as much a matter of ethics and politics. What, then, happened to the classical ideas of close relations when they were transmitted to philosophers, clerical and monastic thinkers, state officials or other people in the medieval and early modern period? To what extent did friendship transcend the distinctions between private and public that then existed? How were close relations shaped in practice? Did dialogues with close friends help to contribute to the process of subject-formation in the Renaissance and Enlightenment? To what degree did institutions of power or individual thinkers find it necessary to caution against friendship or love and sexuality?<br>

However, one cannot ignore the status of Bessarabia as part of the Soviet Union.

  Book Title: What Holds Europe Together?-  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Michalski Krzysztof<br>
  Abstract: The book addresses contemporary developments in European identity politics as part of a larger historical trajectory of a common European identity based on the idea of 'solidarity.' The authors explain the special sense in which Europeans perceive their obligations to their less fortunate compatriots, to the new East European members, and to the world at large. An understanding of this notion of 'solidarity' is critical to understanding the specific European commitment to social justice and equality. The specificity of this term helps to distinguish between what the Germans call "social state" from the Anglo-Saxon, and particularly American, political and social system focused on capitalism and economic liberalism. This collection is the result of the work of an extremely distinguished group of scholars and politicians, invited by the previous President of the European Union, Romano Prodi, to reflect on some of the most important subjects affecting the future of Europe.<br>

  Abstract: I should like to state at the very beginning my conviction that sacral kingship, in its variety of forms and representations one of which is monotheistic kingship, might in anthropological terms be regarded an Elementary Form of socio-political life: not an autonomous elementary form, but one falling under the category of rulership, of sovereignty in the sense given to the term by Georges Dumézil, without this necessarily entailing the adoption of his trifunctional model which Le Goff saw to be eminently fitting for medieval Europe. Like all other Elementary Forms for the representation of human sociality, this is one of<br>

  Abstract: The “Velvet Revolution” in November 1989 brought about enormous changes in the political and social environment: the communist regime was abolished and after forty-one years democracy was reestablished in Czechoslovakia. In art, the most important change brought by the Revolution was the end of censorship. Since 1989 artists have been allowed to do as they wish—as long as they can find the funding. Film in socialism was funded exclusively by the state, but since about 1990 the state has not been responsible for what is produced and, not surprisingly, the authorities have cut the subsidies of the costly film<br>

  Book Title: Hybrid Renaissance-Culture, Language, Architecture<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burke Peter<br>
  Abstract: Hybrid Renaissance presents the Renaissance in Italy, elsewhere in Europe and in the world beyond Europe as an example of cultural hybridization. It is impossible to give a clear definition of either of the two key concepts used in this book, “hybridization" and “Renaissance". Roughly speaking, hybridity refers to something new that emerges from the combination of diverse older elements. The term “hybridization" is preferable to “hybridity" because it refers to a process rather than to a state, and also because it encourages the writer and the readers alike to think in terms of more or less rather than of presence versus absence. The book begins with a discussion of the concept of cultural hybridity and a cluster of other concepts related to it. Then comes a geography of hybridity, focusing on three locales: courts, major cities (whether ports or capitals) and frontiers. There follow six chapters about the hybrid Renaissance in different fields: architecture, painting and sculpture, languages, literatures, music, philosophy and law and finally religion. The essay concludes with a brief account of attempts to resist hybridization or to purify cultures or domains from what was already hybridized<br>

  Book Title: Where Currents Meet-Frontiers of Memory in Post-Soviet Fiction of Kharkiv, Ukraine<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zaharchenko Tanya<br>
  Abstract: Where Currents Meet treats the Ukrainian and Russian components of cultural experience in Ukraine’s East as elements of a complex continuum. This study of cultural memory in post-Soviet space shows how its inhabitants negotiate the historical legacy they have inherited. Tanya Zaharchenko approaches contemporary Ukrainian literature at the intersection of memory studies and border studies, and her analysis adds a new voice to an ongoing exploration of cultural and historical discourses in Ukraine. This scholarly journey through storylines explores the ways in which younger writers in Kharkiv (Kharkov in Russian), a diverse, dynamic, but understudied border city in east Ukraine today come to grips with a traumatized post-Soviet cultural landscape. Zaharchenko’s book examines the works of Serhiy Zhadan, Andrei Krasniashchikh, Yuri Tsaplin, Oleh Kotsarev and others, introducing them as a “doubletake" generation who came of age during the Soviet Union’s collapse and as adults revisited this experience in their novels. Filling the space between society and the state, local literary texts have turned into forms of historical memory and agents of political life.<br>

  Abstract: Protestant church art is decorative art and, as in Europe in general, it has had a big influence in Hungary on shaping festive and everyday objects. This “revolution in the decoration of objects” occurred in Hungary in the seventeenth century, unimpeded even by the confusion and sufferings of the period (Turkish wars, occupation by the Turks, the state divided into three). The Protestant denomination became dominant with a share estimated by some at 60–70%. The decorative objects with inscriptions were used by the upper strata of society, but their appearance in urban public offices in the churches (furniture, chests,<br>

Abstract: Patten presents a detailed explication and defense of Hegel’s conception of freedom as rational self‐determination. On such a view, inherited from Kant, being free involves more than the absence of coercion or being able to do as one pleases. Freedom requires actors to self‐legislate their behavior such that the good reasons motivating them override their contingent desires and inclinations. Given standard objections to Kant’s idea of autonomy, and Hegel’s own statements of those objections, Patten carefully analyzes Hegel to demonstrate both that he does in fact hold a related view, and that his view does not fall prey to the same problems as Kant’s. Central to Patten’s interpretation of Hegel is the idea that free agents will be ones who act in ways harmonious with those features of modern life and the modern state that establish the conditions Hegel thinks are necessary for the realization and sustenance of individual freedom.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur turns to Walzer’s work, then, not to move from a Rawlsian liberalism to communitarianism but to look at another question: that of the divisibility of principles of justice within a particular state. Again Ricoeur emphasizes the importance of political community. He thinks Walzer errs in viewing the question of politics solely as a question of the just distribution of political power since, in doing so, he fails to examine the status of the political community within which distributions proceed. Ricoeur acknowledges the attention Walzer pays to questions of membership in a political community. Still, he thinks that what Walzer’s work illuminates is “the uncomfortable situation of an entity called upon to behave at the same time as the whole and as the part, as the container and the contained, as inclusive agency and an included region” (p. 93). Rather than moving to a more communitarian view, then, Ricoeur accepts a modified version of Rawlsian liberalism: Rawls successfully constructs a single set of principles of justice, and we need only recognize that the grounds for this selection lie in our preexisting conception of the good rooted in our aspirations for meaningful lives and friendships within just institutions.<br>

Author(s): Vidal Fernando<br>
Abstract: Successive amputations of the body have been accompanied by an increasing precision concerning the part of flesh necessary for personal identity. Initially, there was an indeterminate portion of matter, which early on adopted the form of a seminal particle. Because embryology alone was incapable of accounting for identity, the seminal particle assumed some features of the brain. Endowed with a double function, the “germ” was entirely responsible for the postmortem development of resurrected persons as psychosomatic unities. But why bother with the body? All we need for Judgment Day is an accountable and conscious personality. To the extent that the brain is responsible for it, why not limit resurrection to the brain? And why not go a step further? If only part of the brain is necessary to be a
         person,shall we need it whole to enjoy the beatific vision?126Maybe just a fraction will suffice. This fraction will have to contain the information necessary for defining the self. A computer program might therefore be enough. The resurrectedIneed be nothing other than the computer equivalent of my brain. In this way, thanks to the progress of technology, to resurrect might eventually mean to be emulated by supercomputers; thus resurrected, we shall inhabit a hereafter whose technical name is cyberspace.127But how much can “we” disembody ourselves without becoming simulacra? Are we still “us” in a state of “postorganic” immortality?128<br>

Abstract: Finally, we can turn the tables back onto the “default setting” that Alexander and Smith (
         1993) portray. We began by saying that studies of binary codes hold the setting constant, keeping it focused on governmental settings. But even governments do not always have the same relations to the wider world. Appropriate speech in different governmental bodies varies from teeth‐clenching but polite disagreement in the U.S. Senate ( … “the gentleman from Louisiana …” ), to shouting, booing, and jeering (in, e.g., the British House of Commons; see Merelman1991); and bonds between legislators vary. One could study differences between state institutions, not just as formal institutional differences, and not just as differences in the “discourses of civil society” of the sort Alexander and Smith (1993) describe, but also as differences in group styles.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Fortunately for the state of linguistic anthropology, the loose congeries of problems and methods which Duranti describes as paradigms do not live up to that designation in Kuhnian terms. Indeed, it seems to me doubtful that Durantis first and second paradigms need involve incompatible views of language at all, any more than do, for example, phonetics and syntax as subdisciplines of linguistics proper. It seems to me telling in this regard that Dell Hymes, one of the originators of the ethnography of communicationand hence of Durantis second paradigmhas in addition to his work in that area never stopped doing straightforward descriptive linguistics and grammatical analysis of the kind that belongs firmly within Durantis first paradigm. The same goes for many other linguistic anthropologists who were trained in the sixties, seventies, and eighties. It is true that researchers views of language structure tend to vary according to their views about how language functions in relation to other aspects of human social life, but few if any ethnographers of speaking or Labovian sociolinguists have attempted to dissolve the notion of grammar entirely or the need to main a level of analysis which treats it as at least a semiautonomous formal system, without thereby denying its status as an interactional achievement both in everyday acts of language use and in the long term as languages change over time. Exemplary in this regard is the work of Duranti himself, whose outstanding studies of language and politics in Samoaaptly characterized by the title
         From Grammar to Politics(1994)have been grounded in both detailed ethnography and rigorous grammatical analysis of verbatim transcriptions of Samoan oratory and disputation.<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: The God‐term in Luhmann’s universe is “autopoesis,” essentially the self‐direction of the systems of society, including that of art, toward greater autonomy and complexity. Although Luhmann was a student of Talcott Parsons and his work bears the evolutionary interest of the functionalist paradigm, it is what many partisans of the older version might consider to be a mutant functionalism. As Luhmann avers, he considers “system differentiation” as “the heart of Parsons’s theory” (p. 350, n. 4) yet unlike Parsons’s optimistic sense that differentiation was undergirded by functional imperatives such as adaptive upgrading, Luhmann’s own sense is that the process of societal evolution “does not presuppose central norms, no matter how generalized” (p. 2). Essentially what this means is that society is composed of a set of systems (economy, politics, law, and art, among others) that evolve and complexify but not toward any unified state, such as Parsons’s “societal community.” Rather, each system tends toward its own independence and standards, and thus much of Luhmann’s book explores what he calls “the autonomy of art,” that is, the ability of the art system to develop its own “self‐description.”<br>

It is a time to lament our state, to agonize, to ponder, a time in which we must of necessity call everything into question. Besides, why should the fragile art of writing history escape from the general crisis of our age? We are quitting a world of which we have not always had the time to understand or appreciate the benefits, the errors, the certainties, and the dreams—the world, shall we say, of the early twentieth century? We are leaving it, or rather, it is slipping inexorably away from us.”<br>

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: The apologetic project can be compared to rites of institution in that it establishes a social difference—one that becomes part of a group’s self‐understanding—by calling attention to a difference in a preexisting state of affairs.
         61Apologetic theology exploits objective differences between religious traditions in order to establish a community’s sense of its uniqueness. The “demythologization” of apologetics reveals a gap between the social differences constitutive of a community’s sense of identity and the objective differences upon which these are founded. Now, an underlying intent to express communal loyalty takes the form of an oppositional stance in a situation of theological challenge. This oppositional attitude then determines which differences will be incorporated into the group’s self‐understanding. An obliteration of the distinction between social and objective difference, however, creates the illusion that the oppositional attitude plays no active role in the production of communal identity, that it merely follows an awareness of objective difference as an inevitable consequence. One of the dangers of traditional apologetics, then, is for a simple awareness of objective differences between religions to compel an oppositional stance, even when the identity of the home tradition is not threatened. A confusion of social for objective difference allows the directionality from attitude to observation to reverse itself such that the simple awareness of differences between communities evokes an oppositional attitude. By dispelling the illusion that makes opposition an automatic reaction to objective difference, comparative theology frees itself of the false obligation to assume an oppositional stance toward other traditions.<br>

Abstract: Why the history of reading? What historical difference does this casual activity make? By now, historians have become accustomed to scholarly accounts of seemingly incidental matters, such as pet ownership and melodrama, which at first blush may seem rather removed from dynamics of historical change like war, revolution, and industrialization. But in the hands of historians like Roger Chartier and Robert Darnton, the history of reading has become a significant field in the social history of ideas. It has far‐reaching implications, especially in the early modern period, for the development of individual and group consciousness, of new religious beliefs and related institutions, and of the state and its bases in society, culture, and the economy. The Enlightenment, for instance, looks very different from the perspective of the consumers of printed matter. In the eighteenth century, readers took very selectively to heart the ideas of the philosophes for a host of reasons we now know: with a few exceptions—for instance, Jean‐Jacques Rousseau’s
      La nouvelle Héloïse(1761) and J. W. von Goethe’sThe Sorrows of Young Werther(1774)—the major publications of the century’s great intellectuals were much less well circulated than those by the period’s hack writers. And readers received these texts with other things in mind than the philosophes’ challenge to think rationally, deductively, and independently of established authority. Moreover, Jürgen Habermas’s notion of the public sphere (inThe Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere,trans. Thomas Burger and Frederick Lawrence [Cambridge, Mass., 1989]) makes sense only if there are engaged readers as well as engaged writers to create a bourgeois civil society on the eve of the French Revolution of 1789.<br>

Abstract: Using the analogy of reader and text (wherein the latter is very broadly defined as an objectification or product of action), Ricoeur argues that human experiences, grounded in the world of action, take on the nature of prenarratives [
            14]. These prenarratives are in a state of prefiguration, and their articulation becomes the narration of an experience, which he calls configuration. Once narrated, the possibility exists for refiguration, or reauthoring. In terms of relationship, these are the three moments in the mimetic operations that make up the process of emplotment. They enable us to be conducted “from one side of the text to the other” [14, p. 53] through the action of reading (where reading is a mediator in a process). Ricoeur argues that configuration and refiguration have a faculty of mediation enabling a work to “lift … itself above the opaque depths of living, acting, and suffering, to be given by an author to readers who receive it and thereby change their acting” [14, p. 53]. Because it is the reader who takes up the unity of the traversal from prefiguration (mimesis1) to refiguration (mimesis3) by way of configuration (mimesis2), this being done by way of reading [14], and because Ricoeur argues that narrative is central to human endeavors to make sense of the world, these would seem to be important operations for LIS to consider in theoretical terms.<br>

Abstract: After this initial citing of the relationship between race and sexuality, race does not disappear from Rubin’s essay but rather appears through a proliferation of analogies. It is this nature of racial incorporation that needs close scrutiny because it demonstrates not simply an omission but a problematic technique of appropriation via inclusion. Here are a few instances of Rubin’s incorporation of race:
         
               
            It is impossible to think with any clarity about the politics of race or gender as long as these are thought of as biological entities rather than as social constructs. … One may then think of sexual politics in terms of such phenomena as populations, neighborhoods, settlement patterns, migration, urban conflict, epidemiology, and police technology. (Rubin
            1984, 277)
               
            This kind of sexual morality [revulsion at homosexuality] has more in common with ideologies of racism than with true ethics. It grants virtue to the dominant groups, and relegates vice to the underprivileged. (

            The use of S/M [sadomasochistic] images in the movie
            Not a Love Storywas on a moral par with the use of depictions of black men raping white women, or of drooling old Jews pawing young Aryan girls, to incite racist or anti‐Semitic frenzy. (1984, 298)
               As the above examples make amply clear, although the vector of racial difference is clearly present in the essay, racial analogies help mainly to clarify the nature of sexual oppression and sexual intolerance. Let us focus for a moment on the particular manner in which race and sex/gender are linked: “race or gender,” “in common with,” “similar to,” “on a moral par with,” and “similar miracles.” First, in each case there is an assumption of a problematic similari~<br>

Abstract: Taking my cue from Homi Bhabha’s twofold thesis that the colonial and postcolonial history has been characterized by the colonizers’ construction of a binary opposition between pure, homogeneous, and culturally superior Europe and the equally homogeneous but inferior and decadent other of Europe and that the traditionalist, nativist, and nationalist movements of anticolonial resistance have all more or less bought into that binary scheme repressive of hybridity and internal heterogeneity, I suggest the following sociopolitically concrete reformulation of the dialectic.
         42First of all, any claim of pure and homogeneous religious identity made today must initially be put within its proper postcolonial‐neocolonial context via a hermeneutic of suspicion and examined in regard to the degree to which it may or may not be stained with the enduring impact of the centuries‐long imposition of economic, political, and cultural master‐slave relations. For example, when today a European or Euro‐American Christian community calls for a return to the “pure,” “orthodox” tradition in total opposition to modernity—variously called “the world,” “the liberal nation‐state,” “the secular humanistic culture,” and so forth—and castigates feminist and other liberationist voices of resistance springing up both within itself and outside for having been contaminated by modernity, it is apropos to ask if that gesture of repudiation and return is an attempt to maintain an originary myth of pure and homogeneous identity in another package after modernity’s totalizing binary opposition of Europe and Other has been discredited and condemned. Especially, if that community today asserts once more the long‐standing Christian view that Christianity is the only true way, one is all the more drawn to wonder whether that assertion now camouflages a lingering residue of and an effort to perpetuate by other means the sense of culturally superior identity it enjoyed for so long, being at the center ~<br>

Abstract: The first and most influential treatise on the shroud is
      Esplicatione del lenzuolo ove fu involto il Signore(Interpretation of the sheet in which the Lord was enshrouded) by Alfonso Paleotto, Archbishop of Bologna. Paleotto’s seminal text came out in 1598, twenty years after the transfer of the shroud from Chambéry to Turin, the new capital of the state of Savoy. Paleotto’s book is at once a scientific description of the figure imprinted on the cloth and a meditative appropriation of the two images. The section “The Beauty and Measures of the Lord’s Body” (chap. 3) offers a detailed commentary on the two images reproduced at the beginning of his book (fig. 1). Paleotto adds a biblical quotation, “torcular calcavi solus” (I have trodden the wine press alone [Is. 63:3]), as if Christ himself commented on the image of his corpse. According to Paleotto, the Word wished to grant us a remembrance of his handsome face, which inThe Song of Songsthe bride had already contemplated in its powerful splendor.9If, as session 25 of the Council of Trent confirms, “ordinary” images “created by human art” can be used “to excite our celestial love,” how could we possibly refrain from contemplating the self‐portrait the Word granted us?10Paleotto’s devotional reading of the shroud could be read as a form ofaffetto(affective response), a key term of Italian seventeenth‐century literature. Based on Ignatius’sExercises,affettoindicates a literary text (prose or poetry) that aims at triggering a devotional response in the reader’s mind, a sort of “conversion of the heart,” as the Dominican Ignazio del Nente stresses in his important religious works.11In “The First Exercise,” Ignatius stresses that, if a meditation is “about something that can be gazed upon,” the imagination must first sketch a “physical space.”12In Paleotto’s text, the shroud is the space of the meditation on Christ’s passion. After the intellect has studied this inner space in greater detail, the will leads us “to d~<br>

Abstract: As developed in
         Interpretation Theoryand elsewhere, Ricoeur’s position is best known for his reworking of the “reference” of the text. Where many philosophers and theologians have tended to treat reference as ostensive, designating a state of affairs or event “outside” or prior to the text, Ricoeur calls us to think of reference as a world of possibility that opens through the text. The text—especially biblical scripture—opens a distinctive, unique world in which a range of possibilities for reflection and practice emerge; as he writes, the goal of interpretation “is achieved insofar as the interpretation actualizes the meaning of the text for the present reader.”12Ricoeur and Frei therefore agree that biblical reference need not be conceived ostensively. However, from Frei’s standpoint, Ricoeur’s emphasis on the text opening a world of understanding for the reader moves too quickly toward the subjective appropriation of reference, occluding the possibility of the biblical narrative’s self‐referentiality.<br>

Abstract: A caveat:
      Critical Inquiry,in any number of ways, is a notoriously difficult journal to define. Calling it interdisciplinary or a journal of cultural critique are only ways of hiding or containing this difficulty. Perhaps its general nature can be summed up with words that Wayne Booth, Robert Streeter, and W. J. T. Mitchell used to help the journal both honor its founding editor and to work through a crisis of identity (who are we if we are no longer the journal edited by its founder?). Here they describe Sheldon Sacks in hisCIobituary: “Along with his commitment to theoretical inquiry, he responded warmly to the personal, the offbeat, the idiosyncratic.”1We might addthe passionateorthe polemicto this list, for, in another moment of self‐definition (generated again by a crisis of identity: are we the kind of journal that publishes polemics, specifically Edward Said’s statements against the state of Israel?), the journal’s coeditors endorsed the following declaration by Mitchell:
            The polemic, the passionate essay, the personal essay, the generally idiosyncratic essay require a generalist’s knowledge built from wide reading, but not the bibliography of a theorist and certainly not the footnote structure of a professional academic. And so we note that 137 published pieces in thirty volumes of
               
         Critical Inquiryis a journal dedicated to debate, dialogue, and controversy. We may hope for the elevated, disinterested discourse of angels, but we have to settle for the passionate engaged voices of men and women in real historical situations.… Once a question of general urgency has been raised, we would not presume to dictate inflexible limits of propriety or to rely unquestioningly on appeals to the authority of experts. In this policy of critical tolerance of polemic, we find ourselves aligned with William Hazlitt: “passion … is the essence, the chief ingredient in moral truth.”2

Abstract: Maurice Halbwachs’s (
         1992) notions of collective memory can help to conceptualize the processing of history that went on in Mrs. Barrett’s room. To do so, however, it’s worth contextualizing Halbwachs’s own work, as his most famous writing,La memoire collective, was published in 1950, five years after Halbwachs's death at Buchenwald concentration camp. He had been working on the volume when the Nazis invaded the French city of Strasbourg, where he lived. Patrick Hutton suggests that, in light of these circumstances, “one senses … that [Halbwachs’s] thoughts on the subject were still provisional” (1993, 74). Specifically, Hutton critiques Halbwachs’s positivistic notions of history, his passionate loyalty to the claim that history exists outside of collective memory, inaccessible though it may be. Hutton explains, “To Halbwachs’s way of thinking, history considers a past from which living memory has been distilled, one that may be reconstructed from its evidentiary leavings but whose mentality or subjective state of mind cannot be resurrected. As he remarked in a telling simile: ‘History is like a crowded graveyard to which new tombstones are continually being added’” (76). In short, history’s chambers are inaccessible to the living, opposed intrinsically and forever to the needs and dictates of the present.<br>

Abstract: I have now described the complexity of multicivilization problems in the interaction between the diverse cultures and religions in modern society from an observer perspective and indicated that the constitutional state and human rights provide an appropriate framework for the human dignity, freedom, and equality that they should accord each other. The aim is to prevent religious apartheid and cold peace between religions from deteriorating into cold war, conflict, and strife. That does not rule out interreligious dialogue, as I pointed out, but it has to be situated in a framework of constitutionalism and human rights. One should not expect too much from this framework, for it cannot be assumed that age‐old civilizations, each encompassing many nations and peoples, will put their beliefs, values, and norms at stake in transforming dialogue just like that.<br>

Abstract: It is appropriate at this point to go back and “recall” the opening reminiscences of this text. This recollection is no longer the same as the initial experience, of course; it is inflected by the thoughts that have come in between. Strictly speaking, only the statues in front of the university would correspond entirely to the notion of
         lieu de mémoireas utilized and defined by Nora. For the generations who were part of the institution‐building efforts of the young state and for whom the figures of the “pre‐Liberation period” were an important component of their immediate childhood memories, and not just textbook entries, the monument to the Brothers Georgievi (placed in 1934) used to be a veritablemilieu de mémoire.
            95To didactic historians, probably the most widely distributed breed among the species, these figures stand as symbols of genuine patriotism and selfless charity to be admired and emulated. To contemporary students, their names mean very little, and few actually know anything about their lives and other exploits. If not entirely forgotten, their huge bronze images, “like seashells on the shore from which the sea of living memory has retreated,” tease the historical memory of college students who pass by them every morning. There is nothing exceptional or unexpected in this. As Reinhart Koselleck has remarked: “Memorials, like all works of art, have a surplus potential to take on a life of their own. For this reason, the original meaning of countless memorials is no longer recognizable without recourse to inscriptions or other empirically comprehensible reference signals.”96<br>

Abstract: Empirical studies of these multiple conditions do in fact suggest ways in which children exercise social agency, such as through resilience to poverty’s effects, awareness of family situation, support of parental employment, self‐limitation of wants, and capabilities to adapt and grow even under the severest conditions. However, they also reveal a massive failure of American society to respond to the needs of its most vulnerable members, and indeed to respond to human vulnerability as such. The problem faced in children’s poverty is not just children’s lack of social participation. The problem, more fundamentally, is that “social participation” in the United States today is defined in a primarily adult, individualistic, market competitive, and utilitarian way, so that children are bound to lose out. Barbara Bennett Woodhouse has argued that American “rights” language tends to emphasize this kind of state‐free autonomy over state support for needs and dignity.
         47Or, as Jürgen Habermas would put it, the lifeworld of children (both within and outside families) has been thoroughly “colonized” by the values of the marketplace, values that happen to be chiefly agential and adult.48<br>

Abstract: Library professionals will not take a stand on ethical matters beyond the insistence that patrons should have equal and open access to whatever sources they desire. An information‐professional might correct you were you to state that Chicago is the capital of the state of Illinois, but that same professional apparently will refrain from criticizing your opinion were you to state that sadism is to be encouraged. Notice that making such distinct responses assumes that the two items of belief are radically different in kind: the one is factual information about which a professional can make judgments, the other is not.

Abstract: Like the Book of Mormon, the JST places the knowledge of Christ and the offer of salvation prior to Jesus’s birth. Explicitly, salvation is the plan from the beginning and atonement is God’s anticipatory response to human defection. Hence, a BCE figure in the Book of Mormon will explain: “if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end. And they would have … remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin. But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.”
         64What Adam and Eve originate for their progeny is not evil, but death: “by reason of transgression cometh the fall, which fall bringeth death.”65In the JST narrative, humans are by nature separate, not evil. “The Fall” is not a fall into evil, but into alienation. Adam and Eve’s legacy is not to change human nature but, rather, to change the conditions under which that nature will be developed, that is, out of God’s presence and in a world where “God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other,” according to the Book of Mormon.66<br>

Abstract: Popper would have none of it for two reasons. Being a philosopher of science, Popper believed that history is “characterized by its interest in actual, singular, or specific events, rather than in laws or generalizations” [
      75p. 143]. For Popper, history becomes an empirical science, like other disciplines within the social sciences, because of its interest in particular acts and events. This view of history goes back to Thucydides. There is a second reason, however, for Popper’s disdain for this version of historicism. Anyone who has read his earlierThe Open Society and Its Enemiesknows that Popper sees in Plato’s essentialist analysis of the state and in Hegel’s dialectical theory of history the two foundations of twentieth‐century totalitarianism [76, vol. 1, p. 24; vol. 2, p. 193.]. Totalitarianism is the opposite of what Herder intended in his philosophical reflections on the history of mankind. Only in a free and open society could Herder’s historicism become possible for scholars to use.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: The mourning strategies adopted respectively by Augustine and Marcel suggest that the death of the beloved may teach us how to disrupt the foundation of self‐reflexivity upon which, as we saw with regard to the split selves of Augustine and Marcel, we tend to erect our own identity. In
         Memory, History, Forgetting, Ricoeur advocates a mourning strategy equivalent with a similar goal. At first, he says, the death of the beloved brings about “a genuine amputation of oneself.” But then the experience of mourning entails “internalization,” a new level of personal identification for both the love object, lost to death, and our own self as a subject predicated on affections that now manifest themselves in absentia. This new self‐identification, in turn, trains us in the “anticipation” of our own futural self as predicated on the “plurality” that death will one day bestow on us in the memory of our dear ones.67This is the equivalent of the compassionate reciprocity with the subject of one’s grief that, as mentioned in my opening remarks, justifies the state of mourning, or, in Nussbaum’s words, makes compassion “comprehensible.”68<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur,
            Memory, History, Forgetting, 68. Memory for Augustine is subject to the power of time, also understood as the power of death. Book 11 ofConfessions, exploring time as both a condition for and subject of memory, underscores finite humanity’s being‐toward‐death, the fact that time is “the impending state ofnot being.” SeeConfessions, bk. 11, par. 14. Ricoeur engages Heidegger on memory, historicity, and death inMemory, History, Forgetting, 357–69. See also n. 48.<br>

Abstract: Here we find, I suggest, one of the roots of the current global debate about religion and humanism. At the level of structures of perception and frameworks of experience, the present tendency, unlike the ancients', is to draw the distinction between a humanistic outlook and a religious one in terms of the scope of human knowledge. Humanists explore the domain of human makings and so the realms of history, language, and culture in which we fashion and seek meaningful individual and social lives. Reality exceeds human makings, yet knowledge centers on our creative powers and finite limits (as Immanuel Kant first insisted). The humanist account of knowledge, thus, requires the denial of any other higher, sacred, or revealed meanings. The religions, conversely, are believed to present a different observation of the world that transgresses or exceeds human epistemic limits. Lived social reality on a global scale is being structured by a debate about the creation of meaning and the dynamics of human understanding. The debate comes to a head in disputes about posting the Ten Commandments at state houses or riots and deaths over political cartoons of religious figures and, more subtly, in theories about language and the scope of knowledge.

Abstract: By the time the SCS added media to its name in 2002, the transformation of the landscape had already occurred. One of the strongest new graduate programs to arise in the country, that of the University of Chicago, had baptized itself the Committee on Cinema and Media Studies. At Brown University, prominent film scholars work within a department called Modern Culture and Media. And the six‐hundred page
         The Oxford Handbook of Film and Media Studies, which the publisher describes as a “state‐of‐the‐art survey of current thinking and research” in the field as it now seems constituted, has now been published. Robert Kolker's fine introduction puts in play every permutation of the book's two key terms and the objects they deal with.
               Kolker, a former president of SCS, finds film studies to be hampered by being tied to a large yet circumscribed set of texts. It revolves around objects whose density is great enough to keep a complex array of issues in orbit. Media studies, on the other hand, is not tied down by such gravity. It floats through a universe that contains artifacts of all sorts, not just the beautiful Milky Way of films but other galaxies, gaseous clouds, space junk, and the solar winds that carry it along. Artifacts precipitate from the processes and forces that are media studies' true concern. Once nearly the exclusive province of social science approaches, this field has emerged within the humanities as a type of cultural studies. The latter, while infiltrating and sometimes taking over numerous departments, seldom constitutes an academic unit since the topics it takes up are so vast, so variegated, and so amorphous.Traditional film studies starts with the individual work, genre, or director, and moves outward to larger issues of the ideologies of production and reception, to gender issues, to the effects of distribution on viewership, and increasingly to the ways globalization is affecting national cinemas, always attempting to solidif~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: In conclusion, Coleridge testifies, in poetry and theological reflection alike, to an internal struggle constitutive of prayer and its language. Going back to the most recent philosophical discussions, this is not incompatible with Derrida’s insistence that the words of prayer are always inappropriate to the Other. Yet because Coleridgean prayer is a response, this struggle is entirely fitting: the call of God upon the subject is to open up the for‐God in one’s being, thus by definition practicing a kind of violence against one’s current being—including one’s speech. In
         Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit, Coleridge describes the name of God, the “I Am,” as part of a religious category called “stasis.” Prayer, however, is part ofmetastasis‐anastasis(change of state/rising up): the conflictual, dynamic, unfinished scene of human redemption that includes grace, love, hope, and perseverance.71Appropriately enough, the primary signification of metastasis is a transition between rhetorical figures. For Coleridge, there can be no transformation in one’s spiritual state unless the language in which one responds is also transformed, wrenched toward the improper. The heart of Coleridgean prayer is the metastasis between proper signification and catachresis that cuts against one’s language, one’s understanding, and hence one’s being in order to open oneself up to God. Perhaps one may even argue that in this cut, this wound, made against the “fleshly Understanding” (N6666, fol. 83), “the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered” (Rom. 8:26). This, certainly, is a hope on which much of his poetry and certainly his philosophy of prayer is founded.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: The studies under review represent significant revisions to the narrative of secularization. Their point of departure, as this essay has argued, is Enlightenment-era reactions to the inaccessibility of a radically transcendent, hidden God. By investing temporal concepts and institutions with new meanings that approximated religion's function of legitimizing human existence, eighteenth-century philosophers and theologians made the imperatives of the temporal sphere as binding as divine hierarchies once had been. Of course, the operative elements of this process varied, depending on the monograph in question: for Bell and Sepinwall, it was the regeneration of the nation-state and its inhabitants; for Sutcliffe, it was the Enlightenment's efforts to transcend Judaism; for Sheehan, it was the translation and repackaging of Scripture; for Dupré, it was the human person's emergence as the fundamental source of meaning. Yet each of these scholars insists that religious culture had a decisive influence on the formation of “secular” ideals and institutions. Enlightenment and religion, so long regarded as antithetical to each other, are now viewed as overlapping and interdependent agents of historical change.<br>

Abstract: They also include mutual prayer. Prayer has been an essential element in Islamic battle preparations from ancient times through recent terrorist activities. Turkish‐Arabic prayer books from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries illustrate the role of prayer recitation as calming, initiating a sublime state of mind in warriors before battle.
            84Some commentators envision the last instructions as 90 percent prayer, wherein prayer is defined as “lifting up heart and mind to God.”85Prayer is enjoined at least four times in the first stage (instructions 3, 6, 11, 15), four times in the second stage and five times in the third stage. Presumably its purpose here is the same as it was in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: to induce a sublime state of mind before battle.<br>

Abstract: A promise is a gift. Yet, it is a gift that warps the ordinary economy of giving. In this, any thinker who develops promise as a gift must attend to those who are interested in interrupting the ordinary gift economies that the anthropologists since Marcel Mauss have considered. Those gifts of equivalence, as Ricoeur called them, are economies that demand gifts to be returned. Because a promise consists of a given pledge and its ultimate fulfillment, it can be considered a doubled and extended gift. We can then generally state that a promise is a doubled gift. The donor promises, offering a token, down payment, or one’s word as the pledge of the promised gift. He or she next fulfills that promise by giving the promised gift. These two gifts are actually a single, doubled gift since they are related to one another by the act of promising and its initial symbolic delivery. Further, the promise is an extended gift since the promissory token and its final gift are separated in time; as Mauss indicated that gifts take and make time, a promise requires time.
         39The delay that obtains between the doubled token and gift extends the promise throughout time.<br>

Abstract: However, while it could be argued that these similes function allegorically to show the loss of rational faculty to instinctual drives that explains the condition of the sinners in this circle, and while the similes do indeed describe the actions of the sinners, the vehicles in the similes are not just analogies. Rather, they function as microscopic views of the natural world of creatures and as part of the natural order of Dante's created universe: existing alone, they become sign, signified, and signifying, indifferent to humans or even to their place in the order of creatures; and, like all other creatures, in their immanent presence they perform and participate in a vast cosmic dance. Again, as Agamben puts it, describing animal captivation, the animal possesses a “more spellbinding and intense openness than any kind of human knowledge,” yet “it is closed in a total opacity.”
         62Animals—in this case, ants, fish, and birds—lacking consciousness of themselves as selves are captivated within themselves and by instinct and needs. This captivation, according to Agamben, following Heidegger, makes the world opaque to the nonhuman creature, yet this “captivation” also allows the animal to be “open” to the world, as vestige or footprint of a living divine presence. In this understanding of the ontology of the animal, we recognize that the animal is not in the postlapsarian human strife-ridden condition, trapped between being and nonbeing (consciousness and finitude). Rather, the animal exists in a state of obliviousness about the cares and anxieties that plague human consciousness. With the similes functioning heuristically, we then see the lustful inPurgatorio26, who are harnessing their recalcitrant desires, to aspire to this state possessed by nonhuman creatures and epitomized by the unconscious action of ants. In one sense the condition of the blessed, like that of the ants, is fullness of being, outside consciousness.<br>

Abstract: If we wish to express the principle of temporality in
         Ulyssesin terms of a formal concept, we could say with Augustine: within the continuous flux of unarticulated consciousness, everything is only to the extent that it is present; the past aspraesens de praeteritis[the present of the past], the present aspraesens de praesentibus[the present of the present], the future aspraesens de futuris[the present of the future]. All [manifestations of] time [alle Zeiten] are subjected to the movement, never to come to rest, of the actual flux of consciousness and are to flow into each other uninterruptedly: the past without any distance, modified and often also deformed, as a mere mirror; the present in a state of absolute contingency, a-causal and without any specificity (without any reference to a hierarchy of meanings), as mere perception; the future entirely as empty projection, in the mode of expectation, of mere intention or of passive desire, but never in the guise of a causal act of the will that would create a future for itself.

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: Faustus's rejection of faith is both producer and product of his sense that salvation will entail his own erasure, because it alienates him from his soul by alienating him from God; it is both producer and product of his determination not to read “past” what is material and embodied to what is intangible, because it gives him the sense that the intangible will turn out to be nothing. Yet Faustus's lack of faith does not enable him to feel that there is in fact no life after death. On the contrary, Faustus is obsessed with the afterlife and with hell specifically, about which he repeatedly questions Mephistopheles. Not that Faustus believes what Mephistopheles tells him about hell, however: he scoffs, “come, I think hell's a fable” (2.1.130) when the devil informs him that “hell hath no limits, nor is circumscribed / In one self place; for where we are is hell, / And where hell is, must we ever be” (2.1.124–26). Faustus will not imagine hell as a universally diffused, Augustinian state of privation; rather, he insists on imagining hell as an extension or reproduction of the university where he currently resides. In response to Mephistopheles' insistence that he himself is “damned, and…now in hell” (2.1.140), Faustus impatiently replies, “how now, in hell? Nay, and this be hell, / I'll willingly be damned here! What, walking, disputing, / etc.” (2.1.141–43). “Damned here…walking, disputing, etc.”: Faustus reveals how much it matters to him that hell be a place, and not a state of the soul. Faced with a salvation that seems to entail his annihilation in the disappearance or dissolution of his body, Faustus is comforted by the idea of a hell where he will walk and dispute, where he can have reading groups with the “old philosophers” (1.3.62) and where “the infernal spirits” will “swarm” (1.1.117) to his lectures. Imagining hell as a continuation of his brilliant academic career, Faustus simply sees damnation as the better choice.<br>

Abstract: Larmore critiques several familiar conceptions of authenticity. He argues that the effort to “become one” with one’s “intimate core” is self-defeating because recognition of this state would undo it (8). He also argues that the romantic idea of discovering a “true self” that “one is already” at heart without influence from others (9) is impossible—not only because such a union with “our inner core” could only be a by-product of other pursuits (17) but also because even our most original inspirations “take shape within a community” (34); we are essentially mimetic beings all the way down (34). Since I cannot do justice to these fascinating arguments here, I will simply register four quick reservations.<br>

Abstract: Among the multiple dimensions of social and cultural imagination, morality occupies a blurred place across social domains, being Religion, on the one hand, and Law, on the other, the traditional loci of the moral in classical anthropology. Tom Csordas’s article helps us think beyond tradition, pointing out a little addressed topic in the emerging subfield of the anthropology of morality: the notion of
         evil, which, by the way, was and still is of central concern in shamanic and witchcraft studies, and also in certain currents of contemporary philosophy. This article interrogates us about the possibility of defining morality “as a cultural system,” in Clifford Geertz’s sense. In doing so, the author seems to discard finally the idea of morality as a “cultural system” for a less systematic, dispersed set of moral meanings that traverse social life. In this undertaking he does not leave the central Geertzian concern on symbols and meaning. Ultimately, human action is mediated by symbols that condense and produce meaning. Here, meaning seems to be the master concept related to the anthropological study of morality. Among the cultural meanings that shape moralities, Csordas finds appropriate introducing cross-cultural notions of evil to enrich any anthropological approach to morality. In the multifarious realms of morality, evil appears as a complex idiom or code through which moral notions are expressed. And among cultural practices, witchcraft and sorcery are of central concern to understand how many societies build their moral frameworks. Regarded both as a human and a cosmological (or nonhuman) phenomenon, evil in Csordas’s view as a cross-cultural analytical category, might enlighten studies about what I may call the “moral installation in the world.” The latter is related with the existential approach to morality proposed in this article. But I consider that, in conceptual terms, morality is always hierarchically included in ontology (what is the nature of ~<br>

Abstract: Montgomery decides that this voice begins to belong to another as soon as Eve can positively attribute it to a visible “other”—in this case the angel. But who exactly is this angel? Critics and readers often speak at this point of Satan disguised as an angel—something like the disguise he adopts in book 3 when speaking to Uriel. Relating the two scenes, Regina Schwartz claims that “with hypocrisy so hidden, it is no wonder that Eve could not penetrate the disguise of the angel who flattered her in her dream.”
         
               We should, I think, draw at least a tentative distinction between the two scenes. In book 3 we know that Satan adopts a disguise that fools even the sharpest-sighted angels, but do we know that the mysterious figure in Eve’s dream is evil disguised as good? If there is no textual evidence for Satan speaking the dream into Eve’s ear, then neither is there any reason to imagine Satan as an actor on the dream stage, playing the lead in his own production. Following Samuel, we might say that Satan “induces” the unquiet physiological state in which Eve’s mind works but that ultimately both voice and figure are her own “productions.”25<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>

Abstract: Badiou also emphasizes that the subjects to the truth of the resurrection, by the very fidelity toward that truth, are enabled to “refuse to submit to the order of the world as it has existed and instead struggle for a new one.”
         
               The community of the believers is constituted by their faithfulness toward the event that, in turn, allows them—and only them—to see the truth that it communicates. While the State’s interest is always in reforming the world, the believers are not interested in reforming the existing reality but in the birth of a new one. Therefore, those who feed on the truth-event adopt “a necessary distance from the State and from what corresponds to the State in people’s consciousness: the apparatus of opinion.”168
            
               Following Paul, Badiou admonishes that “a truth is a serious and concentrated procedure, which must never enter into competition with established opinions.”169
            
               This distinction between the opinions and the truth may suggest the same anti-idolatrous tendency that underlies Bonhoeffer’s reflection on the arcane discipline: the church must not allow the truth of the resurrection to be “sold” to the world as one of many products, since that would cause the specifically Christian discourse of the evental grace to degenerate into something we might call the “market-discourse” or, somewhat ironically, the “American discourse.”170<br>

Abstract: The meaning of
         catharsisin Aristotle’sPoeticsis heavily debated, with most interpretations clustering around three key translations: purgation, purification, and clarification. In his 1599 treatise on tragicomedy, Giambattista Guarini likened catharsis to the medical procedure of purging, as neither seeks eradication of the target element but instead restoration of balance (The Compendium of Tragicomic Poetry (1599), inLiterary Criticism: Plato to Dryden, ed. Allan H. Gilbert [Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1962], 517–20; see also O. B. Hardison Jr., “Three Types of Renaissance Catharsis,” inPoetics and Praxis, Understanding and Imagination: The Collected Essays of O. B. Hardison, Jr.[Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1997], 78–94). Martha C. Nussbaum has characterized catharsis as a “clearing up” or “cleaning up” of emotions (“Tragedy and Self-Sufficiency: Plato and Aristotle on Fear and Pity,” inEssays on Aristotle’sPoetics, ed. Amélie Oksenberg Rorty [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1992], 280), and Gerald F. Else has argued that catharsis is a purification of the act of the character rather than a purgation of the emotions of the audience (Aristotle’s Poetics: The Argument[Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1963], 230–31, 422–40). John P. Anton, critiquing Nietzsche’s reading of Aristotle’sPoetics, argues that Nietzsche was incorrect in construing catharsis as a purge of emotions, also claiming that it is a clarification of events (“Nietzsche’s Critique of Aristotle’s Theory of Tragic Emotions,” inTragedy and Philosophy, ed. N. Georgopoulos [New York: St. Martin’s, 1993], 19–38). In light of this ongoing debate about the meaning of a single Greek word, several critics have suggested other language and models through which to examine the phenomenon of audience response to tragedy—a useful critical strategy for discussing how modern audiences might conceptualize their own reaction to what they see on stage.

Abstract: The Ionian cosmogonies of the sixth century b.c.e. explained how an ordered world evolved out of an undifferentiated initial state of “things.” In the fifth century, science became more particularly an inquiry into the ultimate constitution of material substance: the uniform and permanent “nature of things.” The notion of substance derives from tactile sensation. The belief in substantial things outside us reverts to the original detachment of self from the object. With Heraclitus of Ephesus, philosophy focused on knowing the thing, not on that which is known. Thought controls the phenomena as it constitutes the thinker. The problem of understanding nature was taken to a new level. The Milesian school of philosophers had moved it to the realm of the intellect in that they claimed the universe to be an intelligible whole. The manifold was to be understood as deriving from a sustaining principle or first cause, but was to be perceived in the phenomena.<br>

Abstract: As the publication of the
         Collected Works of Eric Voegelinare nearing completion, the University of Missouri Press has issued a new series,The Eric Voegelin Institute Series in Political Philosophy, that places Voegelin's works in the context of those of other philosophers and thinkers. Two recent books from this series,Faith and PhilosophyandEric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmoderns, examine Voegelin's writings in his exchanges with Leo Strauss and in the context of postmodern philosophy.Faith and Philosophyis an updated version of the 1993 Pennsylvania State University Press edition and does not contain Part Three: the essays that analyze Strauss' and Voegelin's philosophies;Eric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmodernsis a collection of essays that compares Voegelin with such postmodern thinkers as Levinas and Patočka. The editors of both books offer excellent introductions to Voegelin's philosophy, but these books are for advanced students of Voegelinian scholarship and should not be consulted as an introduction to it.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ca.2006.25.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 2006<br>
Author(s): Moatti Claudia<br>
Abstract: AbstractThis paper isolates movement as a topic for analysis in Roman imperial history. Movement is regarded under three aspects: translation (of texts, practices, ideas), migration (of officials, merchants, students, etc.), and communication (i.e. the movement of written documents). Interrelationships among the three aspects of movement are identified and discussed, as are the shared impact of translation, migration, and communication on issues of cultural and social identity and political negotiation and control. The article argues that movement changes the role of the state as well as relations between individual and states, augments the use of writing in society, transforms identities, and gives impulse to internal and external regulations. The implications of movement are understood as both pragmatic and formal, altering relations to space and time and influencing ways of organizing and thinking. The author surveys current work in the field and identifies potential areas for future research. The paper draws heavily on both literary and documentary sources and discusses material from the late republic through late antiquity, paying particular attention to continuities and discontinuities between early and later periods of the Roman empire.<br>

Abstract: Swartwout wrote that in the beginning of his independent practice he had used standard sheets of linen measuring 4 by 5 feet or even 4 by 7 feet; he discussed the projects of the Denver Post Office (1909–11) and the Missouri State Capitol (1913–18) in "Working Drawings, The Contract Set,"
               Pencil Points5, no. 10 (Oct. 1924), 39; cited in Eugene Clute,Drafting Room Practice, 155). Swartwout reported that the blueprints for the Missouri State Capitol had to be carried around the site in a wheelbarrow. It should be noted that in this article Swartwout advocated the use of smaller and less meticulous drawings, and stated that in his projects that followed the Missouri State Capitol he started using smaller sizes of drafting sheets. However, the "more modest" size that he used in his later practice was still much larger than those used today. Besides, the drawings, which the firm produced several years later—and that Swartwout reproduced to illustrate his later, less ambitious methods—show that his graphic techniques (which he claimed being totally void of anything that builders did not need) were quite lavish and did contain much excessive information.<br>

Author(s): Abbott Don Paul<br>
Abstract: AbstractBeginning with Roland Barthes' “The Old Rhetoric: an aide-mémoire” (1964–65), semioticians have shown a remarkable interest in the history of rhetoric. Writers like Barthes, Tzevtan Todorov, Gérard Genette, and Paul Ricoeur have offered accounts of rhetoric's past that invariably concluded with rhetoric's demise and its replacement with semiotics. These writers typically portray rhetoric's history as one of a brief rise followed by a very long decline, a pattern, says Todorov, of “splendor and misery.” This essay examines the semioticians' predictions of rhetoric's demise as well as semiotics' attempt to claim elements of rhetoric as its own. The essay concludes by considering the present state of semiotics' aspiration to supersede rhetoric as a theory of language and human affairs.<br>

Abstract: Memoria Abierta's work responds to the need for a dialogue in Argentina among human rights organizations, the government, and civil society that will stimulate the formation of a collective memory about the history of State-led terrorism in the country. Processing documents, testimonies, and images related to the history of illegal repression in Argentina (c. 1974–1983), and creating a topographical reconstruction of the locations where State-led terrorism occurred poses diverse ethical, technical, and political problems regarding the recollection, description, transmission, and diffusion of the materials of memory. This article describes some of these challenges and how they affect and are shaped by the work of Memoria Abierta.<br>

Article Title: Entrepreneurial Education Makes Its Debut in Israel: New Curriculum in an Ideological Shift<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.<br>
Issue: i250458<br>
Date: 4 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Yehoshua Dani<br>
Abstract: The introduction of entrepreneurial education (EE) in the Israeli education system is discussed in this article as an example of the introduction of new curriculum. We argue that this introduction should be construed as a consequence of major ideological changes in Israel and its education system, a change from collectivist to individualistic values. We open with an analysis of a Ministry of Education publication that introduces the EE program and find that it is loaded with references to Zionist myths. We suggest that relying on references to these myths in promoting EE reflects a need to disguise the discontinuity between the social values behind the new curriculum and the traditional collectivist values of pioneering Zionism. We note that the Israeli programs exercise EE in groups, whereby the responsibility for the new ventures is shared by the group members. We suggest that adopting the group method indicates a compromise between a completely individualistic and competitive approach to entrepreneurship and a collectivist approach to coping with new tasks-which is more in line with traditional Zionist values. We argue that the change of atmosphere from collectivism to individualism is a result of demographic and economic processes that have occurred since the establishment of the Israeli state, and that these processes may be exposed through observing the Israeli youth movements and the public discourse. We believe that the gradual shift from collectivism to individualism is a central factor in explaining the timing of EE's introduction in Israel.<br>

Article Title: Rethinking the Political: Some Heideggerian Contributions<br>
Publisher: University of Notre Dame<br>
Issue: i261382<br>
Date: 10 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Pangle Fred<br>
Abstract: Recent literature on Heidegger concentrates heavily on his (temporary) involvement in or collusion with Nazi ideology and policies. Without belittling the gravity of the issue, this article shifts the focus somewhat by invoking a distinction which recently has emerged (or reemerged) in political thought: namely, the distinction between "politics" and "the political" or between politics viewed as partisan ideology or policy making, on the one hand, and politics seen as regime or paradigmatic framework, on the other. The main thesis of the article is that Heidegger's promising contributions to political theory are located on the level of ontology or paradigmatic framework rather than that of ideological partisanship. While not neglecting the dismal intrusions of the latter plane, the article probes Heideggerian cues for a "rethinking of the political" by placing the accent on four topical areas: first, the status of the subject or individual as political agent; second, the character of the political community, that is, of the polity or (in modern terms) the "state"; thirdly, the issue of cultural and political development or modernization; and finally, the problem of an emerging cosmopolis or world order beyond the confines of Western culture. In discussing these topics, an effort is made to disentangle Heidegger from possible misinterpretations and to indicate how, in each area, his thought pointed in the direction of an "overcoming" of Western political metaphysics.<br>

Abstract: This study of organised political violence in north-central Nicaragua from 1926 to 1934 focuses on the infamous Conservative gang leader Anastacio Hernandez and on Sandino's rebels. The contexts of a weak central state and local-regional caudillismo are outlined. It is shown that after the 1926-27 civil war. Hernandez and others produced ritualised spectacular violence in the service of their Chamorrista caudillo patrons. The language, practices, and characteristics of organised violence are examined. It is argued that Sandino's rebels appropriated these tools of political struggle, and that changes and continuities in the organisation of violence in Nicaraguan history merit greater attention.<br>

Publisher: Butterworths Scientific Limited<br>
Issue: i272292<br>

Author(s): Llosa Roberto<br>
Abstract: Notre analyse repose sur deux hypothèses générales complémentaires. La première hypothèse affirme l'existence non pas d'une crise de la pensée politique mais de trois situations critiques auxquelles doit faire face le pensée politique et qui déterminent des formes d'incertitude spécifiques, irréductibles les unes aux autres. La deuxième hypothèse affirme que l'intelligibilité des crises que connaît la pensée politique passe par celle des conditions politiques dans lesquelles s'exerce cette pensée. Pour préciser ces deux hypothèses nous faisons appel à un modèle construit à partir de la structure d'une action. Trois formes d'incertitude sont ainsi repérées: une incertitude concernant les valeurs, une incertitude concernant l'état des choses et une incertitude portant sur les voies d'action. Transposées sur le plan ou la dimension de la structure sociale, ces trois formes d'incertitude sont à saisir et à examiner respectivement comme crise au niveau du système de légitimation et de motivation, comme crise au niveau du système organisationnel ou des institutions et comme crise au niveau des stratégies ou système "opérationnel". Nous localisons la première forme de crise dans les sociétés du capitalisme "central", la deuxième dans les formations sociales socialistes et la troisième dans les sociétés du capitalisme "périphérique". A partir d'une analyse des conditions politiques qui ont rendu possible l'émergence de ces formes spécifiques de crise nous essayons de déterminer au moins certaines conditions nécessaires--mais non pas suffisantes--de leur dépassement. /// Two general complementary hypotheses underlie this analysis. The first contends that, although political science does not confront a crisis, it faces three critical challenges giving rise to uncertainty in the discipline. The second hypothesis asserts that to understand the present challenges testing political theory, it is necessary to relate the latter to the prevailing political context. To clarify the tw~<br>

Abstract: Freud: "The analytic treatment now proceeds to follow [the libido]; it seeks to
track down the libido, to make it accessible to consciousness and, in the end, serviceable
for reality. Where the investigations of analysis come upon the libido withdrawn into
its hiding place, a struggle is bound to break out; all the foreces which have caused the li-
bido to regreess will rise up as 'resistances' against the work of analysis, in order to con-]
serve the new state of things" (1912:12)]

Publisher: Philosophy of Science Association<br>
Issue: i209984<br>

Author(s): van Fraassen Patrick A.<br>
Abstract: Using the methods of hermeneutic phenomenology, and against the background of the principle that the real is what is or can be given in a public way in perception as a state of the World, and of the thesis established elsewhere that acts of perception are always epistemic, contextual, and hermeneutical, the writer proposes that objects of scientific observation are perceptual objects, states of the World described by theoretical scientific terms and, therefore, real. This thesis of Hermeneutical Realism is proved by showing how the response of a standard instrument is 'read' as if it were a 'text'. Conclusions are then drawn about a number of topics, including Scientific Realism, Conventionalism, and Cultural Relativism.<br>

Publisher: African Studies Association<br>

Author(s): de Lame Danielle<br>
Abstract: Rwanda became a Belgian trusteeship under mandate of the Société des Nations after the first World War. With churches playing a prominent role in the political evolution of Rwanda, the two countries were closely bound together. After the 1959 revolution in Rwanda and independence in 1962, development cooperation with strong NGO input still linked them. While the genocide still has tragic influence on the new Rwanda, Belgium has undergone a political process leading to a federal state. The colonial past refers to a national past. Changes in Rwanda and Belgium question any collective attempt of mourning for a past that is very different for all parties involved. /// Le Rwanda devint une possession de la Belgique sous le mandat de la Société des Nations après la Première Guerre Mondiale. La conséquence du rôle proéminent des églises dans l'évolution politique du Rwanda fut la création de liens étroits entre les deux pays. Après la révolution de 1959 au Rwanda et l'indépendance en 1962, la coopération de développement avec l'impact des ONG ont maintenu ces liens entre les deux pays. Alors que le génocide a aujourd'hui toujours des conséquences sur le Rwanda moderne, la Belgique a, elle, a vécu une transformation politique menant à la formation d'un état fédéral. Le passé colonial se mire dans le passé national. Les transformations du Rwanda et de la Belgique mettent en question toute tentative collective de faire l'expérience du deuil d'un passé commun, vécu de manière très différente par les deux cultures.<br>

Publisher: Taylor & Francis<br>
Issue: i20184615<br>
Date: 11 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Iguchi Kawori<br>
Abstract: This article seeks to explore the act of reading as an essential element of notated musical practices and of the construction of knowledge about them. By examining how musical notations affect their reader-performers (and vice versa) in two different musical contexts in Japan--the Kyoto Gion festival and amateur lessons on the nohkan flute--the article draws attention to the ways in which the act of reading notation is central to the construction of knowledge about such musical practices. With reference to Etienne Wenger's notion of learning as a process of alignment, and to debates in the anthropology of reading, it then argues that, for learners of these musics, reading notations is a practice of reverse tracing towards the bodily practices of the accomplished. In discussing the musicians' concern for the efficacy of reading as a means of achieving a relevant state of understanding, the article also addresses questions on the role of reading as a method of becoming knowledgeable in the practice of anthropological inquiry.<br>

Abstract: Su questo aspetto vedi anche R. Seaford (2000) part. p. 37 s. n. 36 e passim. L'approc-
cio di S.I., che non prende in considerazione questo contributo, offre il vantaggio rispetto
all'analisi di Seaford (su cui vedi anche Reciprocity and Ritual: Homer and Tragedy in the De-
veloping City-State, Oxford 1994), di non collegare meccanicamente la rilevanza del culto
menzionato nella tragedia alla concreta pratica ateniese. Attraverso i meccanismi di avvi-
cinamento anche un culto non ateniese può essere collegato a un aspetto ateniese del dio
come avviene, ad esempio, nel caso dell'Artemide taurica collegata a quella ateniese nella
menzione di aspetti 'brauroni' della dea.<br>

Abstract: Chile's collective memory has been brutalized by state-implemented terrorism. This historical process has resulted in, among other things, a "torn collective memory." The history and memory of the period of so-called popular power (1970-1973) continue to be largely unknown. Oral history allows us to begin a slow process of historical reconstruction as well as to reflect on the construction of militant memories.<br>

Abstract: This article reviews some new international releases in the field of discourse analysis in the tradition of Michel FOUCAULT. This kind of Foucauldian discourse analysis is related to other forms in the wider interdisciplinary field of discourse analysis. Nonetheless, it can be demonstrated that the Foucauldian form of discourse analysis is the most relevant one for contemporary analysis in the social sciences. It is argued that in the German social sciences the term "discourse analysis" is primarily used for theoretical social research or is used for empirical social research, without disclosing discourse-analytic methodology. Since the 1990s, the development of empirical methodologies for social discourse analysis in Germany has intensified. From it's beginning in the late 1960s, French methodology of discourse analysis has been empirically orientated. Here, the work of Michel PÊCHEUX is the central influence in which the epistemology of discourse analysis is thoroughly discussed and theorized. In France, PÊCHEUX continued the work of Michel FOUCAULT and, since then, one can speak of a Foucauldian tradition of discourse analysis, namely "French Discourse Analysis" (FDA). This review outlines the state-of- the-art of the transformation of Foucauldian discourse theory into a discourse-analytic methodology as a new kind of qualitative social research. For this reason, the influence and the analytic tools of linguistics are critically reviewed and a comparison of FDA in France and Foucauldian discourse analysis in Germany is undertaken. The first book reviewed is a British monograph from Glyn WILLIAMS that describes the development of French discourse analysis in the context of structuralism and post-structuralism. The book contains a thorough update of French discourse analysis and is path breaking for German readers of the discourse-analytic work of Michel PÊCHEUX. The volume comes on the heels of a new German handbook of social discourse analysis (edited by KELLER; ~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i211061<br>
Date: 7 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Ku Agnes S.<br>
Abstract: There exist around the notion of the public three different yet overlapping dichotomies posed on different levels of analysis: public (sphere) versus private (sphere), public versus mass, and publicness versus privacy/secrecy. Habermas's book ([1962]1989) incorporates all the three sets of dichotomy without resolving the contradictory meanings and bridging the gaps among them. As a result, his conception of the public sphere becomes paradoxical in terms, and it undertheorizes the cultural property of publicness. This article proposes an alternative conception of the public that may encompass the structural, institutional, and cultural levels of theorization in a more precise and coherent way. It is argued that the public is an imagined category about citizen membership that is attached to both institutions of state and civil society. In political practices, a symbolic "public" is institutionalized through an open communicative space where it is called upon, constructed, and contested as the central source of cultural references. In this connection, a notion of public credibility is introduced as an attempt to bring forth a richer and more dynamic conception about the role of culture in democratic struggles than that of critical rationality by Habermas.<br>

Article Title: Words and things in Yucatán: poststructuralism and the everyday life of Mayan multiculturalism<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i23011305<br>
Date: 3 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Armstrong-Fumero Fernando<br>
Abstract: This article draws on ethnographic examples to examine how rural Maya-speakers in the Mexican state of Yucatán ground the experience of identity politics in quotidian engagements with pre-Hispanic objects and utterances in the Maya language. My argument is intended as a revision of models of critical scholarship that have been influenced by poststructuralism and that place an overwhelming emphasis on discourse as a modality through which politically viable identities are created and performed. Specific examples show how vernacular multiculturalism is shaped by the agency of forms of language use and physical objects that have been a part of local life-worlds long before the popularization of Mayan identity politics. This offers some potentials for collaborative work that have not been fully explored in poststructural critiques of representation. L'auteur s'appuie sur des exemples ethnographiques pour étudier la manière dont les locuteurs du maya vivant dans les zones rurales de l'état mexicain du Yucatán fondent leur expérience de la politique identitaire sur une interaction quotidienne avec les objets et énoncés préhispaniques de la langue maya. Son argumentation se veut une remise en cause des modèles universitaires critiques influencés par le poststructuralisme, qui mettent lourdement l'accent sur le discours en tant que modalité permettant de créer et de réaliser des identités politiquement viables. Des exemples concrets montrent comme un multiculturalisme vernaculaire se constitue par l'action des formes d'usage du langage et des objets matériels qui faisaient partie de la vie locale longtemps avant que la politique identitaire maya se popularise. Cette approche offre un potentiel de travail en collaboration qui n'a pas été complètement exploré par les critiques poststructuralistes de la représentation.<br>

Abstract: The work of William Sewell and Marshall Sahlins has led to a growing interest in recent years in events as a category of analysis and their role in the transformation of social structures. I argue that tying events solely to instances of significant structural transformation entails problematic theoretical assumptions about stability and change and produces a circumscribed field of events, undercutting the goal of developing an "eventful" account of social life. Social continuity is a state that is achieved just as much as are structural transformations, and events may be constitutive of processes of reproduction as well as change.<br>

Author(s): Øye Inger-Elin<br>
Abstract: Building on 25 months of fieldwork in eastern Germany from 1991 to 2003, this article explores the interpenetration of aesthetics and politics, and questions them as theoretical categories. A multilayered description depicts aesthetic perception and action, guided by an imagery of façade, as constituted and reproduced by state policies, positioned experiences, and subversive responses. Moving beyond the Cold War legacy, aesthetics' potency and politicization is dated back to early nation building and Protestant and Romantic influences. Being essential to and controlled by shifting, largely authoritarian regimes, aesthetics simultaneously provided a 'shadow life' and a 'lingua franca', cross-cutting verbal and non-verbal mediums and everyday and high culture, as people juggled with, distrusted, and decoded surfaces, expressing and in search of deeper, hidden truths. I argue that historically generated aesthetic perceptions and praxis not only mark east German political culture but also emerge in Habermas's public sphere theory and, moreover, offer arguments to revise it.<br>

Abstract: This article proposes using the theoretical discussions of Deleuze and Guattari as a means of comprehending the various ways in which individuals speak about their ethnic identity. This is done through a case study of a state-run educational boarding school offered to subjects identified as 'ethnic' in Israel. The findings expose two ways of talking about ethnic identity: 'minor language' and 'major language'. What I term the 'major language of ethnicity' makes substantial use of state language and offers two hierarchical categories that serve as an archetype for classifying groups. The 'minor language of ethnicity', on the other hand, offers multiple local identifications and potential identity alternatives. The article suggests using dynamics at the foundation of these concepts to consider the position of the researcher and to expose existential 'lines of flight' and life inventions of subjects in everyday life.<br>

Abstract: This commentary reflects on the first official visit made by a British monarch to Ireland since its independence. Focusing on three key moments of Queen Elizabeth's itinerary — the Garden of Remembrance, the Irish National War Memorial, Islandbridge, and the state banquet, Dublin Castle — I suggest that efforts to simultaneously honour rebels/soldiers in acts of public remembrance sought to re-position the past between these two islands in ways which recognised conflict but also aspired towards reconciled understandings of how that past could be more peacefully calibrated.<br>

Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23548425<br>
Date: 1 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): BLOOMQUIST L. GREGORY<br>
Abstract: In this article I suggest ways in which rhetorical analysis can complement sociological analysis of early Christianity. On the basis of a universally acknowledged saying of Jesus ("blessed are you poor"), I suggest that those who use social scientific perspectives need to clarify more accurately the levels of data from which they are working (i.e., when they are working with probably early material, possibly the words of Jesus himself, and when they are working with the later elaboration of the traditional material) and to identify the rhetorical value of each level. I then show how, contrary to sociological analysis that depicts Jesus as merely proclaiming reversal, the historical Jesus proclaimed a reversal that had already happened but one that was away from God's intended order: what the historical Jesus was calling for was a future restoration to a state that existed before the reversal. Attention to the rhetorical nature of his follower's use of this proclamation, however, shows that when the author of the Gospel of Luke and the Lukan Acts of the Apostles uses the language of reversal and restoration, he now does so to describe what was happening not primarily vis-à-vis "the world" but in their own, now Christian communities Jesus' message of reversal of the fate of the poor becomes in this way the Lukan message of the apostolic governance of that reversal, that is, the broker's (the apostolic leadership's, after the model of Jesus) dispensation of the patron's (God's) resources.<br>

Abstract: This article studies the institutional context of recent reforms in ecclesiastical faculties, with special attention to the transformation of modern Universities. Four major problems are raised in this period of University renewal. 1) Should Universities stress research or teaching functions? 2) Should they admit the mass of students or be reserved to an elite? 3) How can they organize efficiently the University community? 4) What is their responsibility towards the collectivity? With regard to the first question, the author notes the current emphasis on research as compared to teaching. A reasonable balance between these two functions may be attained by drawing from philosophies of education within the English, French, German and American traditions. A rewarding survey of recent University legislation in various countries is made. The post-industrial era calls for a stress on research in such a way as to link it more effectively with the teaching function of the University. As to the second question, youth today assumes its right to a University education. Universities can neither receive all candidates nor, on the other hand, systematically impose a « numerus clausus ». Selectivity is necessary. A system of diversified Colleges, Universities and Faculties would permit everyone with the prerequisite aptitudes to receive a University training. Planning would be necessary among the institutions of a given region. A system of gradual and qualified selection is suggested. The third problem concerns the University as a community. Recent reforms require effective collaboration among all the components of the University: administrators, professors, students. All should have some voice in university government. More important than structures is the mentality which will effect a genuine solidarity and consensus among all members of the University community. The fourth problem regards the University's relationship to the collectivity. The University must protect its academic~<br>

Abstract: Between the sixties and the eighties metaphysics has been in a state of crisis; logic and the human sciences seemed to have taken over. The last few years have, however, witnessed a return of metaphysics. Having first called to mind some of the features of the aforetold crisis and evoked some recent authors, the article proceeds to show how reflexive metaphysics is capable of integrating the demands of the physical sciences and mathematics, and through them of building up the idea of being. A constitutive requirement of this idea is that epistemology and its categories of objectivity be surpassed through the affirmation of the other, whose existence and essence are the fundamental categories of transcendence. The ethical experience is surpassed in its turn, in such a way that through transcendence a fulness may manifest itself; the doctrine of analogy and the transcendentals opens the understanding of that fulness. Reflexive experience enlivens the discourse and ensures its exactness.<br>

Le point de départ de cet article porte sur les conditions qui ont permis la constitution des organisations de chômeurs. La première partie analyse les courants principaux du mouvement piquetero, ses différentes matrices politiques et idéologiques, le rapport qu'il établit avec l'État et l'institutionnalisation des programmes sociaux. La deuxième partie étudie les éléments communs qui constituent l'espace piquetero. Enfin, l'article fait le point sur les difficultés actuelles du mouvement. Since 1996, the unemployed who have adopted the name of piqueteros have become a new and particularly perturbing actor on the Argentinean political scene. This article examines the conditions which have brought about the constitution of the unemployed into organisations. The first part analyses the principal currents of the piquetero movement, its different political and ideological matrices, the relationships it establishes with the State and the institutionalisation of social programmes. The second part studies the common elements which constitute the piquetero space. Finally, the article assesses the current difficulties of the movement.<br>

Abstract: This article critically revisits the Foucauldian perspective on modernity by exploring the constitutive importance of limits of transparency in relations of power and knowledge. It differentiates between Foucault's Panopticon as a model for modernity, which posits a total visibility of subject under modern gaze, and what I call cybernetic ways of knowing that posit the 'black box' of the inner self that is blocked from visibility. The case in point is a comparative study of two anthropologies — two groups of anthropological cadres — the American anthropologists who in the 1940s were involved in emerging Soviet studies, and Soviet anthropologists of the 1920s and 1930s who took part in Soviet reforms. The article draws attention to similarities in their perspective of images and notions of the enemy: the 'enemy of the people' within Soviet society and the Soviet society as the West's Cold War enemy. In doing so, the aim of this article is to develop an ethnographic perspective on state socialism that does not depend on a foundational dualist distinction between 'Soviet' and 'Western' or 'socialist' and 'capitalist' modernity as a starting point.<br>

Recent debates on global history have challenged the understanding of history beyond the nation-state. Simultaneously, they search for non-Eurocentric approaches. This has repercussions on the relation between historical space and time in both historical interpretation and in research design. This article reflects on the possibilities of a global conceptual history by expanding Reinhart Koselleck's theory of temporal layers (Zeitschichten) into global spaces. To this end, it introduces the notion of spatial layers (Raumschichten). First, historicisation and its relation to and interaction with spatialisation and temporalisation is pondered; then, the impact of global spatial and temporal complexities on comparative and conceptual history is considered, before, thirdly, a framework of three tensions of global history - normative, temporal and spatial - is introduced as a way to concretely unfold historical research questions through global conceptual history. Regarding time and space, the main lines of argument in global history have focused either on the question of whether or not European powers were ahead of non-European ones or on the supposedly Western linearity of time as opposed to a non-Western cosmology or circularity of time. Taking its point of departure in Zeitschichten, which break from the linear-vs.-circular logic, this article instead proposes to foreground an actor-based, multi-lingual, global conceptual history to better understand spatio-temporal practices.<br>

Abstract: History is not neutral. It is rendered ideological by the very act of being conveyed in a narrative form, for language is both the purveyor of meaning and the principle locus of ideology. This paper explores the idea of history as discourse, and its deployment in the cultural-symbolic construction of the Singapore nation. To this end, I have chosen to analyse a key moment for Singapore history, the years 1963-65, when Singapore was first merged with the nation of Malaysia, and then separated from it. The way that these events are described in official histories is used by the government of Singapore to justify its policy of multiracialism, which also serves as a legitimating device confirming the state in its political and ideological hegemony. I have examined the events through analysis of local newspapers, The Straits Times and Berita Harían, to see in what ways their reporting may have helped to mould popular understandings of what was happening.<br>

Abstract: The global justice movement reveals a diverse array of emergent publics striving politically for a sustainable world. Working partly from John Dewey, we try to illuminate democratic grounds for knowledge and action in these endeavors. We begin by situating Dewey's ideas in the politics of American history, especially historian John Diggins' countervailing approach to issues of authority, knowledge and opinion. Diggins, against Robert Westbrook and others, contends that Dewey's philosophy of politics chased radical democratic illusions, whereas he might have learned from Charles S. Peirce to uphold the boundary between professional communities and other entities including democratic publics. Dewey saw no democratic alternative to harness the political energy of ordinary people. We argue that Dewey had come to understand that a corporate state system of political economy had come to engulf both the liberal democratic polity and the professions. Dewey's political challenge to the professions and his illumination of the aesthetic ecology of democratic publics prefigure a democratic republican alternative that opens up a new basis for participation in the global justice movement confronting, among other obstacles, a transnational corporate state based in the USA. A Marxist-progressivist notion of the ongoing socialization of markets by corporate capitalism too often reinforces an anti-Populist intellectual sensibility that is coupled with, whether wittingly or not, either a social-democratic elitism or a revolutionary vanguardism. Globalization struggles need, on the contrary, a pragmatic vision of democratic publics instituting a true diversity of policies assuring a world-in-common. The fight for public spaces in the treacherous politics of civil society and global consumerism is a struggle against subjectivization. The fact that corporate state elitism, in the U.S. context, feeds on a rightist version of nationaism does not mean we can junk the history of democratic s~<br>

Abstract: On démontrera en particulier que le caractère strictement phénoménologique de la psychanalyse existentielle permet non seulement de dépasser la forme traditionnelle de la métapsychologie psychanalytique et le caractère reificateur de ses concepts, mais encore que celle ci a même anticipé la problématique specifiquement narcissique de Kohut. Le fait que cette psychanalyse existentielle puisse formuler les problèmes de manière plus adèquate en raison de son approche phénomenologique n'exclut pas que, inversement, la théorie narcissique puisse à son tour crtiquer la psychanalyse existentielle, là où celle ci tend à poser les états psychopathologiques comme structures d'être. Cet article se termine par une considération critique sur le manque de place que la théorie narcissique accorde à la sexualité et sur l'apolitisme radical de celle ci qui la démarque de la théorie sartrienne et de son évolution philosophique. First it is demonstrated that the strictly phenomenological approach of existential psychoanalysis is able to overcome the traditional form of the Freudian psychoanalytical metapsychology by means of its concretizing terms. Then it is pointed out that existential psychoanalysis has been anticipating problems, especially in the field of Kohut's theory of narcissism. The fact that it can illustrate these problems more adequately because of its phenomenological approach does not mean that the other way round the theory of narcissism cannot criticize the existential psychoanalysis — that is to say in its tendency towards attributing a psychopathological state to patterns of being. Lastly critical remarks are made regarding the diminution of sexuality in the theory of narcissism as well as its apolitical sealing — off — the latter being in contrast to the further development of Sartre's philosophy.<br>

Abstract: La biométrie mesure l'unicité d'un individu à partir des parties inchangeables de son corps. Elle est présentée comme la méthode la plus scientifique pour identifier les individus avec certitude et pour contrôler le futur. Cet article examine l'adoption d'un dispositif sophistiqué de surveillance et d'identification par la biométrie comme faisant partie d'une problématique de la maîtrise de la fluidité par l'Etat. Défié dans ses fonctions weberiennes par la globalisation et la transnationalisation, l'Etat cherche à restaurer son monopole sur l'identification des personnes et sur la surveillance des mouvements en recourant aux technologies biométriques. Or, cette préoccupation de « sécuriser » dépasse les limites de l'Etat et constitue un enjeu de surveillance au niveau global. Par conséquent, il faudra repenser l'Etat dans un cadre post-weberien où la globalisation de la biométrie participe à la déterritorialisation des contrôles. Biometrics measures the uniqueness of an individual from the unchanging parts of his/her body. It is presented as the most scientific method for identifying individuals with certainty and controlling the future. This article examines the adoption of a sophisticated identification and surveillance apparatus operating through the deployment of biometrics. This apparatus is here approached through the problématique of the mastering of fluidity by the state. Challenged in its Weberian functions by globalization and transnationalization, the state seeks to restore its monopoly over the identification of individuals, as well as over the surveillance of movements, by resorting to biometrics. However, this preoccupation of guaranteeing certainty goes beyond the limits of the state and constitutes a surveillance issue at the global level. Consequently, the state needs to be reconceptualised in a post-Weberian framework for which the globalization of biometrics contributes to the de-territorialisation of control.<br>

Abstract: This article takes a close look at the iconographic construction of the so-called "otherness" in Spain between 1936 and 1945. During this three year period of civil unrest, the Franco regime set out to cast the defeated half of the war as an inimical "other." In this process of building an impression of the "other," the "New State," created after April 1, 1939, played an important role, since in many ways the existence of this enemy "other" could favour unity between the rest, or "us." The State used mandatory education as an efficient socialization tool in this process. The text looks at the different ways in which the image of the "other" was used in books that taught History, Civic Education and Patriotic Education in primary school.<br>

Abstract: Será possível colocar a questão da culpa à parte de determinantes morais e históricos? Heidegger parece pensar que sim e, em verdade, empreende esta tarefa com base na reflexão sobre o papel do chamamento, um tema que, como a culpa, também está rodeado por inevitáveis conotações religiosas. O seu propósito inicial, mesmo que não declarado explicitamente, é mostrar a viabilidade de uma análise do chamamento, sem fazer uma apologia de qualquer tradição. Por seu lado, Foucault mostrou-nos os problemas associados com uma separação histórico-social do tema da culpa. Neste artigo pretendo expor estas duas abordagens sobre a questão da culpa. Is it possible to raise the question of guilt apart from those moral and historical determinants? Heidegger seems to think so and actually undertakes this task based on the reflection on the role of the call, a matter that, like guilt, is also surrounded by unavoidable religious cannotations. Its initial purpose, but does not state explicitly, is to show that it is feasible consistent and deep analysis of the call without making at any time through you an apology for any religious tradition. For his part, Foucault has shown us the problems associated with socio-historical untethering of the issue of guilt. In this paper I intend to expose these two lines of approach to the question of guilt.<br>

Abstract: O filme Diamante de Sangue [Blood Diamond] de Edward Zwick oferece a possibilidade de uma reflexão à volta de três aspetos da noção de testemunho no âmbito da Filosofia da Religião: 1) a ideia de que o testemunho (absoluto), enquanto matriz das culturas humanas, sustenta a atividade jornalística e a sociedade da informação possibilitando não apenas a sua desconstrução como também a (re-)atualização de uma dimensão testemunhal do jornalismo; 2) as condições de possibilidade da conversão da consciência, isto é, da rutura com o estado de má-fé (auto-engano) necessária à consciência testemunhal e religiosa; 3) a indissociabilidade da experiência testemunhal e da doação, correlativas da experiência religiosa entendida como "fundação mútua" do divino e da testemunha (constituinte), experiência religiosa da qual surge o testemunho. Acrescentaremos ainda a ideia de que a experiência testemunhal ganha sentido à luz da metafísica do tempo do projeto. The film Blood Diamond from Edward Zwick offers the possibility of a reflection concerning three aspects of the concept of testimony within the Philosophy of Religion: 1) the idea that the testimony (absolute), while source of human cultures, supports the journalistic activity and gives information to the society; not only in its deconstruction but also in (re-)updating the testimonial dimension of journalism, 2) the conditions of possibility of the consciousness conversion, meaning, the rupture with the state of bad faith (self-deception) will required to the testimonial and religious consciousness, 3) the inseparability of the testimonial experience and donation, correlates in the religious experience, understood as “mutual foundation” of the divine and the witness (constituent), religious experience from which comes the testimony. We add further the idea that the testimonial experience makes sense in light of the metaphysics of time of project.<br>

Abstract: Matter, pp. 67-68: "One must wonder, though, how 'healthy' a diet totally lacking in protein,
calcium, and most vitamins could possibly be, especially over the course of years spent routinely
enduring cold, heat, deprivation of sleep, and various forms of corporal punishment. It seems,
rather, that the nuns of the Monastery of the Blessed Sacrament of Pavia lived in a continual state
of semi-starvation; one that, while chosen (in Maria Domitilla's case, ardently so), was nonetheless
hardly a personal expression of religious striving." Sull'anoressia si senta anche Kristeva, Pouvoirs
de l'horreur, p. 10: "Dégoût d'une nourriture, d'une saleté,... spasmes et vomissements.... Le
dégoût alimentaire est peut-être la forme la plus élémentaire et la plus archaïque de l'abjection".<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>

Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h~<br>

Abstract: This article tries to give an outline of Christian ethics in a pluralistic world most clearly characterized by its Babel of moral languages. There is no longer any single valid moral language. The liberal solution to establish a neutral moral language – a moral Esperanto – to solve this crisis of modernity is not possible without turning into some sort of moral imperialism. To avoid, however, the other extreme – nihilism – this article follows to some degree "communitarian" thinkers like A. MacIntyre, J. Stout and M. Walzer. Every ethics must be rooted in a narrative tradition and needs a concrete community as its precondition. The second part of this article addresses the narrative structure of Christian ethics. At first it follows MacIntyre's insight that every ethics is based on myth. It differs, however, from MacIntyre's position by putting special emphasis on the substantial content of the Christian "myth". With the help of Girard's mimetic theory this article distinguishes between archaic myths that are the product of the scapegoat mechanism and identify with the view of the lynch mob and the Biblical history of salvation that consists of a story written from the perspective of the victims of collective persecution. In the center of Christian ethics we find the example of Jesus Christ – the victim of collective violence par excellence – and the example of those of his disciples who became aware of their own contribution to Jesus's death and converted to the side of the victim. The third part of this article addresses the question of the concrete community that makes Christian ethics possible. Again MacIntyre's communitarian emphasis on the connection between concrete communities and ethics is taken as a starting point. Whereas communitarians, however, tend to support patriotism the community necessitated by Christian ethics is the universal Church. Patriotism like the ancient Greek polis is essentially characterized by its enmity to outside communities, a frie~<br>

Abstract: This article concerns itself with the question of what constitutes a hymn, within the framework of the existing state church. This framework is defined as "religious pluralization", characterized by an individualized understanding of Christ, and the parallel development of a new interdenominational religious awareness, two trends which have been increasingly prominent since the days of post-Reformation Orthodoxy and the Enlightenment. "Pluralization" is intimately associated with a fundamental movement away from traditional forms of religious piety. The article attempts to describe the hymn as a figure of "tentative continuity"; that ist, the hymn is the means by which human beings symbolically express their religious perception of their own finiteness in history. The hymn can therefore claim a more universal validity than if it merely pinpoints a specific moment of human religious history. At this point, the article carefully examines several examples of older as well as of more modern hymnody.<br>

Abstract: È senz'altro a causa del fatto che di questa dimensione prolungazionale non si fosse
occupata la linguistica strutturale, che essa non ha dato vita a studi in questa direzione nel-
l'applicazione dei modelli linguistici all'analisi musicale. Nella storia dell'analisi del XX secolo
il prolungamento proviene da altre fonti: dal contrappunto di Fux in Schenker, dalla psicolo-
gia della Gestalt in Meyer. Va notato che se le teorie linguistiche di Gustave Guillaume, in-
ventore di una 'psico-meccanica del linguaggio' occultata durante il periodo strutturalista, fos-
sero state tenute in maggior considerazione, la situazione sarebbe potuta essere diversa. Ma
non si può cambiare la storia...<br>

Author(s): Serra Alice Mara<br>
Abstract: The concept Deckerinnerung (en. screen-memory), which appeared in Freud's work in 1899, points towards the important epistemological question about the possibility of adequation or coincidence (Deckung) between past experience and the current act that is being presentified. This can take the form of remembering as such or be conceived as fantasy. In order to clarify the differences between fantasy and memory, or rather their interconnection in the Deckerinnerung, they need to be looked at phenomenologically, and in doing so various aspects should be analysed, such as: the character of positional and neutralised acts of presentification; the interference of conscious attention and the phenomenon of inhibition in the act of presentification; the state of memories in the unconscious and the possibilities of their association between themselves or modification by other current acts. While Freud introduces the subject without further analysing it, Husserl's theories offer a valuable contribution here. In this context, there is first a need to outline the way in which Husserl's investigations into memory come close to Freud's discourse, in the sense that they lead to a "Phenomenology of the Unconscious" (Hua XI; Mat. VIII).<br>

Abstract: En 1906 los "cabezas de familia" de cinco comunidades indígenas le pidieron al abogado Wistano Luis Orozco que los representara en sus pleitos legales por la defensa de sus tierras. Parte de la estrategia legal fue escribir un memorial de los agravios experimentados y dirigirlo a Porfirio Díaz. El memorial y el proceso judicial que desencadenó ejemplifican cómo los actores sociales daban forma a la cultura política en los ámbitos locales, estatales y nacionales, a finales del porfiriato. In 1906, the heads of household from five indigenous communities asked the lawyer Wistano Luis Orozco to represent them in their legal battle for the defense of their land. Part of their legal strategy was to prepare a written statement detailing their grievances and addressing it to Porfirio Díaz. The written statement and the legal process it sparked exemplify how social actors gave form to political culture at the local, state and national level towards the end of the Porfiriato.<br>

Abstract: Public administration is inherently an interdisciplinary field, prominently incorporating theory and methods from economics, political science, and sociology. Less obviously, however, MPA curricula include historical treatments of particular policy arenas, institutions, the administrative state, and the professions of policy analyst and public management. In addition, the case method that figures prominently in MPA pedagogy and the research MPA students perform depend on doing history. Yet, history as a scholarly endeavor is rarely included in basic courses, much less instruction in research methods. This essay explores the use of history in MPA curricula and how MPA students might acquire a deeper appreciation of history and how historians ply their craft.<br>

Abstract: Having a voice, either at the level of the individual or the community, has been one of the atavistic ways of defining or asserting humanity. This allows for the inscription of the twin-capped hegemony of successes or victories and frustrations at both the private locus and the public sphere. The disruptions of this possibility by rifts between natives in pre-colonial South Africa were aggravated in the heat of the colonial suppression it suffered, and was compounded by the operation of apartheid rule. By reason of this misrule, voices were suppressed, with a few cacophonies of dissention breaking forth. The culmination of these disenchantments into the demise of apartheid significantly presaged the need for reconstruction and redefinition of citizenship and cohabitation, and hence the necessity for establishing a public sphere, or put alternatively, a public domain in the form of the Archbishop Desmond Tutu's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This paper, therefore, seeks to interrogate the dramatic world(s) created using the material properties of the TRC in John Kani's Nothing but the Truth and Zakes Mda's The Bells of Amersfoort. The paper argues that the domination and manipulation of this public realm by the state at the expense of the individual is not only counterproductive, but constitutes a denial of the relevance of such spheres. The paper, going by indices in the plays, therefore, concludes that every individual should not only be: given a voice, and be heard, but be allowed equal unbiased participation. Otherwise, the public sphere would not just be impotent, but the idea of nation-building and desirable citizenship would be a mere ruse. Avoir une voix, que ce soit au niveau individuel ou communautaire, a été l'un des moyens ataviques de définition et d'affirmation de l'humanité. Cela tient compte de l'inscription de l'hégémonie à double face des succés ou victoires et des frustrations tant au niveau de l'espace privé que de la sphère publique. Les pa~<br>

Abstract: In Romania, the fall of the Communist regime and the loss of referents that followed have inspired a revival in a "tradition of the nation" whose foundation was laid during the 19th century, associating a representation of identity based on ethnicity with a unitary and centralized conception of the state. The sudden opening up to the outside world, pressures from an internationalized economy and Western institutions – specifically, NATO and the European Union, which Romania hopes to join – have led some to modify this tradition, while others have attempted to render it an absolute in order to better resist what are deemed destabilizing changes. These two tendencies can be identified in the way in which Romanians represent their pre-Communist and Communist past, as well as their manner of apprehending the tension between unity and plurality (ethnic, regional) at the heart of the nation-state.<br>

Abstract: The title of "Righteous Among the Nations," which was created by the state of Israel, refers to non-Jews who helped Jews during the Second World War. Since the early 1990s, this title has been adopted by different European countries that were occupied during the war. By analyzing the integration of the Righteous in Polish historical memory, and reviewing previous occurrences of this since 1945, we can elaborate a new approach to transition phenomena. Mobilization of the figure of the Righteous in Polish historical memory is largely understood in terms of foreign policy, and reflects the marginality and social exclusion of the Jews in this country. Thus, it seems that its recent evolution can be linked to an ongoing transformation in the Polish public sphere.<br>

Abstract: Jerome Bruner, Pourquoi nous racontons-nous des histoires? Le récit au fondement de la culture et de l'identité
individuelle, Paris, Pocket, 2005, p. 29. Le critique littéraire Bruce Robbins insiste lui aussi sur l'aspect décisif de
la narration dans la mise en valeur de l'expérience du populaire. Il place ainsi au centre de sa problématique la
question des conditions rendant possible la mise en valeur de l'origine sociale : « Quoi que cela représente pour les
sociologues, je considère que la mobilité sociale est aussi une histoire. Et je suppose que, dans cette histoire, l'état
initial de misère économique représente une sorte de capital pervers, un capital qui ne peut être encaissé que lorsqu'il
est donné à voir aux autres. (...) Si la pauvreté ostentatoire est un placement stratégique dans un jeu narratif, on est
alors curieux de savoir de quelle sorte de jeu il s'agit. Pourquoi l'auditeur se sent-il obligé de reconnaître que des
points ont été marqués? Est-ce simplement que plus la distance gravie est grande, plus on a le droit de se vanter de
sa réussite? ». Bruce Robbins, Upward Mobility and the Common Good: Toward a Literary History of the Welfare State,

Abstract: Les années 1960 apparaissent comme un moment de profonde remise en question du système scolaire (particulièrement du modèle secondaire), tant du fait des réformes initiées par les premiers gouvernements de la Cinquième République que de la dynamique des débats publics de cette décennie, couronnée par le colloque d'Amiens, en mars 1968. Or l'étude systématique du discours tenu dans la presse sur ce sujet montre que l'affichage zélé d'un consensus apparent masque de profondes incertitudes quant au modèle scolaire qu'il faudrait inventer en remplacement du système présenté comme unanimement condamné. On constate également que ce large accord ignore l'importance des pesanteurs conservatrices, qui, même marginalisées, peuvent facilement alimenter des doutes, qui ne manqueront pas de s'exprimer si une situation conflictuelle vient à se présenter. The 1960's appear as a moment when real doubts concerning the French School system (particularly the traditional Secondary model) came to light, partly because of the reforms initiated by the first governments of the Fifth Republic but also as a result of the state of the discussions arising over that decade, and coming to a head at the colloquium held in Amiens in March 1968. However, the systematic study of the discourse held in the newspapers about this subject reveals that the zealous show of an apparent consensus masked deep uncertainties relating to the school model which needed to be invented to replace the widely condemned system. We also notice that this broad agreement ignored the importance of conservative obstacles which, even when marginalised, could easily fuel doubts, and would certainly be expressed as soon as a conflictual situation arose.<br>

Abstract: This paper traces the development of the historical origins of an economic ethos and the groups that carried and transformed this ethos in two key economic sectors: first, Silicon Valley, and second, Wall Street. Financialization of the US economy is closely connected to a political logic that celebrated the capacity for the self-regulation of markets and condemned state intervention, bringing free-market thought to the fore. A growing body of sociological literature explains the rise of neoliberalism as an intellectual project, as a series of policy reforms, and as a form of politics. This dialogue has largely lacked sufficient critical analysis of whether a motivating ethos allowed market fundamentalism to emerge and take hold across different economic sectors. An analysis of the resurgence of free-market ideas in two important sectors of the US economy, informed by Weberian theory, reveals a distinct element, in this case an ethos, which itself motivates and sustains free-market thinking. In Silicon Valley and on Wall Street an economic ethos emerged from the structuring of ideas and ethics into specific historical contexts by distinct groups within each economic sector.<br>

Abstract: See Ricoeur in the essay mentioned in note 33 on the transition from 'sub-
ject' to 'structure' in Althusser's works: 'Zugleich wird damit die Wachsamkeit
gegenüber Verifizierung und Falsifizierung geschwàcht' (p. 208). Openness on this
point cannot, in my opinion, be expected until followers of Althusser show a
readiness to abandon the disastrous notion that the appealing, interpellating
^uthority which demands accountibility can be no other than Ideology. See for
instance Althusser, 'Ideologie en ideologische staatsapparaten' ('Ideology and
ideological state apparatuses'), in Te elfder ure (At the eleventh hour), 24 (1978,
no. 1), pp. 99f: 'the individual is addressed as a (free) subject, so that it subjects
itself in freedom to the commandments of the Subject' (100), '... the ideology
brings about simultaneously (1) the addressing of the 'individuals' as subjects; (2)
their subjection to the Subject' (99).<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i24707971<br>
Date: 1 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Morton Herbert Donald<br>
Abstract: Philosophy and worldview both have a religious starting point, so Dooyeweerd and Vollen-
hoven maintain. The question however is whether philosophical thought is conditioned in
its own turn by worldview. Although in Vollenhoven and even more so in Dooyeweerd
there is a tendency to deny the latter, their standpoint on the issue is not entirely consistent.
Vollenhoven writes: 'What the view of life is to non-scientific knowledge, philosophy is to
scientific knowledge' ('Schriftgebruik en wijsbegeerte', p. 8). Yet as it turns out, philosophy
on the one hand and life and world view on the other are not completely separated in his
conception, for he continues: 'scientific knowledge never loses all traces of what is non-
scientific'. Dooyeweerd observes: 'Philosophy cannot take the place of a life- and world-view,
nor the reverse, for the task of each of the two is different' (A New Critique, vol. 1, p. 128);
and elsewhere: Ά life- and world-view may not be "elaborated" philosophically. It must
elaborate itself (Ibid., p. 158). Nonetheless, he goes on to say also: Ά life - and world-view
should come to theoretical clarity in philosophic thought' (Ibid., p. 165). I call such state-
ments happy inconsistencies!<br>

Abstract: Cf. George Steiner, A/ter Babel, Aspects of Language and Translation (Oxford Univer-

theory. George Steiner himself seems to prefer a special sort of interlinear literalist
option (but not 'a word-for-word' transference) that has the translator remain selflessly
submerged within the original tongue, producing a centaur idiom in which one's own
longue takes on a 'deliberate strangeness', and the product becomes virtually an unknown
tongue 'which can transcend the constraints of imprécise objective reference' (pp.307-33).
Steiner approves of Hölderlin's approach, and crédits Chesteron on Du Bellay and Leyris
on Hopkins as superb approximations of the true translation (pp.407-13).<br>

Abstract: On the "participation idea" see Steen, Structure, p. 209; on the collapse of structure into
direction see Ibid., p. 83, where Steen writes: "It might be said that structure tends to be
reduced to direction... Structure is transcendentally-directed meaning. Meaninglessness,
nothing, and meaning loss tend to occur when this direction is lost. The structure is almost its
pointing character." Steen finds in this state of affairs what he calls the "semi-contradictory
theme" in Dooyeweerd's thought.<br>

Abstract: At issue here is the principle of sphere sovereignty. When Dooyeweerd draws attention to
the relative autonomy of the parts with respect to the whole by saying that the former conform
to their own structural principle, he is trying to do justice to the principle of sphere sovereignty
in the theory of entitary (or thing) structures. Examples of enkapsis are the relation between
living organisms and their environment, and the relation between matrimony and the state.<br>

Author(s): Morris Rosalind C.<br>
Abstract: This article considers the legacies of Jacques Derrida in and for Anglo-American sociocultural anthropology. It begins with a survey of Derrida's own engagement with themes that have historically been foundational to the field: (a) the critique of sign theory and, with it, the questions of language and law in Lévi-Straussian structuralism; (b) the question of the unconscious; (c) the critique of the performative and its consequences for the idea of ritual; (d) the rereading of Marcel Mauss's concept of the gift, and of economy more generally; and (e) the analysis of the metaphysical basis of law, in both religious and ostensibly secular formations. It then considers the state of the field at the time when it was being infused with different forms of poststructuralism and explores the competing claims made by these discourses in relation to deconstruction. Finally, after tracing the convergences and divergences between Derridean deconstruction and theory in sociocultural anthropology, it treats two main examples of works produced against and under the influence of Derrida's thought, respectively.<br>

Author(s): Mellema Gregory<br>
Abstract: Much light can be shed on events which characterize or underlie scandals at firms such as Enron, Arthur Andersen, Worldcom, ImClone, and Tyco by appealing to the notion of ethical distance. Various inquiries have highlighted the difficulties in finding or identifying particular individuals to blame for particular events, and in the context of situations as complex as these it can sometimes be helpful to investigate the comparative ethical distance of various participants in these events. In this essay I offer a characterization of ethical distance in terms of moral responsibility, and in doing so I describe and illustrate the rough inverse correlation between moral distance and degrees of moral responsibility. I urge that the concept of ethical distance is capable of shedding light upon situations in which several people are involved in bringing about a state of affairs. I then argue that moral responsibility cannot do justice to all situations involving ethical distance. When the distance between a person and a state of affairs grows sufficiently large, a different type of treatment is called for, and I introduce the notion of moral taint to describe the moral status of agents in these situations.<br>

Article Title: In Search of a Postcolonial Theory of Normative Integration: Reflections on A.C. Cairns' Theory of "Citizens Plus"<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i25165879<br>
Date: 12 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Libesman Heidi<br>
Abstract: The focus of this article is the theory of integration advanced by Alan Cairns in his book, "Citizens Plus: Aboriginal peoples and the Canadian State". Cairns' theory has had a mixed reception since its publication. Like much scholarship and public policy in the Aboriginal rights field, "Citizens Plus" has attracted strong proponents and opponents. At present "Citizens Plus" remains one of the primary competitors vying for influence in guiding the postcolonial reconfiguration of the relationship between Aboriginal peoples, the Canadian state and civil society on terms of justice that may be perceived as legitimate by both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples. The prime alternative, as conceived by both Cairns and his critics, is the nation-to-nation constitutional vision of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. The author provides a political theoretical reading of "Citizens Plus". She seeks to disclose the normative and conceptual structure of Cairns' argument and to situate Cairns' theory in the context of debates concerning the future of Aboriginal peoples and the constitution of Canada. This reading foregrounds an alternative interpretation of the relationship between "Citizens Plus" and the constitutional vision of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, which makes it possible to see them as complementary rather than opposed constitutional visions. The author also raises broader questions concerning the reasons for continuing the search, at the heart of Cairns' work, for a post-colonial theory and praxis of normative integration in diverse societies, and the conditions of the possibility of such a theory and praxis. Ultimately the author argues that whether one agrees or disagrees with Cairns' prescription, at a minimum "Citizens Plus" should be understood as raising a fundamental question to which multinational constitutional theory must respond. /// Le présent article a pour objet d'examiner la théorie avancée par Alan Cairns dans son ouvrage, "Ci~<br>

Publisher: Maney Publishing<br>

Date: 7 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Soroka Mykola Iv.<br>
Abstract: Because of the close association between ideology and utopia, Volodymyr Vynnychenko's three-volume utopian novel "Soniachna mashyna" (1921-24, published in 1928), one of the most well known and discussed works in Ukrainian literature, has more often been approached as a product of his political and ideological preoccupations. While I do not disregard this, in my paper I propose a new reading from a largely neglected perspective of geographical displacement as a social, cultural and psychological phenomenon in an effort to bring fresh theoretical insight into the study of utopian writings. It maintains that Vynnychenko's utopia was largely inspired by his involuntary stay outside his homeland, in Germany, which led to a state of existential uncertainty, feelings of extreme uprootedness, and the desire to overcome this conflict with the reality of his day. The paper examines the writer's personal attitude to his displacement and uses the theoretical paradigm of utopia and nostalgia to argue that his utopia was aimed at a 'reconstruction' of his highly unstable identity by transcending the intolerable present and a projection of a better future.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i25619787<br>
Date: 8 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Cody Francis<br>
Abstract: This essay examines how activists in rural southern India have sought to reshape the field of political communication by encouraging lower-caste women to submit written, signed petitions to district-level government offices, and so represent themselves to the state. I argue that contradictions between democratic recognition and the will to development that inhere to the political structure of contemporary governance in rural India correspond to tensions within the semiotic structure of signature itself, between constative representation and performative creation. Governmentality and the forms of communication that it requires often rest on the notion that written self-representation constitutes an act of political agency. But the limits of a governmental communicative reason that would conflate written subject and agent become especially clear in postcolonial contexts where the construction of those citizens that would be represented is in fact a product of the very act of representation. It is the narrative of development-as-pedagogy that holds out the promise of a future alignment of communicative frameworks, technologies, and participant roles, allowing for the transparent self-representation of an already-constituted citizen. By tracking the ambivalent experience of one group of women in particular, this account focuses on how the logic of signature as self-representation has served to recontextualize the marginality of petitioners as something within the state's broader field of power.<br>

Abstract: How does international interaction shape states' patterns of thought, emotion, and action? This paper examines the processes by which motives and practices feed each other in reproducing historical structures. An artificial intelligence model defines state-subjects as cultures combining special meanings that produce causal attribution, state self-identification, emotions, and action motives. These special meanings are built from subjective cultural categories describing social acts and group character of the self and others. Anger, pride, fear, and relief motivate action. A collection of such subject-cultures may produce a pattern of actions that reiterates the cultures. The model discriminates between those combinations of elements in special meanings which reproduce subjects and historical structures, and those which do not. The meanings discovered in such reproduction analysis can be validated by discourse analysis.<br>

Abstract: Intrinsically linked with the process of Modernity, the term «World System» reveals an evident secular dimension which derives mainly from the well-known sociological approach established by the Weberian thesis of
            «Weltentzäuberung»It implies a distinction between political [secular] and religious power, which establishes other parallel dichotomies between the public and the private power spheres, as well as between the profane and the sacred realms. But this typology —though useful and in fact essential in analytical and synthetic terms— is not completely suited to the «real» and effective state of the world. This actual world shows that the political and religious realms are deeply intertwined and that they build an effective net of interests, values, mutual agreements and disagreements, sometimes complementary and sometimes confronted, but in any case related. This situation emerges as a consequence of a process of historical construction.<br>

Abstract: Public financial education is an emerging theme in international public policy, presented by its promoters as a way of protecting citizens faced with the liberalization of financial markets, which shifts risk from the State and collective actors to individuals. This article will examine its development in France, and its overlap with the transformation of social work. We will first describe the social space of financial education, which brings together an unexpected coalition of representatives from financial institutions and social service and aid organizations. We will then go on to focus on one of this space’s central actors,
         Finances et Pedagogie(an association created by the bankCaisses d’Épargne), analyzing its partnerships with associations and social services.<br>

Abstract: I should emphasize that I do not suggest the state is about to disappear, nor am I

remain unchanged by the rapidity and power of the general pace of global change.<br>

third Earl of Shaftesbury, as well. See also Donald Desserud, 'Virtue, Commerce and

Abstract: Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, trans. J. Macquarrie and E. Robinson (New
York, 1962), p. 233. For Heidegger, Dasein has a sudden sense of uncanniness, of not
being at home, when it experiences itself as being-in-the-world. Dasein attempts to
escape this state by losing itself in an environment it considers familiar and safe: the
world of everyday concerns, of the 'they'. On the notion of homelessness in Heidegger,
see Leslie Paul Thiele, Timely Meditations: Martin Heidegger and Postmodern Politics
(Princeton, NJ, 1995). On the similarity between Freud and Heidegger on this subject,
see David Farrell Krell, 'Das Unheimliche: Architectural Sections of Heidegger and
Freud', in Research in Phenomenology, XXII (1992), pp. 43-61.<br>

Abstract: Cfr. Colloqui col Manzoni cit., pp. 359-360. Per il saggio storico cfr. in Tutte
le Opere, a cura di M. Martelli, Firenze, Sansoni 1973. Oltre alla serie di aneddoti
efferati (l'uccisione di Alessandro Ferreri « strascinato fin sotto il palazzo reale e mo-
strato al re in mezzo alle grida di - Morano i traditori! -, - Viva la santa fede! -,
- viva il re! -» (XIII); la cruenta ferocia di Mammone Gaetano il cui «desiderio di
sangue era tale, che si beveva tutto quello che usciva dagli infelici che faceva scannare »
(XLIV); il fanatismo spregiudicato del cardinal Ruffo che « ai creduli abitanti delle
Calabrie si fece creder papa » - in nota al capitolo successivo - e ancora le persecuzioni
dello Speziale, al cap. XLIX) il Saggio storico del Cuoco offriva al futuro autore del
racconto inchiesta sulla Colonna infame matrici modulari e cadenze patetiche inconfondi-
bili: « Essi non avevano altro delitto che questo, né giovani senza grado, senza fortuna,
senza opinione potevano tentarne altro. Fu eretto un tribunale di sangue col nome di
Giunta di Stato... Si volle del sangue, e se n'ebbe » (VI); « Sia che queste voci fossero
vere, sia che fossero state immaginate... è certo che queste voci furono da tutti ripetute,
da tutti credute...» (XIV). D'altronde non manca neppure lo stilema topografico per il
futuro « cronista d'una storia milanese »: « La natura ha diviso essa istessa il territorio
del regno di Napoli: una catena non interrotta di monti la divide da Occidente ad
Oriente dagli Apruzzi fino all'estremità delle Calabrie; i fiumi, che da questi monti
scorrono ai due mari che bagnano il nostro territorio a settentrione e a mezzogiorno,
formano le suddivisioni minori » (XXX).<br>

Publisher: Institute of Management Sciences<br>
Issue: i345213<br>
Date: 5 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Zigurs Marshall Scott<br>
Abstract: The past decade has brought advanced information technologies, which include electronic messaging systems, executive information systems, collaborative systems, group decision support systems, and other technologies that use sophisticated information management to enable multiparty participation in organization activities. Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose adaptive structuration theory (AST) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. AST examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of AST, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system (GDSS). A GDSS is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the GDSS is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied. We begin by positioning AST among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to GDSS use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of AST. We outline an analytic strategy for applying AST principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of AST is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization r~<br>

Article Title: Sorcery and Sovereignty: Taxation, Witchcraft, and Political Symbols in the 1880 Transkeian Rebellion<br>
Publisher: Carfax Publishing Ltd.<br>
Issue: i324967<br>
Date: 6 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Scott Sean<br>
Abstract: The paper examines the causes of the 1880 Transkeian Rebellion and attempts to build upon previous explanations. In particular, the paper looks at the way in which taxation and witchcraft beliefs combined to make the colonial state appear especially malevolent. The information on hut tax registers represented a potential threat to the African population, a threat that was both material and supernatural. With that information state officials could confiscate property, deny bridewealth claims, and do harm through the means of sorcery. This threat motivated many Africans to rally behind the precolonial authority and social harmony symbolised by the chiefs and to rebel in October 1880. Once colonial forces had squashed the rebellion, however, the collection of hut taxes became a state ritual that recreated and reinforced bonds between ruler and ruled. A high proportion of Africans paid their hut taxes in the years after the revolt: in the 1887-97 period in the three districts discussed, compliance rates averaged in the 80-100 per cent range. Yet, this was a period in which officials were often reluctant to use physical coercion or property seizure to enforce collection, because of the fear of provoking more unrest. The high compliance rates can instead be explained by the symbolic content of tax payments. Believing that state officials had access to supernatural powers and knowing that they had overcome the power of the chiefs. Africans paid their taxes as a way of deflecting those powers, thereby enabling themselves to farm in relative peace. Compliance with tax laws reflected an acknowledgement of the historical reality of the loss of African independence, but it also helped create and maintain the political reality of colonial control in the aftermath of the rebellion.<br>

Abstract: Edward X. Gu charts the changing and complex relationship existing between intellectuals and party/state in China during the "culture fever" era of 1979 to 1989. He draws on theoretical insights from the "new institutionalism" literature to problematize the "civil society" approach and to interrogate earlier scholarship emphasizing the anti-establishment character of intellectuals. His detailed investigation of three intellectual groups reveals that intellectuals attained some measure of autonomy and independence but only by developing collaborative and cooperative relations with the party-state. Thus, the author defines the boundaries of the "cultural public space" that emerged in Deng's China.<br>

Publisher: Grafo<br>
Issue: i27859582<br>
Date: 10 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): ATZENI PAOLA<br>
Abstract: Using an "anthropo-pragmatic" approach, this essay analyzes the speech made by Mussolini in the square in Carbonia, Sardinia, on 18 December 1938. The analysis also takes in other speeches and reveals the power of Mussolini's logos: this was not simply inaugural, ritual and foundational in its celebration of the new town, but recognised a historic turning point in the policies of the Italian nation and empire in the passage of the fascist state from ruralism to industrial urbanism. By broadening the study, the power of Mussolini's declarative strategy becomes more apparent. Also that other subjects were submerged with subversive micro-narrations of different types. Finally, multiple discourses, practices and complex negotiating subjects appeared in the post-fascist democracy. The "anthropo-pragmatic" approach, which is at first restricted, is later broadened and utilized on a speech-by-speech basis: from the comical and satirical to the poetic and the contractual. Highlighting the discursive conflicts at work, examples are emphasized of dialectical speeches that constitute and characterize other antagonists and protagonists of democratic cultural modernity: the nurse-comedy-writer, miner-poet, and miner-trade unionist. In the new fascism these figures test new risky declarations that were also practices of freedom, caring for oneself and many others, to the extent of spreading into democratic relations. These speeches and themes operate in a setting where discursive and identity-related powers meet, hidden and manifest, public and private, in the mine and the city.<br>

Publisher: Nanzan University, Anthropological Institute<br>
Issue: i30030308<br>
Date: 1 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Kim Seong-Nae<br>
Abstract: Oral traditions can contain elements of historical evidence and convey meaning. The narrative pattern of oral epics serves not merely as "a mnemonic device" that aids in recalling significant historical events but makes meaningful connections to the cultural experience of identity politics. On Cheju Island, a volcanic island located some fifty miles below the southernmost tip of the Korean peninsula, the indigenous sense of identity and history is expressed and accentuated in the fate of the shrine deities who are portrayed as exiles in shamanic epics such as ponhyang ponp'uri. The tragic heroism in the cliché of exile and return of the shrine deities recapitulates the historical identity of Cheju people as "exiles at the frontier." After Cheju Island lost political autonomy as an independent kingdom, Tam-ra, in the early twelfth century, the Cheju people's cultural memory of isolation and redemptive desire for liberation from the mainland state's domination becomes intelligible and justifiable textually through the heroic acts of exiled deities.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i30038913<br>
Date: 2 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Abizadeh Arash<br>
Abstract: Two arguments apparently support the thesis that collective identity presupposes an Other: the recognition argument, according to which seeing myself as a self requires recognition by an other whom I also recognize as a self (Hegel); and the dialogic argument, according to which my sense of self can only develop dialogically (Taylor). But applying these arguments to collective identity involves a compositional fallacy. Two modern ideologies mask the particularist thesis's falsehood. The ideology of indivisible state sovereignty makes sovereignty as such appear particularistic by fusing "internal" with "external" sovereignty; nationalism imagines national identity as particularistic by linking it to sovereignty. But the concatenation of internal sovereignty, external sovereignty, and nation is contingent. Schmitt's thesis that "the political" presupposes an other conflates internal and external sovereignty, while Mouffe's neo-Schmittianism conflates difference (Derrida) with alterity. A shared global identity may face many obstacles, but metaphysical impossibility and conceptual confusion are not among them.<br>

Abstract: L'exégèse biblique contemporaine associe une longue tradition herméneutique au développement moderne des sciences philologiques et historiques. Marqué par la séparation des Églises et de l'État ainsi que par la "crise moderniste" au sein du catholicisme, ce domaine savant s'interroge aujourd'hui en France sur son avenir et sur son rôe dans l'espace public. Dans leur diversité universitaire ou ecclésiale, les biblistes français ne participent pas moins au cours international et pluriconfessionnel de recherche. Où la théologie, momentanément séparée de la science positive, sert en fait d'aiguillon à la recherche historique et anthropologique. Et où en définitive, le texte, atelier de l'exégète, s'impose comme un vecteur de dépassement des vieux clivages de la science et de la croyance. /// The contemporary biblical interpretation associates a long hermeneutical tradition with the modern development of philological and historical sciences. Marked by the Separation of Churches and State, also by the "modernistic crisis" within Catholicism, this field of scholarship wonders today in France on its future and its part in the public space. Although connected with University or Church, the French biblical specialists do not take part less in the international and interdenominational research. The theology, temporarily separated from positive science, is finally stirring up historical and anthropological studies. At last for the scholar, Holly Scripture as workshop is used to overstep the old bounds of science and believe. /// La exégesis bíblica contemporánea asocia una larga tradición hermenéutica al desarrollo moderno de las ciencias psicológicas e históricas. Marcado por la separación de las Iglesias y el Estado así como por la "crisis modernista" en el seno del catolicismo, este ámbito de saberes se pregunta hoy en Francia sobre su futuro y sobre su rol en el espacio público. Dentro de su diversidad universitaria o eclesial, los biblistas franceses no dejan de participar~<br>

a small role in Holland, where the source of political power was much
more diffuse. . . . It was in the social and religious spheres, in government
and in foreign trade that Dutch art seemed to seek its subjects and from
which it took its basic terms. Moreover, each of these spheres was col-
oured strongly by local interests" (p. 14)<br>

Author(s): Zelizer Roger<br>
Abstract: God is once again afoot in the public sphere. Politics has become a religious obligation. For a new breed of religious nationalist the nation-state is a vehicle of the divine. This essay seeks to accomplish four things. The first is to argue for an institutional approach to religious nationalism in order both to interpret and explain it. Second, I argue that religion and nationalism partake of a common symbolic order and that religious nationalism is therefore not an oxymoron. Third, the essay seeks to explain why religion has become such a potent political force in our time. And fourth-the task that will take up the bulk of the text-it seeks a principle of intelligibility in the semiotic order of religious nationalism that can comprehend its preoccupation with both women's erotic bodies and monies out of national control.<br>

Abstract: "The

ing, more loathsome: the state of being forsaken by God. The punishment of being discarded,
abandoned, rejected, is worse than the punishment of exile. Anger, too, is a form of His
presence in history. Anger, too, is an expression of His concern" (p. 296)

Journal Title: Anthropological Quarterly<br>
Article Title: Peasant Politics and Secret Societies: The Discourse of Secrecy<br>
Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
Issue: i274773<br>
Date: 1 1, 1969<br>
Author(s): Wolf Robert C.<br>
Abstract: Many contemporary sources, including anthropological, define politics as the vying for power that occurs in the public domain, the goverance of the body politic, or strategies for advancing particular interests as general. While not inaccurate in terms of reflecting politics in the modern state, the instrumental notion often excludes a sense of politics that involves a struggle for mutual recognition or consensus through the medium of discourse. Discourse becomes the central concept in grasping the relation between politics and secret societies among the peasantry. It is argued in this essay that politics displayed through discourse goes a long way towards defining the public in peasant societies. In terms of augmented repression, either from a centralized state or local elites, the sense of public submerges itself in the hidden discourse or code of the secret society. This theme is examined with respect to the Mau Mau of Kenya and late nineteenth and twentieth-century Chinese secret societies.<br>

Abstract: Recent discussions of religious, cultural, and/or moral diversity raise questions relevant to the descriptive and normative aims of students of religious ethics. In conversation with several illustrative works, the author takes up (1) issues of terminology, (2) explanations or classifications of types and origins of plurality and pluralism, (3) the relations between pluralism as a normative theory and the aims of a liberal state, and (4) the import of an emphasis on plurality or pluralism for the comparative study of religious ethics.<br>

Author(s): Hellweg Joseph<br>
Abstract: This article explores the hunting aesthetics of initiated Jula hunters of Côte d'Ivoire who call themselves dozos. It explains how their hunting aesthetic structures their relationship to Islam and the Ivoirian state. Although many Africans approach Islam in the context of tensions between local ritual traditions and modernizing Muslim reform, dozos approach Islam the way they approach the forests where they hunt, assimilating to both in order to tame them. They organize their hunting activities around an aesthetic centred on notions of sweetness and fullness; their contraries, difficulty and emptiness; and the process of mimetic transformation (shape-shifting) that mediates between these extremes. With these categories dozos assimilate themselves to and appropriate power from the forest to kill game. They also link themselves to pre-Qur'anic Muslim figures to legitimize themselves as Muslims. More recently, they tried to assimilate to the Ivoirian state to become a parallel police force. Stories of their tutelary spirit, Manimory, and the texts of their hunting songs, incantations, and epics encode diverse ways for dozos to relate to Islam, leaving room for dozos to eschew it as well. Their texts reveal a dynamic sense of history that defies classification in terms of tradition, modernity or postmodernity. /// Cet article examine l'esthétique de la chasse chez les chasseurs initiés julas de Côte d'Ivoire, qui se donnent le nom de dozos.

Article Title: The Phenomenology of Falling Ill: An Explication, Critique and Improvement of Sartre's Theory of Embodiment and Alienation<br>
Publisher: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers<br>
Issue: i40010631<br>
Date: 3 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Svenaeus Fredrik<br>
Abstract: In this paper I develop a phenomenology of falling ill by presenting, interpreting and developing the basic model we find in Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1956). The three steps identified by Sartre in this process are analysed, developed further and brought to a five- step model: (1) pre-reflective experience of discomfort, (2) lived, bodily discomfort, (3) suffered illness, (4) disease pondering, and (5) disease state. To fall ill is to fall victim to a gradual process of alienation, and with each step this alienating process is taken to a new qualitative level. Consequently, the five steps of falling ill have not only a contingent chronological order but also a kind of logical order, in that they typically presuppose each other. I adopt Sartre's focus on embodiment as the core ground of the alienation process, but point out that the alienation of the body in illness is not only the experience of a psychic object, but an experience of the independent life of one's own body. This facticity of the body is the result neither of the gaze of the other person, nor of a reflection adopting the outer perspective of the other in an indirect way, but is a result of the very otherness of one's own body, which addresses and plagues us when we fall ill. I use examples of falling ill and being a patient to show how a phenomenology of falling ill can be helpful in educating health-care personnel (and perhaps also patients) about the ways of the lived body.<br>

Publisher: University of Sydney<br>
Issue: i40014217<br>
Date: 6 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Telban Borut<br>
Abstract: By focusing on children involved in the ritual practices in Ambonwari village, East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea, this essay compares two types of ritual: that of healing and that of male initiation. Like other life crisis rituals both deal with two dimensions of the Ambonwari life-world, that is with the living and the dead and, in a broader sense, with people and spirits. Though both are based upon the same cosmology there are fundamental differences between them. First, healers in healing ceremonies treat uninitiated children as 'non-beings'. From the perspective of Ambonwari 'selves' or 'beings', children belong to this domain. They exist as extensions of their parents or carers, from whom they cannot be separated conceptually. Second, by examining the Ambonwari concepts of negation I show that healers do not approach the domain of cosmological non-existence: they are not concerned with the cosmogony of the Ambonwari life-world. The male initiation rituals do just the opposite, however. It is only in the male initiation ritual, seen as a cosmogonic event, that young boys are cut off from their parents and 'thrown' abruptly into a state of becoming. Unlike the healing rites, these rituals treat young boys as both Ambonwari beginnings and Ambonwari beings. I argue that Ambonwari initiation rituals are not concerned with symbolic death followed by rebirth, but with states of being. Initiation means that death becomes possible for a child. The initiated boy will now be able to die as an Ambonwari being.<br>

Abstract: Hobbes julgava ter encontrado na ciência e na sua metodologia, especificamente naquelas ciências que eram consideradas como indubitáveis, o modelo que lhe permitiria construir as bases da nova sociedade. Com isto buscava evadir-se das ambiguidades predominantes no seu tempo, as quais não faziam outra coisa senão manter a sociedade num estado bélico. O presente artigo mostra como Hobbes constrói o seu pensamento político de modo geométrico, como uma ciência demonstrativa, comparando o dever-ser da ciência política com a ordem imperante na matemática. O autor mostra ainda até que ponto Hobbes colocou todos os seus esforços na tarefa de dar um carácter científico à política, já que a sua pretensão era fazer dela uma ciência racional Numa palavra, o artigo mostra de que modo Hobbes pretendeu elevar o carácter da filosofia política ao de uma verdadeira ciência política. /// In science - particularly in those sciences that were considered indubitable -and in its methodology, Hobbes thought that he had found the pattern which would allow him to build the bases of a new society. In doing so he was trying to avoid the prevailing ambiguities of his time, which did not go beyond keeping society in an ongoing state of war. Accordingly, he builds his thought around the geometrical mode, as a demonstrative science. Thus he compares the "ought" of political science to the prevailing order of mathematics. Hobbes took great pains to give politics a scientific character, as he tried to make a rational science out of it. By doing this, Hobbes attempted to raise the nature of political philosophy to political science.<br>

Abstract: Analysis of the Turkish state in the 20th century both draws upon and supports Gramsci's definition of the state as "dictatorship + hegemony." Both the form of the capitalist state and its activities rest upon the hegemony of the dominant class. The importance of society and class conflicts in understanding the capitalist state suggests a critical position vis-à-vis the state autonomy tradition. The history of the Turkish state provides support for the argument that the dominant class must have established hegemony in the state in the first place, since without this there is no guarantee of successful use of the coercive power of the state on behalf of the sectional interests of the dominant class.<br>

Abstract: El propósito de esta artículo es reconstruir itinerario de investigción, a través de los diferentes proyectos que lo componen y que fueron realizados en los diez últimos años, con el fin de develar cierta coherencia metodológica y teórica. Cada estudio de esta trayectoria se propone analizar varias facetas de la juventud, desde un punto de vista antropológico y sociológico. Los años de doctorado fueron dedicados a entender el proceso de construcción identitaria de los jóvenes pijos madrileños a través de sus usos y costumbres. Luego, un trabajo post-doctoral se orientó hacia la ano-rexia nerviosa y la feminidad en jóvenes de la ciudad de México. Tercero, un trabajo de campo en la Meseta Tarasca permitió el acercamiento y entendimiento de las "nuevas" representaciones y prácticas de algunos jóvenes acerca de su cuerpo y de su alimentación, así como de algunas lógicas familiares, desestructuradas y re-estructuradas por el hecho de la migración hacia Estados Unidos. Por último, se presenta un cuarto proyecto sobre "bulimia, sexualidades y género", inscrito en una propuesta global de estudio de las inversiones de la "valencia diferencial de los sexos". /// The author revisits her research itinerary, reviewing the different projects that compose work carried out in the last ten years. The aim is to reveal a certain methodological and theoretical coherence. Each study in this trajectory set out to analyze several aspects of young people's lives from an anthropological and sociological point of view. The PhD years were invested in researching the process of identity construction of the Madrilenian pijos (young people from middle an upper middle class) through their uses and customs. Postdoctoral work was focused on nervous anorexia and femininity in young women in Mexico City. Later on, fieldwork in the Tarascan Plateau in Michoacán state in Mexico enabled the author to approach and understand the "new" representations and practices of some young people concerning their bo~<br>

Abstract: En este texto, el autor intenta esclarecer determinados aspectos del imaginario en relación con el Estado, la política, pero también en relación con la violencia y el mal, en un contexto en el que la dialéctica de la identidad y de la alteridad sigue siendo una de las estructuras del imaginario. El imaginario, más allá del ámbito exclusivo de las representaciones, actúa sobre el mundo y sobre la evolución de la historia. Pero el mundo también actúa sobre el imaginario y son los períodos de crisis los que amplían sus manifestaciones, destinadas a "a servir de pantalla contra los temores". En este sentido, la violencia, frente a la cual cabe adoptar actitudes diferentes, se convierte en un elemento simbólico para interpretar nuestras fuerzas. ¿Hasta qué punto estamos presenciando un nuevo modo de funcionamiento de los imaginarios políticos y religiosos? Para responder a esta pregunta, el autor habla de esperanza intercultural "en un mundo donde las voluntades de poder de lo trágico interfieren en los impulsos de lo comunicacional". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles? To answer this question, the author discusses intercultural hope "in a world in which the will of the power of the tragic interferes with communicational impulses."<br>

L'imaginaire, débordant le champ exclusif des représentations, agit sur le monde et sur le mouvement de l'histoire. Mais le monde agit aussi sur l'imaginaire et ce sont les périodes de crise qui amplifient ses manifestations, appelées à "faire écran contre les peurs". C'est dans ce sens que la violence, face à laquelle différentes attitudes sont possibles, devient un élément symbolique pour interpréter nos forces. Jusqu'à quel point est-on en train d'assister à un nouveau mode de fonctionnement des imaginaires politiques et religieux ? Pour répondre à cette question l'auteur parle d'espérance interculturelle "dans un monde où les volontés de puissance du tragique brouillent les élans du communicationnel". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyze how Brazilian trade unions are using social memory as a tool to build up workers' collective identities, in an attempt to fight the fragmentation resulting from the impact of the industrial restructuring of the 1990s. We will draw upon two ongoing programs conducted by the ABC Metal Workers Union (SMABC) and the Oil Workers Union of Brazil's state oil company Petrobras (Sindipetro). The SMABC and Sindipetro have recently been addressing the issue of workers memory with social and public projects. These projects are building up memories, which in spite of being institution-based are also collective, framed by the unions through the use of new types of communication and electronic media.<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40030281<br>
Date: 6 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Gosselin Gabriel<br>
Abstract: Expliciter les fondements d'une éthique des sciences sociales engage hors d'une sociologie de l'éthique. C'est une recherche peu pratiquée dans ces disciplines qui conduit nécessairement à des affirmations en première personne, et entraîne des présuppositions épislémologiques. Trois postulats sont ici dégagés : 1 / Reconnaître en tout autre un sujet, c'est admettre que le sujet est seul porteur de sens ; 2 / L'affirmation d'une commune humanité introduit une universalité en valeur et une relativité épistémologique, dans une démarche interprétative et une éthique des limites ; 3 / Dire que ce n'est pas l'ordre qui nous constitue, mais nous qui le constituons, c'est dire le risque éthique de nous concevoir comme les éléments d'un Tout, et c'est supposer un individualisme d'ordre épistemologique. Accurately defining the basis of an ethic of social sciences requires an approach which is outside the sociology of ethics. The little amount of research which has been conducted in these fields has necessarily led the author to present personal assertions and has also resulted in epistemological presuppositions. Three assumptions are presented here : 1 / To consider that any one else is a subject amounts in effect to admitting that only the subject carries a real meaning ; 2 / The assertion that mankind is a common whole is introducing both the concept of universality and an epistemological relativity, through an approach based on interpretation and an ethical understanding of limits ; 3 / To state that society does not legitimate ourselves, but that ourselves legitimate society amounts to drawing attention to the ethical risk of considering ourselves as lhe components of a whole, which is presupposing an individualism of an espistemological nature.<br>

Author(s): Lentz Carola<br>
Abstract: Sowohl Ethnologie wie Soziologie werden durch die Globalisierung herausgefordert. Die vermeintlich abgeschlossenen fremden „Völker“ verschwinden; „Gesellschaft“ nationalstaatlich zu konzipieren, wird immer unplausibler. Eine (Wieder) Annäherung der beiden im neunzehnten Jahrhundert ausdifferenzierten Fächer tut Not. Taugt „Kultur“ dafür als Brückenbegriff? Soziologen wie Andreas Reckwitz werben für eine praxis-oder diskurstheoretische Reformulierung des Kulturkonzepts, tragen dabei aber auch zu einer problematischen, weil zu umfassenden „Kulturalisierung“ des Sozialen bei. Dagegen halten Ethnologen wie Adam Kuper oder Chris Hann den Kulturbegriff für so unrettbar reifiziert, diffus und machtblind, dass sie ihn lieber abschaffen oder doch umfassend „soziologisieren“ und durch eine präzisere Benennung der jeweils gemeinten symbolischen Codes oder sozialen Praktiken ersetzen wollen. Der vorliegende Artikel schließt sich eher den Skeptikern an und zeichnet aus dieser Perspektive die wichtigsten Stationen der „Entsoziologisierung“ des klassischen ethnologischen Kulturbegriffs und die neuere Kritik in der Ethnologie sowie Ansätze nach, Kultur als Arena von machtförmigen Aushandlungsprozessen zu begreifen. Anthropology and sociology are both challenged by globalisation. Supposedly self-sustaining peoples are rapidly disappearing, and attempts to conceptualize "society" within the parameters of the nation-state have proven themselves unfeasible. It is time to (re) consider the two disciplines that both took shape in the nineteenth century. Can 'culture' still serve as a bridge concept? Sociologists like Andreas Reckwitz have argued in favour of a discourse-and practise-oriented conception of culture, one, however, that entails difficulties of its own, as it leads to the complete culturalization of the social. Anthropologists such as Adam Kuper or Chris Hann, on the other hand, believe the concept of culture to be so reified, diffuse and blind to power relations that they wo~<br>

Abstract: Cet article explore les dynamiques de l'échange communicationnel à l'époque de Stalin et son impact sur la formation de l'opinion. Alors que les journaux, qui présentent leurs auteurs dans un état solitaire de monologue intérieur, révèlent souvent des étendues d'ambiguité et de doute, une communication engagée, particulièrement entre personnes se faisant confiance, est beaucoup plus à même de donner naissance à des jugements et des opinions clairs, ce qui est de la plus haute importance sur le plan de la capacité critique. La riche correspondance personnelle de la famille Kravčenko-Spunde, famille de vieux bolcheviks engagés, montre à quel point un échange ouvert peut susciter et renforcer tant le soutien que la critique la plus âpre du système. Ces documents mettent en lumière un changement majeur, le passage d'un soutien quasi inconditionnel au régime stalinien à sa critique de « fossoyeur de la révolution » , condamnation qui émerge du débat politique tenu dans le cercle étroit de la famille. De plus, la défense d'un bien commun à l'encontre du discours public pousse les discutants à transcender leur cercle restreint et à chercher un contre-public indispensable pour lever le soupçon de particularité qui pèse sur les « biens » défendus au sein de ce cercle et pour confirmer ainsi leur caractère de « bien commun ». La tentative d'élargissement du cercle communicationnel mène à une nouvelle activité dans l'écriture mémorielle qui se propose aussi bien de dévoiler les mensonges du système que de révéler un héritage révolutionnaire distinct de la représentation officielle monopolisée par le régime. L'expérience des relations personnelles pendant la révolution joue un rôle essentiel pour cette revendication dissidente d'un héritage révolutionnaire. Camaraderie et confrontation unie face à l'ennemi pendant la guerre civile doivent être distinguées de l'énonciation et de l'élaboration d'opinions lors de débats publics. Seule cette seconde expérience, basée sur la récipro~<br>

Author(s): Gensburger Sarah<br>
Abstract: Le titre de « Juste parmi les Nations » est décerné depuis 1963 par l'État d'Israël afin d'honorer la mémoire des non-Juifs « qui ont risqué leur vie pour venir en aide à des Juifs » . Le « Juste » reçoit un diplôme et une médaille par un représentant de l'Etat hébreu lors d'une cérémonie publique où les individus « sauvés » et leurs « sauveteurs » , ou leurs descendants, sont réunis. Cet article étudie comment, à travers cette cérémonie, s'effectue un bricolage entre des « mémoires » véhiculées par des institutions et des individus, Juifs et non-Juifs, résidant en France et en Israël. Comment s'explique le recours à une seule et même pratique de rappel public du passé par des individus dont les récits des souvenirs peuvent diverger ? The title of « Righteous among the Nations » has been attributed since 1963 by the State of Israel to honor « the high-minded gentiles who risked their lives to save Jews » . Each nomination goes with the gift of a medal and a diploma to the nominee during an official ceremony. This public event gathers « rescued people » and « rescuers » and members of each family. In this article, the author studies how, through this ceremony, a « patchwork » between different and plural memories can take place. In a common place and time, the different actors crosses institutions, individuals, Jews and non-Jews, living in France or in Israël. How can we explain the use of a single common practice of remembrance by individuals whose social characteristics are different and whose narrations of the past diverge from each other ? Der Titel « Gerechte(r) unter den Nationen » wird seit 1963 vom Staat Israel verliehen, um an Nicht-Juden zu erinnern, « die ihr Leben riskiert haben um Juden zu helfen » . Der/die Gerecht(e) erhält von einem Vertreter des Staates Israel im Rahmen einer Zeremonie und im Beisein der « Geretteten » ein Diplom und eine Medaille verliehen.

Author(s): Saillant Francine<br>
Abstract: Au Brésil, le récit officiel concernant la mémoire de l'esclavage différe nettement de la vision des leaders du mouvement noir contemporain, notamment à propos de la situation et des conditions de vie des Afro-Brésiliens à Rio de Janeiro. Ce mouvement demande à l'État et à la société brésilienne de reconnaître les conditions misérables dans lesquelles les esclaves ont été laissés après l'abolition de l'esclavage, mais aussi la contribution des esclaves à la construction de la société, de l'économie et de la culture brésiliennes et enfin le racisme dont les Afro-Brésiliens sont encore l'objet. Aujourd'hui, des décisions juridiques tendent à favoriser une égalité effective, permettant ainsi l'émergence d'une image positive de la culture afro-brésilienne. This article discusses the difference between the official account on the memory of slavery in Brazil and how contemporary black movement's leaders, notably in Rio de Janeiro, see the Afro-Brazilians' situation and living conditions. This movement, which seeks to reveal in public space the memory of slavery and its consequences, claims Brazilian State and society to recognize not only the miserable conditions under which former slaves were left after the abolition of slavery, but the contribution of the slaves to the construction of Brazilian society, economy and culture and also that Afro-Brazilians are still the object of racism. If in today's Brazil, the public debate on reparations comprises a legal aspect of rectification, by creating measures aiming to provide effective equality, this discussion also takes the form of symbolic fight, in which one of the objectives is to build a positive image of the Afro-Brazilian culture. In Brasilien weicht die offizielle Berichterstattung über die Wahrnehmung der Sklaverei vor allem in Bezug auf die Situation und Lebensbedingungen der Afro-Brasilianer in Rio de Janeiro stark ab von der Sichtweise der Führer der zeitgenössischen « Schwarzen-Bewegung ». Die Bürgerbewegung forde~<br>

Abstract: Within the last 2000 years the land demarcated by the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Jordan Valley to the east has been one of the most disputed territories in history. World powers have redrawn its boundaries numerous times. Since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 within British Mandate Palestine, Palestinians and Israelis have disagreed over the national identity of the land that they both inhabit.The struggles have extended from the battlefields to the classrooms. In the process, different national and ethnic groups have used various sciences, ranging from archeology to history and geography, to prove territorial claims based on their historical presence in the region. But how have various Israeli social and political groups used maps to solidify claims over the territory? In this paper we bring together science studies and critical cartography in order to investigate cartographic representations as socially embedded practices and address how visual rhetoric intersects with knowledge claims in cartography. Before the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the Israeli government and the Jewish National Fund produced maps of Israel that established a Hebrew topography of the land. After 1967, Israel's expanded territorial control made the demarcation of its borders ever more controversial. Consequently, various Israeli interest groups and political parties increasingly used various cartographic techniques to forge territorial spaces, demarcate disputed boundaries, and inscribe particular national, political, and ethnic identities onto the land.<br>

Abstract: Europe is grounded, from all sides, in traces of old inter-state and ethnic conflicts. Experience has proved that they can still be re-activated in spite of various forms of resolution in the past. History is welcome in the present, and we can observe mobilisation among agents, populations of victims, or despoiled groups, which have been forgotten or forced into silence through post-conflictual issues. Various interest groups, political parties, or states, build up memorial resources that they incorporate in their actions list of historicist strategies, with the aim of 'recycling' the representations of the symbolic pasts into contemporary political games. These mobilisations meet the reconciliation trends coming from society (for example, informal groups, NGOs, and so on), or are taken in charge by national and international institutions – which are becoming more and more routine - especially under the influence of the circulation of 'good' models of the pacification of resentments, containing a highly normative tone. The question is to know whether, in spite of the apparent heterogeneity of this phenomenon, the historicist games do constitute a common indicator of the state of political regimes, especially democracies, and also of the strength of that supranational construction called the EU. This question necessitates the revisiting of the dominant concepts in the field of the political sociology of memory. The international circulation of reconciliation grammars, and the fact that memory issues are being torn out of their national frameworks and exploited in several arenas, both internal and external, in order to increase their yield of political resources, are further evidence that the paradigms heretofore dominant in the social sciences are now at an impasse.<br>

Abstract: This paper looks at how "official" memories are produced in state-sponsored public spaces and how a multi-ethnic, multicultural north-east India responded to it. Official memory sites like museums, monuments and memorials not only reflected but also shaped ethnic relations to a great extent. The emerging states in the region have assiduously favoured the historical imagination of a politically dominant community, which is masculine, and remains persistently insensitive to the marginal "others" in the state. This, on the one hand, encouraged the dominant community to assimilate and thereby produced ethnonationalism around that notion of shared pasts. On the other, it generated a sense of neglect in the minorities who responded with vernacular memorials to embody their historical imagination and likewise developed their own ethnic nationalism around it. This parallel rise to prominence of often competing ethnonationalisms within the region, or sometime within the state, has thereby produced violent forms of contestation often dangerously imbued with fissiparous tendencies.<br>

Abstract: Il s'agit d'éclairer plusieurs déplacements qui se sont produits dans les trente dernières années. Tout d'abord la création d'un milieu d'experts intermédiaires entre la politique, l'administration et la recherche. Ensuite un changement du cadre à l'intérieur duquel se situe la réflexion. Il s'agit moins de penser la cohésion d'une société dans un cadre national qu'à la manière dont le pays peut maintenir son rang dans la compétition internationale. Enfin un changement d'orientation politique : le souci de la formation de l'élite redevient primordial même s'il ne s'agit plus de maintenir une tradition culturelle mais de sauvegarder ses parts de marché. Le texte étudie ces évolutions en France en distinguant trois périodes : une période de « politique à l'état gazeux » où la gauche tente de transformer les idéaux libertaires de 1968 en programme de gouvernement ; une tentative de passage à l'état solide avec la loi d'orientation de 1989 et la création de la Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective ; une déstabilisation de ce système par le ministre Claude Allègre qui jette le système éducatif français dans le grand bain de la concurrence internationale. Il s'ensuit une période à la fois « sous influence » et d'incertitude. The idea is to explain several moves that have happened in the last thirty years. First of all, the creation of a body of experts, middlemen between politics, government and research. Then a change in the setting of the thinking process. It is less to think about social cohesion within a national setting than the way the country can live up to its ranking when competing at the international level. Finally, a change in political orientations: teaching the elite becomes a crucial problem again even if it does not mean keeping cultural traditions alive any more but securing market shares. This article studies those changes and defines three periods: firstly, a period of politics in "gaseous-state" in which the left tried to change 1968's liberta~<br>

Abstract: O artigo pretende apresentar um novo modelo de distribuição das ajudas sociais na França, modelo esse entretanto conhecido pelo nome de "alocação personalizada". Trata-se de um mecanismo que, em seu mesmo funcionamento e nas suas justificações éticas, se opõe seja ao sistema actual dominante, herdeiro do Estado-Provi-dência, seja ao projecto alternativo de alocação universal, ou basic income, entretanto amplamente debatido. Objectivo principal do artigo, porém, é explorar os fundamentos filosóficos subjacentes à proposta em causa. Tal como o próprio nome indica, o princípio da "alocação personalizada" apoia-se sobre o contributo de uma filosofia social específica, o personalismo. Assim, evocando principalmente os escritos de Emmanuel Mounier e de Max Scheler, os autores pretendem mostrar até que ponto esta filosofia social suporta uma concepção original da solidariedade, ela própria fundada sobre uma relação específica aos outros. Neste sentido, a proposta que aqui se faz em favor de uma "alocação personalizada" pode ser lida e interpretada como uma aplicação directa da perspectiva personalista a um problema preciso de economia política, a saber, o da organização da assistência social. This paper intends to present a new model for distribution of social assistance in France, a model which has been known by the name of "personalized allocation". It is a mechanism which opposes itself, in its own functioning and in its ethical justifications, both to the present dominant system, heir to the Welfare State, and to the alternative project of universal allocation, or basic income, which in the mean-while has been largely debated. The main aim of this paper, then, is to explore the philosophical fundaments underlying the proposal of the model in question. Like the very name indicates, the principle of "personalized allocation" is based on the contribution of a specific social philosophy, namely personalism. Thus, chiefly calling forth the writings of Emmanuel Mounier and M~<br>

Abstract: The Play About the Baby remains neglected by interpreters of Albee's work because its austerely schematic mode of presentation seems to keeps everything on the surface, making acts of interpretation seem superfluous. Therefore, rather than trying to interpret the play, it is more useful to ask, following the suggestion of Gilles Deleuze, what it does. The play is a dramamachine that produces loss and asserts the centrality of loss to the constitution of selfhood. This loss is achieved by the deployment of perversion, both sexual and linguistic, against Boy and Girl's innocence. The use of perversion ultimately even questions whether there was ever any state of presence that preceded loss. These tactics seem to suggest a wider set of sexual possibilities, but the tactics are ultimately subordinated to the production of melancholia though loss, a subordination that traps the work in a world of severely limited possibilities and encounters.<br>

Abstract: The article contributes to the ongoing debate on the Polish intelligentsia and the role of intellectuals in the politics. The pre-war Polish state is characterized by its domination by intelligentsia, furthering its self-assigned modernizing mission. Communism was reinterpreted as offering another chance for this purpose and when this stagnated, the Solidarity revolution put forward a third chance. The anti-populist argument is seen as expressing the intelligentsia's concern about preserving its unique position.

Article Title: Systemic Change as Institutional Change: Universal Challenges and Polish Adaptations<br>
Publisher: The Polish Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i40057469<br>
Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): MORAWSKI WITOLD<br>
Abstract: On the assumption that harmonization of the allocative efficiency of market, state redistributionism and the social values of solidarity and social justice is the key to successful systemic transformation, the author analyzes systemic change from the institutional perspective. Thus he is able to interpret the new systemic rules in their interaction with the environment and to interpret change in evolutionary terms. The analytic design has seven components: new rules, their intrinsic domestic sources, the need to adjust structurally to the West, environmental contingencies (values, actors and their methods of operation, public or private space, time and circumstances), the mechanisms of emergence of the new system (via establishment of new institutions, deinstitutionalization, reinstitutionalization etc.), impact of the heritage of the past, and, finally, the effectiveness of the new institutions (the state, the economy and civil society). Both in the analysis of universal challenges and the analysis of Polish problems, the author emphasizes the need to develop adaptive rationality, which he views as a superior, synthetic form of overcoming the dilemmas posed by the systemic transformation.<br>

Publisher: The Polish Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i40057480<br>
Date: 1 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): MISZTAL BARBARA A.<br>
Abstract: The article asserts that a search for truth ought to be carrying out in such a way as to preserve or enhance solidarity. It demonstrates the necessity and the difficulties of making atrocious and traumatic historical events legally accountable. The necessity and difficulties have been recently fuelled by the trends towards the openness of modern identity and the growing importance of human rights, both of them demanding settling conflicts in the context of the multiplication of particularistic memories, yet without undermining social solidarity constructed on liberal foundations. The article argue that because of the hybrid nature of the task, unresolved tensions between memory and history, the erosion of the state's ability to impose unitary and unifying framework of memory, there is no simple and quick solution to tensions between memory, solidarity, and therefore to manage these strains we need to rely a plurality of contending narratives and civility of rules.<br>

Article Title: SOCIAL MEMORIES IN (POST)COLONIAL FRANCE: REMEMBERING THE FRANCO-ALGERIAN WAR<br>
Publisher: George Mason University<br>
Issue: i40058998<br>
Date: 7 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): McCormack Jo<br>
Abstract: This article examines social memories in France over the last 10 years. There has been a significant amount of 'memory work' during this period, concerning various aspects of French history, including the World Wars, but predominantly postcolonial issues: the Algerian War, the legacy of slavery, memories of Empire and memories of Immigration in particular. The 'devoir de mémoire' (duty to remember) and 'work of memory' (Paul Ricœur) have taken on greater, and controversial, proportions. While President Jacques Chirac was for some the 'président du devoir de mémoire' (President who championed the duty to remember), President Nicolas Sarkozy seems intent on ending what he sees as the trend towards 'repentance'. After a discussion of the wider memory culture in France, this article focuses on collective and social memories of the Franco-Algerian War (1954-62) Through an analysis of various 'vectors of memory' (Henry Rousso) it argues that the recent upsurge in 'memory work' in France is very much anchored in the present postcolonial social context in France. That memory work is however largely symbolic and in some ways unsatisfactory. It shows that much of the recent work of memory has been only belatedly and partially undertaken by the State, and with civil society in some ways yet to follow.<br>

Author(s): Lebel Udi<br>
Abstract: Individual behaviors, such as loss-coping and “grief work” are affected in organizational contexts. In everything pertaining to coping with trauma in general, and loss more particularly, the individual is “trapped” within a political psychology that enforces the habitus and expectations of institutional dominance on the ostensibly intimate and private response. Regimes have perceived bereavement over battlefield deaths as a form of social capital that can be mobilized to enhance national loyalty and political support. Employing both existential/hermeneutic and institutional analysis, this study examines three diachronic models of bereavement — hegemonic, political and civil — and their political ramifications in the Israeli context.Drawing on changing parental conceptual orientations towards fallen sons and their role as cultural and ideological agents in public sphere, the article traces the movement of bereavement from its capture by the hegemonic state institutions to its creations under the domination of others institutions: political and civic and ultimate use in critiquing the political and military echelon. The article indicates the powerful impact of the social institutional-organizational context on the intimate-psychological context of coping with loss, by illustrating this phenomenon in the Israeli society.<br>

Publisher: Éditions de l'École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales<br>
Issue: i40068374<br>
Date: 6 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Muchnik Natalia<br>
Abstract: L'attachement au pays d'origine est bien analysé pour les diasporas contemporaines afin de démontrer leur dimension transnationale et décrire leurs rapports avec l'État-nation. Pour les XVIe-XVIIIe siècles, en revanche, cette question pourtant fondamentale est minorée au profit des liens entre communautés. Souhaitant sortir des perspectives mono-confessionnelles qui limitent l'historiographie des diasporas modernes, ce travail s'appuie sur l'étude de quatre groupes dispersés : les séfarades, les catholiques britanniques, les huguenots et les morisques. La terre d'origine, qui grave son empreinte culturelle sur la diaspora, constitue un liant structurant fondamental : lieu de l'événement-déclencheur de dispersion et du martyre, elle apparaît comme le front de la résistance qui légitime l'existence de « l'arrière » , la diaspora. Territoire matriciel, souvent mythifié et mobilisé dans les visions messianiques, elle est indissociable de la notion de retour. The attachment to the country of origin is well analyzed for contemporary diasporas to demonstrate their transnational dimension and to describe their relationship with the nation-state. For the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, however, the historiography has emphasized the relationship between communities, overlooking this important issue. Putting aside mono-denominational perspectives, this article offers a new approach to early-modern diasporas by confronting four groups: the Sephardim, the British Catholics, the Huguenots and the Moriscos. The cultural imprint of the homeland was a core structure of diasporas. The locus of both martyrdom and the trigger-event of dispersion, the homeland appeared as the front line of resistance, legitimizing the existence of the "rear", i.e. the Diaspora. Often mythologized and mobilized in messianic visions, this crucial territory was inseparable from the notion of return.<br>

Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press<br>
Issue: i40071687<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Venegas José Luis<br>
Abstract: This article analyzes the function of letter writing and epistolary correspondence in Gustavo Sainz's fiction, particularly Obsesivos días circulares (1969) and A la salud de la serpiente (1991). It contends that the personal letter emerges in these novels as a form of expression and communication that breaks with the models of individual and collective identity fostered and consolidated by the Mexican state during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In addition, epistolary writing responds to the political situation in post-Tlatelolco Mexico by contesting the temporal homogeneity needed to imagine the nation as a unitary social body progressing toward modernity. Epistolary writing thus opens the narrative text to competing, unresolved temporalities while at the same time unmooring individual subjectivity from the destinies of a repressive nation-state.<br>

Issue: i40071849<br>
Date: 5 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Adams Julia<br>
Abstract: How did cultural dynamics help bring about the societies we now recognize as modern? This article constructs seven distinct models for how structures of signification and social meaning participated in the transitions to modernity in the West and, in some of the models, across the globe. Our models address: (1) the spread, via imitation, of modern institutions around the world (memetic replication); (2) the construal, by socio-cultural forces and by state organizations, of the modern citizensubject (social subjectification); (3) the continual search for new meanings to replace traditional religious meaning-systems (compensatory reenchantment); (4) repeated attempts, in modern revolutions, to remake society completely, according to a Utopian vision (ideological totalization); (5) the cultural origins and social consequences of scientific and humanistic worldviews (epistemic rift); (6) the gendered politics of state formation (patriarchal supercession); (7) the invention and production of race in the colonial encounter (racial recognition). We explicate the models in reverse chronological order, because in our synthesis, we argue that the original modern break results from a dynamic combination of racial recognition, patriarchal supercession, and epistemic rift; these changes set the stage for the four other processes we theorize. In addition to our synthesis, we also consider, from a more neutral perspective, the kinds of causal arguments upon which these models tend to rely, and thus explicate the analytical undergirding for the application of any of these models to empirical research on transitions to modernity. Throughout the article, we consider how these models might, and might not, mesh with other families of explanation, such as the politico-economic.<br>

Abstract: A ristotle lived during a period of unprecedented imperial expansionism initiated by the kings of Macedon, but most contemporary political theorists confine his political theorizing to the classical Greek city-state. For many, Aristotle's thought exhibits a parochial Hellenocentric "binary logic" that privileges Greeks over non-Greeks and betrays a xenophobic suspicion of aliens and foreigners. In response to these standard "polis-centric" views, I conjure a different perceptual field—"between polis and empire"—within which to interpret Aristotle's Politics. Both theorist and text appear deeply attentive to making present immediate things "coming to be and passing away" in the Hellenic world. Moreover, "between polis and empire," we can see the Politics actually disturbing various hegemonic Greek binary oppositions (Greek/barbarian; citizen/alien; center/periphery), not reinforcing them. Understanding Politics within the context of the transience of the polis invites a new way of reading Aristotle while at the same time providing new possibilities for theorizing problems of postnational citizenship, transnational politics, and empire.<br>

Abstract: Can one speak of Israelitism in the case of Poland? By asking this question, one runs into the classic difficulty of the universalisation of concepts and to what extent they can be transposed. As a specific method of individualistic integration, French Israelitism pre-supposes a particular organisation of citizenship and society, a dissociation of political and religious categories, as well as a specific articulation of the universal and the particular. This article shows that Israelitism as an idea and a theoretical model entered Judeo-Polish society in the 19th century. Nevertheless, the sociological and political context was radically different from the institutions and public space of the Third Republic and thus limits to the importation of the model were soon reached. All the while drawing its political references from western cultures, the troubled history of Eastern Europe was not structured by the same variables nor by the same historical ruptures. The same words (nation, State, religion) do not have the same meaning; the modes of national and political constructions, particularly between religion and politics, has very little in common with what made French Israelitism possible in the 19th century. In Poland, the paradigm of the Israelite was merely an impossible dream.<br>

Abstract: In 1884 an Ottoman public prosecutor and fellow officials stood trial for abusing their official authorities when attending to an incident in one of Istanbul's neighborhoods. A published verbatim report of the proceedings is used in this article for discussing Ottoman socio-legal change in the late nineteenth century, employing a microhistorical perspective. Following a major reform in the new court system, which was established in the 1860s (the Nizamiye courts), the judicial authorities used the trial in question for transmitting the commitment of the modernizing state to the rule of law, exhibited by the principle of officials' accountability. Features of the reformed judicial system and its distinctive legal culture are demonstrated in this article by unfolding the judicial aspects of this episode and by discussing connections between them and the immediate socio-political and socio-legal contexts of the trial.<br>

Abstract: This review article discusses the emergence of the subsequent proceedings before the US Military Tribunals from the shadows of the trial of 'Major War Criminals' at the International Military Tribunal as explored in Kevin Jon Heller's The Nuremberg Military Tribunals and the Origins of International Criminal Law. The article applauds Heller's efforts in producing a detailed examination of an understudied aspect of the origins of international criminal law. The essay suggests that given the specific focus of the author on the genealogy of international criminal law, important legal historical questions are left unexamined. It suggests a research agenda that would focus more specifically on the centrality of the Shoah to National Socialism and argues that the current trend in historical scholarship focusing on war crimes trials as a distinct subject of inquiry could provide a fruitful basis for future socio-legal research into the Nazi state and its legal apparatus.<br>

Abstract: This article challenges the assumption that "tradition" is a quality pertaining chiefly to objects, stylistic conventions, or the use of materials. Equally, it refutes the notion that tradition is merely the perpetuation of ritualized practices or skilled techniques. By considering the complex relation between vocational migration, heritage, and identity among contemporary fine woodworkers at London's Building Crafts College, it argues that tradition is a state of mind — a recurring nostalgia for an idealized past, or the desire for a Utopian future. More specifically, the article investigates a "tradition of longing" for engagement in nonalienating modes of production, aesthetic work, and an authentic way of living.<br>

Issue: i40088676<br>

Author(s): ANTONINI BRUNO<br>
Abstract: Le but de notre article est d'essayer de montrer en quoi l'expérience rédactionnelle et éditoriale de l'Histoire socialiste de la Révolution française fut pour Jaurès, hormis le prétexte pédagogique évident pour préparer les dirigeants à l'unité du mouvement socialiste encore divisé et pour éduquer politiquement les militants et le prolétariat, l'occasion d'affiner sa réflexion sur une future « méthode socialiste », à la veille de l'unité de 1905. Parce que « la Révolution française contient le socialisme tout entier », quels sont donc les événements que Jaurès juge les plus pertinents et les plus féconds pour l'avenir socialiste de la société et de l'État ? Rappelant le contexte et les conditions de cette grande entreprise, nous nous sommes attachés à retrouver ce qui fonde philosophiquement sa démarche et ses analyses historiques - spécialement au cours du « moment thermidorien » - à partir de sa méthode philosophique adossée à sa métaphysique de l'unité de l'être. Une esquisse, en somme, de l'analyse critique jaurésienne de la « dictature jacobine » et de l'esprit révolutionnaire de Robespierre conditionnant le socialisme réformiste gradualiste de Jaurès. The article attempts to show how the writing and editing of the Socialist History of the French Revolution was for Jaurès not merely a self-evident pretext to enlighten others, unify the still divided leaders of the socialist movement and educate politically the party faithful and the proletariat, but also an opportunity to finetune his reflections on a future « socialist methodology » on the eve of the union of 1905. Given that « the French Revolution contains socialism in its entirety », what then were the events that Jaurès thought most relevant and fruitful for the socialist future of society and state ? While recalling the context and conditions of this great venture, our aim has been to retrieve the philosophical essence of his historical approach and analysis, especially during the « moment of Thermidor »~<br>

Author(s): KAJFOSZ JAN<br>
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to consider such ethnolinguistic categories as magic, connotation, cognitive blending as possible keys to the following questions: How is it possible that we can perfectly adopt different representations of the past and internalize them as our past? How can we reconcile different representations of the past and how is it possible that diverse representations of the past merge in one social memory? Such amalgamations of various forms of representations and diverse scales of objectification can be clarified by means of the theory of magic, by means of the law of resemblance, and the law of contiguity. Such considerations are supported here by empirical study of the construction of social memories in Teschen Silesia, which was divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1920. On both sides of the new border different state institutions emerged and influenced local memories.<br>

Author(s): Zamyatin Peter G.<br>
Abstract: This article examines the interplay of dystopian and utopian themes in Terry Bisson's "Pirates of the Universe," utilizing Tom Moylan's concept of "critical dystopia." In the novel, Bisson maps out a number of discontinuous dystopias in a near-future US marked by rampant capitalist enterprise, out-of-control bio-technology, ecological decay, and a weak central state. These dystopias generally produce citizens with fragmented personal experiences, disinterest in social issues, and limited aspirations. Towards the end of the novel, when free and clean energy becomes available to all, Bisson explores continuing dystopian trends, articulates utopian possibilities, and emphasizes the importance of individual and collective imagination for choosing among alternatives.<br>

Author(s): Hodrová Daniela<br>
Abstract: This study represents a Chapter from a section devoted to the composition of a literary work and is part of a larger project called ‘The Poetics of a Work of Literature in the Twentieth Century’, which is being undertaken by the Theory Department of the Institute of Czech Literature. The fragment and fragmentariness in a twentieth-century literary work are a manifestation of a marked tendency towards discontinuity or in some cases towards continuity of a certain kind. There exist works of art that for various reasons remain fragments without, however, being preceived as such (the novels of Kafka and Ladislav Klíma’s Velký román, are cases in point); on the other hand, the fragment, that is to say an intentional fragment (such as a sketch or a synopsis), becomes an independent genre whose roots go back to Romanticism (for instance Novalis’s fragment). The fragment and fragmentarieness that manifests itself in the text in the widest possible number of ways (intentional incompleteness and sporadicity, ‘blank spots’ in the Story, the mixing of heterogeneous elements, the alternating of various genres within one work, and so on), we understand as a reaction to the idea about the work as a complete, inlernally unified and accomplished whole with a clear and single Sense, an idea that Classicism molleyeoddled, which was then to a large exient done by Realism and with it all so-called decadent literature (including tendencious, Socialist-Realist literature). The fragment and fragmentariness (with which is linked the idea of a sense that continuously defies being pinned down to any one definition, which follows from its quality of not being fully told, from suggestion, hints, silence, gaps and ‘ holes’) are, in the literature of the twentieth century, perceived as both a genre and also as approaches that can express the open nature of being and of the world better than the whole work can. Because fragmentary works often represent a work in a nascent state or in a state of tr~<br>

Issue: i40100618<br>

Author(s): Špirit Michael<br>
Abstract: This article discusses the attitude of the Czech literary critic Václav Černý to his fellow critic and compatriot F. X. Šalda, that is to say, Černý's self-stylization, which was defined in polemical reference to Šalda, and also the way Černý 'broadcast' it or concealed it - the primary feature of his technique. Concerning the question of whether literary criticism is a science or an art, the author does not state that Šalda was correct in his Stance against Černý nor, for that matter, that Černý was correct in his against Šalda: the construct of Černý's 'Co je kritika, co není a k čemu je na světě' [What Criticism Is, What It Is Not, and Why It Exists at All] is just as valid as Šalda's claim. The article seeks to demonstrate that in particular it was in his conception of literary criticism that Černý needed to distance himself from Šalda. The fact that Černý could argue for his own method only thanks to Šalda's not having declared criticism a science is only seemingly a paradox. The article also points out parallels between Šalda’s Boje o zítřek and Černý's Osobnost, tvorba a boj, which are interesting particularly for the way the narrow correspondence between the two works then stands out and how Černý in fact barely discussed Šalda at ali. The affinity of the two critics emphasizes how important it was for Černý to stress the difference between himself and his predecessor in the very area in which he was in fact most similar to him.<br>

Abstract: La coexistence de différentes manières de penser l'historicité - qu'elles soient, en particulier, cycliques ou linéaires - est évidente dans l'histoire longue de la Chine et, plus généralement, de l'Asie orientale. C'est ce que démontre l'article de Prasenjit Duara qui, après une réflexion sur les débats historiques et philosophiques portant sur le temps et l'histoire, insiste sur la manière dont les circulations transnationales affectent profondément les formes de l'historicité. Ici, c'est le rapport entre nation et conscience historique qui est examiné à nouveaux frais. Les récits du passé sont peut-être nécessaires à toutes les organisations sociales qui cherchent à se constituer comme telles. Cependant, avant l'apparition de l'Étatnation, ces récits non seulement englobaient des différences et des contestations, mais ils entretenaient aussi une relation à un temps et des idéaux universels ou cosmologiques. L'émergence de la modernité contribua au désenchantement du politique, parallèlement à l'avènement d'États capitalistes en concurrence, qui cherchèrent a mobiliser toutes les formes de ressources et de biopouvoir. Ces histoires de l'État et de la civilisation, linéaires et réifiées, furent essentielles dans cette mobilisation. Un bon exemple peut en être donné avec les récits historiques eurasiens et la manière dont ils circulèrent. Cet article les examine et s'intéresse notamment aux modalités de l'historicité en Asie orientale, en étant attentif à leurs circulations et en insistent sur les voies, à la fois globales et régionales, qu'elles empruntèrent. Leurs forces furent converties en récits historiques linéaires de nations souveraines engagées dans des interrelations de compétitions agressives. Narratives of the past are perhaps necessary in all collectivities that seek to constitute themselves as such. Before the modern nation-state, however, these narratives not only embedded differences and contestations, they also bore a relationship to universal or co~<br>

Abstract: In societies coming to terms with historical injustices, public apology has recently emerged as a potent trend. This is particularly true of France, where the state served as a catalyst for a wave of public apologies for acts of intolerance committed during the Second World War. Following Jacques Chirac's 1995 official apology for Vichy's anti-Semitic policies, various groups in civil society publicly atoned for their particular Vichy roles in discrimination against Jews: the medical profession, the law bar, the Catholic Church, and the police. How does public apology, as distinct from court trials, historical commissions, and reparations, affect contemporary France's reconciliation with its past? This article also analyzes how apologizing for Vichy has created demand for an official French apology for the Algerian War. By 2006, the politics of memory in French society decidedly shifted attention from Vichy to post-colonialism: in both cases, the apology turn imposes new dynamics of remembering and forgetting.<br>

Article Title: NARRATING CRISIS: THE DISCURSIVE CONSTRUCTION OF THE 'WINTER OF DISCONTENT'<br>
Publisher: British Sociological Association Publications Limited<br>
Issue: i40108657<br>
Date: 5 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Hay Colin<br>
Abstract: The winter of discontent continues to exert a powerful hold over the British political imaginary. It acts as a discursive key to a collective mythology seemingly appealed to, and conjured, in each wave of industrial unrest, in each hint of political turmoil and, until recently, whenever the election of a Labour Government looked credible. In this paper I consider the rhetorical strategies and linguistic devices deployed by the tabloid media in the narration of the events of the winter of 1978-79. I argue for an interpretation of the winter of discontent as a moment of state crisis. By crisis however I do not refer to the mere accumulation of contradictions but rather to a moment of transition, a moment of decisive intervention. Within such a framework, the winter of discontent emerges as a strategic moment in the transformation of the British state, and perhaps the key moment in the pre-history of Thatcherism. For, as I hope to demonstrate, the initial appeal of the New Right was premised upon its ability to offer a convincing construction of the winter of discontent as symptomatic of a more fundamental crisis of the state. In such a moment of crisis, a particular type of decisive intervention was called for. In this discursive construction of crisis the New Right proved itself capable of changing, if not the hearts and minds of the electorate, then certainly the predominant perceptions of the political context. It recruited subjects to its vision of the necessary response to the crisis of a monolithic state besieged by the trade unions. This was perhaps the only truly hegemonic moment of Thatcherism. It occurred well before Mrs Thatcher entered Number 10. It is thus not surprising that one of the most enduring and distinctive legacies of Thatcherism has been the new political lexicon of crisis, siege and subterfuge born of the winter of discontent.<br>

Issue: i40113339<br>

Author(s): Frunzâ Sandu<br>
Abstract: Primo Levi's If This Is a Man is a central work in understanding the way in which the subjective memory of a Holocaust survival receives a general meaning. This requires a context in which the duty to prevent the repetition of the tragic events endured by European Jews becomes a universal responsibility we must assume. This text examines the process of dehumanization and total degradation of a human being in the conditions of the death camp, and examines the antidote that Levi proposes for escaping the state of existential pathology. Particular emphasis is placed on the way in which Levi, who embraces secular humanist values, uses religious background and religious symbolic structures in order to provide additional understanding of the fact that in the absence of God, the world itself becomes void of humanity.<br>

Abstract: Giuseppe Capograssi (1889-1956) was an important legal philosopher and had a lively influence on the development of legal studies. The centre of his reflections lay in his many investigations into the concept of experience, which aimed to supersede the prevalent orientation in Italy, focussed on vertexes, emphasizing instead the importance of practices, both on the theoretical level and in the analysis of legal activity and political reality. Capograssi therefore paid great attention to the relationship between state and society viewed in a dynamic and pluralist perspective. No less illuminating are Capograssi's investigations into the value of the constitution and the principle of legality. During the Fascist period, Capograssi upheld the values of individual liberty and democratic principles, seeing as indispensable the continual involvement of citizens in the development of political action. This perspective played a further, particularly important role in the "ideas of Capograssi", after the war and the advent of the republican legal order. According to Capograssi, more space needed to be given to social life and to the spiritual links on which political community is based. In this sense, Capograssi found the teachings of Catholicism fundamental. His Catholicism placed great emphasis on freedom and solidarity and contained a lively, underlying sense of the cultural and spiritual, inspired by the ideal of "charity".<br>

Abstract: Les deux courants de pensée politique arabe au Proche-Orient les plus marquants depuis la guerre des Six jours sont, d'une part, les théories palestiniennes de la révolution arabe, et, d'autre part, l'islamisation du socialisme arabe hérité de Nasser. Les textes fondamentaux du FPLP et du FDPLP, mais aussi les études, plus modérées, d'intellectuels proches du Fath et de l'OLP redonnent vie à des sensibilités politiques proche-orientales caractéristiques. En effet, la « révolution palestinienne » est vue expressément à la fois comme locale, provinciale, d'une part, et, d'autre part, comme nationale-arabe, et non comme étatique. Quant au socialisme arabe en quête d'islamisation, il bénéficie de la pensée sociale et politique des Frères musulmans. Socialisme arabe et socialisme islamique se rejoignent, avec en priorité un projet économique d'une urgence évidente. L'intégrisme et le fanatisme politiques des Frères se sont estompés. Cette remontée raisonnable de l'authenticité islamique offre peut-être la chance d'une ferveur mobilisatrice des masses arabes. Ces deux évolutions, chacune à sa façon, contestent la pensée politique héritée de l'Occident. Quelques penseurs arabes ont profité de la catastrophe de juin 1967 pour analyser les structures profondes des sociétés arabes actuelles : communautarisme, mentalité « poétique », et surtout expérience originale de l'appartenance nationale. Réflexions sociologiques assez indépendantes des pressions idéologiques pour aider à saisir un phénomène comme le « nationalisme arabe », par exemple. Since the Six-Day War, the two most prominent lines of Arab political thought in the Near East have been, on the one hand, the Palestinian theories of the Arab revolution and, on the other, the Islamisation of the Arab socialism inherited from Nasser. The basic texts put out by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Popular and Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PDFLP), and also the more moderate st~<br>

Abstract: Este artigo trata da clássica relação entre as ordens moral e jurídica, no contexto problemático do direito contemporâneo, acentuado pela crise nos países ocidentais do Estado constitucional. O autor defende a necessidade da relação entre o conhecer e o agir no direito, ou seja, de afirmar a relevância de uma unidade autêntica e coesa entre a teoria e a prática jurídicas. Por um lado, a coerência jurídica deve estar baseada no rigor lógico, por outro, essa coerência exige o compromisso e a responsabilidade dos agentes jurídicos. Portanto, neste artigo é sugerida a necessidade de um compromisso verdadeiro com os fins próprios do Direito e, ainda, que a responsabilidade se converta em condição ineludível para, juridicamente, saber distribuir com justiça. This article deals with the classical relations between moral and juridical orders, in the problematic frame of contemporary Law, marked by the current crises, in western countries, of constitutional State. The author argues for the necessity of a relationship, in Law, between knowing and acting, that is, the necessity of affirming the relevance of an authentic and cohesive unity between theory and juridical practice. On the one hand, the juridical coherence must be based on logical rigor, on the other, that coherence requires the commitment and responsibility of legal agents. So, in this article it is suggested the need for a genuine commitment to the purposes of Law and, also, that the responsibility becomes the unavoidable condition to know, legally, how to distribute with justice.<br>

Abstract: O plural e conflituoso entendimento da legitimação da pena no Direito, tem origem nas diversas intencionalidades que lhe conferem sentido. Neste artigo são analisadas as intencionalidades mais relevantes, destacando os seus modelos justificativos: retribuição, reparação, prevenção, expiação, reabilitação e restauração (precedidas pela vingança, extrajudiríca). Para melhor análise destes são também consideradas a variável da temporalidade (passado, presente, futuro) e a variável dos sujeitos, que protagonizam a dinâmica do castigo (infractor, víctima, Estado, sociedade). Depois, num momento comparativo, destacam-se criticamente as confluencias e as oposições. Assim será possível concluir que a intencionalidade restauradora e a sua firme relativização do castigo é aquela que melhor consegue articular as variáveis de sentido-com os seus valores-, a temporalidade e os sujeitos, pelo que se mostra ser a referência mais positiva para a legitimização. Contudo, dada a sua precaridade, devido ao seu surgimento recente, impõe-se reforçá-la reflexivamente e prácticamente. The plural and conflictual understanding of the legitimacy of penalty in law stems from diverse intentionalities that constitute their respective meanings. This article analyzes the most relevant intentionalities. It seeks to highlight the models that justifies them: retribution, reparation, prevention, atonement, rehabilitation and restoration (preceded by vengeance, extrajudirical). To better analyze these models, the variable of temporality (past, present, future) and the variable of the subjects are also considered in view of the fact that they operate in the dynamics of punishment (offender, victim, State, society). Then, establishing comparisons, the confluences and oppositions are critically highlighted. In order to conclude that the restorative intentionality and its strong relativization of punishment is the one who can best articulate the variables of meaning -with their values, involving temporalit~<br>

Abstract: Recent research on collective memory suggests that commemorations of difficult pasts take either a multivocal or a fragmented form. I suggest these forms exist as ideal types for the initial commemoration, but the commemorative field, as a whole, remains dynamic over time, effectively shifting between forms. This study traces the creation, maintenance, and transformation of collective memory of the May 4, 1970 shootings at Kent State from 1970 to 2013 using archival sources, media accounts, and participant observation. In examining the commemorative field at Kent, I theorize the existence of a third commemorative form—the integrated commemorative field, which allows for the expression of divergent narratives and the maintenance of separate commemorative spaces while simultaneously enhancing social solidarity through shared meta-narratives that stress overarching values, like human rights or scientific inquiry.<br>

Abstract: Until about 2005, it was hard to find any publication about literature during the communist era or any important work concerning this period. Since then, this astonishing silence has given way to the publication in Bulgaria of several novels and hybrid writings. In the meantime occured not only literary, but also political and social events which changed the issue: isn't the real problem in Bulgaria today no longer the institutional, generational, historiographical or literary silence, but the dilemna between the collective or individual responsability? To cope with these problems, the author takes into account both the works of Paul Ricoeur concerning the excess of memory and the excess of oblivion, the blocked memory, manipulated memory, abusively controlled or obligated memory, and two emblematic books concerning the communist past as seen in the State Security files: The Watched Man by Vesko Branev, and Surveillance and Conditioning: the literary prose of the State security by Žerminal Čivikov.

Abstract: During the reign of Catherine the Great, the question of the origins of the Russian State and people ('the Varagian-Norman question') becomes a matter of wide discussion in Russia and in Europe. It has been a very controversial topic in the Russian Academy of Sciences and the occasion of a violent polemic between historians around 1749-50. It has long been kept secret because of the possible dangerous political consequences for the Monarchy and the national pride. The political power wanted by all means to give its subjects a glorious national history but at the same time to control the story of the origins, the ethnic aspects and possible liberal, parliamentary or democratic interpretations of the beginnings of the Russian State. While western historians (German, French and English) gave their accounts of this founding event to the Enlightened Europe, making this story widespread in the West, Catherine made ancient Russian history part of the new modern national education of the elites. She was writing plays herself and patronizing artists and printers, censuring them occasionally: she tried to orient collective memory and used it as an ideological tool to create a unified empire under her lead. В правление имератрицы Екатерины Великой (1762-1796 гг.) - как в России, так и в Европе - всё активнее обсуждается т н. «варяжско-норманский вопрос», т.е. вопрос происхождения Российского государства и народа. Еще в правление императрицы Елизаветы Петровны (1742-1761 гг.) внутри Российской Академии наук, и прежде всего в 1749-1750 гг., данный вопрос стал предметом острой полемики между историками. Между тем долго опасались огласки, т.к. было принято считать, что самый спор, пожалуй, может вызывать нежелательные политические последствия для Монархии и национальной гордости. Политическая власть стремилась к тому, чтобы в ее основание легла величественная национальная история. В свзи с этим она пыталась иметь контроль над повествованием о своем происхождении, и также об этниче~<br>

Issue: i40143302<br>

Author(s): Payen Pascal<br>
Abstract: Dans l'« Archéologie », Thucydide met en oeuvre les modalités et les conséquences d'une omniprésence de la polis, en tant que phénomène social total, depuis les commencements, puis tout au long des « temps anciens (τά παλαιά) », et jusqu'au présent (νῦν). La description de ce passé antérieur est tantôt celle de l'état présocial ou de la genèse de l'état social de l'homme, tantôt celle des premiers temps des sociétés grecques, alors tournées vers le « développement » (αύξηθῆναι) et préoccupées de leur « puissance » (δύναμις). L'Archéologie entretient avec le présent une relation de distance et d'interférence. De distance, parce que le recours constant à l'expression τὰπαλαιά pour désigner ce moment marque une intention d'objectivation ; d'interférence, parce que les modèles d'intelligibilité élaborés par Thucydide tout au long de son exposé sont, par leur origine, empruntés au présent. Il montre que les concepts se sont forgés, sedimentes, complexifies au cours de cette forme de préhistoire. L'« Archéologie » décrit à la fois les temps anciens et le présent, le présent dans les temps anciens ; elle recourt à des concepts tirés du présent, mais validés parce qu'ils sont opératoires dans les temps des origines. In the «Archeolog», Thucydides brings into play the modalities and consequences of an omnipresence of the polis, as a total social phenomenon, since the origins, then all along the «former past» (ta palaia), to the present (nun). The description of that former past is sometimes that of a presocial state or of the genesis of man's social condition, sometimes that of the early days of Greek societies then bent on «development» (auxethenai) and concerned by their power (dynamis). The Archeology entertains with the present a relation of distance and interference. One of distance since the permanent resort to the expression ta palaia to designate that moment underscores an objectivying purpose; one of interference, since the patterns of intelligibility worked out ~<br>

Abstract: This paper is based on the analysis of a corpus of letters sent to a specific Chinese institution: the Letters and Visits Administration created in 1951. Its main focus is to analyze the recent trends of this particular space of direct address to State and Party representative. This is indeed a space where situations considered to be unjust, illegitimate, unacceptable are exposed, whether individually or collectively. The article begins by stressing the importance not only of the grievances expressed but of the type of relationship posited by complainants between themselves and those they appeal to, which is also between the ruled and the rulers. It then considers how letters and visits enable those who take such initiatives to step outside the private realm and tell public authorities who they are and, more precisely, how they perceive themselves. Finally, I will try to explain why the shared arguments put forward by petitioners, although they often rely on official commitments, cannot be understood as expressing a mere inclination towards rule compliance. Ce texte prend appui sur un corpus de lettres adressées à une institution chinoise particulière: l'administration des Lettres et des Visites créée en 1951. II a pour principal objectif d'analyser les développements récents de cet espace d'adresse directe auprès des représentants du Parti et de I'État. II s'agit en effet pour ceux qui investissent cet espace de parole, que ce soit à titre individuel ou collectif, de révéler des situations jugées injustes, illégitimes, inacceptables. L'article commence par souligner l'importance non seulement des griefs exprimés mais de la relation que les plaignants rendent manifeste dans leurs lettres entre eux et ceux auxquels ils s'adressent, soit entre gouvernés et gouvernants. II analyse ensuite comment lettres et visites permettent à ceux qui prennent de telles initiatives de sortir du domaine privé pour dire aux autorités publiques qui ils sont et, de façon plus précise, co~<br>

Abstract: Conspiracy accounting is often regarded as an atypical, pathological form of political reasoning, and little research has considered how ordinary social actors may refer to political conspiracies in the course of argument. In this article, we consider the spontaneous use of conspiracy narratives by politically engaged Greek citizens in interview discussions of the Macedonian crisis. Analysis revealed that conspiracy narratives were typically used to challenge dominant representations that attributed the Macedonian crisis to Greek xenophobic nationalism. Specifically, conspiracy accounts were used to dispute assumptions concerning Greece's majority status by representing the political opposition as a consortium rather than a single out-group, by recasting the threat posed to Greece as a matter of realistic rather than symbolic competition, and by extending the historical frame of reference to encompass past and prospective future threats to the Greek people and the Greek state. In conclusion, we note how the use of conspiratorial reasoning may be used to construct complex causal arguments concerning intergroup relations and to challenge dominant ideological assumptions about social hierarchy and political legitimacy. In this respect, conspiratorial reasoning might be regarded as a prototypical form of intergroup representation.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40160154<br>
Date: 12 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Medina Rafael Alarcón<br>
Abstract: Using postwar El Salvador as a case study, I argue against the dominant paradigm that situates the repressive role of the state as both the central object of memorialization and the main subject of history. Instead, I focus on the ways in which the memory of insurgent collective action is constructed among young members of the popular classes in postwar El Salvador. Drawing on extensive ethnographic research in the communities of northern Morazán, I understand memory as the suspended time of praxis. Media—such as Internet, Facebook, and TV play a key role in this process, impinging on the ways youth relate with the revolutionary past of their relatives making sense of their present living conditions. I argue that memory must be understood as a particular form of praxis, one that is embedded in historic concrete forms of class constitution in which the role of media has become a constitutive element in the labors of memory, particularly among young people.<br>

Author(s): Hoskins Gareth<br>
Abstract: An interest in narrative has done much to shed light on our understandings of geography. Studies linking narrative to nation building, the making of place, identity, the region, the spaces of health, heritage, and environmental history, give some indication of the breadth at which geographical scholarship has been pushed forward by an applied interest in stories. This article attempts to develop such work with a particular focus on the performative capacities of narrative; how stories might work towards various recuperative outcomes. It discusses the revision of historic tours around Angel Island Immigration Station, a California State Park property and National Historic Landmark with reference to the term narrative economy. The Immigration Station plays host to a narrative economy where stories circulating around the site acquire value on the basis of their factual content and their compatibility with a set of approved messages. Some of these stories are disputed and devalued so as to distinguish them from factual 'histories' produced by recently commissioned research. The article considers how heritage sites negotiate tensions between the burden of representational accuracy and the need to function more broadly as platforms for liberatory intervention.<br>

Abstract: If nations are "imagined communities" as many theorists like to define them, then they need an ideology to create a cohesive imagination. In modern times, the project of writing "history" has been an important instrument in the service of this ideological purpose of justifying and reproducing the modern nation-state as the predestined and legitimate container of collective consciousness. School textbooks, at least in South Asia, have long been among the most exploited media for the presentation of the history of the national collective. This essay is a study of school textbooks in Bangladesh. It looks at narrative representations of selected episodes from the past, both pre- and postindependence, in order to reflect on how they construct "history". Through this work I endeavor to relate textual images to issues of community relations and identity by identifying and sharing the ways in which the audience for nationalist discourse is created, nurtured, and secured through symbolic means.<br>

Abstract: La transition vers l'État de droit et la démocratie qui a eu lieu dans de nombreux pays (Argentine, Chili, Afrique du Sud, Haïti, pour n'en citer que quelques-uns) au cours de ces dernières décennies a remis à l'ordre du jour le problème de l'amnistie. Doit-on, au nom de la réconciliation et de la paix civile, renoncer à traduire en justice les anciens bourreaux ? Ou bien doiton, au nom de la justice due aux victimes, les traduire en justice ? Poser la question de cette façon, c'est suggérer qu'il existe une opposition absolue entre l'amnistie et la justice. Dans notre contribution, nous voudrions montrer que cette opposition n'est pas aussi absolue qu'on le pense et que l'amnistie peut aussi parfois être nécessaire pour préserver ou réinstaurer les conditions de possibilité de la justice. The transition towards a state of law and democracy which has taken place in many countries in the last decades (Argentina, Chili, South Africa, Haïti, to mention just a few) brings up again the problem of amnisty. In the name of reconciliation and civil peace, should former torturers and hangmen be released from justice? Or, to do justice to victims, should they be brought to trial? Put that way, the question suggests an absolute opposition between amnisty and justice. In this article we want to show that this opposition is not so absolute as one might think and that amnisty is sometimes necessary to preserve or to re-instate the condititions for the possibility of justice.<br>

Issue: i40185026<br>

Abstract: L'auteur se propose de vérifier l'affirmation de Lavelle selon laquelle l'ouvrage de 1937, De l'Acte, se serait progressivement développé comme une synthèse complète de sa philosophie. Or il existe, à l'état dactylographié, une version antérieure de ce livre, qui permet de comprendre combien l'aisance presque trop grande des analyses de 1937 cache en fait une élaboration lente et un effort continu. La version inédite insiste sur l'intemporalité transcendantale de l'acte, et sur l'impersonnalité de l'acte fondateur de toutes les existences personnelles. Ces thèses seront abandonnées en 1937. On analyse ensuite l'article « Être et Acte » et la conférence de la société française de philosophie sur « Acte créateur et acte réflexif », où est discutée la position de Jean Nabert. Les thèses de De l'Acte montrent une progression de l'identité de l'être et de l'acte (dans l'acte d'être) jusqu'à l'acte en sa forme la plus haute, l'acte d'amour. Situer cette œuvre capitale implique qu'on ait bien compris l'interprétation du sensible comme de la donnée matérielle qui doit être spiritualisée. L'expérience extérieure du sensible s'oppose à l'expérience intérieure de l'esprit. Et l'acte est l'œuvre de l'être spirituel. L'ontologie dynamique de Lavelle est une affirmation de la liberté humaine comme participation à l'acte créateur divin. Divin ou humain, l'être est subjectif parce que libre. Ainsi Lavelle s'inscrit dans la tradition platonicienne moderne, celle d'Avicenne d'abord, celle de Hegel ensuite. The author proposes to verify Lavelle's assertion that the 1937 work, De l'Acte, would be progressively developed as a complete synthesis of his philosophy. Now there exists in typewritten state an earlier version of this book, which allows us to see the extent to which the almost excessive facility of analyses of 1937 in fact conceals a slow development and a continuous effort. The unedited version insists upon the transcendental atemporality of act, and upon the impersonality of ~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>

Date: 12 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Cyprus News Agency Olga<br>
Abstract: This article is an ethnographic exploration of the process through which citizens come to conceptualize their identities as political subjects in rapidly changing contexts. The focus of the article is the lifting, in 2003, of a ban on crossing between the northern and southern parts of the island of Cyprus, which had been instituted in 1974. The article examines how this new political change affected state rhetoric, and concentrates on the reactions of Greek-Cypriot citizens to this shift. These data are related to the wider discussion on the political theory of subjectivity and the concept of 'event', where, it is argued, anthropology has a significant contribution to make. / Le présent article est une exploration ethnographique des processus par lequel les citoyens en viennent à conceptualiser leurs identités comme sujets politiques dans des contextes de changements rapides. Il est centré sur l'abolition, en 2003, de l'interdiction de passage imposée en 1974 entre les parties Nord et Sud de L'île de Chypre. L'auteur examine la manière dont ce nouveau changement politique a affecté la rhétorique étatique, et se concentre sur les réactions des Chypriotes Grecs à cette évolution. Ces données sont replacées dans un cadre de discussion plus large sur la théorie politique de la subjectivité et le concept « d'événement », auquel l'anthropologie peut, selon l'auteur, apporter une contribution importante.<br>

Author(s): Womack JoAnn<br>
Abstract: The Mexican state's use of revolutionary history to invoke nationalistic sentiments nurtures a lively tradition of storytelling. Ironically, Buena Vista's storytellers criticize the inauthenticity of official representations of the past even as they draw on the images and ideals of "official" history to weave their own tales. This article argues that discourses of authenticity reinscribe historic distinctions between the community and the state in a language which evokes modern notions of purity and truth. The article highlights the political role of discourses of authenticity within the hegemonic structures of modern state power in Mexico.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i201461<br>
Date: 12 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Zharova James V.<br>
Abstract: An approach to sociocultural analysis based on the ideas of Vygotsky, Bakhtin, and others is used to provide the foundation for discussing narratives as "cultural tools." The production of official, state sponsored historical narratives is examined from this perspective, and it is argued that this production process may be shaped as much by dialogic encounters with other narratives as by archival information. These claims are harnessed to examine the production of post-Soviet Russian history textbooks, especially their presentation of the events surrounding the Russian Civil War of 1918-20.<br>

Publisher: American Society for Public Administration<br>
Issue: i240081<br>
Date: 2 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Wolf Larry D.<br>
Abstract: Since the founding of this nation, the theater metaphor has had an influence on political discourse. Politicians often invoke the metaphor when they enact political dramas to construct themselves in the image of leader. An argument is presented that former President Ronald Reagan and his political strategists made extensive use of this strategy and were effective in portraying public administrators as evil villains. It is also argued that supporters of the administrative state relied on the theater metaphor as well. In an effort to counter Reagan's negative image of villain, supporters responded by portraying public administrators as heroes and innocent victims. This article suggests that the theater metaphor is problematic when viewed from the perspective of public administration theory and practice. The images of villain, hero and innocent victims emanating from the theater metaphor are troublesome and deserve scrutiny.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the connection between state order and selfunderstandings in everyday life through a case study of the “Boarding School for Gifted Disadvantaged” in Israel. It includes content analysis of governmental protocols that documented the establishment of the boarding school (governmental constitution of a new self-concept) and interviews with sixty of its graduates (self-understandings in everyday life). The findings reveal how the new cultural order invented a new selfhood, “gifted disadvantaged,” previously unknown in Israel. This category is based on structural distinctions between being “naturally” gifted versus the governmental constitution of gifted status. Interviews with graduates indicate that they experience selfhood as a philanthropic gift bestowed on them by the state of Israel and voice their gratitude toward the state. The concluding discussion suggests that the graduates experience their selfhood as “public property.” The self, perceived as having been constructed from outside, is in a continuous dialectic between the presence and the absence of certain personal qualities.<br>

This article reviews the key theories and empirical findings that have emerged over the last two decades of that research program. The aim, in addition to a comprehensive review and assessment, is to outline an agenda for collaboration between political scientists and international lawyers on topics that will advance the state of the art in both fields.<br>

Abstract: Other poets use endnotes to make visible the constraints that structure their poems, in a mode reminiscent of the Oulipian penchant for texts that thematize or otherwise lay bear their constraints. In four of the poems in
         Lighthead, African American poet Terrance Hayes borrows the form of thepecha kucha, a Japanese business presentation in which “a presenter narrates or riffs on twenty images connected to a single theme for twenty seconds at a time.”
               Hayes directs the reader out of his book and across media to a website (88
            http://www.pechakucha.org/) for more information on the form; and he suggests Googling images of works by African American sculptor Martin Puryear that correspond to “Arbor for Butch.” “Coffin for Head of State” is written “after” the songs of Nigerian musician and composer Fela Kuti; and “Twenty Measures of Chitchat” draws on “conversational fragments.” In one section of “Twenty Measures,” titled “Landscape with Riot,” looting and cannibalism are described as modes of appropriation: “When the house windows were broken, I was one of the people / stepping in, then out again, with boxes and whole registers / of what belonged to me, with dream-swollen jewelry leashed / about my neck, with blood on my shirt and blood on my teeth.”
               The image of the speaker with bloodied teeth, appropriating commodities, appears amended in the following section (“The Imminent Till”) by the statement “Time is the real cannibal.” It is the violence of American racism that is cannibalistic in this portrayal. The title refers to Emmett Till, the fourteen-year-old African American boy from Chicago who was brutally murdered in Mississippi in 1955 for whistling at a white woman:89
            
               Till's body was found in the Tallahatchie River, with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck with barbed wire. His death helped spark the civil rights movement. It inspired dozens of poems (from Langston Hughes to Marilyn ~<br>

Abstract: In order fully to comprehend what constitutes a literary nostalgic experience, we need to define the nostalgic experience. The nostalgic experience can be simplified into a two-fold experience. The emotional content of the nostalgic experience consists of two emotional phases. The first is the remembrance of an idealized image or event that brings immediate happiness and great emotional affection as the senses unite in recreating something past and perhaps even lost. We can call this element
      happiness. It is soon transformed into a more intellectual and reasoning second state, which we can callreflection. When we leave the spontaneity of the first emotion and enter the more reflective state where one is reminded of the passing status of the idealized image or event, what could be referred to as ahyper-memory, a melancholia, is created; ultimately nostalgia ends in the bittersweet. In literature it is possible to use these two elements of the nostalgic experience and create a literary nostalgic experience. One part can engage and thrill the reader into experiencing it as a present. A second part confronts the reader through melancholia and reflection upon his or her own textual memory of the first part. What is gained here is a fictional creation, or substitution, of the nostalgic experience.<br>

Abstract: Patricia Jabbeh Wesley is one of the most prolific African poets of the twenty-first century. With four collections of poetry spanning over fifteen years, and having won prestigious awards and garnered rave reviews, she is the most renowned of African women poets. While she is known to many students of African literature, it is a shame that she has not yet attracted as much scholarly attention as she deserves, especially given the depth of her poetics and the thematic relevance of her works. To my knowledge, the only scholarly article on her works is that of Carol Blessing titled “Exile and Maternal Loss in the Poems of Patricia Jabbeh Wesley.” Jabbeh Wesley occupies a metonymic position in writings about Africa, a continent that has experienced brutal historic traumas, but one that has an abundant will to heal, to live, and to flourish. What is said of Jabbeh Wesley applies in some respects to her native country, Liberia, whose former head of state Charles Taylor was convicted of war crimes in 2012 by a special court in The Hague.<br>

Abstract: The continental status of Europe was at the same time an announcement of its destiny. Fernand Braudel has pointed out, “To draw a boundary around anything is to define, analyze, and reconstruct it, in this case, indeed, adopt, a philosophy of history.”
         
               Europe's self-definition as a continent represented an explicit separation of itself from Asia as “the East” as well as a diminution of Africa as possessing any prestige as a continental landmass. The European apotheosis reminds one of Theodor Gaster's descriptions of the Rites of Filling (Plerosis) and Rites of Emptying (Kenosis) in the ancient Near East. Europe's continental status accorded vigor, vitality, and power upon its spatiality while simultaneously divesting Asia and Africa of any similar virtues. Gaster's description of what he calls a topocosm emerging from the rites of filling is analogous to various aspects of the European ideology. Gaster describes the topocosm thus:7
            
               The societal religious drama characterized in the topocosm could serve as the model for G. W. F. Hegel's historical-geographical speculation in hisBasic to the entire procedure is the conception that what is in turn eclipsed and neutralized is not merely the human community of a given area and locality but the total corporate unit of all elements animate and inanimate alike, which together constitute its distinctive character and “atmosphere.” To this wider entity we may assign the name topocosm, formed (on the analogy microcosm and macrocosm) from the Greek,
            topos, “place” andcosmos, “world order.” The seasonal ceremonies are the economic regimen of this topocosm…. The essence of the topocosm is that it possesses a two-fold character, at once real and punctual, and ideal and durative, the former aspect being necessarily immerged in the latter, as a moment is immerged in time. It is bodied forth as a real and concrete organism in the present, it exists also as an ideal, time~<br>

Abstract: Over the course of an academic career that involved many ups and downs, and many dislocations, SPEP has remained a constant, a place of refuge almost, where I could be recognized and accepted. Many friendships were formed and continued there, and after a time the possibility of seeing friends became a major reason for attending. It's strange that SPEP can seem like a fixed place to which one returns again and again, even though it is a movable feast held each year in a different place. In a certain sense arriving at SPEP each year is “getting back into place,” to plagiarize a well-known phenomenologist, even though we may be in Philadelphia, Chicago, New York, or even (if we can find it) Penn State. Its heart and soul, of course, remains the exchange of ideas built around a common tradition: ideas, texts, philosophers. As important in the history of SPEP has been the appearance among us of some of the most important European philosophers of these last fifty years: We were too late to lure Heidegger, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty to our shores, but we heard Gadamer, Arendt, Ricoeur, Habermas, Derrida, and many more.<br>

Abstract: In addition to indulging in self-righteous indignation and outrage we need to examine our own economic and psychic investments in, and dependence on, state-sanctioned violence, killing, and war. For example, directly or indirectly, many of us receive our paychecks from the very state governments that are executing people and from the federal government that is sending soldiers off to kill and be killed. As my grandmother used to say, rather than accuse someone else for the stink all around us, “the fox should smell his own hole first.” This goes not only for Kant's serpents, those clever politicans, but also and even more so for Kant's doves, those supposedly guileless moralists. After all, Kant' serpents and doves originally found their home in Christ's instructions to his disciples in the New Testament: “Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore as wise as serpents, and harmless as doves” (King James Bible, Matthew 10:16).<br>

Abstract: Thus “I” is essentially a nonascriptive form of (self-)reference. And its target is precisely what is itself nonsortal, nonpropertied. (Husserl's descriptions of the “pure I” and I-pole find symmetry here.)
            
                  I suggest that the referent of “I” is the haecceity or unique essence of “myself” that is individuated29
               per se. I propose that the evidence for this is what founds Robert Spaemann's thesis thatpersonis a nonsortal term. Some considerations may help evoke the basis for this claim. Again, of course, persons as identifiable beings in the world with others are of necessity laced with properties. Think of our public personae; our status before our municipal, county, or state governments; and our identity for the federal government as well as our colleagues and acquaintances.<br>

Abstract: I want to thank the organizers for allowing us to go back to those halcyon days of yore when we were young, the world was ours, and we, the carriers of the coals, were unintentionally about to bring critical theory to the United States. No doubt I played a minor role in that process, and looking back there was no singular event that led to my association with critical theory but, rather, a curious set of happenings that led to encounters, friendships, and a richness of life that I could not have fathomed when I made a simple trip to Germany in 1971. At the time I considered myself to be a thoroughgoing phenomenologist and hermeneuticist. I had written my first book on Paul Ricoeur and was hired to teach philosophy of religion, having had the good fortune of having been a student directly of Mircea Eliade and indirectly of Paul Ricoeur. No doubt I would still be teaching and writing about the philosophy of religion had it not been for the events of the day. America was “all shook up” with the opposition to the Vietnam War, the dilemma of the draft and the reaction to it on college campuses, Kent State, the invasion of Cambodia, the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, and numerous other incidents. True, I had no particular qualifications to deal with those things; none of us did. But I was prone to try. I was equipped by sentiment if not by intellect.<br>

Abstract: Before 1980 men dominated the organization and programs of SPEP. The growth of women's involvement in SPEP was a key factor in what I am identifying as its postmodern turn.
         
               On the basis of available information, 1972 appears to be a breakthrough year for women on the SPEP program: Five gave “presentations” in workshops, and Marjorie Grene presented what appears to be the first stand-alone paper that was published in a SPEP volume. The SPEP volume that included papers from 1976 and 1977 (entitled5
            Dialogues and Bridges—not, you will notice,Crosscurrents—and edited by Ronald Bruzina and Bruce Wilshire) included papers by Joan Stambaugh, Sandra Rosenthal, Janet Farrell Smith, and Marie-Louise Schubert-Kalski. The volumePhenomenology in a Pluralistic Context(edited by William McBride and Calvin Schrag) included papers from 1978 by Mary C. Rawlinson and Arleen Dallery. From the 1979 meeting, the volume published Linda Bell's paper “Loser Wins: The Importance of Play in Sartre's Ethics of Authenticity.” From 1972 though 1979 seventeen women participated in SPEP programs. I do not have an adequate basis to state that no women participated in programs prior to 1972, but I believe that there is adequate information to show that relatively few women were included in SPEP programs before 1980 and that few if any of them directly addressed women's issues. At the same time we can safely assume that a considerable amount of ferment was taking place that set the stage for a major new development in SPEP. If you accept my observation that SPEP's postmodern turn includes organizational decentralization and uprooting of organizational foundations, then I believe you will agree that the feminist impact on SPEP in the 1980s constituted a major development in its postmodern turn.<br>

Abstract: 1968. The first significant event marker, 1968 was the international year of student revolts. I was in Paris, along with many now retirement-cusp SPEP people, experiencing the “events of May.” Similar events reached from Tokyo to Berlin to Columbia and Kent State. Several academic but symptomatic results include the disappearance of tweed and ties but also titles—since then I am everywhere “Don” and rarely “Professor Ihde.” This was also the epitome of the organized protest march, become the standard to this day from Tiananmen Square to Tahrir Square, Egypt. The practices invented then have challenged and often enough, brought down regimes, and youthful democratization movements still repeat themselves.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Interestingly, we have reached a curious state of déjà vu. If SPEP was very much the work of John Wild, and if Wild followed a trajectory from realism to phenomenology, we are today seeing a movement in reverse, from phenomenology back to realism. Furthermore the later theological turn, almost predictable from the implicit theological beginnings of Continental philosophy, has occasioned a turn toward an antireligion, toward a new atheism, a new modernism, and a new materialism, reminiscent of the debates about scientific realism when Wilfrid Sellars presented his views on the manifest image and the scientific image in the early years of SPEP. The new movement has gathered around Quentin Meillassoux's
            After Finitude.
                  Meillassoux, a student of Badiou's, makes two charges. First is “correlationism”: Continental philosophy from Kant to the present is inherently subjectivistic and antirealist and makes nonsense of modern science (the premise that provoked the Alan Sokal ruse).26
               
                  The villain of the piece is Kant's perversion of the Copernican Revolution, wherein Kant reinstated the very anthropocentrism destroyed by Copernicus. Second is “fideism”: when Kant said that he found it necessary to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith, he laid the ground for the theological turn. He invented the God of the gaps. He turned philosophy into a kind of apologetics that delimits the natural sciences and leaves the barn door wide open, through which theology makes an easy escape. Phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction are just so many versions of Kantian idealism under another name, constituting the dark damp soil in which the poisonous mushrooms of theology take root. If the theological turn is where Continental philosophy leads us, the young critics seem to say, that is the last straw, its reductio ad absurdum!27<br>

Abstract: Our third plenary session in 2013 was a new part of the program, the Co-director's Address. Modeled somewhat loosely on the APA Presidential Address, this session was designed to offer the outgoing co-director the chance to speak to the whole membership either about his or her own work or about a reflection on the state of the discipline. Anthony Steinbock, as outgoing co-director, chose the latter approach for his address, though his article, “SPEP and the Continental Divide,” clearly shows that the question of the identity and orientation of SPEP as an organization is as much philosophical as it is practical. Tracing distinct phases in the history of SPEP, Steinbock argues that SPEP's distinctive orientation is its openness to experience. This openness to experience is, of course, central to the methodology of phenomenology, but over the years maintaining this orientation has also pushed SPEP to be open to new styles and currents of thought that go beyond phenomenology. To be sure, this has at times been a conflictual process, as Steinbock recounts, but it has also been one that remains true to SPEP's core animating impulse. However, Steinbock also maintains that this fundamental internal openness and rootedness in experience compels us to resist the strict and dogmatic identification of SPEP with “continental philosophy,” especially where this is understood as the Other of “analytic philosophy.”<br>

Abstract: More than fifteen years have now passed since the publication of Dominique Janicaud's book
      Phenomenology “Wide Open”(Phénomenologie Eclatée)—the sequel to his controversial essay published inPhenomenology and the “Theological Turn.”
         
            There, as is widely known, Janicaud raised the question of whether the phenomenological enterprises of figures such as Emmanuel Levinas, Michel Henry, and Jean-Luc Marion were marked by a “theological turn” and, if so, whether such a turn was phenomenologically warranted. At this point, a voluminous literature over this debate exists, much of it defending the accused against those charges.1
         
            Perhaps as an indirect result of that focus, there has been relatively little discussion of Janicaud's later development of a “minimal phenomenology.”2
         
            To correct this state of affairs, the broad aim of this article is to redirect attention to Janicaud's minimal phenomenology and to show how it opens up new possibilities for phenomenological reflection today.3<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not view the movement from mimesis
      3to mimesis1as arhetoricalmoment. He employs rhetorical terminology as he discusses the techniques that the actual (as opposed to implied) author of a text utilizes in order to conceal “the violence … in the strategy of persuasion” (1988, 3:162). But he abandons this vocabulary when he approaches the reader, opting instead for the language of phenomenology and aesthetics (1988, 3:166–67). In part, he discards the language of the rhetorical tradition because of his limited view of rhetoric's capacity to produce real change in the world. He privileges poetics and philosophy “ontologically” over rhetoric, as Michael Leff has rightly pointed out (1987, 60). Ricoeur valorizes these intellectual traditions according to their ends: poetry results in a cathartic moment that purges old emotions and makes way for new ones, whereas rhetoric results in a persuasive moment that merely crystallizes the preexisting opinions of the audience. According to Ricoeur, these two ends are starkly opposed to one another: “Catharsis must, finally, be opposed to persuasion.” Unlike “all seduction or flattery” (i.e., rhetoric), catharsis stirs the emotions in order to enable “the creative imitation of human action” (1997, 66; see also 1977, 35). However, in the third volume ofTime and Narrative, Ricoeur also admits that the set of effects attached to catharsis is “complex”: “It designates first of all the effect of the work that is more moral than aesthetic: new evaluations, hitherto unheard of norms, are proposed by the work, confronting or shaking current customs” (1988 3:176). Because catharsis possesses a moral component, Ricoeur reasons, it is capable of instructing. Many rhetorical scholars would likely take issue with his assigning such seemingly “persuasive” effects to the realm of poetics rather than rhetoric. Does not Aristotle say that the stirring of emotions is as essential as logical argument to persuasion and judgm~<br>

Abstract: The resonance of Shaw's perspectives on health deepens in his later writings, from
      Back to Methuselah(1921) andThe Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism(1928) toDoctors' Delusions(1932) andFarfetched Fables(1948–50). In them, with an eye toward collective wellness, progressive growth, and enduring fitness, he promulgates interrelated theories of metabiology, socialism, despotism, and evolution. His constellation of superabundant vitality, political and metaphysical sensibilities, and practices of diet, exercise, and dress evokes a Victorian construction of healthiness, understood, according to historian Bruce Haley, as “a state of constitutional growth and development in which the bodily systems and mental faculties interoperate harmoniously under the direct motive power of vital energy or the indirect motive power of the moral will, or both. Its signs are, subjectively recognized, a sense of wholeness and unencumbered capability, and, externally recognized, the production of useful, creative labor.”
            For many at the time,18
         mens sana in corpore sanoconceptualized the healthy body as a vivarium for intellectual and moral growth while others were more radically materialist in positing happiness and good living as dependent upon the physiological self. In any case, as Haley maintains, the “practice of analogically or metaphorically connecting [spiritual health and bodily health] was habitual in Victorian epistemology[,] … the ideal of personal health a way of grasping the proper relation between the self as a whole … and the unity of moral and physical laws which transcend the self.”
            If consistent with their yoking of vivacity, integrity, and volition, Shaw flipped the hierarchy that privileged the corporeal, figuring the intellectual will as the unifying and driving force in health; in his words, “it is the mind that makes the body and not the body the mind.”19

Abstract: For Ricoeur, there is something more originary than evil is radical, and that something is the goodness of creation, as attested to by the Genesis narrative at 1:31: “And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.”
         
               While Ricoeur refrains from interpreting the Bible literally, he does discern in the symbolic story of creation a bedrock affirmation of the human capability for the good that precedes metaphysics and history and resides at the uppermost limit of rational thought. And this attestation is expressly the testimony he chooses to stake his life and work on, even if it cannot be verified empirically. Without such a leap into the Kantian unknowable, without this wager on the elemental goodness of being, faith, hope, and meaning itself, Ricoeur maintains, would eternally elude the grasp of humankind. Hence, Ricoeur can agree that evil is primordial and still believe that something—the good—is even more primordial. In other words, Ricoeur starts from the premise that we are predisposed toward the good but have a propensity toward evil. This means, in effect, that the will, although corruptible, is not fundamentally corrupt. It has to be seduced, led astray, before it falls victim to evil. Thus, for Ricoeur, we do not come into the world as damaged goods; rather, we damage our intrinsic goodness through the imprudent deeds we later enact. To put Ricoeur's point another way, that we have fallen implies that we fell from somewhere, and that somewhere is just our original, untainted state of goodness. Moreover, the fact that we have fallen also intimates to Ricoeur that with effort we might be able to get up, that with exertion we might become upright once again in the ontological sense of reclaiming something approaching our initial moral wholesomeness.37<br>

Abstract: The recent pragmatic-contextual theory of fiction entails the possibility of changes between fact and fiction over the course of time. It is also perhaps commonplace to state that this process can be reversed—that fictional texts may cease to be fictional. The question of generic fiction-to-fact transition, however, is rarely confronted in the theory of fiction. This essay investigates the generic expectations attached to texts that make a full-scale transition from fiction to nonfiction difficult, both culturally and psychologically. “Fiction” is understood here in a limited, pragmatic sense of a work of fiction, a text known and categorized as fiction. The discussion is structured around five interrelated reasons that contribute to the difficulty: (1) the commonness of as-if structures in everyday life; (2) the generic combinations among literature, fiction, factual representation, and narrative; (3) the relative stability of the communal values and ways of checking facts that determine the categories of fiction and fact (the fact convention); (4) the popularity, in fiction, of metalepsis and the theme of transworld travel between different ontological spheres; (5) and the fictionalization of literature in the historical perspective.<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Perhaps the resemblance between rhetorical invention and utopia is best illustrated in Plato's dialogue
         Phaedrus. Plato disparaged rhetoric in his earlier philosophical writings, particularly in theGorgias, where he claims that rhetoric is nothing but flattery; it panders to the public and works only to have power for the moment, by showing off with glamour and stirring up desire. For Plato, rhetoric, like the concept of utopia to most twentieth-century Marxists, was an unrealistic waste of time and a useless dream of escape. But in his later works, Plato changed his mind about rhetoric, just as Marcuse changed his about the usefulness of utopia as a concept in history. In thePhaedrus, Socrates is in love with the interlocutor in his dialogue, a young man who is intelligent but easily swayed by shows of verbal/symbolic skill and emotional power—the very propagandistic techniques that Marcuse would scrutinize in the need for a reeducation of desire. Socrates, voicing Plato's mature understanding of the function of rhetoric when it is used for the betterment of society, tells the young Phaedrus that “the function of oratory is to influence men's souls.”
               For the wisest of orators, who would be the best of political and cultural leaders, the art of rhetoric is one that is informed by long study of human nature but also by a divine inspiration. The inventor in this type of rhetorical work is possessed with a kind of love, a divine Eros, by which he or she leads the multitudes to the good, tempered by self-control. In effect, he conceives of rhetoric as a kind of erotic love that seeks to persuade the beloved (that is, the audience, whether an individual or the social collective in a state). The function of Plato's rhetoric in the30
            Phaedrus, like Marcuse's and Bloch's function of utopia, is to use imagination and emotion to lead constituents toward belief in a fuller humanity, a true expression of the good in human nature.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: This opposition between the static and the dynamic—and the triumph of the latter in
         Finnegans Wake—is modeled by Sheldon Brivic in terms of Joyce's symbolic uses of gender within the novel: “The male story enacts conflict and decline, but the female one may be seen as showing discovery and development that proceed through the disintegration of the discourse of patriarchal coherence.”
               Yet one might suggest not so much that the novel is about gender difference as that it deploys gender difference to symbolize the dichotomy between the static and dynamic historical perspectives upon which it reflects. Brivic admits that his feminist reading of156
            Finnegans Wakeshould not claim to reveal the novel's “ultimate or real meaning”—and if (as he writes) the novel represents “history as progress through literary work” in a way that offers “freedom through the disintegration of stable identity,”
               then it may be that, in order to engage with that progressive idealism, such determining terminologies as157
            feminism—orUtopianism, for that matter—and all of the categorical polarizations they involve might no longer seem particularly relevant. A static Utopia has no need for Utopianists (perfect worlds do not need dreamers); and a dynamic Utopia—a world populated by such aspirants—would have no need for such deterministic, static, and outmoded categorizations. A progressive Utopia must be unfinished; it is not a state but a perpetual coming-into-state in which all of its subjects continue to dream, to hope, to aspire. This work of progress is, likeFinnegans Wake, an unendingwork in progress. It may at first seem incongruous that this Utopia of unceasing movement is also the Utopia of real, material place, but it is clear that one of the defining characteristics of material reality is that it never stays still.<br>

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Another way to clarify what Utopia might be for architecture is to begin with Saint (Sir) Thomas More's (1478–1535) originary coinage of the term in 1516 and the definition that extends from it. First, it is worth considering that
         Utopiais a much older word thandystopia. Nevertheless, because More's Utopia depicts an imaginary island enjoying a putatively perfect social, legal, and political system,Utopiahas primarily come to be associated with all such representations of the same, literary, architectural, and political alike.Utopia, though, contains within itself two senses that when taken together establish something of a paradox: referring to the Greekou(no) andeu(good) plustopos(place),Utopiaconnotes both “a good place” and a “no place.” By beinga good no place, Utopia seems to inscribe within itself the most common criticism of it: impossibility (as a placeless place). Worse still, because no (actual) place can be (or even approximate) an ideal state, the value of Utopia seems dubious at best. Even more troubling, because the ideal state depicted in Utopia requires a degree of coercion, as all social organizations do, Utopia has come to be associated with tyranny and is rejected, which deprives the imagination of a concept for possibilities. In the absence of a crucial habit for thinking about how to achieve the possible-impossible, the culturally dominant conviction that “there is no alternative” has taken on the character of a natural law, leading Fredric Jameson to observe: “Someone once said that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism. We can now revise that and witness the attempt to imagine capitalism by way of imagining the end of the world.”

Abstract: R.A. Lafferty's reputation for rollicking humor and poetic verve, as demonstrated in such stories as “Narrow Valley” (1966) and “Slow Tuesday Night” (1965) belies the considerable theoretical and narratological complexity of his entire body of work. This article draws on the vocabulary developed by Paul Ricoeur in
         Interpretation Theory(1966) andTime and Narrative(1983–85) to explore Lafferty's process of world creation in light of his startling 1979 announcement that the cognitive world of humanity had come to an end. Thus, in this post-conscious state, it was left to science fiction to develop potential replacements. In his writings Lafferty seeks not only to project new worlds but also to reconstruct the world-building capacity in others, enabling readers and writers alike to collaborate toward a future for humanity.<br>

         memoryis indispensable to individual memory. By recounting memories, the individual gains greater control over them, integrating them within self-identity. These functions are undermined by theRepublicanfamily's fear of reprisals for articulating a counter-discourse in theFrancoist New State, and the personal history of Sunta, the narrator inAlfons Cervera's

Sunta resolves this situation through the medium of narrative memory, which effects a retrospective uncovering of memory traces through images of the past, allowing her to revisit an inadequately assimilated childhood from an empowered position.El color del crepúsculo<br>
