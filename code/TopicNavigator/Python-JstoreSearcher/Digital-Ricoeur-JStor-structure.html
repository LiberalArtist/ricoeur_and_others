  Book Title: For René Girard-Essays in Friendship and in Truth<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Williams James G.<br>
  Abstract: In his explorations of the relations between the sacred and violence, René Girard has hit upon the origin of culture-the way culture began, the way it continues to organize itself. The way communities of human beings structure themselves in a manner that is different from that of other species on the planet.Like Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Émile Durkheim, Martin Buber, or others who have changed the way we think in the humanities or in the human sciences, Girard has put forth a set of ideas that have altered our perceptions of the world in which we function. We will never be able to think the same way again about mimetic desire, about the scapegoat mechanism, and about the role of Jewish and Christian scripture in explaining sacrifice, violence, and the crises from which our culture has been born.The contributions fall into roughly four areas of interpretive work: religion and religious study; literary study; the philosophy of social science; and psychological studies.The essays presented here are offered as "essays" in the older French sense of attempts (essayer) or trials of ideas, as indeed Girard has tried out ideas with us. With a conscious echo of Montaigne, then, this hommage volume is titled

From Canto XXIII, 37, to Canto XXIV, 99, the focus is on Dante’s encounter with his Florentine friend Forese Donati.

For Stoker standard time served a double function: it preserved England’s ontological purity by excising the temporally untranslatable, and it provided a model for a total narrative, able to assimilate various classes, nations, and dialects (spoken by the multinational vampire hunters) as well as various media.

Profitable discussion of Italian affairs in this period must therefore make careful distinctions of place. This caveat is, indeed, particularly true for the period following the Peace of Bologna, early in 1530, which brought to an end the Italian phase of the Hapsburg-Valois wars; it marked the conclusion of a long ordeal which,<br>

Those who are poor in spirit, or who mourn, or who are meek are blessed in some enigmatic way, says Jesus, because these dispositions somehow anticipate the salvation that God has promised will come.

  Author(s): Erickson Amy<br>
  Abstract: Every faith community knows the challenges of inviting new members and the next generation into its shared life without falling into an arid traditionalism or a shallow relativism. Renowned scholar Walter Brueggemann finds a framework for education in the structure of the Hebrew Bible canon, with its assertion of center and limit (in the Torah), of challenge (in the Prophets), and of inquiry (in the Writings). Incorporating the best insights from his own career and from the fields of canonical criticism, Old Testament theology, and pedagogical theory, Brueggemann offers a vision of how the community can draw on the shape of Scripture to educate its members. First published in 1982, The Creative Word is now updated and introduced with a foreword by Amy Erickson of Iliff School of Theology.<br>

  Book Title: Structures of Appearing: Allegory and the Work of Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Machosky Brenda<br>
  Abstract: Taking a phenomenological approach to allegory, Structures of Appearing seeks to revise the history of aesthetics, identifying it as an ideology that has long subjugated art to philosophical criteria of judgment. Rather than being a mere signifying device, allegory is the structure by which something appears that cannot otherwise appear. It thus supports the appearance and necessary experience of philosophical ideas that are otherwise impossible to present or represent. Allegory is as central to philosophy as it is to literature. Following suggestions by Walter Benjamin, Machosky argues that allegory itself must appear allegorically and thus cannot be forced into a logos-centric metaphysical system. She builds on the work of Maurice Blanchot and Emmanuel Levinas to argue that the allegorical image is not a likeness to anything, not a subjective reflection, but an absolute otherness that becomes accessible by virtue of its unique structure. Allegory thus makes possible not merely the textual work of literature but the work that literature is. Machosky develops this insight in readings of Prudentius, Dante, Spenser, Hegel, Goethe, and Kafka.<br>

  Abstract: There is general agreement that the term
                  allegoryrefers to a way of saying or showing one thing and meaning another. This very definition reveals the particular phenomenology of allegory, an artistic or poetic structure in which some “other thing” appears in the “thing appearing” without being the same thing. Allegory can be defined more specifically as “the appearance of one thing in another thing which it is not.” Traditionally understood as a structure of meaning, allegory has a limited range, and critics of this mode are correct that it can be a facile, if at times fascinating, signifying structure.<br>

  Abstract: Overcoming Onto-theology is a stunning collection of essays by Merold Westphal, one of America's leading continental philosophers of religion, in which Westphal carefully explores the nature and the structure of a postmodern Christian philosophy. Written with characteristic clarity and charm, Westphal offers masterful studies of Heidegger's early lectures on Paul and Augustine, the idea of hermeneutics, Schleiermacher, Hegel, Derrida, and Nietzsche, all in the service of building his argument that postmodern thinking offers an indispensable tool for rethinking Christian faith. A must read for every student and professor of continental philosophy and the philosophy of religion, Overcoming Onto-theology is an invaluable collection that brings together in one place fourteen provocative and lucid essays by one of the most important thinkers working in American philosophy today.<br>

Ethics is not a matter of moral argument but of solicitation by the other, who by virtue of sheer otherness resists violence. Levinas’s access routes to the other are nonlinguistic: they include the human face, an idea of the infinite that exceeds any description of it, and<br>

  Book Title: The Reinvention of Religious Music: Olivier Messiaen's Breakthrough Toward the Beyond-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): van Maas Sander<br>
  Abstract: Present-day music studies conspicuously evade the question of religion in contemporary music. Although many composers address the issue in their work, as yet there have been few attempts to think through the structure of religious music as we hear it. On the basis of a careful analysis of Olivier Messiaen's work, this book argues for a renewal of our thinking about religious music. Addressing his notion of a hyper-religiousmusic of sounds and colors, it aims to show that Messiaen has broken new ground. His reinvention of religious music makes us again aware of the fact that religious music, if taken in its proper radical sense, belongs to the foremost of musical adventures.The work of Olivier Messiaen is well known for its inclusion of religious themes and gestures. These alone, however, do not seem enough to account for the religious status of the work. Arguing for a breakthrough toward the beyondon the basis of the synaesthetic experience of music, Messiaen invites a confrontation with contemporary theologians and post-secular thinkers. How to account for a religious breakthrough that is produced by a work of art?Starting from an analysis of his 1960s oratorio La Transfiguration de Notre-Seigneur Jsus-Christ, this book arranges a moderated dialogue between Messiaen and the music theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar, the phenomenology of revelation of Jean-Luc Marion, the rethinking of religion and technics in Jacques Derrida and Bernard Stiegler, and the Augustinian ruminations of Sren Kierkegaard and Jean-Franois Lyotard. Ultimately, this confrontation underscores the challenging yet deeply affirmative nature of Messiaen's music.<br>

The two halves are related: the discursive element participates in its metaphoric resonances, with the metaphoric resonances grounded in the discursive ballast.

  Abstract: 1QH
                  aVI 19–33 is generally considered a community hymn because of the formal feature of the reconstructed introductory (or resuming) formula, the formal structure, and some less formal criteria. due to the exceptional similarity between this text and certain parts of 1QS, many see the initiation ceremony described in 1QS V as itsSitz im Leben. This social setting also serves as an argument for interpreting it as a hymn of the community.¹ Others, however, disagree with this prevailing assessment. In her 2004 monograph, Carol Newsom, who does not ascribe the so-called Leader Hymns to any specific leader but rather<br>

  Abstract: The city of Cairo, like all global mega-cities, is entrenched in processes of globalization where flows of labor, capital, and information are re-shaping its physical boundaries, the structure of the economy, and its political landscape.¹ The Egyptian state seeks to remake itself as the “Tiger on the Nile,” a growth engine that will not only sustain Egypt’s regional dominance but also propel it to become a truly global capital, drawing investment for its industry, franchises, services, and new ‘planned’ cities in the desert.

  Book Title: Narrative Criminology-Understanding Stories of Crime<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Sandberg Sveinung<br>
  Abstract: The contributors uncover the narratives at the center of their essays through qualitative interviews, ethnographic fieldwork, and written archives, and they scrutinize narrative structure and meaning by analyzing genres, plots, metaphors, and other components of storytelling. In doing so, they reveal the cognitive, ideological, and institutional mechanisms by which narratives promote harmful action. Finally, they consider how offenders' narratives are linked to and emerge from those of conventional society or specific subcultures. Each chapter reveals important insights and elements for the development of a framework of narrative criminology as an important approach for understanding crime and criminal justice. An unprecedented and landmark collection,
      Narrative Criminologyopens the door for an exciting new field of study on the role of stories in motivating and legitimizing harm.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15r3xt2">Narrative Criminology</a><br>
  Author(s) SANDBERG SVEINUNG<br>
  Abstract: Narrative criminology, with its ethnomethodological influences, has much in common with feminist theoretical frameworks that concern themselves with uncovering the constitutive nature of gendered practices, including speech (Butler 1990; Connell 2002; Stokoe 2006; West and Zimmerman 1987). If narratives provide us, as analysts, a window into how individuals “organize views of themselves, of others, and of their social worlds” (Orbuch 1997, 455), then a critical facet of narrative analysis involves investigating how “women are constructed or construct themselves” within them (Daly and Maher 1998, 4). Narratives impart essential messages about gender, with the structure, content, and usage of language emerging<br>

  Abstract: In three recent articles, John Lippitt has raised important questions about the notions that human selves have a “narrative” structure and that the natural development of our capacity for robust selves (including autonomy and ethical maturity) involves achieving “narrative unity” in the stories that we are.¹ His questions intersect with other critiques of narrative models raised in the wider and growing literature on this topic in the past decade.

  Abstract: For years in my seminar on embodiment I have begun by juxtaposing the work of Merleau-Ponty, Bourdieu, and Foucault, based on the intuition that the work of these three thinkers taken together established the intellectual topology of embodiment as an “indeterminate methodological field defined by perceptual experience and mode of presence and engagement in the world” (Csordas 1994: 12). Writing against the grain of the occasional antipathy toward phenomenology articu lated by both Bourdieu and Foucault, I suggest that taken together their work helps to outline the structure of this methodological field for cultural phenomenology by defining complementary aspects of<br>

  Abstract: To his critics, Bourdieu’s understanding of human agency (upon which I have relied to loosely structure my explanation of the abandonment) amounts to nothing more than a sophisticated version of social determinism.¹ Although Bourdieu’s intention had been to articulate a way of thinking about why people do what they do that transcended the reductive binaries of domination and resistance, his critics have consistently accused him of proposing a model of agency that condemns human actors to the reproduction of their own histories. And it is easy to see upon what logical grounds such accusations rest. For Bourdieu, after all, social<br>

  Abstract: The horizon of contemporary discussion includes a rejection of human nature that stands in tension with attempts to revive the notion within the context of dialogue. Lyotard considers the notion of human nature as a construct of the Enlightenment, a blanched, one-leveled notion that destroys the plurality of cultural experiences. He reaffirms the plurality of Wittgensteinian language games and rejects the Habermasian search for consensus by calling attention to the dissension from dominant paradigms that leads to scientific expansion.¹ Habermas claims that the structure of language implies a decentered subjectivity in a community underpinned by language and aimed at an<br>

A body is the entire material or physical structure of an individual organism; it is also an entity composed of numerous members—of people, things, concepts, or processes—a student body, a body of work, a body of evidence, the body politic.

  Book Title: Music, Analysis, Experience-New Perspectives in Musical Semiotics<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Reybrouck Mark<br>
  Abstract: Transdisciplinary and intermedial analysis of the experience of music Nowadays musical semiotics no longer ignores the fundamental challenges raised by cognitive sciences, ethology, or linguistics. Creation, action and experience play an increasing role in how we understand music, a sounding structure impinging upon our body, our mind, and the world we live in. Not discarding music as a closed system, an integral experience of music demands a transdisciplinary dialogue with other domains as well. Music, Analysis, Experience brings together contributions by semioticians, performers, and scholars from cognitive sciences, philosophy, and cultural studies, and deals with these fundamental questionings. Transdisciplinary and intermedial approaches to music meet musicologically oriented contributions to classical music, pop music, South American song, opera, narratology, and philosophy.<br>

  Abstract: This part reflects on the nature of music. It broadens its definition as a mere description in terms of a sounding structure by comparing it to language and speech. By stressing their roles in action and performance, both music and language in action establish social bonds that afford listeners and performers the feeling of a genuine and shared experience. The figure of the performer who acts as a mediator between music and audience is a crucial element in understanding the mutual relationship between theoretical approaches to music and its possible, actual performances.

  Abstract: The human condition, according to Georg Simmel (1971), could be truly apprehended only by taking account of a certain ‘dialectical circuitry’ which underlay experience and gave human life a sense of passage and progress. The characteristic human experience concerned ‘co-present dualisms’: public and private, rule and practice, antagonism and solidarity, freedom and constraint, rebelliousness and compliance, creativeness and structure. Here were paired phenomena one element of which presupposed the second element which yet, in turn, presupposed the first; one element influenced the second element which yet, in turn, influenced the first.

  Abstract: Jerome Bruner reminds us that narrative is not a contingent, optional dimension of society, but is an essential, ecologically necessary structure with which individuals make sense of social complexity.² We do not need to subscribe to ontological structuralism – which argues that narrative is a timeless structure that transcends society – to accept this level-headed reminder. In the process of structuring social experience, narrative necessarily reinvents itself in each epoch, offering an historically specific experience. Fredric Jameson’s analysis of the novels of Balzac and Conrad is exemplary in this respect. Jameson identifies in the narrative narrative<br>

  Book Title: Narration, Identity, and Historical Consciousness-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Straub Jürgen<br>
  Abstract: A generally acknowledged characteristic of modern life, namely the temporalization of experience, inextricable from our intensified experience of contingency and difference, has until now remained largely outside psychology's purview. Wherever questions about the development, structure, and function of the concept of time have been posed - for example by Piaget and other founders of genetic structuralism - they have been concerned predominantly with concepts of "physical", chronometrical time, and related concepts (e.g., "velocity"). All the contributions to the present volume attempt to close this gap. A larger number are especially interested in the narration of stories. Overviews of the relevant literature, as well as empirical case studies, appear alongside theoretical and methodological reflections. Most contributions refer to specifically historical phenomena and meaning-constructions. Some touch on the subjects of biographical memory and biographical constructions of reality. Of all the various affinities between the contributions collected here, the most important is their consistent attention to issues of the constitution and representation of temporal experience.<br>

As a social construction, time is a narrative through which events and nonevents are ordered in relation to people. Within society, time sets some crucial standards for living. Both individuals and societies try to reproduce themselves and try to keep themselves healthy, sometimes in conflicting ways.

  Abstract: As Parts I and II have demonstrated, Nancy conceives Christianity—or more generally, monotheism—as a religion that is marked from the outset by a secular structure. This secular structure consists not in the proposition of a unique God but in the way this God is present in the world. What is most important in the shift from polytheism to monotheism is thus not a reduction in the number of gods but a rearticulation of the relation between God and the world. Whereas polytheism affirms the immediate presence of gods and believes them to inhabit and organize the world, monotheism<br>

  Book Title: Words of Life: New Theological Turns in French Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Words of Life is the sequel and companion to Phenomenology and the Theological Turn,edited by Dominique Janicaud, Jean-Francois Courtine, Jean-Louis Chrtien, Michel Henry, Jean-Luc Marion, and Paul Ricoeur. In that volume, Janicaud accuses Levinas, Henry, Marion, and Chrtien of veeringfrom phenomenological neutrality to a theologically inflected phenomenology. By contrast, the contributors to this collection interrogate whether phenomenology's proper starting point is agnostic or atheistic. Many hold the view that phenomenology after the theological turn may very well be true both to itself and to the phenomenological things themselves.In one way or another, all of these essays contend with the limits and expectations of phenomenology. As such, they are all concerned with what counts as properphenomenology and even the very structure of phenomenology. None of them, however, is limited to such questions. Indeed, the rich tapestry that they weave tells us much about human experience. Themes such as faith, hope, love, grace, the gift, the sacraments, the words of Christ, suffering, joy, life, the call, touch, listening, wounding, and humility are woven throughout the various meditations in this volume. The contributors use striking examples to illuminate the structure and limits of phenomenology and, in turn, phenomenology serves to clarify those very examples. Thus practice clarifies theory and theory clarifies practice, resulting in new theological turns and new life for phenomenology. The volume showcases the work of both senior and junior scholars, including Jean-Luc Marion, Jean-Yves Lacoste, Kevin Hart, Anthony J. Steinbock, Jeffrey Bloechl, Jeffrey L. Kosky, Clayton Crockett, Brian Treanor, and Christina Gschwandtner-as well as the editors themselves.<br>

  Abstract: Marshall Sahlins has been one of the few anthropologists and certainly the most celebrated to have continued the tradition of argument and scientific reason that has been in large part abandoned in recent years by so many intellectuals. The tradition, if I may use such a dangerous term, consists in finding structure in reality. All structure is underlying insofar as it is not obvious “to the most casual observer.” It takes a great deal of work to arrive at structural understanding, and even then it is always in the form of hypothesis that is contestable. This is the burden of<br>

  Abstract: Since the publication of Descartcs’s
                  Discourse on Method(1637) andMeditations(1641) and Newton’sPrincipia Mathematica(1687), the mechanistic model has dominated natural science, The Cartesian-Newtonian paradigm enjoys cognitive hegemony in the modern world, displacing any aesthetic, religious, or philosophical claim to insight or knowledge. And long before the social sciences emerged, such thinkers as Thomas Hobbes and Adam Smith were modeling their treatises on the structure of political and economic society on the mechanistic paradigm, attempting to capture in human affairs what was being achieved in natural science: theoretical elegance and precision leading to predictive knowledge and causal control.<br>

  Book Title: Life in the Spirit-A Post-Constantinian and Trinitarian Account of the Christian Life<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): snavely Andréa D.<br>
  Abstract: Christians are united in saying that the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. But the unity breaks down when explaining how the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. Life in the Spirit is the first book to engage the post-Constantinian critique of the church with the field of Spirit Christology. Building upon the work of post-Constantinians John Howard Yoder and Stanley Hauerwas and upon the Trinitarian Spirit-Christology of Leopoldo Sánchez, this account provides a framework for seeing one’s Christian life as one transformed by the Spirit. Snavely rejects the characterisation of life in the Spirit as bringing sinners to faith, and instead proposes that as Jesus lived as the Son of the Father in the Spirit, the Spirit also makes other sons of the father in the image of Jesus. This Trinitarian interpretation shows the Christian life as being one of total trust in God with one’s own life, and after death living in Jesus’ resurrected life in the Spirit. Snavely’s account calls for a reimagining of the church and the Christian life in terms of ecclesial structure, Christian discipleship and the Christian view of marriage. Life in the Spirit will not only help Christians to have a better understanding of the place of vocation in the world as witnesses to the lordship of Jesus Christ, but it will also promote unity in the body of Christ based on the actual unity that all his adopted sons and daughters already have by belonging to Jesus Christ’s life in the Spirit.<br>

  Abstract: In his categorial semiotics and phenomenology, Charles Sanders Peirce arrives at a fundamental triadic structure that, he claims, shapes all possible experience and reality alike. The subject—seen as the “interpretant” in a triadic semiotic process—becomes an instance in the self-interpretation of the universe of signs. Thus, perception of reality and reality itself coincide. This can be experienced in what Peirce calls the category of “Firstness.” Following Peirce, the contemplation of reality in the immediate experience of its quality (Firstness) is a phenomenological task. In Peirce’s “humble argument” for the reality of God, the experience of Firstness can account<br>

Like all stories, the structure, which arranges the individual parts so that the story is brought to a satisfying conclusion, has a beginning (Matthew 1–2, the prologue), middle (Matthew 3–25, the central section), and an end (Matthew 26–28, the passion and resurrection).²<br>

  Abstract: In the last chapter, we saw how Barth, in his early writings, responded theologically and practically to the events around him during 1910s and 1920s. Reversing the dominant structure of modern ethics, which attempts to secure human freedom by separating humanity from God, Barth saw clearly that human freedom depends upon God’s freedom to act
                  in relatio. Thus, his task, in these early writings, was not to simply contrast God’s action and our action as the way to preserve human autonomy, but instead attempts to demonstrate how divine agency establishes, rather than negates, human agency.

In every encounter with another human being there is an ethical demand requiring care for the other.² For Løgstrup this is a universal demand and therefore not something unique to the Christian tradition.

  Book Title: Analogies of Transcendence-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): FIELDS STEPHEN M.<br>
  Abstract: The problem of nature and grace lies at the heart of Christian theology. No dimension of divine revelation can be addressed without implicitly drawing reference to this issue.Analogies of Transcendence focuses on the central role that the analogies of being and faith play in developing a solution to the problem. These link God, as self-manifesting transcendence, to the human person as both fallen and justified, and to the material cosmos. Although the proposed solution draws on the work of Maréchal, de Lubac, Balthasar, and Rahner, it criticizes their approach for its underdeveloped analogies that diminish nature in grace's engagement with it. In redressing this weakness, Fr. Fields adapts its solution to the intellectual struggle of our time. This volume examines the origins and structure of modernity, which, it asserts, has not been superseded and is therefore critical of'‘postmodernism,' as well as of some ambiguous legacies of Thomism.<br>

It is his philosophical priority to refuse any transcendent ideas or transcendental conditions; instead, he tends to examine the vital forces of an immanent structure.

Keenly aware of the limitations imposed by a worldview, Eiseley responded formally in “The Illusion of the Two Cultures” to C. P.

  Abstract: The central problem of translation, namely, the competition between faithfulness to meaning and preservation of form, grows more attenuated as translation moves from simple conveyance of information to artistic forms. Generally, in working with translations among European languages, the translator struggles with word choices when one language contains a particular word that denotes or connotes an idea that the other language does not. Then the translator seeks synonyms, or may resort to a phrase that more completely captures the sense intended. The translator may also have to deal with problems of grammatical structure: a language may lack a particular verbal<br>

  Abstract: Because cultures express ideas using more than just written words, textoriented historians can have great difficulty in understanding and communicating the “meaning” of some of the most basic components of experiences past. Past experiences are often measured in difficult-to-articulate symbols rather than words, and Lakoff and Johnson argue that humans tend to rely more upon such symbols when a particular idea cannot be clearly defined by experience in any direct fashion. They write that “we tend to structure the less concrete and inherently vaguer concepts (like those for the emotions) in terms of more concrete concepts, which are more clearly<br>

  Abstract: The only part of Reyes’s quotation that interests me here is the chronicle, its generic nature and its acceptance as literature.¹ The conceptual structure of Reyes’s statement presumes that the chronicle is a genre, and a literary genre at that. But is it really? In asking the question “what is literature?” or “what is a genre?” we are confronted with a complex problem. One could answer the question in a straightforward manner, simply stating that literature is everything that our traditions recognize as literature and that genres are categories of texts, such as chronicles or missionary plays.

  Book Title: Indebted-Capitalism and Religion in the Writings of S. Y. Agnon<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Sagiv Yonatan<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book to examine the oeuvre of Shmuel Yosef Agnon, 1966 Nobel laureate in literature, through a reading that combines perspectives from economic theory, semiotics, psychoanalysis, narrative theory, and Jewish and religious studies. Sagiv outlines the vital role economy plays in the construction of religion, subjectivity, language, and thought in Agnon's work, and, accordingly, explores his literary use of images of debt, money, and economy to examine how these themes illuminate other focal points in the canonical author's work, excavating the economic infrastructure of discourses that are commonly considered to reside beyond the economic sphere.Sagiv's analysis of Agnon's work, renowned for its paradoxical articulation of the impact of modernity on traditional Jewish society, exposes an overarching distrust regarding the sustainability of any economic structure. The concrete and symbolic economies surveyed in this project are prone to cyclical crises. Under what Sagiv terms Agnon's "law of permanent debt," the stability and profitability of economies are always temporary. Agnon's literary economy, transgressing traditional closures, together with his profound irony, make it impossible to determine if these economic crises are indeed the product of the break with tradition or, alternatively, if this theodicy is but a fantasy, marking permanent debt as the inherent economic infrastructure of human existence.<br>

  Book Title: Metaphor, Morality, and the Spirit in Romans 8-1–17<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Robinson William E. W.<br>
  Abstract: In this innovative book, William E. W. Robinson takes the reader on a journey through Romans 8:1-17 using Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Conceptual Integration Theory. Robinson delineates the underlying cognitive metaphors, their structure, their function, what they mean, and how Paul's audiences then and now are able to comprehend their meaning. He examines each metaphor in the light of relevant aspects of the Greco-Roman world and Paul's Jewish background. Robinson contends that Paul portrays the Spirit as the principal agent in the religious-ethical life of believers. At the same time, his analysis demonstrates that the conceptual metaphors in Romans 8:1-17 convey the integral role of believers in ethical conduct. In the process, he addresses thorny theological issues such as whether Spirit and flesh signal an internal battle within believers or two conflicting ways of life. Finally, Robinson shows how this study is relevant to related Pauline passages and challenges scholars to incorporate these methods into their own investigation of biblical texts.<br>

The story of Christ’s humble nativity, teaching, crucifixion, and resurrection surpasses even the Adam and Eve mythos as a recognized and revered narrative structure.

Transcendental phenomenologybeganin the recognition that the world had to be taken explicitly precisely as an overwhelmingly comprehensive structure that remained yet to be thematized properly in philosophy. The most famous methodological “devices” in Husserl’s phenomenology, the epoché and phenomenological reduction, are precisely moves by which the questioning of the world is to begin authentically, against the unwitting and unquestioned acceptance<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, as a prelude to my final estimation of Husserl’s philosophical accomplishments, I relate him and his thoughts to those philosophers who were, in a preeminent sense, his others, that is to say those to whom his thought stands related by its internal dialectic as well as by its own structure and motivation. In such cases, it is my claim that the otherness of others is constitutive of his philosophy. Husserl, in other words, is to be understood by his difference from Kant, Hegel, and Heidegger—three philosophers who occupy this status of being truly his others. Of<br>

  Abstract: In this completely revised edition of one of the foundational texts of network sociology, Harrison White refines and enlarges his groundbreaking theory of how social structure and culture emerge from the chaos and uncertainty of social life. Incorporating new contributions from a group of young sociologists and many fascinating and novel case studies, Identity and Control is the only major book of social theory that links social structure with the lived experience of individuals, providing a rich perspective on the kinds of social formations that develop in the process. Going beyond traditional sociological dichotomies such as agency/structure, individual/society, or micro/macro,
      Identity and Controlpresents a toolbox of concepts that will be useful to a wide range of social scientists, as well as those working in public policy, management, or associational life and, beyond, to any reader who is interested in understanding the dynamics of social life.<br>

Since literary analysis almost always also encompasses formal aspects of works, narratological concepts concerning the structure and forms of a narrative are taken by many as a ‘natural’ choice.

  Abstract: Any cognitive psychology of dreaming must encounter and reconcile two statements: “the dream is a story” and “the dream is imagery.” Neither statement is as obvious as it initially appears, I I because there is no agreement in contemporary cognitive psychology on the ultimate relation between visual-spatial imagery and language. Much evidence and theory supports both the view that a visual-spatial imagistic intelligence rests directly on and creatively reorganizes the processes of perception and the view that mental imagery is a surface paraphrase of abstract propositional knowledge, whose deep structure is accordingly far closer to verbal syntax than visual imagery.<br>

  Book Title: Heidegger's Estrangements-Language, Truth, and Poetry in the Later Writings<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Bruns Gerald L.<br>
  Abstract: According to Bruns, the strangeness of Heidegger's later writings is a deliberate attempt to expose philosophy to what it cannot contain within its powers of description and explanation. Heidegger takes poetry more seriously than any philosopher since Plato, says Bruns. In his texts on language and poetry he reappropriates the ancient notion of poetry as enigma, the impermeable text that resists our efforts to lay bare its meaning or structure. What matters to Heidegger in these writings, Bruns explains, is the rift between poetry and thinking., where each is said to repose in its own darkness. Poetry moves thinking away from philosophy by turning the thinker into a wanderer, closer to listening than to reasoning, more at home with puns than with concepts. Bruns shows this to be no less true of Heidegger's later writings as he examines them for the way they resist conventional methods of reading.<br>

  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): RAYMAN JOSHUA<br>
  Abstract: What are the foundations of human self-understanding and the value of responsible philosophical questioning? Focusing on Heidegger's early work on facticity, historicity, and the phenomenological hermeneutics of factical-historical life, Hans-Helmuth Gander develops an idea of understanding that reflects our connection with the world and other, and thus invites deep consideration of phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. He draws usefully on Husserl's phenomenology and provides grounds for exchange with Descartes, Dilthey, Nietzsche, Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Foucault. On the way to developing a contemporary hermeneutical philosophy, Gander clarifies the human relation to self in and through conversation with Heidegger's early hermeneutics. Questions about reading and writing then follow as these are the very actions that structure human self-understanding and world understanding.<br>

  Book Title: Echoes of the Tambaran-Masculinity, history and the subject in the work of Donald F. Tuzin<br>
  Publisher: ANU E Press<br>
  Author(s): Roscoe Paul<br>
  Abstract: In the Sepik Basin of Papua New Guinea, ritual culture was dominated by the Tambaran —a male tutelary spirit that acted as a social and intellectual guardian or patron to those under its aegis as they made their way through life. To Melanesian scholarship, the cultural and psychological anthropologist, Donald F. Tuzin, was something of a Tambaran, a figure whose brilliant and fine-grained ethnographic project in the Arapesh village of Ilahita was immensely influential within and beyond New Guinea anthropology. Tuzin died in 2007, at the age of 61. In his memory, the editors of this collection commissioned a set of original and thought provoking essays from eminent and accomplished anthropologists who knew and were influenced by his work. They are echoes of the Tambaran. The anthology begins with a biographical sketch of Tuzin's life and scholarship. It is divided into four sections, each of which focuses loosely around one of his preoccupations. The first concerns warfare history, the male cult and changing masculinity, all in Melanesia. The second addresses the relationship between actor and structure. Here, the ethnographic focus momentarily shifts to the Caribbean before turning back to Papua New Guinea in essays that examine uncanny phenomena, narratives about childhood and messianic promises. The third part goes on to offer comparative and psychoanalytic perspectives on the subject in Fiji, Bali, the Amazon as well as Melanesia.

  Abstract: Coming after a long period of civil war, the Empire meant the establishing of a strong and stable power under the authority of the 
                     princeps or “prince.” This regime dominated the entire Mediterranean basin, both Latin-speaking provinces in the west and Greek-speaking provinces in the east. An immense and centralized structure, the Empire was built on strong foundations and accepted by the large majority of subjects. The reign of the famous pax Romana brought security and cohesion to the ancient world and in particular assured a cross-fertilizing of Greek and Latin regions.<br>

  Abstract: During the first decade of his reflection (1964–74), Bruaire elaborated a systematic anthropology whose outcome is the recognition that man’s very existence is indicative of a constitutive givenness. The interesting aspect of Bruaire’s remarkable speculative effort in search of what is distinctly human, however, is that his anthropology is forged within and apart from Hegel’s system. Hegel’s influence can be perceived at every step of Bruaire’s reflection: the circular movement of self-determination, the structure and patterns of speculative thought, the search for a unity between the finite and the absolute spirit that does not obliterate the differences, the role<br>

  Abstract: All religions make cosmological claims, claims about the structure, nature, and purposes of the cosmos, but, like Judaism before it, Christianity from the beginning was of its essence cosmological, seeing human life both as dramatic, centered on a struggle to achieve a proper use of freedom, and as eschatological, receiving its orientation from beyond history. All was viewed against a cosmic background articulated in Scripture and preserved in the liturgy.

  Abstract: The process most often invoked in describing the hallmark of the Axial Age—or, to circumvent tricky problems of timing and synchronicity, of the Axial cultures—is the “discovery of transcendence.” “Transcendence,” however, covers a wide range of meanings. When applied to the distinction between our cognitive grasp of the world and its internal structure, for example, it denotes an epistemological conviction that is entirely neutral with regard to religious truth claims. The Axial Age debate emphasizes another aspect: it takes the religions and philosophical worldviews developed in the Axial cultures to be focused on a transcendent realm, a divine<br>

  Abstract: If the traditional authority structure in Islam had always been polyphonic, modernization made it even more so. “Islam” means submission to God’s authority alone, as expressed in the divine revelation, the Qurʾān and the Ḥadīth. Yet the authority to interpret the divine revelation is not the monopoly of a person, group, or institution. On the contrary, all Muslims, men and women, are required to study the Qurʾān and even memorize some of it.¹ The only source of authority is expertise and knowledge, which the ʿ

  Abstract: Concepts are the building blocks of thought. They take part crucially in various aspects of cognition such as categorizing objects, induction, deduction, and analogy making. Non-cognitivism and subjectivism are two meta-ethical views that make claims about the nature or structure of our moral concepts in moral judgments, concepts that are in part the building blocks of such thoughts. By claiming that all moral judgments are the expression of our emotions, such theories conclude that the moral concepts in our judgments are primarily constituted by emotions or sentiments.

The balance and stability of the pyramid completely depend on the stability of its summit. According to scientific observations, in a pyramid made of sand, one piece of sand may change the entire configuration with unpredictable results. The structure of democracies, by contrast, is not pyramidal, but corresponds to flat and even surfaces.

  Book Title: Metaphysics in Ordinary Language-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosen Stanley<br>
  Abstract: In this rich collection of philosophical writings, Stanley Rosen addresses a wide range of topics-from eros, poetry, and freedom to problems like negation and the epistemological status of sense perception. Though diverse in subject, Rosen's essays share two unifying principles: there can be no legitimate separation of textual hermeneutics from philosophical analysis, and philosophical investigation must be oriented in terms of everyday language and experience, although it cannot simply remain within these confines. Ordinary experience provides a minimal criterion for the assessment of extraordinary discourses, Rosen argues, and without such a criterion we would have no basis for evaluating conflicting discourses: philosophy would give way to poetry.Philosophical problems are not so deeply embedded in a specific historical context that they cannot be restated in terms as valid for us today as they were for those who formulated them, the author maintains. Rosen shows that the history of philosophy-a story of conflicting interpretations of human life and the structure of intelligibility-is a story that comes to life only when it is rethought in terms of the philosophical problems of our own personal and historical situation.<br>

  Abstract: We have been dealing with the cognitive processes that underlie experiences which we have variously termed higher states of consciousness, transpersonal experience, or presentational states. These have been understood as a reconstitution on the level of symbolic cognition of presence-openness as the basic structure of perception in motile sentient creatures. Horizonal openness and the flow gradients of the ambient array are “real,” “existent,” and inherent to the structure of sentience, but would only be realized as such, as felt meaning for its own sake, on the human level.

Translation is not just the stringing together of the most accurate synonyms by the most proximate syntax. Kant’s “Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason” is written with the presupposition that mere (rather than pure) reason is a programmed structure, with in-built possibilities of misfiring, and nothing but calculation as a way of setting right.¹ Since the eighteenth century, English translators, not resonating with Kant’s philosophical presuppositions, have psychologized every noun, making Kant sound like a<br>

  Book Title: Shattered Voices-Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth Commissions<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Phelps Teresa Godwin<br>
  Abstract: Following periods of mass atrocity and oppression, states are faced with a question of critical importance in the transition to democracy: how to offer redress to victims of the old regime without perpetuating cycles of revenge. Traditionally, balance has been restored through arrests, trials, and punishment, but in the last three decades, more than twenty countries have opted to have a truth commission investigate the crimes of the prior regime and publish a report about the investigation, often incorporating accounts from victims. Although many praise the work of truth commissions for empowering and healing through words rather than violence, some condemn the practice as a poor substitute for traditional justice, achieved through trials and punishment. There has been until now little analysis of the unarticulated claim that underlies the truth commissions' very existence: that language-in this case narrative stories-can substitute for violence. Acknowledging revenge as a real and deep human need,
      Shattered Voicesexplores the benefits and problems inherent when a fragile country seeks to heal its victims without risking its own future. In developing a theory about the role of language in retribution, Teresa Godwin Phelps takes an interdisciplinary approach, delving into sources from Greek tragedy toHamlet, from Kant to contemporary theories about retribution, from the Babylonian law codes to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Report. She argues that, given the historical and psychological evidence about revenge, starting afresh by drawing a bright line between past crimes and a new government is both unrealistic and unwise. When grievous harm happens, a rebalancing is bound to occur, whether it is orderly and lawful or disorderly and unlawful.Shattered Voicescontends that language is requisite to any adequate balancing, and that a solution is viable only if it provides an atmosphere in which storytelling and subsequent dialogue can flourish.

The major thesis of the authors was that an empire-like regime with no territorial boundaries was presiding over ‘an irresistible and irreversible globalization of economic and cultural exchanges. Along with the global market and global circuits of production has emerged a global order, a new logic and structure of rule – in short, a new form of sovereignty.’ The empire they saw ‘materializing before our eyes’ (Hardt and Negri 2000: ix) reverted to the more familiar imperial<br>

                  Being and Timeis not primarily concerned with questions of interpretation or understanding. Its driving interest is instead ontological—an interest in the question of the “meaning of being.” Yet inasmuch as the work adopts a thoroughly hermeneuticized approach to ontology—the very focus on themeaningof being suggests as such—so the inquiry into ontology also involves Heidegger in an inquiry into the “structure” of understanding. Although the explicitly hermeneutic focus disappears from Heidegger’s later work, still the concern with understanding, thought in terms of a broader happening of disclosedness—a happening of world—can be seen<br>

Si ce mouvement culturel se caractérise avant tout par l’hétérogénéité, la multiplicité, la remise en question de l’autorité et l’absence de l’unicité et du consensus¹, Babel peut être considéré non seulement comme étant à la source du postmodernisme, mais aussi comme son symbole. Dans un roman incontestablement postmoderne, les liens entre Babel et l’esthétique postmoderne sont mis en scène au moyen de discours sur la problématique de la dualité linguistique, par la construction littéraire d’un Paris fictif et par la structure romanesque.

For the most part, however, Cassirer speaks about the subject of culture in the most general and abstract of terms: it is the anonymous force of the “energy of

Corresponding to a “both/and” rhetoric that precludes an objective truth, multiplicity presents several acts of interpretation, but no one view is privileged as correct. Literary multiplicity is widespread and, according to the Russian narrative theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, it derives from the multiplicity endemic to all language, which describes a world that is “overlain with qualifications, open to dispute, charged with value, already enveloped in an obscuring mist—or, on the contrary, by the ‘light’ of alien<br>

In an age when talk of representation has become increasingly subject to both ideological and epistemological suspicion, mimesis is, for many philosophers and critics, little more than a broken column surviving from a long-dilapidated classical edifice, a sadly obsolete relic of former certainties.

  Abstract: Burns explores the rich narrative structure of the trial, beginning with the lawyers' opening statements, which establish opposing moral frameworks in which to interpret the evidence. In the succession of witnesses, stories compete and are held in tension. At some point during the performance, a sense of the right thing to do arises among the jurors. How this happens is at the core of Burns's investigation, which draws on careful descriptions of what trial lawyers do, the rules governing their actions, interpretations of actual trial material, social science findings, and a broad philosophical and political appreciation of the trial as a unique vehicle of American self-government.<br>

  Abstract: Where does meta-utopian narrative stand in the general crisis of social imagination and the parallel crisis of representational aesthetics? Born in isolation, Russian meta-utopian fiction is certainly not an isolated phenomenon. It parallels the renewed attention to language, semiotic play, and narrative structure that has figured so importantly in the West in opening up new insight into ideological structures. Its challenge to maximalist, bipolar thinking and its argument for the middle ground makes meta-utopian fiction very much of a piece with current social, literary, and philosophical discourse.

While the dynamics of abstraction and experience will continue to guide the investigation, the turn from paradigm to person will bring to light distinctive features of the works of Pound and Eliot. The present chapter, devoted to Ezra Pound, begins with the poet’s tendency to think in terms of certain oppositions—form/flux, abstraction/experience, identity/difference, unity/multiplicity—and then to find constructs that hold together the antithetical terms.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvgsp">The Tale of the Tribe</a><br>
  Abstract: Paterson, as J. M. Brinnin rightly observes, has “an all-of-a-piece consistency on an intellectual level, but on an emotive level the poem is vastly uneven.”² Accordingly, much of the critical energy devoted to Williams’ poem has centered on an explication—and implicit celebration—of the work’s “intellectual consistency,” combined with a nervous awareness of how difficult it is to reconcile that reassuring surface coherence with its unstable and shifting bases. Yet, I suspect thatPatersonsucceeds only when it abandons its symbolic structure, when, in place of the eponymous hero and his metaphoric landscape, the text directly confronts the “delirium<br>

  Abstract: I have been concerned throughout this book to understand the shape of Blake’s thought, both as a structure of ideas and as a warfare of antitheses whose tremendous energy constantly threatens to break that structure apart. It will be obvious that I admire Blake most deeply for the intransigence of this ever-reconstructed vision, which defiantly rejects all of art’s customary accommodations with conventional ways of interpreting reality. But it would be idle to pretend that Blake’s prophetic poems are not, in the end, very strange as well as very difficult. In trying to come to terms with Blake's claims to<br>

  Abstract: The doctrines of Augustine, Gerhoch, and Schleiermacher concerning interpretation elucidate two points: first, the complex frame of reference that was thought to verify the sentence, “I am you,” and, second, the continuity of that frame of reference in a Western hermeneutic tradition. The verifying structure can be briefly summarized. Beginning with a distinction between flesh and spirit, it was deduced, ultimately, from Plato, and, in various guises, it posited an ironic tension between archetype and image, on the participation of the image in the archetype, and on the actual presence of the archetype in the image of likeness.

  Book Title: Between Muslim and Jew-The Problem of Symbiosis under Early Islam<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): WASSERSTROM STEVEN M.<br>
  Abstract: In Part I, "Trajectories," the author explores early Jewish-Muslim interactions, studying such areas as messianism, professions, authority, and class structure and showing how they were reshaped during the first centuries of Islam. Part II, "Constructions," looks at influences of Judaism on the development of the emerging Shi'ite community. This is tied to the wider issue of how early Muslims conceptualized "the Jew." In Part III, "Intimacies," the author tackles the complex "esoteric symbiosis" between Muslim and Jewish theologies. An investigation of the milieu in which Jews and Muslims interacted sheds new light on their shared religious imaginings. Throughout, Wasserstrom expands on the work of social and political historians to include symbolic and conceptual aspects of interreligious symbiosis. This book will interest scholars of Judaism and Islam, as well as those who are attracted by the larger issues exposed by its methodology.<br>

Salo Baron emphasizes the darkness of this terra incognita: “In the first three and one half dark and inarticulate centuries after the conclusion of the Talmud (500–850), Jewish intellectual leadership laid the foundations upon which the vocal and creative generations of the following three and one half centuries (850–1200) erected the magnificent structure of medieval Jewish biblical learning.”¹ S. D. Goitein likewise states unequivocally that “the centuries both preceding and following the rise of Islam are the most obscure in Jewish history.”²<br>

And yet the more one ponders it and its successors in the century, the more its collective voice appears to speak elegiacally, that is, in accents reflective of one of the most traditional and conventional of literary modes. Recently Peter Sacks (1985, 2) has reminded us that “the myth of the vegetation deity” is one of the elegy’s central conventions all of which may be “not only aesthetically interesting forms but also the literary versions of specific social and psychological practices.” Both the presence and<br>

The questions asked are based on what has been accomplished in the past. Natural science is largely incremental. We build on prior work. The lattice of concepts and theories is self-reinforcing. It is only during periods of major paradigm shifts or scientific revolutions when one experiences the collapse of the entire structure.

In its heyday the structure was subject to several rebuildings. Then, from the eighth to the nineteenth century, it endured a long, often painful afterlife.

Of course, Findley’s text gives the biblical story a contemporary twist by mapping the corrupt, ancient empire of Babylon onto a wellknown Canadian city, Toronto the Good, and by emphasizing the permeable boundary between the elect and the non-elect. As the novel demonstrates, Toronto has been tainted by the legacy of imperialism - a legacy vividly depicted by the novel’s central intertext,<br>

Whether it is a question of influence or simple affinity matters little for our purposes here; suffice it to say that we are often reminded of the sententiousaphoristic style of these two predecessors as we read Saint-Exupéry’s text. The most clear-cut manifestation of the style in question occurs in Saint-Exupéry’s highly aphoristic

A digressive structure, the focus on the self (on the narrator-elegist or character-elegist as survivor), and a tendency towards selfreflexivity are characteristics of both modern and late modern fiction-elegies. But where Woolf and Joyce employ self-reflexivity as a trope of consolation and suggest that the work of art is an immortal and idealized product achieved at the end of the work of mourning, Gallant and Munro use<br>

  Book Title: The Sense of the Universe-Philosophical Explication of Theological Commitment in Modern Cosmology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Nesteruk Alexei V.<br>
  Abstract: The Sense of the Universe deals with existential and phenomenological reflection upon modern cosmology with the aim to reveal hidden theological commitments in cosmology related to the mystery of human existence. The book proposes a new approach to the dialogue between science and theology based in a thorough philosophical analysis of acting forms of subjectivity involved in the study of the world and in religious experience. The uniqueness of this book is that it uses recent advances in phenomenological philosophy and philosophical theology in order to accentuate the existential meaning of cosmology as the discourse that ultimately explicates the human condition. The objective of the book is not to make a comparative analysis of the cosmological scientific narrative and that of the Bible, or the Fathers of the Church (in what concerns the structure of the universe), but to reveal the presence of a hidden theological dimension in cosmology originating in the God-given ability of humanity to discern and disclose the sense of creation. The book contributes to the synthesis of appropriation and incorporation of modern philosophical ideas in Christian theology, in particular its Eastern Orthodox form.<br>

In this sense we are not dealing with a traditional teleology, which would imply the assertion in the purposiveness of the universe’s evolution.

  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Archer Neil<br>
  Abstract: The traditionally American genre of the road movie has been explored and reconfigured in the French context since the later 1960s. Comparative in its approach, this book studies the inter-relationship between American and French culture and cinemas, and in the process considers and challenges histories of the road movie. It combines film history with film theory methodologies, analysing transformations in social, political and film-industrial contexts alongside changing perspectives on the meaning and possibilities of film. At once chronological and thematic in structure,
      The French Road Movieprovides in each chapter a comprehensive introduction to key themes emerging from the genre in the French context - liberty, identity and citizenship, masculinity, femininity, border-crossing - followed by detailed, innovative and often revisionist readings of the chosen films. Through these readings the author justifies the place of the road genre within French cinema histories and reinvigorates this often neglected and misunderstood area of study.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter explores a theory of problem-structuring dynamics. It follows the structuration logic proposed by Giddens (1979), showing how policy actors can influence the nature of institutionalised systems of interaction while at the same time being constrained by them. On the one hand, problem-frame shifts and the possibilities for policy change depend on the structure of policy networks. A closed, institutionalised policy network differs from an open, emergent or decaying network. Part of the difference is in shaping different types of policy-making processes, with different capacities for problem processing, and, therefore, speed, scope and direction of policy change and innovation.<br>

Invoking Fabio López de la Roche’s argument that the fundamentalist Christian view serves as the umbrella or atmosphere to this historical moment provides a brief but significant comment on the cultural parameters subtending this mode-of-production model.

Cosmology excites particularly strong, varied and interesting responses, for the subject matter is the structure and history of the universe as a whole.

  Abstract: One might suppose that life’s end is of special importance to narrativist views of the self, even if the specific nature of that import is opaque. Many philosophical discussions of the narrative self touch upon the end of life.¹ End-related terms and concepts that occur in these discussions include finitude, completion, closure,

Despite urban Iraqi society’s abandonment of Arab tribal affiliations (nisba) and the severance of urban Iraq from desert Arabia in the wake of the escalating Qarāmiṭa crisis and the collapse of Hajj traffic, Iraqi writers produced an unprecedented outpouring of literature about Arabness and Arab history, resulting in what today constitute the ‘primary sources’ about pre-Islamic Arabia.

  Abstract: The truest violence of law is not attributable to its errors, but to its essence. As a structure of meaning and a source of norms, framed through general and abstract standards, law has an especial, inevitable capacity to misrecognise ‘the other’ at the precise moment that the other is in most need of its justice. The significance of the other, upon which Levinas speaks with unparalleled philosophical authority, is instead personal, unique, singular, and fundamental in informing our understanding of ourselves, our desires and our duties.

However, as a limitless reaction, the worst violence arises from the essential nature of a limit.

  Abstract: In Chapter 14, ‘Photography and Poststructuralism: the Indexical and Iconic Sign System’, Edge reflects on how the pecularity of the photographic sign sytem, and the study of photography generally, have been informed by poststructuralist thought in two important respects: one approach is concerned with the unique structure of the photograph, its indexicality; the other with the discursive effect of specific photographs in different locations – the iconic/symbolic element of the photograph. Drawing on the work of Kristeva, as well as an original case study on very early Victorian photography, Edge offers some fresh and very interesting insights on the indexical<br>

  Abstract: Broadly speaking, the term ‘structure’ has functioned as a password for many human sciences and provided them with a unified program. Where does the concept ‘structuralism’ come from, that caused so much passion and opprobrium? The term initially had an architectural sense deriving from ‘structure,’ which designated the manner in which an edifice is built. (
                  Dictionaire de Trévoux, edition of 1771) During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the meaning of the term ‘structure’ was modified and enlarged by analogy with living beings: language, for Vaugelas and Bernot, is like the construction that Fontenelle attributes to a man’s body.

  Abstract: The discussions provide a jargon-free account of a wide range of historical and contemporary schools of thought about poetic language, and an organised, coherent critique of those schools (including analytical philosophy, cognitive poetics, structuralism and post-structuralism). Via close readings of whole poems from 1600 to the present readers are taken through a wide range of modernist, experimental and innovative poetries. Paired chapters within a chronological structure allow lecturers and students to approach the material in a variety of ways (by individual chapters, paired historical periods) that are appropriate to different courses.<br>

For Jaspers, a human being is not merely a physical entity, but a being with a transcendent aspect, which is in some sense ‘deathless’. It is the connection between these two aspects of the human being that governs the structure of his work. This book is primarily concerned to clarify and reassess Jaspers’ concept of death and his claim that one’s transcendent self ‘knows no death’.

The Czech language itself, as a network of concepts, conceptual links and linguistic habits, had been remodelled by the forces of the Marxist–Leninist worldview. This was by no means a one-way process: on the contrary, the concepts of ‘people’, ‘folk’ and ‘nation’ which were fundamental to the communist worldview were modelled using the plastic material of the Czech imagination, an<br>

Covering institutional documentation, work discussions and routine talk, it also explores the discursive patterns of control and challenge as struggles for identity occur.

A foundational argument here is Roman Ingarden’s discussion of temporal perspective in

By focusing on a theory’s internal structure as an assemblage of political concepts, this book conceptualizes theories as theoretical constructions, a form of idea entity, and moreover, a form of political thought: a configuration of decontested political concepts arranged together, each conferring meaning on the others and receiving meaning from them.

  Book Title: Traces of the Past-Classics between History and Archaeology<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassi Karen<br>
  Abstract: What are we doing when we walk into an archaeological museum or onto an archaeological site? What do the objects and features we encounter in these unique places mean and, more specifically, how do they convey to us something about the beliefs and activities of formerly living humans? In short, how do visible remains and ruins in the present give meaning to the human past? Karen Bassi addresses these questions through detailed close readings of canonical works spanning the archaic to the classical periods of ancient Greek culture, showing how the past is constituted in descriptions of what narrators and characters see in their present context. She introduces the term protoarchaeological to refer to narratives that navigate the gap between linguistic representation and empirical observation-between words and things-in accessing and giving meaning to the past. Such narratives invite readers to view the past as a receding visual field and, in the process, to cross the disciplinary boundaries that divide literature, history, and archaeology.Aimed at classicists, literary scholars, ancient historians, cultural historians, and archaeological theorists, the book combines three areas of research: time as a feature of narrative structure in literary theory; the concept of "the past itself" in the philosophy of history; and the ontological status of material objects in archaeological theory. Each of five central chapters explores how specific protoarchaeological narratives-from the fate of Zeus' stone in Hesiod's Theogony to the contest between words and objects in Aristophanes' Frogs-both expose and attempt to bridge this gap. Throughout, the book serves as a response to Herodotus' task in writing the Histories, namely, to ensure that "the past deeds of men do not fade with time."<br>

  Abstract: In 2009 I performed a forty- five- minute solo, “Feeding the Ghosts,” in a large theater lobby in Alfred, New York.¹ In the piece, I appeared on a 4’ × 6’ platform, shirtless and blindfolded, and entered into an improvisation whose sole structure was to remain openly receptive to, and inviting of, my personal demons and ghosts. I responded in movement to whatever feeling, thought, and/or image emerged within this structure. While I had rehearsed the dance a few times without an audience or witness, what happened in performance surprised me. Behind my blindfold, an ongoing stream of images unfolded<br>

Even the most adamant realist in, say, engineering presupposes a cultural conception of how scientific cognition proceeds.

  Book Title: Philosophy Beside Itself-On Deconstruction and Modernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Marshall Donald<br>
  Abstract: The writings of French philosopher Jacques Derrida have been the single most powerful influence on critical theory and practice in the United States over the past decade. But with few exceptions American philosophers have taken little or no interest in Derrida’s work, and the task of reception, translation, and commentary has been left to literary critics. As a result, Derrida has appeared as a figure already defined by essentially literary critical activities and interests. Stephen Melville’s aim in Philosophy Beside Itself is to insist upon and clarify the distinctions between philosophy and criticism. He argues that until we grasp Derrida’s philosophical project as such, we remain fundamentally unable to see his significance for criticism. In terms derived from Stanley Cavell’s writings on modernism, Melville develops a case for Derrida as a modernist philosopher, working at once within and against that tradition and discipline. Melville first places Derrida in a Hegelian context, the structure of which he explores by examining the work of Heidegger, Lacan, and Bataille. With this foundation, he is able to reappraise the project of deconstructive criticism as developed in Paul de Man’s Blindness and Insight and further articulated by other Yale critics. Central to this critique is the ambivalent relationship between deconstructive criticism and Lacanian psychoanalysis. Criticism—radical self-criticism—is a central means through which the difficult facts of human community come to recognition, and Melville argues for criticism as an activity intimately bound to the ways in which we do and do not belong in time and in community. Derrida’s achievement has been to find a new and necessary way to assert that the task of philosophy is criticism; the task of literary criticism is to assume the burden of that achievement. Stephen Melville is an assistant professor of English at Syracuse University, and Donald Marshall is a professor of English at the University of Iowa.<br>

This would be true even for words such as “I,” which means that the meaningfulness of my own utterances requires my own absence or death.

  Abstract: Like Talcott Parsons and Niklas Luhmann, Habermas holds that social evolution entails heightened system complexity (

Contra Luhmann’s (1975, 2003) systems theory, Habermas argues that mounting complexity and the social differentiation that accompanies it depend on “learning mechanisms.” In this sense, his position is that differentiation can represent either “evolutionary processes” or stagnation (Rekonstruktion, 133–134, 230;<br>

  Abstract: While the nondiscursive, frequently digressive character of the

By drawing on Warburg's published and unpublished writings and by attending to Warburg's cardinal idea that "pathos formulas" structure the West's cultural memory, Johnson maps numerous tensions between word and image in theMnemosyne-Atlas. In addition to examining the work itself, he considers the literary, philosophical, and intellectual-historical implications of theMnemosyne-Atlas. As Johnson demonstrates, theMnemosyne-Atlasis not simply the culmination of Warburg's lifelong study of Renaissance culture but the ultimate expression of his now literal, now metaphoric search for syncretic solutions to the urgent problems posed by the history of art and culture.<br>

  Abstract: Many scholars and readers of Julian have puzzled over the strangeness of her text’s structure and the curiously recursive and apparently involuted way that she expounds her showings. Right from the outset, she challenges standard interpretative strategies with her claim in the first chapter of the Long Text that the showing of the Crown of Thorns both ‘comprehended and specified the blessed Trinity’ in which ‘all the shewinges that foloweth be groundide and oned’.² This is typical of her dizzying changes of visual and intellectual perspective: both comprehensive and specific; effortlessly moving from image (crown) to abstraction (Trinity); grounding and<br>

  Book Title: The World as Metaphor in Robert Musil's 'The Man without Qualities'-Possibility as Reality<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Grill Genese<br>
  Abstract: Robert Musil, known to be a scientific and philosophical thinker, was committed to aesthetics as a process of experimental creation of an ever-shifting reality. Musil wanted, above all, to be a creative writer, and obsessively engaged in almost endless deferral via variations and metaphoric possibilities in his novel project, 'The Man without Qualities.' This lifelong process of writing is embodied in the unfinished novel by a recurring metaphor of self-generating de-centered circle worlds. The present study analyzes this structure with reference to Musil's concepts of the utopia of the Other Condition, Living and Dead Words, Specific and Non-Specific Emotions, Word Magic, and the Still Life. In contrast to most recent studies of Musil, it concludes that the extratemporal metaphoric experience of the Other Condition does not fail, but rather constitutes the formal and ethical core of Musil's novel. The first study to utilize the newly published Klagenfurt Edition of Musil's literary remains (a searchable annotated text), 'The World as Metaphor' offers a close reading of variations and text genesis, shedding light not only on Musil's novel, but also on larger questions about the modernist artist's role and responsibility in consciously re-creating the world. Genese Grill holds a PhD in Germanic Literatures and Languages from the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York.<br>

  Abstract: Over the last few decades, the concepts of “gender,” “identity,” and “narrative” have received growing attention in nearly every field of academic study. Gender has become an important analytical tool in many disciplines because of the insight it gives into the cultural orders underlying representations. Theories of subjectivity have illustrated that identity is not something we achieve and possess but something individuals must consistently reestablish in various social contexts and through a number of symbolic practices. One such symbolic practice is narrative. Through a coherent structure, and by drawing on familiar forms, narrative both constitutes and naturalizes concepts at the<br>

Author(s): Mische Ann<br>
Abstract: This article aims (1) to analytically disaggregate agency into its several component elements (though these are interrelated empirically), (2) to demonstrate the ways in which these agentic dimensions interpenetrate with forms of structure, and (3) to point out the implications of such a conception of agency for empirical research. The authors conceptualize agency as a temporally embedded process of social engagement, informed by the past (in its “iterational” or habitual aspect) but also oriented toward the future (as a “projective” capacity to imagine alternative possibilities) and toward the present (as a “practical‐evaluative” capacity to contextualize past habits and future projects within the contingencies of the moment).<br>

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: This account of illocutionary force is particularly suited to illuminating struggles for recognition on the part of women who have often entered the public sphere only through the narrative form, in novels, biographies, and autobiographies. Lara is particularly interested in the way in which women take up each other’s lives to make moral claims and to fashion and refashion identities. Hannah Arendt looks at the life of Rahel Varnhagen in order to assume her own identity as a pariah, as a Jew, and as a woman; later, contemporary feminists take up Arendt’s identity as reflected in her biography of Varnhagen to fashion their own. Simone de Beauvoir creates a fictional self to sort through her lived relationship to Jean Paul Sartre, which then becomes the site for contemporary feminists to sort through their own identity and autonomy. This loop occurs repeatedly in what Lara, following Ricoeur, sees as a tripartite mimesis. In mimesis 2, Jane Austen takes up the limited life of the women of her time (mimesis 1) to construct an identity for women that is then taken up again by contemporary women in films of Jane Austen’s novels (mimesis 3) to continue to construct that identity. Moreover, what is told in these looping narratives is the way in which women are and become moral agents. Thus, while many commentators have associated Austen only with Aristotle, with an ethics of virtue, Lara is just as interested in the morality of principle that Austen’s heroines exhibit. Moreover, she emphasizes the extent to which the moral claims Austen raises are validated through the narrative structure of her novels. This is a relationship that Martha Nussbaum also articulates, as Lara notes. For both, it is through the structure of narrative and imaginative speech that moral claims become not only rationally justified but compelling as well.<br>

Abstract: Sheleff identifies four areas where his targets fail. Each endorsed a progressive view of social evolution, concluding that coercion would dissipate with social development. Each ignored available evidence contradicting their theories. Each confused the degree to which law shapes culture rather than reflecting its values or structure. Each minimized their ideological interpretation of evidence. Sheleff’s critiques are convincing and thoroughly supported, though sometimes obvious. His discussions are admirably comprehensive; unfortunately, his lengthy analysis of secondary texts often obscures his more provocative ideas.<br>

Abstract: The necessity of both solidarity and proceduralism thus holds for both distributive and criminal justice. In the end, Ricoeur remains committed to notions that ground the just polity in community and mutual sharing without thinking that these notions require us to dispense with the formalism of procedures of justice. While the latter are not sufficient on their own to create or sustain a just society, while, indeed, formal procedures always presuppose some conception of the good, procedural conceptions allow us to recognize each other as subjects of rights. Although it is not always clear that Ricoeur succeeds in reconciling Rawls and Walzer or Habermas and Gadamer, he does provide a fresh perspective on current debates within his own interesting account of the structure of moral action.<br>

Issue: ci.2002.28.issue-4<br>
Date: 06 2002<br>
Author(s): Vidal Fernando<br>
Abstract: We have witnessed a gradual disembodiment. When Bonnet made the embryology of the resurrected body and the developmental neuropsychology of personal identity coincide, he imagined that the “germ” of the resurrected body was a brain. Voltaire was sarcastic, but not inaccurate, when he wrote that the Genevan “seems persuaded that our bodies will resurrect without a stomach, and without the front and rear parts, but with
         intellectual fibersand excellent intellects.”119Boyle concluded that only a portion of the terrestrial body’s matter was necessary to form resurrected bodies; Leibniz spoke of a mysterioussubstantiae flos;Locke reduced personal identity to psychological continuity; Clarke speculated that the seminal fibers of the glorious body were also the seat of the soul; and by giving this primordial structure the shape of a brain, Bonnet accomplished the tendency to minimize the place of flesh and to replace the resurrection of the body by a resurrection of brain‐located psychological identities. This disincarnating trend will have to be connected to the emergence of liberal Protestantism120as well as to the changes in attitudes toward life and death that marginalized traditional doctrines and beliefs about the resurrection.121The body was henceforth relevant only as a physical basis of the psychological features deemed necessary for personal identity.<br>

Author(s): Lichterman Paul<br>
Abstract: In sum, both Bourdieu and Hochschild examine individuals’ “structures of feeling” as they pertain to social inequality; they move quickly from the individual to the social structure, without asking enough about how participants communicate in groups together. On the face of it, the distinction seems only to be that their goals are different from ours. They link feelings and habits to
            socialstructures, while we, most immediately, link groups’ patterns of interaction to “culturestructures”—collective representations and group styles. Their project may seem to be more about power and politics; ours, simply “cultural.” But we propose that by understanding how people make meaning together in groups, researchers understand more about power, political change, or political quiescence. Analytically, in this article, we have separated culture structures from social‐structural inequality, even if empirically, inequality is almost always weighing heavily on interaction. Butaftermaking this analytic separation, an observer can understand class reproduction more clearly, in more detail. A study of “culture in interaction” offers a crucial complement to analyses of the reproduction of inequality in everyday group settings.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Linguistic anthropology is not a unified field, but it does have some commonly held theoretical views and practices. Many have been consistent over time. Two obvious ones are the importance of learning a field language and the importance of collecting language data, understood broadly as anything from eliciting text to recording naturally occurring speech, for a variety of research aims. As for a general model of language as culture, there is a clear shared sense that language is structured and structuringthat it is a cultural practice both deriving from and helping to constitute society and culture. Linguistic phenomena have unconscious character (as Boas argued) as well as regularities of communicative practice and certain persistent features of reference (Sapir
         1949:104) that function in the production of shared meaning or some approximation of it. Well before the linguistic anthropologists of Durantis third paradigm started thinking about practice theory and performativity, Sapir articulated this view: While we often speak of society as though it were a static structure defined by tradition it is only apparently a static sum of social institutions; actually it is being reanimated or creatively reaffirmed from day to day by particular acts of a communicative nature which obtain among the individuals participating in it.b[1931]<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: To this atom of kinship Juillerat juxtaposes a secondthe Oedipus complexwhose dynamic concerns the nuclear family. The excessive attachment of the son to the mother is disturbed by the father, leading to impossible patricidal fantasies. The resolution of this hyperconflictual situation, freeing the son from both his maternal attachment and his patricidal fantasies, promotes his desire for women outside the nuclear family. For Juillerat Oedipal resolution is preliminary to, if not a prerequisite for, the exchange of women, the structure of which is generated from the basic unit of kinship.
      Voilthe two systems are complementary. The atom of kinship is constituted as much from the interior as from the exteriorfrom the interior through the investment of affect, the repression of drives, Oedipal conflicts and their resolution, from the exterior, through the need for social and psychic exchange and communication (p. 124). Though Juillerat insists on taking the perspective of the different actors in these two dramas, it is ultimately the sons perspective that prevails.<br>

Braudel,The Mediterranean,2d ed., 2:1239, 1242–43, adds references to Durrell and other novelists—Carlo Levi alone is cited in the first edition (pp. 1091–92)—to emphasize “those local, permanent, unchanging and much repeated features which are the ‘constants’ of Mediterranean history.” Braudel even quotes Durrell, “Under the formal pageant of events which we have dignified by our interest, the land changes very little, and the structure of the basic self of man hardly at all.”<br>

Abstract: Second, if articulated structure displaces verbal connective tissue in argument, the effect of such brevity can be a kind of poverty, an overreliance on mere enumeration as a result of which logical relations fail to manifest themselves at all.
            56Recently Edward Tufte, author of magisterial works on the graphic and visual representation of information, has offered a severe critique of PowerPoint for just this failure. In PowerPoint, connective verbal tissue is removed entirely, and oral presentations based on this skeletal writing often display a version of Ong’s “secondary orality” impoverished of information content, in which argument is reduced to mere list.57Tufte’s critique of PowerPoint confirms a distinction between concision and clarity; the burden of his critique is to remind us that sometimesmorewords are required in order for communication to be effective. There is no easy correlation between the quantity of words and the quality of communication, and this mysterious intransigence of language, which goes very deep, means that it will probably never be possible to reduce writing to rules, schemata, or the algorithms that run computer programs.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Bourgeois contends that there are two ways of getting the relation between the enterprise of critique and its grounding in reason wrong. Neither understands the distinction between limit and boundary adequately, and, consequently, both produce untenable philosophical positions, in Bourgeois’s view. The first way, exemplified by Heidegger, attempts to derive the limit from below in finite human subjectivity (or Dasein). Heidegger, fatefully neglecting the essential idea of boundary according to Bourgeois, argues, in
      Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics(1929), that the origin of Kant’s two sources of cognition, sensibility and the understanding, resides in the creative intuition of the productive imagination. Going beyond Kant, Heidegger locates the genesis of the pure concepts or categories of the understanding in the imagination. In fact, in Heidegger’s account, the transcendental imagination becomes nothing other than the primordial time of Dasein. Reason does not set the limits of knowledge. Rather, imagination, or Dasein, limits itself through the existential projection of the meaning of Being as determined by Dasein’s own structure of finite temporality.<br>

Abstract: By extending these ideas on reading to a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur is able to argue that identity is a temporal structure that rests on narrative, as well as a project that is ongoing for individuals during their lifetime. Reading is central to this project because it is only in reading that the dynamism of configuration completes its course; in other words, the passage from prefiguration via configuration to refiguration results in transfiguration of worlds. In this relationship of worlds, it is the person as reader who takes this journey [
         21]. His thesis is that “the process of composition, of configuration, does not realize itself in the text but in the reader, and under this condition configuration makes possible refiguration of a life by way of the narrative” [44, p. 430]. As part of this, a person can be called upon to make an account of herself, and such an account, Ricoeur argues, involves a positing of a beginning, a middle with its highs and lows, and an ending [14]. Through composition, or configuration, this account is dynamic; we can weave different plots about our lives. Ricoeur reminds us that “just as it is possible to compose several plots on the subject of the same incidents … so it is always possible to weave different, even opposed, plots about our lives” [30, p. 248]. But, simultaneously, a life can have the quality of being singular and complete. In terms of a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur best captures this when he argues that “to understand oneself is to understand oneself as one confronts the text and to receive from it the conditions for a self other than that which first undertakes the reading. Neither of the two subjectivities, neither that of the author nor that of the reader, is thus primary in the sense of an originary presence of the self to itself” [44, p. 17]. For Ricoeur, it is through this task that we achieve, by dint of effort, a dynamic balancing of a sense of self, which is, on the one~<br>

Abstract: The subsumption of race under gender/sexuality via analogy—in spite of Butler’s intentions to the contrary and the near absence of race in discussions of normative and radical kinship in
         Antigone’s Claim(2000)—suggests that feminist/gender/sexuality theories have far to go before they recognize the racial projects to which we, particularly the formerly colonized, have all been subjected to since modernity. AlthoughAntigone’s Claimdoes not warrant extended discussion here because it does not invoke the race‐gender analogy, it is worth pointing out that it does make universalizing claims about kinship systems without being sufficiently cognizant of its West‐centered perspective. While challenging the heterosexual imperative of the Oedipal configuration for the family, for instance, Butler suggests a different familial configuration resulting from factors such as migrations, divorces, and blended families. However, the extended family structure endemic to many Asian cultures, and which third‐world theorists such as Ashis Nandy (1980) have argued challenges Oedipal configurations (although not heterosexuality), is never mentioned.14<br>

Abstract: I borrow Min’s helpful definition of religion as “concrete totalities”: “a system of symbols that comprises beliefs, rituals, and practices that embody the collective self‐understanding of its adherents within a ‘plausibility structure’ (Peter Berger), i.e., those objective socio‐historical conditions that render such self‐understanding plausible” (Min, “Dialectical Pluralism,” 590). For the dynamic models of culture that stress the indeterminate, hybrid, conflictual, and contested character of cultural identity formation predicated on sociohistorical processes and an understanding of religion in accordance with those models of culture, see Tanner,

Abstract: Ibid., 279. The title of the eight kinds of metaphors are metaphor of similitude (
            simi
                  glian
                  za), of attribution (attributione), of ambiguity (equivoco), of hypotyposis, of hyperbole (iperbole), of laconism (laconismo), of opposition (oppositione), and of deception (decettione, 298). Compare Aristotle,Poetics1457b7–9, andRhetoric1411a1. The main difference between Aristotle and Tesauro is that, whereas Aristotle’s definition is based on the logical structure of a metaphorical expression, Tesauro considers the rhetorical results of a given metaphor. This is evident in the titles of Tesauro’s eight basic categories. The secondary literature on Tesauro’s concept of metaphor is vast. See, in particular, Mario Zanardi, “La metafora e la sua dinamica di significazione nel `Cannocchiale aristotelico' di Emanuele Tesauro,”Giornale storico della letteratura italiana157 (1980): 321–68; Pierantonio Frare, “Il `Cannocchiale aristotelico': Da retorica della letteratura a letteratura della retorica,”Studi secenteschi32 (1991): 33–63; Pierantonio Frare, “Contro la metafora: Antitesi e metafora nella prassi e nella teoria letteraria del Seicento,”Studi secenteschi33 (1992): 3–20. Also consider the following important books: Ezio Raimondi,Letteratura barocca(Florence: Olschki, 1961), 1–32; Giuseppe Conte,La metafora barocca: Saggio sulle poetiche del Seicento(Milan: Mursia, 1972), in particular, on “meraviglia” (123–24), and on the concept of “sign” in the baroque (156–59).<br>

Abstract: In 1974, in the second issue of
      Critical Inquiry, David Richter, then an assistant professor at Queens College and a student of Sheldon Sacks, predicted that the future of theory would be a battle among genre critics. He had already decided that the neo‐Aristotelians, the Chicago school, had won out over neo‐Kantians and the New Critics.16Thus Tzvetan Todorov and Paul Hernadi, he predicted, would be read, not E. D. Hirsch and Murray Krieger. However, at the same time that he was making his predictions, Denis Donoghue and Frank Kermode were arguing, in footnotes, over the correct translation, meaning, and applicability of Jacques Derrida’s “Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences.”<br>

Abstract: It could also be—if we become genuinely interested, which cannot be taken for granted; all we can take for granted is “our world”—that we adopt a more abstract perspective and, by comparing the other’s ideas and customs with our own and those of people we know a little better, try to understand the “other” confronting us. That is when one can speak of an observer perspective. Adopting an observer perspective is like entering a helicopter and ascending from ground level into the sky—not too high, otherwise one can no longer see the tiny men, women, buildings, streets, villages, and cities, but high enough to be able to survey the whole panorama so as to impose some sort of structure on the mishmash of data: a structure of similarities and dissimilarities.<br>

Abstract: Just about everything that librarians do as professionals carries ethical implications. Matters of intellectual freedom are most commonly recognized as loci for ethics‐based decision making, but the totality of individual and collective conduct is in need of practical, normative ethical structure. What is argued for here is a framework founded on rights. In order to achieve the goal of rights as foundation, processes of deliberation within librarianship must be established. The most attractive form of deliberation is discourse ethics that recognizes the dialectic nature of this (or any) profession. The result is an ethical state that serves the good of both the profession and communities.<br>

Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: In a move that proves Derrida even more heretical than Patočka, he shows that the concept of responsibility resists all final thematization. It is a “paradoxical concept” in that, in addition to seeking to cognitively unify what responsibility means in one intuition, it also defies such an effort insofar as “it has the structure of a type of secret—what is called, in the code of certain religious practices, mystery. The exercise of responsibility seems to leave no choice but this one, however uncomfortable it may be, of paradox, heresy, and secrecy. More serious still, it must always run the risk of conversion and apostasy: there is no responsibility without a dissident and inventive rupture with respect to tradition, authority, orthodoxy, rule, or doctrine” (
      GD,p. 27). With this we have already begun to broach Derrida’s own—radically heretical—take on responsibility.<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: The current return to a historical present teeming with competing temporalities from the past recalls both repetitions from other times and places and what perceiving them meant for social theory. Specifically, this recognition refers to those attempts envisaged by people like Tosaka and Maurice Halbwachs before World War II who sought to account for the spectacle of mixed temporalities in the present. Both, it is important to acknowledge, discounted the veracity of history’s claims to a true time and proposed conceptions of temporality they believed to be emanating from the historical process itself (as they conceived it). The consequence of Halbwachs’s and Tosaka’s interventions was to deprivilege state archives and thus shifted the order of the Hegelian allegory symbolizing the conflict between Chronos, the god of Time, and Zeus, the god of politics who created state and hearth. In this struggle, Chronos, who inevitably devours his own, engulfing all in his passage, is ultimately dominated by Zeus, who creates the state, which in turn conquers time. Just as important is the state’s capacity to transform in history all that Mnemosyne—the goddess of memory—had been able to collect after the rampaging passage of time.
         25It is also worth mentioning that while Halbwachs codified the separation of history from memory and upheld the claims of the latter over the former (that is to say, the claims of time over space) the effort to rematerialize time—yet retain its qualitative character—by freeing it from an interiorized, psychological consciousness was not attempted in Europe or America, but Japan. Tosaka’s critique of what he called “borrowed time,”26referring to history’s reliance on conceptions of time from other disciplines—the physical sciences, but especially the inner time consciousness of phenomenology and even mythology—and his identification of the everyday (especially as lived by the worker) revealed the real source of historical time, the “mystery of~<br>

Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and~<br>

Abstract: The citation as concept symbol is examined from the perspective of three separate levels of analysis. The micro level refers to individual use of a citation to identify past ideas or innovations that have been previously accepted as legitimate. The meso level is defined as a cluster of citations used to identity a group’s contemporary view of reliable knowledge. The macro level of analysis refers to the entire structure of a citation system used to explain knowledge processes. These three levels of citations as concept symbols are then examined in relation to the correspondence, coherence, and consensus theories of truth. The article lays a foundation for considering the relationship between the cited knowledge systems of science, law, and technology and the three theories of truth. In so doing, Van der Veer Martens demonstrates that citations as concept symbols and boundary objects can help illuminate new approaches to understanding specific aspects of citation analysis theory in library and information science and, in some ways, the social networks of scholarly communication within the intellectual domains of science, law, and technology.<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: In conjuring up the conceptual field of such effects, we might turn to set theory and picture a Venn diagram by which narratography is defined as exactly the zone of overlap between narratology and stylistics. Narratography would be shaded in there by the very shadings and incremental gradations of prose in the thick and thin of its own action as linguistic incident. Here emerges, in sum, the heuristic value of a so-called
         Story Left Behindin staging by exaggeration the everyday wake of narrativity in verbal process. Any narrative sentence may have its dramatic prehistory. It need not necessarily be distended or suddenly truncated, not by definition brutal or suppressed or moving or any one thing in particular, and not necessarily longer than the plotted tension of the preceding paragraph or even sentence. But narrative prehistory is manifest as a forward pressure nonetheless. That's why this essay's approach is in fact “narratival” rather than strictly stylistic (whatever that might mean)—and often dialectical as such. And why its instinct for intensive reading comes into sync with the impetus of plotted structure rather than just local representation. And why, further, even in imagining an entire shadow plot, the inflated exception developed in the fictional phase of this essay can still prove the rule of the minuscule. Whole lives, of course, don't usually lie battered, absented, and returned by deformation under the tread of suchfrictionin prose. Broad swaths of plot aside, it is rather in the immediate pace of reading that some aspect or facet of an advancing story is often bent noticeably out of shape. Narratography becomes, in this sense, the tracking of syntax and of the words it marshals for the impinging microplots, one after the other, of their own proximate backstories.<br>

Abstract: There is an intimate link, in other words, between collective memory, public history, and the life of a community over time. Collective memory provides what W. James Booth calls the “tectonic plates” on which communities sit—the deep structure according to which collective identities are forged (and conserved) across generations.
         79In that spirit, we do well to recall George Orwell’s adage that those who control the present control the past. Orwell added to that adage the idea that those who control the past also control the future.80Drawing on just‐war doctrine, we (and they) can ask whether war was entered in a timely way, in pursuit of worthy ends, and with limited means. Wars that fall short of those and other expectations leave citizens with less to be proud of, with less of a record to pass along to future generations as representative of a polity’s history and character.<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Rather than simply reading Ricoeur’s work in chronological sequence to make this case, Hall aims for what he calls a “critical constructive interpretation” that will yield something like a “situated reading” of Ricoeur’s thought (4), one that will better demonstrate this thesis than Ricoeur’s own words do. Basically, the structure of the argument Hall proposes begins from what Ricoeur has to say about the idea of agency in relation to the understanding of selfhood. Hall then moves on to consider the narrative configuration of a meaningful existence that follows from this understanding. He then takes up questions that can arise regarding our practical experience and moral concerns from this perspective. It is the testimony of conscience that comes in at this latter level that brings in the theological perspective. It does so through a discussion of what Ricoeur has to say about the Golden Rule in relation to the love commandment and in relation to what Ricoeur calls a logic of superabundance, one that goes beyond any logic of equivalence. It is this idea of a possible logic of superabundance that leads in turn to a discussion of what Hall calls the economy of the gift and the poetic imperative that Hall sees in Ricoeur’s concept of a theonomy that stands over against Kant’s call for an autonomy that all too easily isolates people from one another. It is love that drives this poetic imperative, and what love calls for is something more than, not less than, justice.<br>

Abstract: Now, the “world,” as I understand it, is a concept one uses for the complex ecology of reflexively interacting environments and the values historically etched into them. As human power grows through technological means, so too does our responsibility and also, interestingly, the world. In fact, our global age is a time of many worlds arising and reflexively interacting around the planet, and this challenges human beings to orient existence amid the possible collision and clash of diverse value orientations.
         34The current attacks on human agency in the name of the fate of Being, like Heidegger's, or nonpersonal social forces, in different ways by Luhmann and Foucault, are wide of the mark. The increase of power expands rather than effaces agency and responsibility; it creates new worlds, for good or ill. We must, then, insist on the work of ethics within the academy since it provides a normative discourse of power and responsible agency linked to the articulation and analysis of the lived structure of reality as itself structured through the interactions among agents and surrounding historically shaped environments. On this point, the religions and the legacy of humanism were right to explore agents who fashion worlds.<br>

Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: In such a charged atmosphere Bazin was reviled as a mystified and mystifying idealist responsible for the excessive adulation of films and auteurs that continued to pour from the pens of mere critics. And yet, as has become increasingly apparent, his penchant for developing abstractions and for elaborating far‐reaching metaphors, based on details mined in close analysis, has remained a hallmark of French film studies. As its collective text on Ford's film demonstrates,
         Cahiers du cinémamight have repudiated Bazin, Rohmer, and Truffaut after 1968, but it remained a place where rich films were identified and then subjected to concomitantly rich symptomatic readings. The difference of the 1970s was that of discipline. Bazin'sQu'est‐ce que le cinéma?gives the appearance of a programmatic analysis of the medium, something both Rohmer and Roger Leenhardt underlined at the time.41The fact is, however, that he did not work methodically through the question posed by the title of his book. He was a practicing critic, and the book anthologized just fifty‐two of his twenty‐six hundred pieces, most of which had been dashed off as daily or weekly reviews for the general public. He may have remained remarkably consistent, suggesting a fully digested understanding of cinema, but he honed his rhetoric to prepare a public for many different kinds of films, not to establish an academic field or even to map out a course of study. On the other hand, Metz and the generation of structuralist‐materialists that looked to him addressed not a public but a subject, one they described as a system that they were determined to explain systematically. And they did so within a university structure, building their articles and books in seminars populated by graduate students who aimed in their own theses to add to the progress they sensed was being made semester after semester by their illustrious professors.42<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: This volume is something of a companion to Ricoeur’s earlier collection,
      The Just(Chicago, 2000), but positions the question differently. Ricoeur characterizes the aim of the earlier volume as a focused treatment of the relationship between justice as a moral ideal and justice as a system of institutions. “In the present volume, the adjective ‘just’ is traced back to its terminological and conceptual source, as we find it in Plato’s Socratic dialogues” (1). The volume is divided into three parts, titled respectively, “Studies,” “Readings,” and “Exercises.” This tripartite structure is one that appears constantly in Ricoeur's work. The essays in the first section isolate the idea of justice. In this initial section, Ricoeur brings thought to bear on the principal phenomenological structures through which the problematic of justice manifests itself: the necessary distance introduced into the question of justice by the imposition of a rule of justice, the relation of passivity and autonomy in the articulation of the imperative of justice, the paradoxical nature of authority, and the aporia that opens between the reflection of justice as an abstract, transhistorical ideal and justice as a historically conditioned set of institutional practices. The essays in the second section place the idea in the context of thought about justice. The principal figures who come into the discussion here are Kant, Weber, and Charles Taylor. The essays in the third section deal with the ideal of justice in the realm of practical, or regional, ethics; Ricoeur’s primary interests here are legal and medical ethics and their similarities, differences, and relations. In each of these proceeding sections, issues raised in the first section are taken up and dealt with at a progressively less abstract level. There is then a discernible trajectory that holds these essays together, one that might be characterized, without too much oversimplification, as a movement from abstract structuring of~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: This passage establishes a pattern that I feel can clarify Coleridge’s handling of the language of prayer. It is one also familiar in its structure from our torn relationship to the moral law: we are constituted as responsible wills because of our relationship to God, but our violation of the law means that we are fallen and finite, necessarily separate from God’s will. Similarly, according to the
         Opus, we are constituted as rational beings by the light of reason given to us by God, but we possess individual, finite rationality precisely because we are necessarily separate from God’s reason. Now, Coleridge definitely believed language was imbued with Logos and even lent it a divine origin given that it, like morality and rationality, marks us off from the animals: “The very conditions and materials of convention, a society of communicants, presupposes a language. … [It is] inconceivable that language should have been given to a mind that did not contain in itself the grounds and principles of language.”51However, just as our fallen individuality demands a necessary separation from God’s will and God’s reason, our speech would logically mark the same separation. When speaking of God or trying to orient ourselves to God, it is not surprising that human language fails to overcome its own determination by the fallen, alienated world from which it proximately springs—even if it may ultimately come from or reflect or echo the divine Word.<br>

Author(s): Kitts Margo<br>
Abstract: At a more intricate level, the metaphorical switch of the ritual actor might be deemed textural, not just structural. Structural metaphorical switches tend to translate between contemporary and ancient models based on some isomorphism of structure or similarity of relationship of parts (structural similarities), whereas textural transformations, according to Fernandez, tend to assimilate ritual actors to new personas based on similarity in feeling tone, contiguities in previous experience, or syntagmatic habit.
         86In this case a simulation of heroic mentality may have been produced by ritual acts such as reciting, praying, blowing Quranic verses into one’s possessions, purifying the body, and so on, which together induced a transformation irreducible to the sum of its parts. As Ricouer might see it, the metaphor was thickened and enriched by a spectrum of images, practices, and stories that attached themselves to the imaginative process when the ritual actor encountered the enacted metaphor, thus enhancing the paradoxical figuration of the 9/11 ritual actor as a seventh‐century holy warrior.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: In this sense both Judaism and communism constitute messianic forms of community, communities that can only articulate themselves in the acknowledgement that their time is indeed
         not now. The source for Blanchot's identification of Judaism with this structure of deracination and disappropriation is clearly Lévinas's own essays on Judaism. Lévinas's own conception of Jewish universalism would also seem to imply the lack of self-coincidence that Blanchot emphasized. For if it is indeed the case that to apply the termIsraelethnically involves forgetting “that Israel means a people . . . which has reached the fullness of its responsibility and self-consciousness,” then it would seem that Israel represents an ideal and not a reality, a goal and not a fact. Yet the question remains as to the relation between this ideal and the Jewish people. Insofar as Lévinas does not in his political writings cultivate the element of disappropriation that is so crucial to Blanchot, his political writings run the risk of indulging the impulse toward exemplarity or self-affirmation of which Blanchot is so wary.<br>

Abstract: There is a history for this reverence for the honeybee in Christianity: going back at least to Ambrose in the fourth century, the honeybee appeared in the Christian baptism liturgy. Virgil's likening of the bee to an immortal soul (
         Georgics4:220–27) was recited almost verbatim when the Paschal candle, made of beeswax and used at baptism, was lit.67Traditionally, bee imagery shows up to characterize monarchy, the church (“apis est ecclesia” [the bee is the church]), community, and labor.68For Dante's period, probably the most important source for bee lore was Thomas of Cantimpré'sBonum universale de apibus(The universal good of bees) (1200–1270), a text that explores, in the Dominican learned tradition, both the natural and moral characteristics of the creatures. Thomas, who closely observes the social and natural life of bees, still maintains that bee life parallels the ideal religious community, for following Ambrose's commentary on theHexaemeron(PL14) and hisDe Virginibus(PL16:210D–1A), it associates bees with community work, with a hierarchical structure, and with virginity.69Yet, although the philosophical and theological underpinnings of Virgil's analogy and Thomas's discussion differ, the analogy remains very similar in that it posits a one-to-one arbitrary equation.<br>

Author(s): Pranger Burcht<br>
Abstract: This being so, the first question to be raised is whether we can pinpoint those mechanisms that keep Augustine's discourse moving, destroying in the process of reading any restful position for the reader and interpreter. In other words, what do the poetical principles look like that are responsible for the Augustinian pulse? Now, it would cause little surprise if I were to contend that the subsequent pairs eternity/time and memory/oblivion can be considered foundational notions for Augustine's thought. As for the first pair, eternity/time, that is precisely what in Flasch's view
      Confessionsis about regardless of the literary and religious shape of the work (which he does not bother to take into account). Things would become a bit more complicated, however, if I were to add that memory/oblivion and eternity/time are also to be seen as constituting the poetical structure ofConfessionsin its entirety. This would, by implication, mean that also the notion ofconfessioitself intrinsically contains and governs the process of temporal remembrance—so intrinsically, in fact, that at no moment can the one,confessio, be detached from the other, temporal remembrance and oblivion. All of them coalesce in an ongoing rhetorical performance as in anunendliche Melodie. As a matter of course, desire and gift are part and parcel of this complex; primordially so, one would be tempted to say, were it not for the fact that we are at once confronted here with a major hurdle in this entire complex, namely, that Augustine's notion of temporality rules out any sequential order and, consequently, prevents one from calling anything—gift no less than desire—primordial. Let us, then, briefly recall Augustine's concept of time as developed inConfessions. Central to that concept is the notion that time is present time that “passes in a point”: “And who would deny that the present time lacks extension because it passes in a point? But yet the attention lasts through which what will be present ~<br>

Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: Yet the structure of theatrical identification changes when the actor returns to the stage as Helen and Faustus are swept up into their erotic union. Then it is Faustus who consumes and is ravished by Helen as an impersonation, and insofar as the audience becomes swept up in the high power of Marlowe's heroic verse and in the actors' ability to project erotic desire and fulfillment, they too become transported by the pleasures of the illusion of rhetorical and theatrical embodiment. The play increases the terror of the pleasure of this identification by juxtaposing this celebration of magical and theatrical mimesis to the theological imperatives of the old man, who appears here specifically in contrast to Helen's conjuration. The old man's theological directives (“break heart…and mingle it with tears” [5.1.40]) remind the audience of their obligation to attend to their faith just at the moment when their inclinations are being most sorely tested by the erotics of the spectacle that they are witnessing. In making the audience aware of the requirements of faith while ravishing them with theatrical spectacle, the play lays bare the dangers of identification with Faustus, whose desire to consider repentance is repeatedly obscured by his absorption in the shows Mephistopheles stages. Yet again and again the audience is invited to enjoy Mephistopheles' spectacles while being made aware that the aesthetic effects of these same spectacles serve to bring Faustus ever closer to the point at which it would be too late for him to repent. Even when Faustus acts less as a passive consumer of Mephistopheles' theater pieces and more as a jester who seeks to “delight” his patrons “with some mirth” (4.1.90), the audience is encouraged to feel that Faustus represents their interests, as it were, since even his cheapest tricks stand as forms of social wish fulfillment. If Faustus and Mephistopheles are able to slap around the pope and his friars despite their curses, not only do they t~<br>

Author(s): Bowman Sharon<br>
Abstract: That said, Larmore’s chapters 1–3 provide many interesting insights on authenticity, which he regards as an “emblem of the self” or window onto the self-relation that constitutes selves (63)—or what Heidegger would have called a clue to the structure of Dasein as “care” (Larmore notes the similarity: 65 n. 5). He has in mind not the technical sense that “authenticity” has acquired in recent analytic theories of autonomy but the existential sense of authenticity as a kind of originality involved in self-realization or becoming the distinct individual one was ‘meant’ to be. He defines this phenomenon to be explained as being “fully or purely oneself” (7) or “fully oneself without taking on the viewpoint of others” (64). Neither of these seems quite adequate as an initial characterization of the analysandum, though, because the self that one fully is might be utterly superficial or shallow, while the idea that “the true self” will “forgo all concern about what others would think” may be stronger than the relevant kind of originality requires. Yet it must be more than just thinking critically for oneself too. It is hard to give a useful initial outline of this phenomenon, as distinct from a particular conception or account of it.<br>

Abstract: This observation reveals some divergence between the biblical answer to Babel and the more universal discussion of LaCocque’s analysis. The critique of Babel’s hubris leads to the covenant of Genesis 12, the “great exception, the miraculous ‘otherness’ that is both judgment and relief for ‘all the families of the earth’” (100). But questions remain. For J, the answer to the loss of innocence in Eden and Babel is the covenant, but in LaCocque’s reading, the text affirms rather the indeterminacy and perennial suspicion of structure more characteristic of postmodern thinkers. In his reading, the tower claims a presence, but “deconstructionism shows the absence of such absolute presence” (154). Such a reading is justified in part by the fact that “authorial intent never exhausts the text’s meanings” (93). While there may be little to regret over the deterioration of Babel’s collapse, the same kind of deconstructive move could be made against the theology of J. The understated theologies of J and LaCocque run suggestively through
      The Captivity of Innocence, but much more could be said about them and how they are related.<br>

Abstract: I am grateful to this international group of scholars for accepting the invitation to engage my argument. My main points are that morality is not a cultural system but a modality of action present across all domains of human life, and that an anthropological approach to morality must recognize evil as an existential category. In other words, the article is neither a study of witchcraft for its own sake nor evil in its own right but a commentary on a particular moment in anthropological thinking about morality. Helene Basu recognizes the intent of my neologistic move toward homodicy and ethnodicy as alternatives to theodicy, which is to identify a starting point for anthropology distinct from those of theological anthropology or theology, in the shadow of which anthropology has approached morality obliquely if at all. She aptly identifies the importance of “concrete, situated human actions” and the “practical logic of evil.” To her question of whether this practical logic is discernible in violent encounters framed in terms other than witchcraft, the answer is an emphatic yes. Witchcraft is not the only evil, just as evil does not account for all of morality. Basu’s example of racial hatred in Germany shows morality as a modality of social action generating personal illness, collective suspicion and distrust, and an atmosphere of injustice. This supports my emphasis on the adjectival quality of moral action and moral interpretation rather than on a nominal morality, and on moral experience rather than on the structure of a moral code. Her interpretive polarity between police and immigrants might also be seen as a triangular one, including the violent right-wing xenophobes as moral actors, if there can be a morality of hatred. A practical contribution of evil as an analytic category in such an instance may be to help preserve cultural relativism while avoiding moral relativism.<br>

Abstract: Learappears to answer in the negative, seemingly because politics—as imagined in the play—would put limits on responsibilities that are limitless. Even though Lear’s regime instills within its subjects a sense of exorbitant duty, the expression of this duty (whether sincere or not) is too narrow. All devotion is directed at the king, who is officially enthroned as the singular other, the one whose plenipotent voice drowns out every other summons. By restricting responsiveness to the royal court, the monarchial structure ofLearwould elide the existence and ignore the neediness of the non-regal other. Moreover, by channeling altruism into the well-defined and well-worn conventions of courtly service, the play’s political system would distance its subjects from the unpredictable passivity that is the essence of the ethical. Court forms are too rigid, insisting upon choreographed behaviors and chivalric displays instead of openness and sincerity.<br>

Abstract: There are alternatives to textual narrative, even if such narrative is crucial and probably indispensable for the generation of a concept of time and historical consciousness (see Ricoeur,
         Time and Narrative). Ritual can be an important way to dramatically act out the past, in a mode of memorizing or re-presentation. Images can focus on constellations and scenes, pointing to and systematizing previous narratives, or even gain narrative powers. On narrative sequences in ancient reliefs, see Mario Torelli,Typology and Structure of Roman Historical Reliefs(Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1982); Holger Hussy,“Die Epiphanie und Erneurung der Macht Gottes”: Szenen des täglichen Kultbildrituals in den ägyptische Tempeln der griechisch-römischen Epoche(Dettelbach: Röll, 2007).<br>

Abstract: As we have seen, for Badiou proceeding from the truth-event delivers no law and thus no form of mastery, be it that of the wise man or the prophet.
            
                  “If one demands signs, he who performs them in abundance becomes a master for him who demands them. If one questions philosophically, he who can reply becomes a master for the perplexed subject. But he who declares … does not enter into the logic of the master… . To declare an event is to become the son of that event.”137
               
                  When Paul leaves for Arabia in order to proclaim the gospel, he is armed solely with a personal event that, nonetheless, provides him with grounds for declaring that impersonal event that is the resurrection.138
               
                  As Badiou puts it, Paul “firmly holds to the militant discourse of weakness”139
               
                  knowing that he must leave truth to its subjective “voicelessness” for only the work of its declaration ensures its continuation. One of Badiou’s central insights is that the militant apparatus of truth can only be achieved by going against the flow of the world,140
               
                  which reminds us that—once emptied of its theological content—the structure of Paul’s proclamation has, for Badiou, contemporary political significance. In this sense, he discovers in Paul a thinker whose legacy contains revolutionary potential even today” and in whose proclamation of the event of Christ’s resurrection as “truth for all” lies the “theoretical basis for continued engagement in revolutionary thought and politics.”141

Abstract: The most essential thing, then, is to mark the well-known solidarity that can be discerned between the substitutive structure of ontology, which refers sensible becoming to intelligible being, and the substitutive structure of metaphor, which refers the literal image to the figurative sense.

Abstract: As Cardwell indicates, Maybeck's design was criticized because of his liberal mix of Greek and Roman sources—especially due to the combination of a Greek entablature in conjunction with arches and a domed structure (Cardwell,
               Bernard Maybeck, 149). In fact, Maybeck was quite open about his approach. In his typescript "The Palace of Fine Arts" he made numerous references to "the Greek" and "the Greeks" as an explanation to certain aspects of his design. His working drawings also demonstrate his interest in the Greek version of the Corinthian order (cf.Figure 18and the capital onFigure 7).<br>

Abstract: In chapter three, “Temporality,” Wu deploys Paul Ricoeur’s concepts of time as an analytical tool to great advantage.
      
            Wu writes that images within the tomb such as star maps and animals associated with the cardinal directions align the deceased with the underlying structure of the cosmos in what Ricoeur would call “cosmic time.” In contrast, personal objects buried with the dead represent a “lived time.” These embody two different forms of time: at the funeral they evoke the past life of the deceased, but once buried in a tomb they cater to the needs of the soul in the present and future. A third kind of time, “historical time,” represented by textual and pictorial biographies of the deceased and narratives of important historical figures, reconstructs his or her public persona. And finally, the frequent depiction of chariots on tomb walls represents a journey that enables the deceased to move through time within the tomb.1<br>

Article Title: The Apparatus of the Dark: Emily Dickinson and the Epistemology of Metaphor<br>
Publisher: The University of California Press<br>
Issue: ncl.2012.67.issue-1<br>
Date: 6 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: This essay argues that Emily Dickinson’s poetry intervenes in the broad cultural assessment of epistemology provoked by the evolutionary debates of the 1860s. While scholars have begun to explore the thematic correspondences between Dickinson’s poetry and some aspects of this cultural conversation, this essay examines the ways in which her intervention occurs at the level of poetic form and is in fact profoundly dependent upon form. Specifically, it analyzes a set of her poems from the early 1860s through the early 1870s in which she uses the dual structure of metaphor to elicit a way of thinking about truth that is aligned with the empirical methods of research that were widely embraced in the mid nineteenth century; however, in the face of an increasingly contingent notion of truth, Dickinson’s way of thinking significantly revises cultural assumptions about what those methods might yield. The metaphors examined here amplify the distinctions between two material entities—lightning and fork, or sunset and lilac, for example—rather than merging them or leaping beyond them to stable, transcendent meaning. What Dickinson plays with is the possibility of a revised version of revelation or truth, one that is not only derived from the observation of material difference through the two parts of a metaphor, but that is more radically contingent on the perpetuity of such dual perception. Altogether, Dickinson’s metaphors are both critical and recuperative, as they contribute to the dismantling of fixed truth while embracing the limited revelations made possible by—
         onlymade possible by—sustained process.<br>

Abstract: Abstract:The fact that classical and early medieval allegorical personifications were exclusively female has long perplexed literary scholars and rhetoricians. Although arguments have been made about this gendering using grammatical formalism for the most part, an examination of rhetoric's own deep structure—that is, the discursive metaphors it has always employed to talkabouttropes and figures—promises to better articulate the gendered bases of the figure. Using analytical tactics drawn from Paul de Man's discussions of prosopopeia, this essay re-examines some of the rhetorical record along with programmatic imagery from patristic writings in order to demonstrate how women theinselves could serve as the "figures of figuration."<br>

Abstract: The article starts with a metaphoric and rhetorical use of the dream concept and then deals with collective dreams. Borrowing ideas from Freud, Durkheim, and Levi-Strauss, concepts are developed to describe collective dreams, for example, the American Dream. I demonstrate that binary oppositions, such as Durkheim's “sacred versus profane” distinction, structure collective dreams. Different forms of symbolic operation are described.<br>

Article Title: Embodied Knowledge<br>

Abstract: The study of teachers' personal practical knowledge is an emerging orientation that focuses on the way teachers' understanding of their world affects the way they structure classroom experience and interact with students, parents, colleagues, and administrators. I argue that several recent articles on this topic are developing greatly enriched models of cognition, meaning, understanding, and knowledge. These models emphasize nonpropositional, pre-reflective dimensions of meaning that arise in our spatio-temporal orientations, perceptual interactions, and bodily movements. To take these experiential dimensions seriously requires new models of cognition and thus marks out a new territory for curriculum inquiry.<br>

Abstract: Buell's view in The Environmental Imagination can serve to epitomize the prevailing
consensus: "Thoreau is often thought of as Emerson's earthy opposite. But it would be
truer to imagine him as moving gradually, partially, and self-conflictedly beyond the pro-
gram Emerson outlined in Nature, which sacralized nature as humankind's mystic coun-
terpart .... Thoreau became increasingly interested in defining nature's structure, both
spiritual and material, for its own sake, as against how nature might subserve humanity,
which was Emerson's primary consideration" (117)<br>

Abstract: Although "story" and "narrative" are frequently mentioned in Voegelin's account of the structure and dynamics of human consciousness, neither he nor his commentators have closely analyzed in a direct fashion the importance of these terms to that account. This article examines their significance to Voegelin's extended analysis.<br>

Publisher: University of Notre Dame<br>
Issue: i261426<br>
Date: 10 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Walzer William A.<br>
Abstract: In recent years it has become increasingly common to speak of the international or global common good. It remains unclear, however, what political content attaches to this expression, and how it relates to more traditional conceptions of the common good rooted in the context of the polis or the nation-state. This article examines the ramifications of extending this time-honored concept to a transnational framework, focusing in particular on the evolving rhetoric of the political common good in Catholic social thought. The first part traces the emergence of the transnational common good in Catholic thinkers such as Maritain, Murray, and Messner, as well as in the encyclical tradition. The second part addresses, from the standpoint of political theory, problems of scope, structure, and application attending the expansion of the common good. The concluding section proposes a multilayered, heuristic interpretation of the common good organized around the notion of a "plurality of pluralisms."<br>

Article Title: Study Drawings in Architectural Design: Their Properties as a Graphic Medium<br>
Publisher: Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, Inc.<br>
Issue: i262141<br>
Date: 1 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Tyler Daniel M.<br>
Abstract: This paper proposes a theoretical foundation for extending our understanding of study drawings by bringing forward concepts from a number of disciplines that are concerned with the structure of knowledge. Study drawings are defined as the informal, private drawings that architectural designers use as a medium for graphic thinking in the exploratory stages of their work. Drawings from the work of Paxton through Picasso are analyzed to confirm the familiar characteristics of study drawings and to identify the properties which account for their role in the working process of design, including their use as a means of inquiry. This epistemological function is compared with certain features of written language in order to propose an internal structure for study drawings. The paper concludes that much of the origin and nature of knowledge in design can be explained in terms of the properties and processes of study drawings and that these terms should be used to evaluate proposals for new media in design.<br>

Author(s): Bachelard Clive R.<br>
Abstract: In a practice environment that unswervingly promotes the systematic tendencies of efficient architectural productivity, to the detriment of architectural creativity, it becomes increasingly important for studio pedagogy to recover and sustain an imaginative engagement with the richness and ambiguity of lived reality. Inhabiting the Chasm is a studio project that attempts to deny the urge to rationalize program and structure and any unchallenged participation in the prevailing apparatus of conventionalized graphic depiction. The project focuses on the simultaneously unfathomable yet familiar reality of two individuals in love. It encourages a perception of the architect as place maker, as interpreter of dynamic human events, and as creator of the settings for the unraveling of dramatic human action.<br>

Article Title: Toward a Generic Analysis of a Classic of the Social Gospel: An Essay-Review of Walter Rauschenbusch<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263714<br>
Date: 12 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Rauschenbusch Walter<br>
Abstract: Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis, viewed by many as the masterpiece of the social gospel movement, has been confined to the dusty shelves of the library. Can we catch no glimpse of what astounded its massive reading public, no glimmer of Rauschenbusch's own sense of the work as a "dangerous book" written in fear and trembling? This article suggests that a generic analysis of Christianity and the Social Crisis might lead to surprising disclosures. Any generic analysis involves the discussion of a group of texts. Consequently this study proceeds via a comparison of the structure of Christianity and the Social Crisis with those of other works of a similar type which were produced between 1890 and 1915. The genre is isolated by utilizing the techniques of Tzvetan Todorov. Certain negative traits are specified which separate the genre from its neighbors. The positive leitmotif of a dual crisis-a crisis affecting society as a whole and the ramifications of that crisis within the Christian churches-is specified as the decisive trait of the genre. To deal with this leitmotif a specific structure was generated by the works under consideration. They provided-to pirate the words of Clifford Geertz in his landmark essay on modern ideologies-"maps of problematic reality" and "matrices for the creation of collective conscience." In designing their maps of problematic reality our authors worked along two separate but related vectors. The first of these vectors was constituted by a historical analysis of the origins of the present crisis, while the second consisted of a systemic analysis of the present social order. Each of these elements of the genre is examined in turn. The mapping of problematic reality by means of a historical and a structural analysis was geared towards provoking as well as defining the crisis. Crisis, once defined, demanded decision. Nevertheless the "permanent basis for action" which Rauschenbusch and others sought could not be groun~<br>

Article Title: The First Evil Will Must Be Incomprehensible: A Critique of Augustine<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263713<br>
Date: 9 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Teselle Robert F.<br>
Abstract: The thesis of this paper is that an absolute origin of evil, arising from the free will of a creature, must be incomprehensible. Although Augustine occasionally acknowledges this point, nevertheless in a number of better-known passages (chiefly in The City of God) he attempts to give a causal account of the fall of Adam and/or Satan. Much of the subsequent Christian tradition has unfortunately followed his lead, and major recent commentators routinely ignore or passively approve of his conceptual error. Augustine offers three unacceptable explanations of the fall, which conflict variously with his own doctrines of divine omnipotence, the goodness of creation, and creaturely free will and responsibility, as well as violating the canons of sound argumentation and explanation. First, his contention that free creatures made "out of nothing" inevitably fall makes the fall seem ontologically necessary (unfree) and thereby lays the ultimate responsibility for it on the Creator. Second, the appeal to pride as an explanation is a spurious causal account, for "pride" is only a synonym for "fallenness" itself and not a possible antecedent condition in a being created good and not yet fallen. Finally, his assertion that the first sin is intrinsically comprehensible, but not comprehensible to us because we are fallen, is an obfuscation masquerading as an explanation, for we have no warrant for supposing that this assertion is true or even meaningful. Instead of seeking causal explanation Augustine should have stayed with his own wiser observation that an evil will has no efficient cause. Theology of the Augustinian sort (which comprises much of the Christian tradition) ought to concede that the fall as a work of genuine freedom is an absurd "fact," an incomprehensible given which steadfastly and in principle resists causal explanation. The concluding section of the paper draws upon Ricoeur's insights to tell why the narrative structure of the "Adamic myth" (which has important p~<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i263809<br>
Date: 9 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Zaleski Charles T.<br>
Abstract: Concluding his "Confessions," Augustine chose as the work's final word aperietur, "will be" or "shall be opened." The oddity of ending and closing a book on a conjugation of to open provokes reflections into the nature of questioning, reflections that open into a larger investigation concerning how Augustine understood the nature of religious belief and faithful life. For him, faithful life is a project of resisting our always premature attempts at conclusion, in order better to see the project of "inquiry into God" as an infinite undertaking, in community with others, organized centrally around reading and inhabiting the thought world of the Scriptures. The "Confessions" turns out to be a story of Augustine learning to ask questions in the right way and to accept the dynamic of questioning as an energy moving him toward God. Appreciating the "Confessions" as a story of "learning to ask questions" illuminates not only the work's content but also its structure, most notably the odd change of tone and topic from books 1-9 to books 10-13.<br>

Abstract: Un nombre important d'éducateurs se sont récemment faits critiques d'un mode courant de pensée qui se veut instrumental et rationnel, lequel mode prédomine lorsqu'il s'agit de recherche dans le domaine des programmes d'études. On a mentionné que la phénoménologie et l'herméneutique pourraient fournir d'autres paradigmes de recherche, mais jusqu'ici les progrès se font attendre en ce sens. Dans cet article, on tente de relier certains aspects de la méthode phénoménologique à la littérature pédagogique de l' "Ecole d'Utrecht." L'accent est mis sur la signification de l'observation pédagogique. Des descriptions phénoménologiques peuvent contribuer à améliorer les pratiques éducatives même si ces descriptions ne fournissent pas de schémas de cueillette de données basés sur le comportement, sur des habiletés et des techniques d'observation. L'aspect pratique d'une description réside plutôt dans la contribution qu'elle apporte à la structure profonde de notre compréhension de l'objet.<br>

Publisher: Butterworths Scientific Limited<br>
Issue: i272292<br>
Date: 1 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Llosa Roberto<br>
Abstract: Notre analyse repose sur deux hypothèses générales complémentaires. La première hypothèse affirme l'existence non pas d'une crise de la pensée politique mais de trois situations critiques auxquelles doit faire face le pensée politique et qui déterminent des formes d'incertitude spécifiques, irréductibles les unes aux autres. La deuxième hypothèse affirme que l'intelligibilité des crises que connaît la pensée politique passe par celle des conditions politiques dans lesquelles s'exerce cette pensée. Pour préciser ces deux hypothèses nous faisons appel à un modèle construit à partir de la structure d'une action. Trois formes d'incertitude sont ainsi repérées: une incertitude concernant les valeurs, une incertitude concernant l'état des choses et une incertitude portant sur les voies d'action. Transposées sur le plan ou la dimension de la structure sociale, ces trois formes d'incertitude sont à saisir et à examiner respectivement comme crise au niveau du système de légitimation et de motivation, comme crise au niveau du système organisationnel ou des institutions et comme crise au niveau des stratégies ou système "opérationnel". Nous localisons la première forme de crise dans les sociétés du capitalisme "central", la deuxième dans les formations sociales socialistes et la troisième dans les sociétés du capitalisme "périphérique". A partir d'une analyse des conditions politiques qui ont rendu possible l'émergence de ces formes spécifiques de crise nous essayons de déterminer au moins certaines conditions nécessaires--mais non pas suffisantes--de leur dépassement. /// Two general complementary hypotheses underlie this analysis. The first contends that, although political science does not confront a crisis, it faces three critical challenges giving rise to uncertainty in the discipline. The second hypothesis asserts that to understand the present challenges testing political theory, it is necessary to relate the latter to the prevailing political context. To clarify the tw~<br>

Abstract: "The mirror stage is a drama whose internal thrust is precipitated from insuffi-
ciency to anticipation - and which manufactures for the subject, caught up in the lure of
spatial identification [with its specular image], the succession of phantasies that extends
from a fragmented body-image to a form of its totality that I shall call orthopaedic - and,
lastly, to the assumption of the armour of an alienating identity, which will mark with its
rigid structure the subject's entire mental development" (p. 4)<br>

Issue: i303097<br>

Author(s): Wellek Chanita<br>
Abstract: This paper discusses the relationship between the Interaction theory of metaphor and Gestalt psychology. Interaction theory views the metaphor as a whole (gestalt), created by an interaction between its primary and secondary subjects. Moreover, this paper develops Interaction theory to require a full contextual analysis of the poetic metaphor embedded within its poetic text. We illustrate this Gestalt-Interaction approach by focusing on a particularly complex poetic text having multiple metaphors (Dylan Thomas's Sonnet VII, from his "Altarwise by Owl-Light" sequence). A representation employing primary semantic fields clarifies the underlying structure of the metaphor chain comprising the text.<br>

Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
Issue: i308701<br>
Date: 7 1, 1977<br>
Author(s): Dittmer Lowell<br>
Abstract: The concept of political culture embraces some of the most basic, perennially fascinating concerns in behavioral political science; because of certain ambiguities in its theoretical formulation, however, there has been a tendency for the term to grow fuzzy with continued use. Its connection with related concepts, such as political psychology, political structure, and political language, has remained unclear, with the result that political culture has been difficult to isolate as an independent variable. Thus it has come to occupy a position on the periphery of politics, and is usually presumed to reinforce the status quo. This paper re-examines previous formulations of the concept and proposes a theoretical synthesis. The analytical framework is derived from semiological theory, a branch of science specifically designed for the analysis of meanings. The central variable is the political symbol. By analyzing the interactions of political symbols within a comprehensive semiological framework, the traditional concerns of political culture can be accommodated in a more precise and systematic way.<br>

Abstract: Refiriéndose a Jean-Jacques Rousseau en "From/of Blindness to the Supplement", Derrida
ofrece varias aproximaciones a la noción del suplemento tales como: "The supplement adds
itself, it is a surplus, a plenitude enriching another plenitude, the fullest measure of presence.
It cumulates and accumulates presence. It is thus that art, techné, image, representation, con-
vention, etc., come as supplements to nature... But the supplement supplements. It adds only
to replace. It intervenes or insinuates itself in-the-place-of; if it fills, it is as if one fills a void.
If it represents and makes an image, it is by the anterior default of a presence. Compensatory
[suppléant] and victorious, the supplement is an adjunct, a subaltern instance which takes-
(the)-place [tient-lieu]'. As a substitute, it is not simply added to the positivity of a presence,
it produces no relief, its place is assigned in the structure by the mark of an emptiness.
Somewhere, something can be filled up of itself, can accomplish itself, only by allowing itself
to be filled through sign and proxy. The sign is always the supplement of the thing itself.

Article Title: A Coincidence of Metaphors: Notes on Two Modes of Text Building in the Indonesian Novel "Surabaya"<br>
Publisher: The Association for Asian Studies, Inc.<br>
Issue: i309685<br>
Date: 8 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Jeff<br>
Abstract: This article suggests that two distinct modes of text-building constraints coincide in the Indonesian novel "Surabaya." The first set of constraints consists of narrative functions that shape sentence-level grammar within the story; the second level of text-building constraints shapes the thematic structure of the story. The author argues that, unlike its narrative structure, which is bound by the linearity of time, the thematic structure, of "Surabaya" is defined by a hierarchy of "heavier" and "lighter" themes, the "heavier" themes being evoked more often than are the "lighter" themes. He suggests that heaviness of theme is a strategy of text building found in classical Malaysian (Hikayat) texts, gamelan orchestra musical organization, and in calendric reckoning in much of Indonesia. He argues, in sum, for a method of writing that encourages grammatical description from two or more perspectives. "Binocular vision," to use Gregory Bateson's words, is necessary in writing to provide a more honest, richer description of a text than a single mode of grammatical description can provide; it makes available to readers more than one means of access to the text.<br>

Abstract: L'allégorie de la Religion (embl. XXXIX/XXXV), déjà évoquée dans la note 31, va aussi
dans le sens de cette hypothèse: l'autonomie du texte par rapport à l'image est ici prou-
vée, si besoin était, par le fait que ce poème figure dans les Poëmata sous le titre «Vera
Religio» depuis 1569 et que ce n'est que dans l'édition de 1599 qu'il disparaît définiti-
vement de la section intitulée «Icones» pour ne se trouver désormais plus que dans les
Emblemata (F. Gardy, op. cit., p. 13). Ce même emblème (texte français, avec gravure)
figure déjà dans certaines éditions de la Confession de la foy chrestienne de 1561 (cf.
F. Gardy, ibid., p. 65 ; A. Saunders, op. cit., p. 242; Dufour (Alain), «Théodore de Bèze»,
Histoire littéraire de la France, t. XLII, Paris, 1995-2002, pp. 347-350). A noter que la
structure de cet emblème diffère fortement de la plupart des autres : un jeu de questions-
réponses présenté sous forme de dialogue fictif entre un je et Religion permet d'éviter
toute lourdeur descriptive (cf. également l'emblème XXVIII/XXVI et A. M. Saunders,
art. cit., pp. 63-64).<br>

Publisher: Society for Utopian Studies<br>
Issue: i20719896<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Jenson Michael<br>
Abstract: A recurrent misconception about the concept of utopia fails to realize fully that its essential endeavor constitutes a speculative act involving the distribution of power and resources. Consequently, utopian desire is closely linked to structures of power and can be manipulated by interests in positions of influence within these structures. It is these connections to the machinations of power that bring utopian visions their potential for social/political influence. However, these same types of links also provide avenues for these conceptions to be cynically influenced in ways that can usurp individual autonomy. The role of power and utopia can be analyzed in the formative process of a specific social structure as well as in their contribution to the conception of a common heritage or history. The "historical perspective" often serves as the foundation for the production of propaganda seeking to capture the imagination of a populace either to instigate positive social change or to legitimize an oppressive regime. Through the lens of Collingwood's philosophy of history, this article investigates the connection that the "historical consciousness" has to the attributes of power and utopia as well as the role that this relationship plays in the formation of a collective mentality. In short, it studies the essential characteristics of the bond between individuals that allows a community or collective to perpetuate itself. It also explores how the attributes of power and utopia can use latent historical perceptions to strengthen the process of ideological integration that underlies any social action or formal structure of authority.<br>

Article Title: Analysing Discourse. An Approach From the Sociology of Knowledge<br>
Publisher: Center for Historical Social Research / Zentrum für Historische Sozialforschung<br>
Issue: i20762120<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Keller Reiner<br>
Abstract: The contribution outlines a research programme which I have coined the "sociology of knowledge approach to discourse" (Wissenssoziologische Diskursanalyse). This approach to discourse integrates important insights of FOUCAULT's theory of discourse into the interpretative paradigm in the social sciences, especially the "German" approach of hermeneutic sociology of knowledge (Hermeneutische Wissenssoziologie). Accordingly, in this approach discourses are considered as "structured and structuring structures" which shape social practices of enunciation. Unlike some Foucauldian approaches, this form of discourse analysis recognises the importance of socially constituted actors in the social production and circulation of knowledge. Furthermore, it combines research questions related to the concept of "discourse" with the methodical toolbox of qualitative social research. Going beyond questions of language in use, "the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse" (Wissenssoziologische Diskursanalyse) addresses sociological interests, the analyses of social relations and politics of knowledge as well as the discursive construction of reality as an empirical ("material") process. For empirical research on discourse the approach proposes the use of analytical concepts from the sociology of knowledge tradition, such as interpretative schemes or frames (Deutungsmuster), "classifications", "phenomenal structure" (Phänomenstruktur), "narrative structure", "dispositif" etc., and the use of the methodological strategies of "grounded theory".<br>

Abstract: Actual efforts to use Michel FOUCAULT's ideas about discourse for empirical research induce a linguistic bias which misses FOUCAULT's interests in power/knowledge. Against such tendencies, this article argues for a grounding of discourse theory and empirical discourse research in the sociology of knowledge, especially in the German-based Hermeneutische Wissenssoziologie, which follows the BERGER/LUCKMANN approach to knowledge. For the purposes of empirical discourse research on knowledge, the author first considers the interpretative dimension of research. Then, some conceptual tools for knowledge analysis are presented (interpretative scheme, classification, phenomenal structure, narrative structure). Third, drawing on grounded theory and sequential analysis, concrete work on texts is discussed. Finally, the article insists that discourse research should not be reduced to the analysis of spoken or written texts. Instead, different kinds of materiality—for example as dispositifs—have to be considered.<br>

Abstract: Marieluise Fleißer's Mehlreisende Frieda Geier is regarded by now as one of the most remarkable novels written during the period of the Weimar Republic. However, both at the time of its publication and in subsequent scholarship, the structure of the work was criticized for being haphazard and ineffective. Responding to this criticism, this study reveals that Fleißer simply employed a set of specifically modern narrative strategies to organize her novel, such as seasonal changes, light-dark contrasts or repetitive patterns. This unusual technique lends the text a paradoxical "dissonant unity" and secures its place among the avant-garde of late 1920s literature.<br>

Abstract: The English translation of Habermas's The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere converges with the revival of the "political culture concept" in the social sciences. Surprisingly, Habermas's account of the Western bourgeois public sphere has much in common with the original political culture concept associated with Parsonian modernization theory in the 1950s and 1960s. In both cases, the concept of political culture is used in a way that is neither political nor cultural. Explaining this peculiarity is the central problem addressed in this article and its companion piece, which appeared in Sociological Theory, volume 3, number 2 (1995). I hypothesize that this is the case because the concept itself is embedded in an historically constituted political culture (here called a conceptual network)-a structured web of conceptual relationships that combine into Anglo-American citizenship theory. The method of an historical sociology of concept formation is used to analyze historically and empirically the internal constraints and dynamics of this conceptual network. The method draws from new work in cultural history and sociology, social studies, and network, narrative, and institutional analysis. This research yields three empirical findings: this conceptual network has a narrative structure, here called the Anglo-American citizenship story; this narrative is grafted onto an epistemology of social naturalism; and these elements combine in a metanarrative that continues to constrain empirical research in political sociology.<br>

Abstract: Though the process of meaning construction is widely recognized to be a crucial factor in the mobilization, unfolding, and outcomes of social movements, the conditions and mechanisms that allow meaning construction and cultural transformation are often misconceptualized and/or underanalyzed. Following a "tool kit" perspective on culture, dominant social movement theory locates meaning only as it is embodied in concrete social practices. Meaning construction from this perspective is a matter of manipulating static symbols and meaning to achieve goals. I argue instead that meaning is located in the structure of culture, and that the condition and mechanism of meaning construction and transformation are, respectively, the metaphoric nature of symbolic systems, and individual and collective interpretation of those systems in the face of concrete events. This theory is demonstrated by analyzing, through textual analysis, meaning construction during the Irish Land War, 1879-1882, showing how diverse social groups constructed new and emergent symbolic meanings and how transformed collective understandings contributed to specific, yet unpredictable, political action and movement outcomes. The theoretical model and empirical case demonstrates that social movement analysis must examine the metaphoric logic of symbolic systems and the interpretive process by which people construct meaning in order to fully explain the role of culture in social movements, the agency of movement participants, and the contingency of the course and outcomes of social movements.<br>

Issue: i23071596<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Scott Bede<br>
Abstract: This article explores the crisis initiated by colonial modernity in Naguib Mahfouz's 1947 novel Midaq Alley. I begin by discussing the significance of anger within the narrative, arguing that this dominant structure of feeling could be read as a collective response to wider social and historical forces. In other words, rather than understanding emotion as the "subjective property" of the individual, I regard it here as a relational practice embedded within and determined by quite specific sociocultural circumstances. I then proceed to discuss the role of rumour in the novel and the significance of its pronounced melodramatic qualities. In the first case, I shall argue, the circulation of rumour provides a way of containing or quarantining the negative feelings produced by modernity, while also reinforcing the boundaries of a community facing the very real possibility of its own demise. In the second case, I would like to suggest that the narrative's tendency to privilege the melodramatic mode creates a sense of social order and moral intelligibility by channelling these feelings into a stable and predictable generic structure. This latter project is ultimately frustrated, however, when the forces of evil emerge to destroy the novel's principle representative of virtue.<br>

Abstract: Si veda P. Ricoeur, Temps et récit, Paris, Seuil, 1983. Paul Ricoeur considera la capacità
del racconto di sdoppiarsi in due specifiche temporalità, quella del presente in cui si narra
e si ricorda, e quella del passato in cui è accaduto ciò che viene narrato. Nel «tempo base
del discorso», ossia il presente in cui si narra, il testimone iscrive la sua storia in un modo
persuasivo: «C'est davant quelqu'un que le témoin atteste de la réalité d'une scène à la-
quelle il dit avoir assisté, [...] cette structure dialogale du témoignage en fait immédiate-
ment reassortir la dimension fiduciaire: le témoin demande à être cru. Il ne se borne pas à
dire: "J'y étais", il ajoute: "Croyez-moi". La certification du témoignage n'est alors com-
plète que par la réponse en écho de celui qui reçoit le témoignage et l'accepte; le témoi-
gnage dès lors n'est pas seulement certifié, il est accrédité».<br>

Abstract: A theory of the moral subject of cooperative relations proceeds from a different point of departure than a formalistic ethics based on individualism and rationalism. Shweder (Merrill-Palmer Quarterly, 1982, 28, 41–69) fails to see that, in this theory, persons communicate in order to co-construct knowledge and to maintain and promote mutual respect. Moral principles are, thus, cooperatively generated because validity is grounded in the structure of reciprocal relations.<br>

Author(s): Jensen Lionel M.<br>
Abstract: There is no more salient figure in early Chinese literature than Kongzi and yet he remains a figure about whose beginnings we know very little. The present essay explores this paradox of bibliographic salience and biographic silence through an in-depth examination of the principal narratives of the Kongzi legend from the Shiji and the Kongzi jiayu, paying particular attention to the language of their respective accounts of the birth of the sage. Finding a distinct lack of fit between the form and content of these these stories, I propose a narrative alternative drawn from the early Han weishu accounts of Kongzi's beginnings. Finding in this alternative a more coherent fit between language and narrative structure as well as recurrent themes such as divine visitation, infertility, jiaomei sacrifice, and cranial disfigurement, vestiges of which are also found in the accounts of Wang Su and Sima Qian, the essay suggests that the weishu texts preserve a fuller popular legend of fertility sacrifice by the childless coordinated with the winter solstice also present in the very name Kongzi and resonating with the charter myth of the Zhou, "Sheng min." The evident implication of this finding is that the historicity of Kongzi is arguable. The name is more like a mythic literary fiction and probably began, as did that of Hou Qi, as a symbolic deity that was made historical in one of its many Warring States incarnations, that one transmitted to us exclusively through the normative biographical tradition. ﻿中國文學中最爲著名的人物莫過於孔子。可是關於他的出身家世我們知道得微乎其微。本文詳細考査了《史記》、《孔子家語》以及漢朝緯書中有關孔子出生的故事。筆者認爲漢朝的緯書對“婦人無子而於冬至郊楳”這一通俗傳說保留得最爲完整。故事中不但直接提到孔子的名子，從其事跡亦可以隱約看到《大雅》“生民”神話的遺跡。本文的結論是孔子的歷史眞實性是大可爭議的。這一名子很可能與周的始祖后稷一樣，最先亦是源於神話傳說，到了戰國時期才演化成歷史人物。並如眞實的歷史人物一樣被地寫入了傳記。此後人們所見到的便無不是這一經過歷史化了的孔子了。<br>

Author(s): Doran Robert<br>
Abstract: To claim that Hayden White has yet to be read seriously as a philosopher of history might seem false on the face of it. But do tropes and the rest provide any epistemic rationale for differing representations of historical events found in histories? As an explanation of White's influence on philosophy of history, such a proffered emphasis only generates a puzzle with regard to taking White seriously, and not an answer to the question of why his efforts should be worthy of any philosophical attention at all. For what makes his emphasis on narrative structure and its associated tropes of philosophical relevance? What, it may well be asked, did (or could) any theory that draws its categories from a stock provided by literary criticism contribute to explicating problems with regard to the warranting of claims about knowledge, explanation, or causation that represent those concerns that philosophy typically brings to this field? Robert Doran's anthologizing of previously uncollected pieces, ranging as they do over a literal half-century of White's published work, offers an opportunity to identify explicitly those philosophical themes and arguments that regularly and prominently feature there. Moreover, White's essays in this volume demonstrate a credible knowledge of and interest in mainstream analytic philosophers of his era and also reveal White as deeply influenced by or well acquainted with other important philosophers of history. White thus invites a reading of his work as philosophy, and this volume presents the opportunity for accepting it as such.<br>

Publisher: The Society for the Study of Early China and the Institute of East Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley<br>

Author(s): Schaberg David<br>
Abstract: Remonstrances (jian ﻿諫) reveal a great deal about the writing of history in China during the Eastern Zhou. As represented in the Zuozhuan and Guoyu, remonstrances, like other speeches, are normally delivered in court and address questions of official policy. They tend to test contemporary phenomena against the lessons of the past, especially as those lessons have been formulated in the Shijing, the Shangshu, aphorisms, and other forms of what I term "inherited speech." Remonstrances also have the support of the third-person historical narrative which surrounds them; the ruler who ignores a remonstrance always suffers for his obstinacy. After briefly discussing the importance of speeches in the Zuozhuan and Guoyu, I outline the structure of a remonstrance and examine four passages in which critical speech, including remonstrance, is said to have circulated freely in the courts of an idealized early period. Next I show how remonstrances match observed historical particulars with fragments of inherited speech. The famous remonstrance of Gong zhi Qi, an exemplary episode, shows how this application of inherited speech guides rhetorical choices and establishes Traditionalist or Confucian terms as the keys to historical intelligibility. Finally, I examine a set of remonstrances which are exceptional in that they do not include overt citations of inherited speech. Among these, military remonstrances can genuinely eschew explicit citation of lessons of the past, while others borrow the authority of inherited speech without seeming to do so. In one case, a brief remonstrance has apparently acquired the status of an aphorism, so that already when it is first uttered it qualifies as a sort of inherited speech. In another case, a precursor of the indirect remonstrances (fengjian ﻿諷諫) of later periods, remonstrators use a theatrical combination of actions and speech to criticize their superior's departure from correct ways.

Abstract: Une fine analyse de la convergence des conceptions du Christ qu'a Origène et de l'Ecriture, met en scène non seulement la consistance interne et le fondement théorique de son exégèse christologique, mais nous présente également le récit que fait Origène de l'histoire du sens chrétien. Selon ce récit, le sens a premièrement une structure trinitaire: le Dieu unique en trois personnes, incorporel, est la source, le fondement et l'épanouissement de l'intelligibilité et de l'existence intellectuelle. Il a deuxièmement une structure christologique: le Fils est le sens ultime, en tant qu'à la fois, contenu objectif ou structure de sens (comme la Sagesse) et agent principal dans le processus subjectif de l'appropriation et de la communication du sens (comme la Parole). Cette simultanéité determine la conception qu'a Origène de la convergence du Christ et de l'Ecriture. Ainsi, le Logos est à la fois la source et le contenu du sens scripturaire, de même que le communicateur principal ou "exégète" de ce sens, cette dernière fonction étant remplie de la manière la plus remarquable dans l'Incarnation, qui est l'indice herméneutique central de l'Ecriture. De manière pratique, cela veut dire que le sens ultime, qui coïncide avec le sens "spirituel" de l'Ecriture est contenu objectivement dans la référence au Christ et subjectivement atteint en ayant "la pensée du Christ"; son accomplissement réside dans la rencontre du lecteur ou exégète avec le Christ.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo consiste numa análise da noção zubiriana de mentalidade. Começa por descrever a razão como busca para descobrir a estrutura da realidade. Esta busca requer um método que inclua um sistema de referência, que é o seu ponto de partida no sentido de sugerir hipóteses e teorias que expliquem a realidade. O sistema de referência deriva da transformação do campo de realidade. Esta transformação, que não segue uma via única, depende da "mentalidade" dos que procuram a realidade profunda. Em Zubiri, o conceito de "mentalidade" é polissémico. Existe uma "mentalidade estrutural e intrínseca", uma "mentalidade situacional extrínseca" e um "horizonte mental". Neste artigo estudam-se as três mentalidades e a sua relevância na constituição do sistema de referência e na elaboração de hipóteses e teorias. Finalmente, o artigo analisa a relevância destas mentalidades para compreender os contributos da investigação interdisciplinar e os seus desafios. The following paper is an analysis of Zubiri's notion of mentality. It starts by describing reason as a quest to uncover the structure of reality. This quest requires a method that includes a system of reference, which is its point of departure in the sense of suggesting hypotheses and theories that explain reality. The system of reference results from a transformation of the field of reality. This transformation, which does not follow a unique path, depends on the "mentality" of those who seek to deepen reality. In Zubiri the concept "mentality" is polysemic. There is a "structural and intrinsic mentality", an "extrinsic situational mentality" and a "mental horizon". The three of them and their relevance in the constitution of the system of reference and the elaboration of hypotheses and theories are studied. Finally the paper analyzes the relevance of these mentalities to understand the contributions of interdisciplinary research and its challenges.<br>

Abstract: La ciudad de Buenos Aires se encuentra cubierta por múltiples marcas territoriales (monumentos, memoriales, altares populares, etc.) que rememoran hechos conflictivos y procesos político-sociales de la historia reciente y que encarnan los diversos recuerdos de sus ciudadanos. A partir de los casos emblemáticos del Espacio para la Memoria (ex ESMA) y del Santuario de Cromañón nos preguntamos cómo se insertan estos lugares de recuerdo en el entramado de la ciudad, en emplazamientos y funcionamientos bastante disímiles que, no obstante, los ubican como íconos del recuerdo y la conmemoración. Nos interesa cuestionar sobre los diversos modos en que puede territorializarse e incluso institucionalizarse la memoria en determinado espacio. The city of Buenos Aires is covered with several territorial markers (monuments, memorials, popular altars, etc.) recalling conflictive events and political-social processes in recent history that embody the various memories of its citizens. On the basis of emblematic cases in the Space for Memory (ex ESMA) and the Cro-Magnon Sanctuary, we explored how these places of memory are inserted in the city's structure, in quite dissimilar locations and functions that nevertheless identify them as icons of memory and commemoration. We explore the different ways in which memory can be territorialized and even institutionalized in a specific space.<br>

Abstract: The aim of the paper is to indicate that it is impossible to describe the difference betweeen logical sentences and norms on the level of the structure of the language but it has to be done only on the level of the use of the language, viz. the act of speech. The author stresses specificity of the natural language in which every legal norm is formulated. He emphasizes the difference between extensional and intensional language stating that the natural language should be ranked among the latter. La tâche de l'article est de démontrer que la différence entre les phrases logiques et les normes ne peut pas être décrite sur le niveau de la structure de la langue, mais seulements sur le niveau de son usage, c'est-à-dire sur le niveau d'un acte de la parole. L'auteur souligne la specificité de la langue naturelle dans laquelle de chaque norme juridique est formulée. Il met l'accent sur la différence entre le langues extensionelles et intensionelles et constate que la langue naturelle est la langue intensionelle. Dieser Artikel bezweckt, nachzuweisen, daß man den Unterschied zwischen logischen Sätzen und Normen auf der Strukturstufe der Sprache nicht beschreiben kann, sondern nur auf der pragmatischen Gebrauchsstufe der Sprache, d.h. des Sprechaktes. Der Autor betont einen spezifischen Charakter der Umgangssprache, in welcher jede Rechtsnorm formuliert ist. Er akzentuiert den Unterschied zwischen extensionalen und intensionalen Sprachen und stellt fest, daß die Umgangssprache eine intensionale Sprache ist.<br>

Abstract: La théorie de la «Ungleichzeitigkeit» de Ernst Bloch definit le rapport de superstructures et de structure économique comme un rapport d'autonomie relative. Les différences entre la conception de Bloch et la définition de cette corrélation d'Althusser ne doivent pas être cachées. Néanmoins il est distinct que les conceptions, qui sont conciliées avec la discussion de Marx, Gramsci et Max Weber, convergent en tant qu'elles tâchent d'élaborer des déclarations utilisables sur l'état et sur la base sociale de l'idéologie. La confrontation des deux conceptions prouve être appropriée d'avancer la recherche de l'idéologie. Ernst Bloch's theory of "Ungleichzeitigkeit" defines the relation between superstructures and economic structure as a relation of relative autonomy. The differences between Bloch's conception and Althusser's definition of this correlation should not be conceiled. Nevertheless it becomes evident that the conceptions which are both reconciled to the discussion of Marx, Gramsci and Max Weber converge in so far as they try to elaborate sound assertions of the status and the social basis of ideology. The confrontation of both conceptions proves to be appropriate to advance in the research of ideology.<br>

Abstract: Confrontant les thèses des anthropologues qui ont tendance à voir dans la mafia une structure plurielle, informelle, dispersée sur le territoire, très dépendante de chaque chef de cellule mafieuse (cosche) et se regroupant à des fins pratiques (task oriented), et les thèses des juges palermitains qui ont tendance à considérer la mafia comme une organisation centralisée de type Cosa nostra, l'auteur montre qu'une analyse dynamique permet de dépasser la confrontation. Ainsi en étudiant les capacités d'adaptation de l'organisation et les différents vecteurs qu'elle peut utiliser (violence marché), il déplace les enjeux du débat et repense le phénomène mafieux dans son rapport à l'État en suivant une problématique weberienne. Haciendo una comparación de las tésis de los antropólogos que tienen la tendencia a ver en la mafia una estructura plural, informal, dispersa en el territorio, muy dependiente de los capos de las células mafiosas, (cosche) y que se reagrupan con objetivos prácticos (task oriented), con las tesis de los jueces palermitanos, inclinados a considerar a la mafia como una organización centralizada de tipo Cosa nostra, el autor muestra que un análisis dinámico permite sobrepasar la confrontación. Asi, estudiando la capacidad de adaptación de la organización y de los diferentes vectores (violencia-mercado) desplaza los terminos del debate, hace el re-examen del fenómeno mafioso en relación con el Estado, siguiendo las pautas de una problemática weberiana. Confronting (comparing) on the one hand anthropologists thesis who have a tendency to see in mafia a plural structure, informal, spread out on the territory, very depending upon their local chiefs (cosche) and meeting for task oriented, and on the other hand the palermitan judges who have a certain tendency to consider mafia as a Cosa Nostra centralized organization type, the author shows that a dynamic analysis allows to go further than confrontation.

Abstract: El objetivo de este artículo es analizar las relaciones entre arquitectura y educación desde una perspectiva dialógica. En esta perspectiva, desarrollada por el antropólogo y pensador lingüístico Mijail Bajtin, el concepto básico es la estructura cronotópica de los objetos culturales en general y los objetos arquitectónicos en particular. Así, la arquitectura es una estructura cultural sociofísica, y la educación una vía importante de modelización de estas estructuras culturales sociofísicas a través del desarrollo mental y personal. The objective of this article is to analyse the relations between architecture and education from a dialogical perspective. The basic concept from this perspective is the chronotopic structure of cultural objects in general and of architectural objects in particular, developed by the Russian anthropologue and linguistic thinker Mijail Bajtin. Architecture is then a sociophysical cultural structure and education a very important way of modelization of these sociophysical structures throughout the mental and personal development.<br>

Abstract: Present discourses on technology education are taking a positive and value-neutral approach with utilitarian and vocational overtones. The discourses generally lack discussions of human agency and human responsibility for techno-scientific activities and technological literacy. To support the emergence of a collective civic literacy, we argue in this text that technology education needs to take up critical and value-acknowledging aspects with emphasis on building sustainable relationships among human beings, technology, and lifeworld. To understand the relationship between human agency and modern technology, we examine the nature of technology in the dimensions of technology as causality and technology as a relationship of lifeworld. Discussing Martin Heidegger's perspectives on the causalities of technology, we question how the nature of technology situates human beings in power-related relationships to the world. Understanding technology as process and relationship of lifeworld, the paper extends its discussion of the responsibility of a dialectical human-technology-lifeworld relation based on a socio-technical and ethico-moral framework of technology. By recognizing human responsibility of and for modern technology, we outline a critical and reflective approach to technological literacy. The approach challenges the position of current approaches to technology in the attempt to provide a foundation for a contemporary pedagogy of technological awareness and values. Aujourd'hui, les discours en matière d'enseignement de la technologie sont en train de prendre une orientation positive et dépourvue de jugement de valeur comportant des connotations utilitaristes et professionnelles. En général, les discours n'ouvrent pas assez de discussions sur l'action humaine et la responsabilité humaine dans les activités technico-scientifiques et dans l'alphabétisme technologique. Dans ce papier, afin de renforcer l'éclosion de l'alphabétisme civique collectif, nous ouvrons le déb~<br>

Abstract: The correlation of narrative and ethics has a long history in literature, and frequently ethics has been associated with a transcendental notion of truth. The recent attention to narrative and theology has offered more theoretical reflections of both poetic and hermeneutical practices that return us to the earliest literary, philosophical and theological productions. In this essay, I wish to present a different way of examining the correlation of narrative and ethics; one less orientated towards Scripture and less concerned with the Church. The narratives I consider are secular fictions from the modernist period. Through examining these works phenomenologically and the role the imagination plays in the production of beliefs, I argue that all narratives structure emotions, desires and hopes and this structuring continually opens up a transcendent horizon.<br>

Abstract: Rav H̱isday Crescas (1340-1410/11), Rabbi of Aragonese Jewry in Christian Spain and a major figure in medieval Jewish philosophy, is unique in positing an all-embracing thesis of Love. This thesis permeates his theories of cosmogony, metaphysics and theology and generates far-reaching didactic implications. This article examines Crescas' rather bold description of Love as a positive Divine attribute, an anthropopathism meant to convey ontological meaning about the Divine Nature via an analogous construct. Themes such as Infinite Goodness, Joy and Kindness enable Rav H̱isday to structure a new conception of the Creator and Providence. After postulating Divine Love as the Cosmic Force sustaining creation, Crescas explains the purpose of Torah and mitzvot in terms of evoking love for God thus drawing the soul to link up to the Divine Overflow of Love. Even spiritual existence after death is explicated in terms of the soul's love for its Divine Source. To understand Crescas' unique theory of Love, we compare it with the views of his predecessors and analyze his use of philosophic sources such as the 5th century BCE pre-Socratic scientist-mystic Empedocles. We examine educational aspects of Crescas' teachings on love and view them in context of the mass conversions to Christianity resulting from the 1391 riots. Finally, Crescas' ideas are read as pedagogical messages relevant to both Jews and conversos in the twenty traumatic years after 1391 when he served as chief rabbi and political leader in Saragossa.<br>

Article Title: PLURALISMUS – ETHISCHE GRUNDINTUITION – KIRCHE<br>
Publisher: VERLAG HERDER<br>
Issue: i24164415<br>
Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Guggenberger Wilhelm<br>
Abstract: This article tries to give an outline of Christian ethics in a pluralistic world most clearly characterized by its Babel of moral languages. There is no longer any single valid moral language. The liberal solution to establish a neutral moral language – a moral Esperanto – to solve this crisis of modernity is not possible without turning into some sort of moral imperialism. To avoid, however, the other extreme – nihilism – this article follows to some degree "communitarian" thinkers like A. MacIntyre, J. Stout and M. Walzer. Every ethics must be rooted in a narrative tradition and needs a concrete community as its precondition. The second part of this article addresses the narrative structure of Christian ethics. At first it follows MacIntyre's insight that every ethics is based on myth. It differs, however, from MacIntyre's position by putting special emphasis on the substantial content of the Christian "myth". With the help of Girard's mimetic theory this article distinguishes between archaic myths that are the product of the scapegoat mechanism and identify with the view of the lynch mob and the Biblical history of salvation that consists of a story written from the perspective of the victims of collective persecution. In the center of Christian ethics we find the example of Jesus Christ – the victim of collective violence par excellence – and the example of those of his disciples who became aware of their own contribution to Jesus's death and converted to the side of the victim. The third part of this article addresses the question of the concrete community that makes Christian ethics possible. Again MacIntyre's communitarian emphasis on the connection between concrete communities and ethics is taken as a starting point. Whereas communitarians, however, tend to support patriotism the community necessitated by Christian ethics is the universal Church. Patriotism like the ancient Greek polis is essentially characterized by its enmity to outside communities, a frie~<br>

Abstract: The article calls attention to the role and function of exemplary "models", defined as evoking signs that move people to reflect their own values and orientations. It was Albert Bandura who first showed that human learning generally has the form of learning from models. Recent insights of neuroscience confirm and explain Bandura's theories: The human brain as a neuronal network estimates things according to similarities of their entire structure. Thus it can be called a "machine estimating structural connections". These insights can inspire moral theology: A concrete model can show the wide range of possibilities christian faith can open to believers. Christian tradition has always maintained this idea by understanding christian life as imitatio Christi. However, "imitatio" must be understood as the free and creative act of an autonomous subject.<br>

Publisher: University of Nebraska Press<br>
Issue: i24243336<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Licops Dominique<br>
Abstract: Dans la littérature antillaise, les métaphores naturelles symbolisent la conception de l'identité des mouvements littéraires: l'arbre de la négritude, le rhizome de l'antillanité, la mangrove de la créolité. C'est en transformant cette pratique que Gisèle Pineau "s'insère dans le débat théorique littéraire actuel" (Florence Ramond Jurney). En effet, si ses confrères remplacent une image naturelle par une autre en arguant que cette dernière représente plus justement l'identité antillaise, Pineau réfléchit à la violence inhérente à la structure métaphorique en inventant ce que j'appelle une "métaphore imbriquée." Que ce soit l'arbre dans L'Exil selon Julia (1997) ou le cyclone dans L'Espérance-macadam (1995), j'analyserai d'abord comment ces métaphores imbriquées révèlent les effets nuisibles de cette conceptualisation sur les personnages. Ensuite, je considérerai comment, à travers cette figure stylistique, l'auteure pense autrement l'identité antillaise. Enfin, j'envisagerai comment sa réflexion sur l'identité culturelle via les images naturelles a évolué dans ses romans plus récents.<br>

La « communauté des règles grammaticales », caractérisée par les différenciations de personnes, de temps, de modes, de voix et de cas, régit en effet l'intersubjectivité et la référence au monde.<br>

Abstract: Pour être juste, il faut reconnaître que la position de Ricœur reste assez ambiguë sur ce
sujet. Tantôt il considère que la structure première est celle du sens, et donc que le premier
pour nous, c'est la précompréhension, ou mieux, le précompris; tantôt il laisse entendre au
contraire que cette structure du sens elle-même repose sur une structure ontologique anté-
rieure, celle de l'appartenance au monde, dont la dimension de la compréhension est certes cru-
ciale mais non exclusive. Si toute compréhension est compréhension « devant le texte » (thèse
capitale autorisant ainsi la fonction centrale de l'herméneutique), il reste que la compréhension
elle-même est rendue possible par ce qui la précède comme appartenance au monde. Assuré-
ment ce monde antécédent est aussi un monde du sens, celui formé par l'histoire, la tradition,
les communautés sociales, mais pas seulement. Car le sens lui-même ne renvoie pas seulement
au sens, dans une clôture infinie de la signification, mais échappe au sens donné, comme on le
voit dans l'usage poétique de la métaphore, pour dévoiler une portion encore non signifiée du
monde.<br>

Abstract: Issu d'un travail plus large sur l'histoire de la philosophie française au XXe siècle, ce texte se propose de caractériser la période à partir d'un problème commun autour duquel les philosophes travaillent: la structure. Mais comment cette notion en vient-elle à s'imposer au centre des réflexions, en fonction de quelles questions, de quelles ruptures ? Il s'agit aussi de voir comment des pensées singulières s'affirment à travers des usages différents du «structuralisme», un dénominateur commun qui n'a rien d'univoque.<br>

vient dans Esprit dans le cadre d'un échange avec Paul Ricœur. Sur le paradigme structuraliste
et le statut de l'événement, voir les mises au point de Frédéric Keck: « La pensée mythique ne
cherche pas à donner sens à l'événement historique, en l'insérant dans une chaîne d'événe-
ments qui l'expliquerait ou qu'il éclairerait rétrospectivement: elle cherche dans l'événement
une opposition logique qui lui permet de mettre en scène l'ensemble des structures symboliques
qui lui préexistent. Le sens de l'événement ne se manifeste pas dans son unité ou sa nouveauté,
mais au contraire dans l'instabilité logique par laquelle il reproduit une structure passée », Fré-

Abstract: C'est le motif de l'opposition de Ricœur à Arendt dans la Mémoire, l'Histoire, l'Oubli, op.
cit., p. 634-639: le pardon ne saurait être institué politiquement, sinon sous la forme caricatu-
rale de l'amnistie. Son rapport à l'amour le tient « éloigné du politique », sa logique mystérieuse
le place au-delà de toute institution. Arendt le pressent dans Condition de l'homme moderne en
parlant de « miracle » de l'action, mais elle s'interdit de rendre compte de la « hauteur »
(presque religieuse) du pardon lorsqu'elle le plaque sur la structure « horizontale » (interhu-
maine) de la promesse.<br>

Abstract: Polish literary theory developed very quickly in the 1960's and 1970's. Its main field of research is structure of literary works, including versology, stylistics, narrative, literary communication, descriptive and historical poetics. It was mostly inspired by phenomenology and Roman Ingarden, a disciple of Husserl and founder of phenomenological theory of literary work, which focused on the intentional structure of literary work and its concretization by readers. The second important source of inspiration for Polish literary theory was structuralism, including Russian Formalism, the Prague Circle and original Polish literary researches before the Second World War. After 1989 the entire field of literary theory in Poland was deeply changed. Formalist perspective was replaced by research concentrated on broad cultural, political, and economical contexts of literature, its ideological determinations as well as forms of symbolic power reflected in a literary work. Literature itself is no more treated as structure or text, but rather as discourse, reflecting and at the same time forming social reality. Analytical tools are mainly provided by French poststructuralist theory, hermeneutics, pragmatism, American cultural studies, feminism and postcolonialism. Inspirée par deux tendances prédominantes : la phénoménologie (dont le représentant le plus important a été Roman Ingarden, disciple de Husserl et fondateur de la théorie phénoménologique de l'œuvre littéraire, centrée sur la structure intentionnelle de l'œuvre et sa concrétisation par le lecteur) et le structuralisme (y compris les influences venues du formalisme russe, de l'École de Prague, ainsi que des recherches polonaises menées avant la Seconde Guerre mondiale), la théorie de la littérature en Pologne s'est développée très rapidement dans les années 60 et 70. Elle s'est intéressée à la structure de l'œuvre littéraire (versologie, stylistique, narration, communication littéraire, poétique descriptive et historiqu~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>
Issue: i24439507<br>
Date: 10 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): CHRISTMAN JOHN<br>
Abstract: In this article I critically discuss a claim made by several writers in philosophy and the social sciences that for an individual to count as a person, a single personality, or the subject of a life, the experiences of the subject in question must take a narrative form. I argue that narrativity is a misleading and, in some ways of understanding it, implausible condition of what it is that adds unity to personhood and personality. I pursue this critique by considering canonical accounts of narrativity in philosophy and literary studies. I consider those connections between events that must hold for the sequence to be considered a narrative: causal, teleological, and thematic connections. I argue that for each of these, the condition that experiential sequences (for a given subject) must have this structure is empty: any life sequence that is reflected upon in an interpretive spirit can meet it. What the condition of narrativity amounts to, then, is the more basic requirement that the person must be able to look upon the factors and events of her life with a certain interpretive reflection, whether or not those factors and events have any particular narrative unity in a traditional sense.<br>

Abstract: Indeed, another is that rather than growing on trees, such designs are trees. I
have in mind here Frits Staal's discussion of "trees" as designs within Vedic ritual;
see his Ritual and Mantras: Rules without Meaning (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass,
[1990] 1996, 105-8), and wish to imply that the epic's design has these ritual designs
as a familiar model. Although the discussion is of "embeddedness" (Staal, ibid.)
rather than specifically of "trees," the point is anticipated by Christopher Z. Min-
kowski, "Janamejaya's saltra and Ritual Structure," Journal of the American Orien-
tal Society 109,3 (1989): 401-20 and his "Snakes, sattras and the Mahäbhärata," in
Arvind Sharma, ed., Essays on the Mahäbhärata (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1991), 384-
400; by Michael Witzel, "JB paulpulanl: The Structure of a Brähmana Tale," in M.
D. Balasubrahmaniam, ed., Dr. B.R. Sharma Felicitation Volume (Tirupati: Ken-
driya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, 1986), 189-216; and, with acknowledgment to both
them and Staal, in Hiltebeitel, Rethinking, 93-94 and nn. 9 and 10.<br>

Abstract: See Ricoeur in the essay mentioned in note 33 on the transition from 'sub-
ject' to 'structure' in Althusser's works: 'Zugleich wird damit die Wachsamkeit
gegenüber Verifizierung und Falsifizierung geschwàcht' (p. 208). Openness on this
point cannot, in my opinion, be expected until followers of Althusser show a
readiness to abandon the disastrous notion that the appealing, interpellating
^uthority which demands accountibility can be no other than Ideology. See for
instance Althusser, 'Ideologie en ideologische staatsapparaten' ('Ideology and
ideological state apparatuses'), in Te elfder ure (At the eleventh hour), 24 (1978,
no. 1), pp. 99f: 'the individual is addressed as a (free) subject, so that it subjects
itself in freedom to the commandments of the Subject' (100), '... the ideology
brings about simultaneously (1) the addressing of the 'individuals' as subjects; (2)
their subjection to the Subject' (99).<br>

Abstract: In Reformational philosophy the term 'structure' can be used in two different senses: It could
refer to the factual or subject-side of reality and is then used in the sense of the structure of
reality. It could also refer to the law-side of reality, i.e. the structural laws governing and
conditioning the regularities perceived in phenomena. Then it is understood in the sense of the
structure for reality. When the term 'structure mapping' is used in this article it refers primarily
to the latter sense of the term, although it is conceded that analysis of the structures for reality
are inextricably bound to the analysis of the structures of reality.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur, op.cit., p. 156. The tremendous difficulties we face in developing an
adequate view of evil are well illustrated by the fact that Ricoeur himself, despite his clear
intentions to the contrary, works with a view of human "fault" in Fallible Man (Chicago:
Henry, 1965) which itself comes very close to reading sin and evil into the fundamental
human structure. See the Master's thesis of Henry Venema, Philosophical Anthropology, and the
Problem of Evil: An Interpretative Analysis of Paul Ricoeur's Philosophy of Will (Toronto: Institute
for Christian Studies, 1986).<br>

Abstract: There is a certain order here: character is a set of dispositions at the level of the act-
structure; temperament is the ensemble of dispositions that is anchored in the psychical sub-
strncture; typical tendencies in motor behaviourand bodily expression are related to the biotic
and physical substnicture. It is interesting that the distinction between character and tem-
perament, after having become obsolete at the end of the fifties and after decades of absence
in the scientific literatnre on personality and personality development, has re-emerged some
15 years ago and has begnn a second life.<br>

Author(s): Glas Gerrit<br>
Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: Je traduis prajnäpäramitä par Parfaite Sagesse plutôt que par l'expression
habituelle «Perfection de Sagesse» pour deux raisons. La première est une
exigence littéraire. En français, on ne parle naturellement ni plus de la perfection
de la patience, de la perfection du courage, que de la perfection de la sagesse, pour
parler d'une vertu ou d'une disposition pleinement développée. Bien entendu, dans
le bouddhisme mahäyäna, le terme pâramitâ est un terme technique désignant une
disposition cultivée par un pratiquant du chemin bouddhique qui reçoit proprement
son nom de pâramitâ quand elle a atteint son plein degré de développement.
L'expression «Perfection de Sagesse» est devenue une de ces expressions
bouddhologiques qui signale sa technicité par sa non-naturalité. Je tente donc
de lui rendre une certaine fluidité en choisissant une expression utilisant un nom
abstrait et un adjectif qui le qualifie. C'est d'ailleurs la traduction habituelle pour
un tel composé en sanskrit, ce qui constitue la seconde raison de cette traduction.
En effet, du point de vue philologique maintenant, Haribhadra propose une analyse
du composé sanskrit (vigraha) dans sa Lumière qui indique qu'une traduction
par un nom et son adjectif serait plus appropriée. Il y explique que le composé
prajnäpäramitä est à comprendre comme prajnâyâ dharma-pravicaya-laksanäyäh
päramitä prajnäpäramitä (Wogihara 1932, p. 23) c'est-à-dire «[le composé]
prajnäpäramitä veut dire la perfection qui appartient à la sagesse, définie comme
étant le discernement des phénomènes ». Cette structure nom abstrait au nominatif
+ nom au génitif où le génitif est subjectif, est plus naturellement traduit dans
les langues occidentales par un renversement qui fait du nom abstrait un adjectif
qualifiant le nom au génitif. Voir par exemple Tubb and Boose 2007, p. 177-182.<br>

Abstract: Many parallels can be drawn between organizational and individual pathologies. We believe that the fantasies of top executives and the neurotic styles to which they give rise are important determinants of the nature of organizational dysfunctions. This is particularly true in centralized organizations where the top executives have a major impact upon organizational climate, structure, strategy and even the selection of the environment; and, where organizational recruitment and promotion processes ensure uniformity, or at least conformity, among the top ranks of executives. Using an empirically derived taxonomy, we have isolated five common pathological organizational types and related each of these to the fantasies and neurotic styles of their top executives. Each type is shown to reflect a large number of elements of structure and strategy that are consistent with and probably caused by the neurotic style of the cadre of top executives. The types are called paranoid, compulsive, histrionic, depressive and schizoid. Implications for management research and organizational change are discussed.<br>

Article Title: In Search of a Postcolonial Theory of Normative Integration: Reflections on A.C. Cairns' Theory of "Citizens Plus"<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i25165879<br>
Date: 12 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Libesman Heidi<br>
Abstract: The focus of this article is the theory of integration advanced by Alan Cairns in his book, "Citizens Plus: Aboriginal peoples and the Canadian State". Cairns' theory has had a mixed reception since its publication. Like much scholarship and public policy in the Aboriginal rights field, "Citizens Plus" has attracted strong proponents and opponents. At present "Citizens Plus" remains one of the primary competitors vying for influence in guiding the postcolonial reconfiguration of the relationship between Aboriginal peoples, the Canadian state and civil society on terms of justice that may be perceived as legitimate by both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples. The prime alternative, as conceived by both Cairns and his critics, is the nation-to-nation constitutional vision of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. The author provides a political theoretical reading of "Citizens Plus". She seeks to disclose the normative and conceptual structure of Cairns' argument and to situate Cairns' theory in the context of debates concerning the future of Aboriginal peoples and the constitution of Canada. This reading foregrounds an alternative interpretation of the relationship between "Citizens Plus" and the constitutional vision of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, which makes it possible to see them as complementary rather than opposed constitutional visions. The author also raises broader questions concerning the reasons for continuing the search, at the heart of Cairns' work, for a post-colonial theory and praxis of normative integration in diverse societies, and the conditions of the possibility of such a theory and praxis. Ultimately the author argues that whether one agrees or disagrees with Cairns' prescription, at a minimum "Citizens Plus" should be understood as raising a fundamental question to which multinational constitutional theory must respond. /// Le présent article a pour objet d'examiner la théorie avancée par Alan Cairns dans son ouvrage, "Ci~<br>

Abstract: Michel Riffaterre, The Semiotics of Poetry (TJloomington, Ind., 1978):
"The poem results from the transformation of the matrix, a minimal and literal
sentence, into a longer, complex and non-literal periphrasis. The matrix is hypo-
thetical being only the grammatical and lexical actualization of a structure. The
matrix may be epitomized in one word, in which case the word will not appear
in the text. It is always actualized in successive variants; the form of these is
governed by the first or primary actualization, the model. Matrix, model, and text
are variants of the same structure" (p. 19).<br>

Abstract: La place de la musique dans À la recherche du temps perdu a suscité nombre de commentaires. Le présent propos connecte ces points à un débat interne aux musicologues français. Si certains l'envisage contre toute interpretation subjective, d'autres entendent la recentrer sur deux axes majeurs: 1) le statut d'écrit littéraire 2) révélant l'expérience musicale d'autre part. Or, de récents articles insèrent Proust à ce débat. Il s'agit de comprendre en quoi réactualiser écrivain ayant fait d'un roman un projet esthétique où la question du langage est centrale peut relancer la discussion du lien musique-langage, ici en un rapport où s'adjoint la musicologie, elle-même objet d'une dissension. /// The work À la recherche du temps perdu by Marcel Proust has provoked numerous commentaries which referred to the importance conferred upon music in this novel. In this, interest was pointed either at the music sources, the listening, or the connections between the architecture of the novel and the musical structure of the composer Vinteuil, the character in the novel. This article offers the articulation of those debates which occur within the French musicology which question its objects in the way that some consider it as a science or discipline at intersection of others, which has to return necessarily within sciences called exact and/or humane, opposed to all subjective interpretations; the other try to center again musicologist's activities in two main axes: the status of a writing with a literary aspiration on one side, and a report about musical experience on the other. In this, recent articles were putting Marcel Proust in the focus of a contemporary debate, trying to understand in which way the reactualisation of a writer - who out of one work had made an aesthetical project in which the question of language became central - can renew the discussion about connections between music and language, but this time within a triangular connection in which musicology is added, whi~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i25619787<br>
Date: 8 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Cody Francis<br>
Abstract: This essay examines how activists in rural southern India have sought to reshape the field of political communication by encouraging lower-caste women to submit written, signed petitions to district-level government offices, and so represent themselves to the state. I argue that contradictions between democratic recognition and the will to development that inhere to the political structure of contemporary governance in rural India correspond to tensions within the semiotic structure of signature itself, between constative representation and performative creation. Governmentality and the forms of communication that it requires often rest on the notion that written self-representation constitutes an act of political agency. But the limits of a governmental communicative reason that would conflate written subject and agent become especially clear in postcolonial contexts where the construction of those citizens that would be represented is in fact a product of the very act of representation. It is the narrative of development-as-pedagogy that holds out the promise of a future alignment of communicative frameworks, technologies, and participant roles, allowing for the transparent self-representation of an already-constituted citizen. By tracking the ambivalent experience of one group of women in particular, this account focuses on how the logic of signature as self-representation has served to recontextualize the marginality of petitioners as something within the state's broader field of power.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i25654803<br>

Author(s): Passos José Luiz<br>
Abstract: It has become commonplace to describe Machado de Assis's characters and narrators as deeper than those of his contemporaries, and his novels as representations more creatively ambiguous than most literary depictions of nineteenth-century Brazil. In this essay I argue that throughout his novels psychological depth is a function of moral imagination; and a troubled moral imagination is a necessary condition for the literary representation of the modern self. Machado's protagonists are able to fashion the public presentation of their selves by imagining alternatives to their origins, desires, and social predicaments. They have in their pasts a burden they need to overcome, and while doing so they find themselves in conditions of freedom and harm. Evil then arises as a consequence of moral dynamism, in so far as it becomes a project for undoing the other. The genesis of a radical conception of free will and evil in Machado's narratives goes back to his translation of Victor Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea (1866). His concern with a more meticulous characterization of inwardness deepens between Iaiá Garcia (1878) and Dom Casmurro (1899), when adopting the structure of a confessional narrative he arrives at a balance between disguised motives (malice), double chronology (nostalgia), and human life as an unfolding, reversible, and self-aware process (metamorphosis). To frame Machado's strategy for depicting moral change, I take from Augustine's Confessions the suggestion that retrospection is the only way of restoring the identity of someone whose self is marked by his or her sense of dissimilarity with the past. Finally, from Kant and Paul Ricoeur I draw the elements for a further consideration of evil as an invitation to think differently about seeing, judging, and narrating human life.<br>

Yet even a modest acquaintance with history shows that the underdevelopment is not original or traditional and that neither the past nor the present of the underdeveloped countries resemble in any important respect the past of the now-developed countries. The now-developed countries were never underdeveloped, though they may have been undeveloped. It is also widely believed that the contemporary underdevelopment of a country can be understood as the product of reflection solely of its own economic, political, social, and cultural characteristics of structure.

Abstract: La traduction de servus par 'esclave' pour la période tardo-médiévale au cours de
laquelle écrit Buridan ne va pas de soi et exige quelques précisions. 11 est vrai que le terme
'esclavage' n'apparaît qu'au XVIe siècle avec l'avènement de la traite vers le Nouveau Monde et
que les médiévaux n'ont de conscience des réalités de l'esclavage antique qu'à travers leur
connaissance des auteurs classiques, dont Sénèque. Lorsqu'ils emploient 'servus', leur perspec-
tive n'est pas historique: le terme désigne communément dans le latin médiéval le 'serf et la
pratique du servage. Pourtant, en choisissant de traduire servus par 'esclave', nous entendons
ancrer les réflexions des théoriciens dans le contexte de la sémantique aristotélicienne autant
que dans le substrat de culture classique et de référence latine qui structure leurs argumenta-
tions; par endroit, nous traduisons servus par 'serviteur' pour une plus grande justesse selon
le contexte de la discussion. Quoi qu'il en soit des choix de traductions, nous ne sommes
donc pas dupes de la distance entre le langage scolastique ainsi influencé par la tradition clas-
sique et les complexités juridiques des diverses servitudes médiévales. Sur ce point, voir D.
Barthélémy, « Postface», de M. Bloch, Rois et serß. Un chapitre d'histoire capétienne et autres
écrits sur le servage, Pairs, rééd. 1996, p. 331 : «Il faut mesurer les écarts entre l'idée juridique
(esclavage antique, servage médiéval) et la complexité concrète des servitudes». Si le terme
reste issu du latin classique et renvoie aux réalités sociopolitiques des communautés antiques,
au Moyen Age cependant, il peut recouvrer indistinctement toutes les formes de dépendan-

Abstract: The past decade has brought advanced information technologies, which include electronic messaging systems, executive information systems, collaborative systems, group decision support systems, and other technologies that use sophisticated information management to enable multiparty participation in organization activities. Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose adaptive structuration theory (AST) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. AST examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of AST, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system (GDSS). A GDSS is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the GDSS is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied. We begin by positioning AST among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to GDSS use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of AST. We outline an analytic strategy for applying AST principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of AST is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization r~<br>

Abstract: This article seeks to integrate the roles of structure and human agency in a theory of historical causation, using the fall of the Weimar Republic and in particular Henry Turner's book Hitler's Thirty Days to Power as a case study. Drawing on analogies from chaos theory, it argues that crisis situations in history exhibit sensitive dependence on local conditions, which are always changing. This undermines the distinction between causes and conditions (including counterfactual conditions). It urges instead a distinction between empowering and constraining causes of specific human actions as a more fruitful model. The paper also discusses more briefly two other analogies to chaos theory: 1) similarity across differences in scale as applicable to different levels of individual (psychological) and collective events, which are seen as homologous; 2) a model of branching as applicable to the totality of causes of a given event.<br>

Abstract: The structural analysis of myth is a prime focus of anthropological interest, largely because of the efforts of Levi-Strauss. This paper uses some Levi-Straussian ideas to develop a strategy for myth analysis that I call the non-sense-in-myth strategy (NIMS). The strategy is given a trial run on a well-known and (I believe) much-misunderstood myth: Adam and Eve in Eden. The structure identified has an evolutionary character consistent with many modern understandings concerning the nature of human reality. NIMS, a mediator between Levi-Straussian intellectual leaps and a real methodology, indicates the value of cautious optimism concerning the question "Can structural analysis of myth become a scientific endeavor?"<br>

Abstract: The argument of Evans-Pritchard's classic The Nuer has been subject to conflicting interpretations. We examine these interpretations and then present a reading of the work that treats it as a whole. A key conclusion is that Evans-Pritchard distinguishes among three aspects of the "systems" he describes: (1) logical possibilities immanent in all forms of action, (2) cultural or local idioms in terms of which action is formulated and expressed, and (3) conditions and patterns of action. With this framework he develops, through an examination of the way interests in cattle are translated into political practices, an analysis in which the central theoretical problem is the relationship of structure to human agency. Our reading raises questions about the utility of standard classifications of theoretical orientations in social and cultural anthropology, particularly of the category of structural-functionalism, of which The Nuer is taken to be a central text.<br>

Author(s): Berner Knut<br>
Abstract: Evil should be characterised as a specific constellation, which results from destructive connections between individual activities and systemic influences. The article shows some important aspects of the structure of evil and prefers the terms of wickedness and obscene coincidences to describe its own character. Therefore, also the division between rationality and affectivity appears as inadequate, because evil has on the one side an intrinsic attractiveness for individuals and is on the other side in modern societies more and more a product of a rationality, which is free from passion. Especially the emotional impoverishment is responsible for the increase of evil, which is demonstrated by two examples. Based on Paul Ricoeur, the evolution of malum can be developed by a short analyse of the relationship between Ethics and Emotions.<br>

Abstract: While individual and group psychotherapy are often referred to as forms of secular confession, the relationship of early religious confessional practices to the psychology of contemporary helping group processes needs further exploration. An examination of the theology and form of the Catholic rites of reconciliation indicates that their psychology and structure clearly parallel many of the healing processes at work in group psychotherapy.<br>

Author(s): Doja Albert<br>
Abstract: The system of beliefs and practices related to Bektashism seems to have corresponded to a kind of liberation theology, whereas the structure of Bektashi groups corresponded more or less to the type of religious organization conventionally known as charismatic groups. It becomes understandable therefore that their spiritual tendency could at times connect with and meet social, cultural and national perspectives. In turn, when members of the previously persecuted religious minority will acquire a degree of religious and political respectability within society at large, the doctrines of heterodoxy and liberation theology fade into the background. In the end, the heirs of the heterodox promoters of spiritual reform and social movement turn into followers and faithful defenders of a legitimate authority. They become the spokespeople for an institutionalized orthodoxy whose support is sought by the political regime.<br>

Abstract: Este ensaio pretende estabelecer correlações entre Literatura, História e História da Literatura do ângulo da Estética Expectacional. Essa posição desloca o tradicional enfoque da literatura da perspectiva da produção para a da recepção, extraindo da obra literária uma abundância de sentimentos em harmonia com as expectativas de cada período, de cada grupo social, de cada nível cultural, tornando-a, assim, uma estrutura móvel, capaz de valer em diferentes contextos e de dar respostas diversas, conforme a demanda de verdade estética. Com isto, a História da Literatura tem condições de incorporar a marcha das ondas inovadoras no percurso da prática textual em dada sociedade, assim como reter, para cada época, as qualificações do horizonte de expectativa, que tornam instantâneas todas as épocas pregressas do fazer literário. /// This essay tries to establish correlations between Literature, History and History of Literature as viewed by Expectational aesthetics. Such a view shifts the traditional approach of literature from production to reception, extracting from the literary work a profusion of feelings in harmony with the prospect of each period, of each social group, of each cultural level. This makes it a movable structure capable of functioning in different contexts and of providing several answers, according to the demand of aesthetic truth. Thanks to this, the History of Literature is capable of incorporating the shifts of innovative waves in the trend to textual practice in a certain society, as well as retain, for each age, the qualifications of the horizon of expectation. This turns all the previous ages of literary making momentary.<br>

Abstract: How can an interpretive theory gain legitimacy in two cultural markets as different as France and the United States? This study examines the intellectual, cultural, institutional, and social conditions of legitimation of Jacques Derrida's work in the two countries and develops hypotheses about the process of legitimation of interpretive theories. The legitimation of Derrida's work resulted from a fit between it and highly structured cultural and institutional systems. In France, Derrida capitalized on the structure of the intellectual market by targeting his work to a large cultural public rather than to a shrinking group of academic philosophers. His work appealed to the intellectual public as a status symbol and as a novel and sophisticated way to deal with late 1960s politics. In the United States, Derrida and a group of prestigious literary critics reframed his theory and disseminated it in university departments of literature. His work was imported concurrently with the work of other French scholars with whom he shared a market. Derrida's support is more concentrated and stronger in one discipline than the support for other French intellectuals. In America, professional institutions and journals played a central role in the diffusion of his work, while cultural media were more central in France.<br>

Author(s): Zeitlin Larry J.<br>
Abstract: Recent developments in historical sociology emphasize the centrality of temporality to analysis and explanation. Narrative uses temporal order to organize information about events and to foster their understanding but is insufficiently systematic to substitute for sociological explanation. This article illustrates a new interpretative heuristic for the computer- assisted analysis of qualitative narrative sequences, "event-structure analysis,"that infuses narrative with greater rigor and explicitness. Through the analysis of a lynching that took place in Mississippi in 1930, this article shows how event-structure analysis can be used to build replicable and generalizable causal interpretations of events.<br>

Author(s): Goodwin Jeff<br>
Abstract: Network analysis is one of the most promising currents in sociological research, and yet it has never been subjected to a theoretically informed assessment and critique. This article outlines the theoretical presuppositions of network analysis. It also distinguishes between three different (implicit) models in the network literature of the interrelations of social structure, culture, and human agency. It concludes that only a strategy for historical explanation that synthesizes social structural and cultural analysis can adequately explain the formation, reproduction, and transformation of networks themselves. The article sketches the broad contours of such a theoretical synthesis in the conclusion.<br>

Author(s): Cooper Marilyn M.<br>
Abstract: Individual agency is necessary for the possibility of rhetoric, and especially for deliberative rhetoric, which enables the composition of what Latour calls a good common world. Drawing on neurophenomenology, this essay defines individual agency as the process through which organisms create meanings through acting into the world and changing their structure in response to the perceived consequences of their actions. Conceiving of agency in this way enables writers to recognize their rhetorical acts, whether conscious or nonconscious, as acts that make them who they are, that affect others, and that can contribute to the common good. Responsible rhetorical agency entails being open to and responsive to the meanings of concrete others, and thus seeing persuasion as an invitation to listeners as also always agents in persuasion.<br>

Abstract: La stèle du Bronzo est gravée d'un oiseau "levé", en plein vol, la tête tournée vers l'extérieurs, superposé à un filon de quartz blanc; une crosse, également traitée en champlevé, lui barre le passage. En première lecture, une identification plausible du genre volatile semblait prévaloir et le colombidé emportait notre adhésion. Mais une analyse plus posée et un effort de déconstruction graphique du motif permettront cette fois de reprendre et d'affiner la reconnaissance, en décrivant les différents filtres autorisant tel ou tel rejet de catégorie ou d'espèce, pour ne conserver en dernier ressort que les meilleurs prétendants à la seule confrontation possible, celle qui oppose les corvidés aux colombidés. La représentation du Bronzo est en définitive équivalente en substance et en structure aux scènes figurées sur les stèles voisines dans lesquelles un phallus s'oppose qu tranchant d'une lame de hache (Mané Rutual), tandis qu'un cachalot affronte la coalition des animaux et des outils de l'homme (Table des Marchand). A "flushed" bird is engraved on the Bronzo stela, in full flight, its head turned to the exterior, superposed over a white quartz vein; a crook, equally treated in cut-away engraving, bars its passage. At a first reading, a plausible identification of the bird seemed to prevail and the Columbidae met with our approval. However, more deliberate analysis and an effort at the graphic deconstruction of the motif allows the identification to be reconsidered and improved, by describing the various filters authorising the rejection of such or such a category, finally preserving the best claimants to the only possible confrontation, opposing Corvidae to Columbidae. The Bronzo representation is equivalent in substance and in structure to the scenes on the neighbouring stelae where a phallus is opposed to the sharp edge of an axe blade (Mané Rutual), while a sperm-whale confronts the coalition of animals and human tools (Table des Marchand). However Bronzo is a ~<br>

Abstract: C'est à ce niveau que se pose le problème de la transformation sociale, le passage d'une
formation sociale à une autre dans l'histoire. Une chose est de dire qu'il y détermination « en dernière
instance » de l'économique (Althusser [1965a]), autre chose est de savoir ce qui exactement, au sein
d'un mode de production, est décisif : la dynamique des forces productives ou celles les rapports de
production ? Les interprétations divergent aujourd'hui comme hier : il y a celles qui insistent sur l'auto-
nomie du développement des forces productives (Papaioannou [1983], p. 39-83) et celles qui insistent
davantage sur la dynamique spécifique des rapports de production à travers l'examen des luttes sociales,
ce qui laisse une place plus forte à la contingence (Maler [ 1995] ; Bensaid [ 1995] ; Vadée [ 1998]). Notre
article examine la structure sociale et la place du travail dans une société émancipée ; il n'examine pas
la genèse de cette société, de sorte que nous n'avons pas à trancher ici ce débat.<br>

Abstract: Literature discussing rhetoric is mainly concerned with rhetoric per se - its structure, and the categorization of arguments by kind. Rarely do rhetorical studies examine the actual effects on audiences, and auditors' reactions. On the other hand, sociological studies of scientific controversies look at rhetoric - or argumentation - in action, but with few references to rhetorical studies. The purpose of this paper is to integrate rhetorical studies into the sociology of technology in order to integrate the concept of action into discourse analysis. I intend to show how the use of discourse to enroll actors in a health technology is intimately linked to action. I deconstruct the promoters' strategy into two discursive components - the utility component and the fear-reduction component - to show how the rhetoric of expectations (utility) and representations (fear) contingently shape the fate of a technology.<br>

Abstract: Most analyses of developments in the religious discourse in Calvinist circles of Languedoc after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) have stressed its basic continuity. The expert comparison of sermons before 1685 with subsequent homilies at the end of the 17th century proves this "continuist" hypothesis to be false. Between the two periods, not only did the speakers change but also the structure of the discourse (transitive/intransitive) was modified as well as its relation to the text of reference (compromise on the meaning/ fundamentalism) and the function of speaking itself (intersocial saturation/intracommunity fragmentation). The pacified public discourse became a private one in a zone of textual violence.<br>

Author(s): Rubbers Benjamin<br>
Abstract: In order to give an account of the Congolese tragedy since independence, the inhabitants of Haut-Katanga often resort to four different narratives: the abandonment by Belgium; the biblical curse on Africans; the conspiracy of Western capitalism; or the alienation of life powers by Whites. Though these four stories offer different scenarios, they are all constructed with two types of actors - Whites and Congolese people. This article suggests that this racial/national frame finds its origins in colonial and national ideologies, which have left their mark on Haut-Katanga, and that it continues today to structure the narratives through which people remember their post-colonial history. Collective memory and racial/national identity are reciprocally constituted in these stories, but in different terms. They offer, accordingly, different ways of influencing the present.<br>

Abstract: Manipulations of time, ranging between moments and centuries, pervade Rogier van der Weyden's Columba Altarpiece. They occur mainly among elements that have been considered forthright iconographic details or unremarkable scenery, including a cityscape, the star of the Magi, a figure among the Magi's followers, and a beggar. While several such temporal expressions find interpretive resonance in Scripture, patristic commentary, and sermons, their collaborative density in the altarpiece contrives a uniquely animated structure of meaning. Among unusual visual alignments that solicit exegetical attention from an observer, precisely charged relationships project backward and forward through history.<br>

Abstract: Describing how my way of being in the world hindered or advanced my research, I suggest that a researcher's quality of life and mode of narrative inquiry may be closely related. The outcome seems to hinge on the inquirer's relationship to time and place in life and research. As all human beings, researchers use narrative to structure temporal complexity, only to find that this use contributes a complexity of its own. Efforts to overcome either pervade our lives as well as our forms of inquiry. I specify how such efforts endanger narrative inquiry, both in research and teacher education, and I struggle to find a language that accommodates a contextualized, narrative self as it reaches out to culturally shared conditions.<br>

Article Title: In the Dark Backward: Time in Pindaric Narrative<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i371935<br>
Date: 12 1, 1899<br>
Author(s): Zeilinski R. Drew<br>
Abstract: This paper considers the temporal relationship between account and story in the narrative passages of Pindar's odes. Highly selective, each narrative covers a vast extent of story-time, creating rapidly juxtaposed tableaux. The account typically begins near the end of the story, proceeding backwards by stages until it reaches the beginning. Thence it returns through all, some, or none of the intermediary stages until it has reached its starting point, beyond which it may then continue forward in time. Prophecy and foreshadowing provide a counterpoint to this basically analeptic structure. Different story lines, simultaneous events, and alternative possibilities all find their place in the narrative. The length of account-time is generally less than that of story-time and diminishes as the narrative proceeds. Repetition is necessitated by the backward and then forward order of combination as well as serving other purposes. Elaboration, when it occurs, serves to explain events that are improbable or inconsistent with the maxims contained in the non-narrative passages.<br>

Article Title: Weber and Freud: Vocation and Self-Acknowledgement<br>
Publisher: University of Alberta<br>
Issue: i275777<br>
Date: 10 1, 1971<br>
Author(s): Weber Tracy B.<br>
Abstract: Most comparisons between Weber and Freud merely identify them as part of larger cultural syndromes. In this paper, I argue that they most resemble each other in the centrality they give to the notion of vocation or adulthood. For both, the man truly possessed of his vocation is the touchstone by which reality is both understood and transformed. They differ, however, in the structure they attribute to vocation. Weber sees it as requiring that humans accept their own historical sociology as constitutive of their selves; Freud asserts that (some) humans can escape from their pasts and only thus become full human beings. /// En générale, les comparaisons entre Freud et Weber se réduisent a l'affirmation qu'ils font tous les deux parti d'une même culture fin-de-siècle bourgeoise. Par contre, je soutiens ici qu'ils se ressemblent le plus dans la centralité qu'ils donnent chacun aux idées de la vocation et de l'adulte. Pour chacun, l'homme de vocation est la source de la comprehension de la réalité et de la transformation de la réalité. Ils diffèrent dans leur sens de la structure de la vocation. Pour Weber, l'homme de la vocation prends sur lui-même son passé et la sociologie de son histoire. Pour Freud, c'est plûtot une question d'echapper à son histoire, quelque chose que seulement certains pevent accomplir.<br>

Author(s): Gunnemann Jon P.<br>
Abstract: Accepting MacIntyre's teleological argument that the notion of individual rights is an invention or fiction, the article argues, against MacIntyre, that such a fiction may be interpreted as a creative response to the social requirements of modernity. Such rights language discloses the essential features of modernity but also the underlying teleological and moral structure of all human association. But whether rights language is perceived as a fall from morality or as a creative differentiation of moral language depends on a reading of history and especially on the interpretation of the Enlightenment project. Jürgen Habermas is used for an alternative reading of the Enlightenment and the relation of rights to the normative teleology of language itself. But both readings of history turn out to be theodicies, dependent upon hidden theological assumptions. Whether a society centered on a notion of rights can be governed by teleology can only be answered theologically.<br>

Article Title: A Preface to Ethics: Global Dynamics and the Integrity of Life<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000937<br>
Date: 4 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: This essay outlines a new preface for ethics demanded by the massive developments of the global age. It does so in and through the comparative use of "myths" to explicate the lived structure of experience. The essay begins by isolating main features of global dynamics, including proximity, the compression of the world and the expansion of consciousness, and also global, cultural reflexivity. In the second step of the "preface," it is argued that globality itself is a moral space in which peoples must orient their lives. It is a moral space defined by the massive extension of human power in the modern world. In light of the challenge that global dynamics and the extension of human power now pose, the essay then isolates, methodologically, options for developing a global ethics, and advocates a distinctly hermeneutical approach. This approach is practiced in the last section of the "preface" by engaging ethically the biblical "myth" of creation and its reinterpretation in an epitome of Jesus's Torah teaching. The intention is to show how current religious thought can speak to massive challenges in a distinctive way. It is, again, to offer a preface to ethics.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000938<br>
Date: 7 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Nussbaum Martha<br>
Abstract: In "Upheavals of Thought", Martha Nussbaum offers a theory of the emotions. She argues that emotions are best conceived as thoughts, and she argues that emotion-thoughts can make valuable contributions to the moral life. She develops extensive accounts of compassion and erotic love as thoughts that are of great moral import. This paper seeks to elucidate what it means, for Nussbaum, to say that emotions are forms of thought. It raises critical questions about her conception of the structure of emotion, and about her conception of compassion, in particular. Finally, the paper seeks to show how analyzing the structure, as well as the moral value, of the emotions ultimately requires entering the realm of religious ethics.<br>

Author(s): Hellweg Joseph<br>
Abstract: This article explores the hunting aesthetics of initiated Jula hunters of Côte d'Ivoire who call themselves dozos. It explains how their hunting aesthetic structures their relationship to Islam and the Ivoirian state. Although many Africans approach Islam in the context of tensions between local ritual traditions and modernizing Muslim reform, dozos approach Islam the way they approach the forests where they hunt, assimilating to both in order to tame them. They organize their hunting activities around an aesthetic centred on notions of sweetness and fullness; their contraries, difficulty and emptiness; and the process of mimetic transformation (shape-shifting) that mediates between these extremes. With these categories dozos assimilate themselves to and appropriate power from the forest to kill game. They also link themselves to pre-Qur'anic Muslim figures to legitimize themselves as Muslims. More recently, they tried to assimilate to the Ivoirian state to become a parallel police force. Stories of their tutelary spirit, Manimory, and the texts of their hunting songs, incantations, and epics encode diverse ways for dozos to relate to Islam, leaving room for dozos to eschew it as well. Their texts reveal a dynamic sense of history that defies classification in terms of tradition, modernity or postmodernity. /// Cet article examine l'esthétique de la chasse chez les chasseurs initiés julas de Côte d'Ivoire, qui se donnent le nom de dozos.

Abstract: Com este texto o autor procura uma resposta para a seguinte pergunta: "Que tipo de método poderá confirmar ou infirmar a hipótese segundo a qual o acto educativo é, no seu núcleo e na sua origem entitativa, confrontação violenta entre duas consciências?". Depois de esclarecer que esta hipótese inter-pretativa da educação tem em mira, não explicar ou descrever a realidade educacional na sua positividade, mas compreender o seu eidos ou essência constitutiva, o autor decide-se, na esteira de Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Duméry, Dufrenne, Levinas e Derrida, pelo método fenomenológico. Para efectuar a exploração filosófica que essa pergunta impõe, o método instituído por Husserl faculta, ao invés dos métodos positivistas e analíticos, uma visão global do fenómeno educativo numa intuição que se atinge depois de realizada uma redução eidética. Além disso, o método fenomenológico é entendido como o mais adequado para desvelar uma realidade cuja textura é tecida por relações intersubjectivas. Todo o texto desenvolve uma sequência argumentativa tendente a mostrar e a demonstrar quer a natureza, quer as potencialidades heurísticas do método fenomenológico aplicado à educação. Só este método poderá evidenciar a estrutura universal e necessária da educação: uma relação violenta entre duas consciências. /// Dans son texte l'auteur cherche une réponse pour la question suivante: "que type de méthode pourra confirmer ou infirmer l'hypothèse selon laquelle l'acte éducatif est en son centre et en son origine confrontation violente entre deux consciences"?

Abstract: Na la meditação «em que se pretende não falar de valor», o autor esforça-se por manter um discurso linear sobre o interesse humano de pensar e agir relativamente a um tema tão fundamental, que parece quase impossivel evitar a «petitio principii». Pode-se sintetizar a primeira meditação nestas duas alíneas: (a) O desejo de felicidade é o grande motor da busca de meios para uma vida sempre melhor; (b) O ser humano estrutura a sua ideia de felicidade, vida, meios adequados, objectivos de graus diversos, em função dos conhecimentos de que disōpe. A 2 a meditação reconhece que a neutralidade de discurso da 1a meditação não teve éxito. As palavras são extremamente analógicas e pressupōem um «pensamento e discurso ocultos» , coniventes com o conceito de valor, que se pretendia evitar. O desejo de plenitude da qualidade de vida implica o acto, por vezes inconsciente, de valorização. /// The 1.st meditation aims to maintain a discourse independent of the concept of value. Like in an « Impossible mission», we face a project that easily forces the adventurer to return over his lost pathways in a desert. I. e., falling in a «petitio principii». The result of that l. st meditation could be synthesized as it follows: (a) The desire of hapiness is what forces us to search a better and better quality of life; (b) Human beings structure their idea of hapiness. life, adequate means to various kinds of objectives, according to their available knowledge. The 2. nd meditation recognizes the failure of the searched neutral discourse in the l. st meditation: its words and concepts exemplify a very deep analogy and reveal an occult system of thought and discourse, where the notion of value is unmistakably implicated. The desire of a quality of life in all its richness implies, although some times unconsciously, the act of evaluation.<br>

Abstract: Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy is most well known for its phenomenology of interpretation in the Geisteswissenschaften or humanities. It moves Heidegger's ' As–structure ' of understanding through an appreciation of the primacy of questioning to the dialogical structure of interpretation as mediated by language. This phenomenology grounds a linguistic ontology, which rehabilitates metaphysics as a renewal of the tradition of a metaphysics of light, without transgressing the limits of phenomenological accessibility. The result is a metaphysics of finitude that is undogmatically open to the infinite. At the heart of this linguistic ontology is the speculative structure by which language-in-use is related to being in a way that overcomes all kinds of representationalism and of naive picture-thinking (including empiricism and idealism). Hans-Georg Gadamer's ontology is postmodern yet genuinely metaphysical. /// A filosofia hermenêutica de Hans-Georg Gadamer é particularmente conhecida pela sua fenomenologia da interpretação no âmbito das Ciências do Espírito (Geisteswissenschaften). Pela importancia que dá à primazia da interrogação, Gadamer transforma a estrutura heideggeriana do como da compreensão numa estrutura dialógica da interpretação mediada pela linguagem. Esta fenomenologia fundamenta uma ontologia linguística, a qual constitui uma rehabilitação da metafisica sob a forma de uma reactualização da tradição que é a metafisica da luz, mas sem contudo transgredir os limites impostos pela acessibilidade fenomenológica da questão. Daí resulta uma metafisica da finitude aberta ao infinito de forma não dogmática. No centro desta ontologia linguística está uma estrutura especulativa segundo a qual a linguagem-uso se relaciona com o ser de forma a que todo e qualquer tipo de representacionalismo ou pensamento-imagem (onde se incluem tanto o empirismo como o idealismo) seja superado. O artigo visa, pois, demonstrar até que ponto a ontologia de Hans-Georg Gada~<br>

Abstract: The view of language is greatly changed from early modern philosophy to later modern philosophy and to postmodern philosophy. The linguistic question in early modern philosophy, which is characterized by rationalism and empiricism, is discussed in this paper. Linguistic phenomena are not at the center of philosophical reflections in early modern philosophy. The subject of consciousness is at the center of the philosophy, which makes language serve purely as an instrument for representing thoughts. Locke, Leibniz and Descartes consider language from a representationalist point of view. To them, language itself is idealized and represents thought as if it were thought representing itself. Like the structural linguist Saussure, the founders of phenomenology and analytical philosophy give much attention to the logical or static structure of language, and stick up for the representationalism of early modern philosophy. However, their successors refuse to accept this attitude, meaning the final collapse of representationalism. /// 从早期现代哲学到后期现代哲学再到后现代哲学，在语言观上产生了重大的 变化。早期现代哲学以唯理论和经验论为典型形式。语言现象没有成为该时期哲学 反思的中心问题; 意识主体处于哲学的中心，这使得语言仅仅充当着表象思想的工 具。洛克、莱布尼茨和笛卡尔都从表象论的角度看待语言，在他们那里，语言本身 被观念化了，它们表象思想，就像思想在表象它自身。正像结构语言学家索绪尔一 样，现象学和分析哲学的创始人关注的都是语言的逻辑结构或静态结构，他们延续 了早期现代哲学的表象论，但他们的后继者拒绝接受这种态度，而这意味着最终突 破表象论。<br>

Abstract: This paper is an anthropological reading of mythical and historical texts aimed at exploring the dynamics by which archaic Egyptian cosmology was constructed and reconstructed. Using Dumont's ideas of hierarchy and Sahlins' work on cultural reproduction, the study presents a synchronie and diachronic analysis of the underlying themes and principles upon which archaic Egyptian cosmology was constructed. The opposition of visible/invisible is the common principle around which other principles or sets of oppositions are clustered. The study shows that archaic Egyptian cosmology underwent a transformation from a structure based on natural entities into socially significant cosmological system. The paper further elaborates the striking homology between the archaic social cosmology represented in Osirian mythology and Christianity in the early centuries of the Christian era.<br>

Abstract: Si certaines formes-sonate ou certains Andante de Mozart et Beethoven ont la réputation d'être « dramatiques » et de porter une expression fondée sur l'opposition entre tension et détente, est-il possible d'y détecter des règles narratives ? C'est la question à laquelle l'article tente de répondre, en se servant du modèle taxinomique proposé par A. J. Greimas. L'articulation des signifiés à l'intérieur d'un micro-univers sémantique est décrite au travers de la représentation de certains types de passion et de caractères musicaux (topiques, topoï, affects, etc.) détectés dans les œuvres de Mozart par Jozsef Ujfalussy. L'analyse de « la forme du contenu » , c'est-à-dire de la structure des signifiés dans un mouvement de symphonie de Mozart (le premier mouvement de la Symphonie en ut majeur, KV 338) ou de sonate de Beethoven (le deuxième mouvement de la Sonate op. 2 n°3) à l'aide du vocabulaire expressif codifié de l'époque, permet de démontrer la présence quasi « littérale » des rapports de contradiction, contrariété et de présupposition décrits par le fameux « carré sémiotique » de Greimas. On y découvre l'existence symbolique, dans ces mouvements d'œuvres instrumentales, des deux grandes classes de récit de la Sémantique structurale de Greimas, en fonction du maintien ou du refus de la situation de départ. If some sonata forms or some Andantes by Mozart or Beethoven can be described as « dramatic » , and cany an expression based on tension and relaxation, is it possible to detect in them narrative rules ? This is the question which the present article tries to answer, on the basis of the taxinomic model proposed by A. J. Greimas. The articulation of signified within a semantic micro-universe is described through the representation of types of passion and of musical characters detected in Mozart's works by Jozsef Ujfalussy. The analysis of the « content forms » , i.e. of the structure of signified in a Symphony movement by Mozart (KV 338, first movement) or in a sona~<br>

Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Author(s): Lazar Judith<br>
Abstract: Après les nombreuses tentatives menées par les sociologues pour élaborer une analyse permettant de saisir la relation dialectique de la structure sociale et des acteurs A. Giddens propose une « théorie générale » centrée sur la notion de « structuration » . Le postulat fondamental de sa théorie se constitue autour de la notion de « dualité de structure » , en référence à la nature recursive des pratiques sociales. Selon cette thèse, les systèmes sociaux sont produits par des acteurs, qui par leurs activités mêmes contribuent à la constitution et à la reconstruction permanente de ces mêmes systèmes de rapports sociaux. Les agents et les structures ne sont pas considérés comme indépendants, ils se lient dans une relation mutuelle complexe et complémentaire. After the numerous attempts on the part of sociologists to elaborate a theoretical approach that incorporates the duality of structure and human agency, A. Giddens proposes a « general theory » focused on the notion of « structuration ». Rather than seeing action and structure as oppositions within a dualism, he suggests to regard them as the complementary terms of the duality of structure. Every act of production is at the same time an act of reproduction : the structures that render an action possible are, in the performance ofthat action, reproduced.<br>

Abstract: A partir de la conception de la biographie développée par A. L. Strauss et de la philosophie du temps de G. H. Mead, trois niveaux d'organisation du temps de l'expérience biographique sont mis au jour. D'abord en examinant comment s'articulent l'irréversibilité du temps et le caractère partiellement indéterminé du passé. Toute restitution rétrospective de l'expérience biographique s'inscrit dans ce cadre. Ensuite, ce temps biographique, constitué dans l'après-coup au sein d'interactions avec autrui, se structure principalement autour des événements marquants, lesquels forment le plus souvent un calendrier privé. Mais, avant cela, ces événements ont leur temporalité propre liée à leur parcours sémantique : la constitution du sens de l'événement est ellemême un processus temporel partiellement contingent - la réduction du tranchant de l'événement ne va pas de soi - et la stabilisation d'un sens appropriable par la personne est la condition pour que l'événement qui « a été » ne « soit plus », que Von puisse tourner la page. Out of the conception of biographical time as developed by A. L. Strauss and G. H. Mead's philosophy of time, three levels for organizing the time of biographical experiences come to light. First of all, any retrospective reconstruction of a biographical experience involves examining how time's irreversibility is linked to the partly indeterminate nature of the past. Next, this biographical time, reconstructed afterwards through interactions with others, mainly takes shape around significant events, which usually form a private calendar. Previously however, these events had their own temporality linked to their semantic itinerary : the construction of an event's meaning is itself a partly contingent temporal process — reducing the cutting edge of an event cannot be taken for granted — and the stabilization of a meaning that the person can appropriate is the condition for the event that « was » to be « no longer » , so that one can be able to make af~<br>

Abstract: Nous nous proposons ici de réfléchir à la question suivante : Comment expliquer le fait que les fondateurs du « programme fort », Barry Bames et David Bloor, insistent depuis quelques années pour dire qu'ils n'ont jamais nié l'influence de la « réalité » sur la formation des connaissances scientifiques et qu'en fait ils ont été mal compris de leurs lecteurs ? Alors que Bloor tente d'expliquer les malentendus en les situant complètement du côté du récepteur, en invoquant une loi psychologique dite de « conventionalisation » proposée par Frederic Charles Bartlett, nous voulons esquisser ici une explication complémentaire qui se situe du côté de l'émetteur et prend au sérieux la structure argumentaire des textes. We propose in this paper to answer the following question : How can we explain the fact that the founders of the « Strong Program », Barry Bames and David Bloor, insisted, over the last couple of years, to say that they have never denied the role played by « reality » in the construction of scientific knowledge, and thus have been misunderstood by their readers ? Whereas Bloor explains these misunderstandings by invoking a psychological law of « conventionalization » due to Frederic Charles Bartlett, thus locating the source of the problem on the receiver's (reader's) side, we suggest here a complementary explanation taking into account the argumentative structure of the text itself, hence situating the origin of the confusion on the writer's side.<br>

Abstract: My article contends that Dostoevsky's short novel, The Gambler, is marked by a fundamental conflict of temporalities. While the novel seems to embrace bourgeois optimism and the hopeful narrative temporality that serves as its most resourceful literary embodiment, it also seems to adhere to a strikingly anti-teleological and circular narrative structure. This affirmation and denial of temporality as linear, purposive movement is the appropriate narrative emblem of the peculiar world of Roulettenburg and its inhabitants, a world where beginning and end continually risk equivalence and where the parameters of structure have therefore begun to dissolve. What emerges is an acceptance of inevitable boredom, of permanent failure to resolve conflict, that is both constricting and liberating. As an artistic principle of form, this failure declares a "poetics" of hesitation whose temporal dimensions brilliantly reflect the fundamentally ambivalent eros of the gambler, the latter's inability to accept or escape from a debilitating presentness. In creating this kind of narrative conflict, Dostoevsky reverses the characteristic romantic obsession with the allure of pregnant immediacy that is an illusion of god-like vision to which only a most ungod-like being could succumb.<br>

Abstract: Three different concepts of the subject of sociology considera to be dominant in sociological thinking are discussed: the ,socia' as an external, as an internal, and as a serial structure. Comparing these concepts the notion of social structures seems to be dissolving: from a desubstantialization and desubjectivation to a destructuralization and detotalization of the ,social'. This raises the question of the end of sociology.<br>

Abstract: L'éthique de la situation (Situationsethik) est une tendance diffuse, qui s'infiltre dans les systèmes éthiques les plus divers, plutôt qu'une doctrine aux arêtes bien nettes. Il faut cependant qu'on détermine son idée et il semble que ses positions extrêmes se prêtent le mieux à une clarification de son contenu. Elle s'oppose à toute éthique normative abstraite et universelle. Par contraste apparaissent certaines lignes maîtresses, au moins négatives. Les systèmes principalement visés sont le rationalisme, qu'il soit formel ou à contenu matériel, l'éthique sociologique positiviste (Science des mœurs de Durkheim, Lévy-Bruhl...) et toute éthique de l'essence. L'abstraction et l'universalité, l'immutabilité et l'extrinsécisme des normes morales sont les caractères mis en question. Nous nous attachons à montrer que l'éthique de l'essence, telle que la conçoit la tradition chrétienne, ne comporte pas nécessairement les caractères incriminés au sens péjoratif ou la „Situationsethik” les entend. Nous croyons même qu'une éthique de l'essence de par son statut même - certaines formes historiques peuvent être des déviations - tient compte de la situation concrète et historique. Elle le fait de deux manières bien différentes, d'abord en ce qu'elle intègre dans ses impératifs universels les situations les plus diverses, et en second lieu en ce qu'elle pose comme principe obligatoire et universel que chacun doit se laisser conduire par certains impératifs moraux, que lui seul peut voir, du fait qu'ils tiennent à sa situation unique, non seulement de fait mais en principe. En effet, une éthique de l'essence transpose en impératifs moraux aussi bien ce qui appartient à la structure essentielle de l'homme (impératifs absolument universels), que ce qui relève de la contingence, telles les circonstances extérieures et intérieures, qui sont susceptible de se répéter, si pas de fait au moins de droit (impératifs relativementuniversels).

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: Mise radicalement en question par l'accusation de l'épître aux Corinthiens : „La sagesse du monde est folie devant Dieu.” (I Cor. 3,19), la raison humaine doit chercher une méthode, qui lui permettra de parvenir à une conscience de soi, capable d'assumer cette accusation. Cette méthode ne peut être que la réflexion, à laquelle les protagonistes de la phénoménologie, aussi bien que ceux de l'analyse reflexive, font appel. Thévenaz entamera une étude approfondie et critique de ces deux méthodes pour en garder ce qui lui semble valable. Ce faisant il parviendra à une position intermédiaire. Husserl, en épistémologue, ignorant toute conscience de soi, même implicite, reconnaît l'inténtionnalité comme structure unique de la raison humaine. Aussi, pour découvrir et expliciter le sujet concret et intentionnellement lié au monde, il ne lui reste que la solution de projeter cette liaison dans le champ transcendantal, qui se déploie sous les yeux d'un spectateur impartial. Ainsi surgit une nouvelle facticité qui reste nécessairement irréfléchie. Thévenaz accepte volontiers les avantages de cette méthode. Non seulement elle permet de dépasser l'opposition idéalisme-réalisme, mais en plus elle échappe au formalisme kantien, en nous livrant le concret comme tel, le vécu, l'être comme rencontre. Cependant, en insistant exclusivement sur l'intentionnalité, elle met en question cette même intentionnalité. Le sujet concret, doublure du moi transcendantal et intentionnel, redevient ce qu'il était avant la réduction, un oeil sans intériorité braqué sur un nouveau spectacle, le champ transcendantal. Le sujet concret n'y apporte aucun apport constitutif. Le concret s'échappe à nouveau et la naïveté de la „natürliche Einstellung” n'est pas vaincue, mais consacrée. Sartre, quoiqu'il admette une conscience (de) soi, résultant d'un acte de néantisation radicale, se heurte à la même difficulté. Le sujet concret échappe à la réflexion à cause du dédoublement inéluctable inhérent à cette réfle~<br>

Abstract: Several representatives of structuralism relate the concept of structure to the langue of Ferdinand de Saussure. And so a linguistic approximation to structuralism seems possible. Such an approximation makes sense for another reason : because of the growing importance of transformational linguistics and the criticism of structuralism expressed by Noam Chomsky. In this article the main ideas of de Saussure and Chomsky are analysed, resulting in the confrontation of langue (de Saussure) and competence (Chomsky). Chomsky's criticism of langue as "a store of concepts" seems to be correct. The relevance of this criticism for the central structuralist topic that individual man, his freedom and his history are of minor importance, is pointed out.<br>

Abstract: L'accord entre psychanalyse et philosophie ne s'est toujours pas fait. Pourtant les psychanalystes s'intéressent à Heidegger et il y a des philosophes heideggeriens qui lisent Freud et Lacan. Les thèmes d'intérêt commun se situent tous autour de la problématique du langage : la découverte d'un décentrement, la „fin de la métaphysique” et un certain parallélisme entre l'impensé et l'inconscient. On ne peut pas expliquer le rapport entre philosophie et psychanalyse dans les termes de la problématique traditionnelle philosophie-science. La psychanalyse met en question aussi bien la philosophie que la science en les prenant comme un discours qui n'est pasessentiellement différent du discours du patient dans la cure analytique. Ce discours, c'est l'homme qui le tient pour un autre ; en parlant il veut faire passer l'image de soi-même et du monde qui leur donne objectivité et identité. Mais l'homme n'est pas maître de ce discours, il parle en fragments qui appartiennent à une légende déjà existante. Il ne revient pas à l'analyste de nier ou d'affirmer ce discours, il n'a d'égards que pour sa continuité. La philosophie aussi bien que la science, il les prend comme des discours qui n'ont un sens que dans la mesure où leur progression porte des fruits. En prétendant qu'aussi bien la philosophie spéculative que la phénoménologie se meuvent dans l'imaginaire, la psychanalyse mène inévitablement à la question du statut de la philosophie. S'agit-il là d'un système d'affirmations fondées ou plutôt d'une interrogation sans fin ? Mais la critique psychanalytique porte aussi sur cette interrogation en tant que celle-ci est un moment du discours philosophique. C'est en tant que discours que la philosophie heideggerienne se rapproche de la psychanalyse. Elle annonce la „fin de la philosophie”, de la philosophie comme fait historique qui a pris fin avec Hegel et la science moderne. Il y a eu des philosophes, mais leur activité philosophique a été dominée de part et d'autre par une inst~<br>

Abstract: 1. Le but de cette étude est d'élucider quelques traits de la philosophie hégélienne, comme „technique de la consolation”, pour en tirer quelques conclusions pratiques quant à la situation de la philosophie et de la théologie contemporaines, en particulier en ce qui concerne l'élaboration du problème de l'angoisse. Nous essayons d'y parvenir en partant d'une esquisse rapide du genre littéraire antique de la „littérature de la consolation”. Et ensuite par une interprétation de quelques traits de la pensée post-hégélienne, en particulier de Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche et Freud. 2. En effet, la „raison élargie” impliquée dans l'entreprise philosophique de Hegel ne se laisse-t-elle pas interpréter comme l'effort de pratiquer une technique d'assimilation et de dépassement de l'histoire ? Et ne représente-t-elle pas dès lors une reprise prestigieuse de deux traits fondamentaux de la philosophie consolatrice antique, l'un étant la „technè alupias” (l'art de consoler) et l'autre la „ préméditation" (des souffrances) ? 3. A partir de cette hypothèse d'interprétation, les réactions des auteurs cités se comprendaient comme une révision de la fonction consolatrice de la philosophie. En fait nous nous sommes restreints à signaler le déplacement du sens de quelques concepts fondamentaux, en particulier des concepts de „travail”, „réalité”, „angoisse” et „souffrance”. Par ce déplacement la raison s'est „élargie” de nouveau, mais non point pour arriver à un nouveau couronnement ou une espèce de super-structure philosophique. Au contraire : une nouvelle dimension, d'un tout autre ordre, fut symbolisée par plusieurs auteurs dans la figure de l'enfant. 4. En ce symbole une certaine critique de la conception hégélienne de la philosophie se résume, nous semble-t-il, comme en une synthèse paradoxale d'une „ excroissance" (Ricoeur) et d'une „discrétion” qui se manifestent à la fois. La place centrale de la libre raison dans l'homme est fortement contestée. Et pourtant : dans cette même e~<br>

Abstract: Nous essayons d'éclaircir quelques principes fondamentaux de la grammaire transformationelle de Chomsky à partir de Derrida et de Lacan. Nous tâchons d'approfondir deux problèmes : le premier concerne la portée de ceci que la possibilité de la déviation est donnée comme inhérente à l'institution même de la règle grammaticale; le second a trait au statut et au contenu du tiers sujet en tant que fondement de la structure intersubjective du langage. Primo : Selon Chomsky, une grammaire idéale doit être capable de générer toutes les phrases — et rien que les phrases — bien formées à partir d'un nombre fini de règles. Une grammaire idéale et cohérente ne peut traiter les déviations que comme des possibilités purement accidentelles : une déviation n'aurait pas dû y être; elle n'aurait même pas pu y être. Bref, le risque d'un échec n'est pas interrogé comme prédicat essentiel de la grammaire. À en croire Derrida, on devrait regarder les conséquences qui découlent du fait qu'un risque possible est toujours possible. Comme les déviations présupposent une règle, chaque règle présuppose le risque d'un échec. La possibilité d'un échec est la condition nécessaire d'une règle grammaticale. Mais il s'agit d'une condition très spécifique, puisqu'elle rend impossible cela même qu'elle rend possible. Ni la grammaire, ni la déviation ne sont originaires, mais bien la différance entre les deux, ce qui veut dire qu'à l'origine de la production du sens il n'y a pas une grammaire idéale. Nous avons élaboré cette remarque de Derrida à partir d'une analyse de la métaphore, précisément parce que celle-ci ne peut être intégrée dans un système grammatical préalable. Secundo : la présence implicite d'un sujet compétent chez Chomsky doit expliquer pourquoi le sens ne dépend pas de l'arbitraire d'un sujet empirique. Chaque parole présuppose un Tiers, un Autre qui transcende les positions de destinateur et de destinataire. Mais, pour Chomsky, il s'agit d'un sujet idéal capable de déterminer a prio~<br>

Article Title: HISTORISCHE INTERPRETATIE EN DE VERBEELDING VAN DE CULTUUR: OVER HUIZINGA'S VISIE OP GESCHIEDENIS EN DE HISTORISCHE SENSATIE<br>

Abstract: What do historians do when they interpretate the past ? Narrativists hold that they organize factual statements into a meaningful whole, the story, which itself has nothing to do with past reality. Others, like David Carr and Paul Ricoeur, defend a relation between the narrative whole and the experience of time. An altogether different approach to the question of the unity of history is that of Johan Huizinga. Huizinga does not place the meaningful unity of history in the text, but in the aesthetic conception of the past. The past is not like a reservoir of signs, which acquire meaning by being put in a self-invented order, nor is it a story-like structure which can be interpretated and translated like a text. History is a cultural reality which we experience as full of symbolic meaning. Interpretation is the search ofthat meaning. The centre of historical conciousness is not in the story, but in the mental imageswe create when we see historical objects, search through documents or read a historians interpretation. In this article I try to clarify Huizinga's concept of the „historische sensatie“ by relating Huizinga's ideas to those of the Dutch writer Lodewijk van Deyssel. Secondly I try to show how the imagination of the (past) world can be regarded as a fundamental form of truth by confronting Huizinga's ideas with those of the philosopher Martin Heidegger and artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Vincent van Gogh.<br>

Abstract: In his hauntology or 'ghost theory', Derrida both subscribes to and rejects Marx's famous exposition on commodities fetishism. He subscribes to Marx's analysis of the world of merchandise as a shadowy world which covers up how exactly society produces this merchandise. His rejection pertains to the invariant structure typical of all discussions of fetishism. This structure, in which the fetish is determined as a substitute for the real item, presupposes a determinable distinction between substitute and the real item. It will be shown that Marx's concept of fetish does indeed rest on this presupposition, because it assumes that the utility value of the commodity can be dissociated fromits market value. Derrida's hauntology wants to retain the critical dimension of Marx'sexposition on fetishism, without incorporating its intrinsic ontology.<br>

Author(s): Jacques Francis<br>
Abstract: Différence, référence, communicabilité : trois mots-clés pour dessiner la structure originaire et élémentaire de la signifiance. Or, l'interrogation change de nature quand on la déplace du signifié vers le sens, puis vers la signifiance. Il ne s'agit ni d'une action, ni d'un événement, mais d'un processus. Trois conditions nécessaires : présence d'un matériel signifiant (sonore, graphique, électronique) ; aptitude à se référer à une réalité extérieure ; énonciateurs en relation binaire entre lesquels et pour lesquels les énoncés signifient. L'auteur examine les conséquences de leur considération groupée en philosophie du langage. Difference, reference and communicability are three key-words to outline the original and elementary structure of« signifying ». Now, the nature of philosophical interrogation changes when it shifts from the saussurian « signifié » towards the meaning, a fortiori towards signifying. It is neither an action nor an event but a process. Three conditions are necessary : the presence of specific material (whether acoustic, graphic or electronical) ; an aptitude to refer to an outside reality ; speakers standing in binary relationship. The writer examines the consequences of considering the constraints as gathered in a philosophy of language.<br>

Abstract: At the heart of this article is a structural approach to narrative, based on the work of Propp, Labov, van Dijk, Halliday, and others. The article highlights the structural features of narrative—basically, the organization of the genre around the semantic template actor-action-actor (syntactically rendered as subject-verb-object but where, in narrative, the subject is typically a social actor and the verb a social action) and the modifiers of each element of this triplet, such as time and space of action—and shows how to implement this structure in a computer environment and how to use this methodological tool in socio-historical research (namely, the rise of Italian fascism, 1919-22). But, taking a cue from Halliday's cover jacket of his An Introduction to Functional Grammar, with its representation of a color circle, the paper takes the reader on an intellectual journey from Newton to Goethe—and the quality versus quantity debate—to Goethe and Propp, to end, back home, with Simmel and Weber.<br>

Abstract: Since its first publication, A Costa dos Murmúrios has attracted the critics' attention to the paradox of the explicit denial of its own authority over the historical facts that are part of the narration and its implicit, if qualified, affirmation of the same authority. This article also focuses on the sort of subliminal tension but from the angle of the literary construction of emotions, rather than examining either the poetics of historiographic metafiction or the role of memory in the narration of the past. Analyzing various aspects of A Costa dos Murmúrios (such as the predominant points of view, the structure of the narrative, the disintegration of the characters' identities, the emotional impact of a few vivid scences, the personalization of national events), a case is made for reading this novel as an intimate chronicle of historical facts.<br>

Abstract: The article begins with an analysis of the concept of identity and a description of two theoretical traditions which lie at the source of this concept and which determine the operationalisations of the identity concept within the context of social change (G.H. Mead and E. Erikson). The author then goes on to discuss the problems which evolve from the many applications of the concept of identity to analysis of collectives. The concept of collective identity is outlined and four basic ways of understanding this concept in contemporary sociology are discussed. The author refers in his presentation to the works of F. Barth, R. Turner, A. Touraine, S. N. Eisenstadt, E. Gellner, and A. Kłoskowska. The author concludes his article with several comments focusing on the relationships between social change and collective identity and he refers to those approaches which either stress the relative independence of identity formulae and social structure or even view the evolving patterns of identity as a factor contributing to social change.<br>

Abstract: Multiculturalism is a term spreading in the West during the 1960s to indicate respect, tolerance and defence of cultural minorities. The idea of multiculturalism has become a collective imaginary ("all different, all equals"). It has generated a political ideology supporting an inclusive citizenship towards "different" cultures. After being adopted as official policy in many Countries, multiculturalism has generated more negative than positive effects (fragmenting the society, separating the minorities and fostering cultural relativism). As a political doctrine, it seems harder and harder to be put into practice. At its place, today we talk of interculturality. But this expression too seems quite vague and uncertain. This essay discusses on the possible alternatives to multiculturalism, asking itself whether the way of interculturality can be a solution or not. The Author's thesis is that the theory of interculturality has the advantage to stress the inter, namely what lies in between different cultures. But it does not possess yet the conceptual and effective means to understand and handle the problems of the public sphere, when the different cultures express cultural values radically conflictual between them. The troubles of interculturality result from two lacks: an insufficient reflexivity inside the single cultures, and the lack of a relational interface between the different cultures (between the carrier subjects). Modern western Reason created a societal structure (lib-lab) promoting neither the first nor the second one. In fact, it neutralizes them, because it faces the dilemmas of values inside the cultural diversities through criteria of ethical indifference. Such criteria set reflexivity to zero, preventing individuals to understand the deepest reasons of the vital experience of the others. Reason is emptied of its meaning and of its understanding capability. To go over the failures of multiculturalism and the fragilities of interculturality, a lay approa~<br>

Article Title: The Making of a Mnemonic Space: Meiji Shrine Memorial Art Gallery 1912-1936<br>

Abstract: This paper argues that Meiji Shrine Memorial Art Gallery (Meiji Jingū Seitoku Kinen Kaigakan) was constructed as a mnemonic space, and that its construction concerned the making of history. The purpose of the gallery was to provide a historical narration of the Meiji period through 80 paintings depicting Emperor Meiji's life. It took over 20 years from the initial planning of the gallery to its completion in 1936 and, throughout the course of its creation, different acts of remembering took place both inside and outside the space of the gallery. It was the lengthy process of gallery construction, rather than the place itself that shaped what was to be remembered. Historiographers and painters strove to portray "real" history in the gallery's paintings. Historiographers investigated historical facts and determined the gallery's picture topics. Importantly, most of them were responsible for compiling two national historiographies, Dai Nihon ishin shiryō in the Ministry of Education and Meiji tennōki in the Imperial Household Agency. For the painters, the challenge lay in determining "realistic" styles of painting adequate to the representation of "real" history. Furthermore, physical constructors of the gallery played a part in perfecting its narrative structure, such as spatial arrangement of the pictures. The contrast between the expectations of the gallery's creators and the experience of the visitors, in terms of how the gallery was viewed as well as how it was to be viewed, is also the subject of this paper.<br>

Abstract: À la suite de la phénoménologie de Michel Henry ce texte analyse la structure fondamentale de la vie auto-affective se supportant toujours elle-même pour être co-originairement également la jouissance d'elle-même. En toute souffrance il faut alors reconnaître cette vie transcendentalement individuée qui veut vivre son « Je-Peux » fondamental en toutes ses modalisations. Toute « thérapie » se trouve ainsi plongée dans un « pathos-avec » dont l'exercice concret se révèle dans ce « regard transcendantal » sur la souffrance d'autrui sans méconnaître les possibilités de la science médicale qui reste, cependant, soumise à cette « communauté intro-pathique » primordiale. De cette manière, une certaine « praxis phénoménologique » peut affronter alors les défis de la civilisation d'aujourd'hui. Following the phenomenology of Michel Henry, this paper analyses the fundamental structure of the auto-affective life, always supporting itself for being equally co-originally the self-enjoyment. Therefore, one must acknowledge in every suffering this transcendentally individuated life which wants to live its fundamental "I can" in all its modalisations. Then, every "therapy" is plunged into a "pathos-with" whose concrete exercise reveals itself in this "transcendental view" on the other's suffering, without ignoring the possibilities of the medical science, that remains, however, subjected to this primordial "intropathic community". So, a certain "phenomenological praxis" can then face the challenges of today's civilization.<br>

Issue: i40068374<br>

Abstract: L'attachement au pays d'origine est bien analysé pour les diasporas contemporaines afin de démontrer leur dimension transnationale et décrire leurs rapports avec l'État-nation. Pour les XVIe-XVIIIe siècles, en revanche, cette question pourtant fondamentale est minorée au profit des liens entre communautés. Souhaitant sortir des perspectives mono-confessionnelles qui limitent l'historiographie des diasporas modernes, ce travail s'appuie sur l'étude de quatre groupes dispersés : les séfarades, les catholiques britanniques, les huguenots et les morisques. La terre d'origine, qui grave son empreinte culturelle sur la diaspora, constitue un liant structurant fondamental : lieu de l'événement-déclencheur de dispersion et du martyre, elle apparaît comme le front de la résistance qui légitime l'existence de « l'arrière » , la diaspora. Territoire matriciel, souvent mythifié et mobilisé dans les visions messianiques, elle est indissociable de la notion de retour. The attachment to the country of origin is well analyzed for contemporary diasporas to demonstrate their transnational dimension and to describe their relationship with the nation-state. For the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, however, the historiography has emphasized the relationship between communities, overlooking this important issue. Putting aside mono-denominational perspectives, this article offers a new approach to early-modern diasporas by confronting four groups: the Sephardim, the British Catholics, the Huguenots and the Moriscos. The cultural imprint of the homeland was a core structure of diasporas. The locus of both martyrdom and the trigger-event of dispersion, the homeland appeared as the front line of resistance, legitimizing the existence of the "rear", i.e. the Diaspora. Often mythologized and mobilized in messianic visions, this crucial territory was inseparable from the notion of return.<br>

Publisher: American Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i387752<br>
Date: 4 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Zukin Fred<br>
Abstract: To understand the rise of market fundamentalism from the margins of influence to mainstream hegemony, we compare the U.S. 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act and the English 1834 New Poor Law-two episodes in which existing welfare regimes were overturned by market-driven ones. Despite dramatic differences across the cases, both outcomes were mobilized by "the perversity thesis "-a public discourse that reassigned blame for the poor's condition from "poverty to perversity." We use the term "ideational embeddedness" to characterize the power of such ideas to shape, structure, and change market regimes. The success of the perversity thesis is based on the foundations of social naturalism, theoretical realism, and the conversion narrative. In the poverty to perversity conversion narrative, structural blame for poverty is discredited as empiricist appearance while the real problem is attributed to the corrosive effects of welfare's perverse incentives on poor people themselves-they become sexually promiscuous, thrust aside personal responsibility, and develop long-term dependency. This claim enables market fundamentalism to delegitimate existing ideational regimes, to survive disconfirming data, and to change the terms of debate from social problems to the timeless forces of nature and biology. Coupling economic sociology with a sociology of ideas, we argue that ideas count; but not all ideas are created equal. Only some have the capacity to fuel radical transformations in the ideational embeddedness of markets.<br>

Abstract: This article is a contribution to an international and interdisciplinary history of text linguistics. It focuses on the works of three authors who have influenced text linguistics in various ways : Bühler, through his theory of four modes of language, his organon model, his theory of anaphora and deixis and his theory of language understanding influenced by Gestalt psychology ; Bartlett, through his theory of schemata or mental models that structure the understanding and memorisation of stories, a theory that had a direct influence on all later models of text comprehension based on schemata, frames, scripts and plans ; and finally Benveniste, through his theory of pronouns and indexicals and his discussion of two broad types of enunciation or genres of text : the story and the discourse.<br>

Abstract: In an empirical study using five real-world creative teams from an advertising agency, participants were given a strategic brief for a new beverage product and asked to design the layout for a print ad. Think-aloud concurrent protocols obtained from each team's copywriter, art director, and the two working together were analyzed to examine the creative process and its relationship to the created advertisement. Interpretive analyses of the protocols reveal that the teams access culturally available plot patterns but in different ways. In this study and with the particular materials and situational context explored here, four of the five teams chose to pursue a single mythic structure to the apoarent detriment of their final product. Only one team engaged in fully diversified idea generation involving a wide range of alternative scenarios. Not coincidentally, as a tentative conclusion, this more flexible team produced the ad judged most successful by advertising professionals. This still-to-be-tested exploratory finding deserves further investigation in future research that embodies various methodological refinements.<br>

Abstract: From the work of Weber onwards charisma has been primarily explained in terms of its relationship to underlying social structural and psychological environments. The paper redresses this imbalance and examines the cultural structures that operate as preconditions for the attribution of charisma to political and religious leaders. Drawing on Weberian, Durkheimian and semiotic theory the paper argues that charisma arises in conjunction with salvation narratives. The internal structure of these narratives requires binary oppositions contrasting good and evil. The model is exemplified with reference to case studies of Hitler, Churchill and Martin Luther King.<br>

The notion is concretized in the context of Reynaldo Ileto's discussion of the Schurman Commission, which was tasked to gather information about the Philippines as part of the United States' pacification campaign. Because historical forgetting is rooted in the structure of society itself, policies concerning language and education are imbued with power and class dimensions. The necessity of change in consciousness is enmeshed in the broader politics of social change, which is thus the context of the debate on the critical role of English in the Philippines. The political imperative to forget is inherent in—and partly sustains—the fundamental structure of social relations in the Philippines.<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the options that narrative and language have in their attempts to capture or describe traumatic experience and death. It concentrates on two prose texts by Karel Čapek, Obyčejný život and Povětroň, and the first phase of Freudian psychoanalysis, pointing at generally distinguishable limits and distortions that arise when narrative and language come in contact with trauma and death. Contrary to the current trend within „trauma studies“ , the article does not deal with autobiographical records of traumatic experience. It rather tries to point out that thinking consistently about the connection between memory, language and trauma tends to blur and question the traditional distinction between fiction (understood as a work of imagination) and autobiography (taken as a description of real events). It also tries to show that psychoanalysis arrives, explicitly and implicitly, at a similar conclusion. The last part of the article poses the question what the resulting relationship between the outside (narrated, written Story) and the „inner“ experience is like, and to what extent the structure of this dyad can also be questioned.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40108662<br>
Date: 8 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Ezzy Douglas<br>
Abstract: Two central unresolved problems in labour process theory are the disjuncture between structure and agency and the problem of what constitutes 'good' work. This paper argues that a hermeneutic conception of the self as constructed through narrative provides a resolution to these two issues. Hermeneutics conceptualises the self as neither a solitary entity impervious to the influence of others, nor as a mere reflection of objective structures or 'discourses of power'. Rather, in the process of self-interpretation a person uses socially learnt cultural discourses to construct and reconstruct a coherent sense of narrative-identity. Substantive illustrations are drawn from labour process theory, recent developments in management theory, and some more general studies of the meaning of working.<br>

Article Title: Metaphor and the Subversive Process of Virginia Woolf's Essays<br>
Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113394<br>
Date: 12 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Bishop Edward L.<br>
Abstract: What distinguishes Woolf's prose is not her famous penchant for simile, but her constant use of the less ostentatious, though more radical, verb metaphor. Combining these figures in strings, in which the verbs are consistent but the implied nouns contradictory, Woolf deliberately unsettles the reader, forcing him or her to consider not only the tenuous relations between the word and the world, but the contingent nature of phenomenal reality itself. Thus the view of life as something at once "very shifting" and "very solid" (expressed in the diaries and dramatized in the novels), pervades the essays, captured in the paradoxical relation "it is and is not" that Paul Ricoeur claims lies at the heart of metaphor. A close study of a paradigmatic essay, "On Not Knowing Greek," and of manuscript drafts in New York and Sussex reveals that this tension between shifting and solid extends to the syntax, which manages to be both extravagant and firmly anchored, and to the developing structure of the essay as a whole, which traces a movement of mind (a strategy James Farrell defines as specifically "feminine"), remaining defiantly heuristic and resisting the inherent closure of the formal essay. Thus, like her novels, Woolf s reviews and essays engage us in the process of perception even while inviting us to explore critically the operations of language in that perception.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113403<br>
Date: 4 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Ronen Ruth<br>
Abstract: Temporal concepts such as "order," "chronology," "narrative present," and "exposition" are extensively used in narrative theory. Accepted notions of time can contribute to our understanding of these concepts and can allow us to question their "temporal" meaning in the context of fictional narrative. Fictional time may be thought of as a system of relations unique to the fictional world after real time. Theories of narrative tend to adopt an essentialist interpretation of temporal concepts and to ignore the ontological divergence between time in fiction and time in reality. As a result, concepts such as "exposition" or "present" appear which appear to carry a direct "temporal" meaning, actually function in a way that indicates the nature of time in fiction. In fiction, temporal divisions and time segmentations do not just construct a temporal structure; they also mark degrees of factuality in the fictional world.<br>

Article Title: The Modes of Narrativity and Their Visual Metaphors<br>
Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113412<br>
Date: 10 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Ryan Marie-Laure<br>
Abstract: Narratology has explored in depth the modes of narration, but it has left largely untouched the question of the modes of narrativity. This term designates the various ways in which narrative structures are realized in texts. To call a novel or short story narrative is an entirely different matter from that of applying the same term to a lyric poem or a drama. The study of the modes of narrativity attempts to answer the question: what does it mean to say "this text is narrative"? As a cognitive category necessary to the proper understanding of a work, the narrative structure of a text may be compared to the identifiable shape of an object in a visual artwork. Thus, various modes of narrative may be compared to a type of picture or visual phenomenon.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113412<br>
Date: 10 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Stampfl Barry<br>
Abstract: Narratology may be thought of as a complicated system of conceptual filters that enact a severe formalist reduction upon the corpus of what may be thought and said about storytelling. According to Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, this reductiveness needs to be expanded in order to attend more to language. One way of answering to her reformist prescription is a turn to the study of linguistic surface structure organized as a meditation on the metaphor of the filter. For Seymour Chatman this metaphor designates a character through whom a narrator elects to tell a story. For Max Black, "filter" is a trope for metaphoric process. Examining these senses of the filter in Henry James's short story "The Beast in the Jungle" leads to emphasis upon negations and belief qualifiers. In James's story, both turn out to be invaded by the logic of Freudian negation, itself a type of intrapsychic filtration.<br>

Abstract: Metaphorics, the movement and process of metaphor, is distributed in Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as modes generating meaning in each of the novel's five chapters. Each of these modes is linked with the specific "historical" matrix in which it originates, a site which determines the metaphor's structure, its function, and the stylistic effects it produces.<br>

Author(s): Mosher, Harold F.<br>
Abstract: Applied to Chaucer's Miller's Tale, A. J. Greimas's various analytic systems—the structure of roles or acteurs, the plots of struggle and exchange of objects, and the semiotic square—reveal Alison as an unchanging, passive object who is passed from her husband John to her lover Nicholas (and potentially to another lover, Absolon). But the application of Claude Bremond's more dynamic functional model reveals not only the story's symmetrical paradigms of seduction, retribution, and dissimulation but also the importance of the last of these isotopies and, above all, the central activity of Alison as seducer, dissimulator, and degrader.<br>

Abstract: La personnalité, l'activité et l'œuvre de Gonseth peuvent être interprétés organiquement dans une instructive pédagogie de dialogue. L'auteur évoque a) la structure dialogale intime de Gonseth, b) les dialogues peu fructueux qu'il a entretenus avec le Cercle de Vienne, puis lors des Entretiens de Zurich, c) les dialogues qu'il a imaginés dans Les mathématiques et la réalité entre trois personnages: Parfait, Sceptique et Idoine, auxquels vient s'ajouter à la fin le Nouvel Idoine, d) les rencontres avec les néo-scolastiques à Rome, e) la «doctrine» explicite du dialogue exposée dans La loi du dialogue. L'auteur s'interroge aussi sur les conditions d'un dialogue fécond et sur les obstacles qui peuvent s'y opposer, (en particulier: l'incompatibilité des référentiels). Gonseth the man, his life and his work can be interpreted organically in an instructive account of dialogue. The author treats the following topics: a) Gonseth's intimate dialogical structure, b) the fruitless dialogues he had with the Vienna Circle and then at the Entretiens de Zurich, c) his imaginary dialogues in Les mathématiques et la réalité between the characters Perfect, Sceptic and Appropriate, and finally New Appropriate, d) his contacts with neo-scholastics at Rome, e) the explicit 'doctrine' of dialogue presented in La loi du dialogue. The article is also concerned with conditions for a fruitful dialogue and with obstacles that can stand in the way (in particular, the incompatibility of reference systems). Die Persönlichkeit, die Aktivitäten und das Werk Gonseths können im Rahmen einer lehrreichen Pädagogik des Dialogs einheitlich interpretiert werden. Der Autor erörtert a) die intime Dialogstruktur Gonseths; b) die wenig fruchtbaren Dialoge, die er mit dem Wiener Kreis und während der Zürcher Gespräche führte; c) die Dialoge dreier Figuren, die er in Les mathématiques et la réalité in Szene gesetzt hat: Perfekt, Skeptiker und Geeignet, zu denen sich am Schluss der Neue Geeignete hinzugesellt; ~<br>

Abstract: Cette courte note veut dégager les lignes de force de l'Œuvre de l'art, la summa æstheticae en deux volumes publiée par G. Genette. On rend compte de la structure et des concepts majeurs de l'ouvrage avant d'insister sur les options de cette esthétique (l'analyse contre la spéculation; la méta-esthétique contre la rationalité esthétique; le fonctionnalisme contre l'essentialisme; un certain idéalisme raisonné contre le nominalisme; le subjectivisme contre l'objectivisme; le plaisir esthétique contre le cognitivisme; le relativisme contre l'absolutisme). On propose de relire ces deux temps en trois mouvements (morphologie, syntaxe, pragmatique) dont le centre serait la difficile notion de transcendance, point focal, mais aussi, peut-être, point aveugle de cette esthétique. On propose alors, pour y voir clair, trois lignes de discussion possibles: la notion d'objet investi d'esprit, celle d'historicité et celle de convention. Le travail d'esthétique de G. Genette est décisif comme sa poétique; il est remarquable dans sa rigueur; elle le rend cruel pour toutes les approximations.<br>

Abstract: On propose ici une analyse de la structure narrative du Saint Louis de Jacques Le Goff, de ses « trois drames » dont la succession (le troisième recomposant ce que le deuxième avait démonté du premier) crée l'effet de lecture. Celui-ci est, en particulier, animé par le retour des mêmes histoires, parfois des mêmes textes, sur lesquels l'historien exerce sa critique, patiemment et modestement, nous délivrant au passage une leçon de méthode. Peut-on lire un livre d'histoire comme un roman ? C'est la question que cet essai tente de poser, en même temps qu'il revient sur l'ambiguïté de son « personnage », Saint Louis qui fut peut-être, comme le Genet de Sartre, comédien et martyr. Proposed here is an analysis of the narrative structure of Jacques Le Goff's Saint Louis, of the « three dramas » which create, by their succession (the third drama recomposes what the second had deconstructed of the first), the effectiveness of its readability. This is particularly animated by the recurrence of the same stories, sometimes of the same texts, to which the author applies his criticism, with patience and humility, delivering to us in the process a lesson in methodology. Can a history book be read like a novel ? That is the question which this essay addresses, at the same time as it reverts to the ambiguity of its « personage » - Saint Louis -, who was perhaps, like Sartre's Genet, a comedian and a martyr.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this essay is to examine and go beyond the Freudian, psychoanalytical approach to the work of art. The author specifically considers the case of the musical work through the notion of 'repetition', a notion upon which the relationship of the unconscious with time is founded. After analyzing the ambiguity of the Freudian stance, he points out Freud's error regarding the meaning that can be attributed to repetition: according to Freud, repetition is only a negative phenomenon, which indicates the failure of desire fulfillment. The author instead posits that repetition, basic to all music, is the fundamental structure of a time-based art that is closely connected with the imaginary and the unconscious. Repetition and variation are the two fundamental aspects of the organization of time for the human psyche. The most ancient figure of repetition-variation in the unconscious is that of the echo. The author analyzes this notion through the concepts of 'sound-container of the Self' and 'transitional time' as defined by Anzieu and Winnicott. Several musical examples show how this figure lies at the root of the first experiences of musical time in Western culture. The echo can be considered as the basis of other musico-temporal figures such as 'dead time', the 'empty container', and the 'pseudo-connection'. These are the figures that constitute the temporal narrative of late nineteenth-century music, and of the passage to contemporary music, its fundamental discontinuity and non-linearity. Finally, the author returns to the initial topic: a psychoanalysis of a musical work can only be a psychoanalytic reading of the figures of its creation, it cannot be a psychoanalysis of the creating artist. More generally, what the work designates remains inaccessible - or rather, cannot be perceived except in a lack that returns us to the listener's emptiness. The work finds its place in the listener, bringing along an absence, a non-existence which is projected outwards, whic~<br>

Abstract: This study considers Schumann's Kinderszenen (1838) from the point of view of the branch of literary criticism known as narratology. The author's aim is not to ascribe a specific narrative content to Schumann's cycle of thirteen brief pieces for piano, but rather to shed light on the inner nature of the work by identifying various ways in which Schumann adopts and adapts the techniques and strategies of narrative toward specifically musical ends. As the author observes, this approach is justified on at least two levels: first, by Schumann's passion for literature in general, and for the works of Jean Paul in particular; and second, by a variety of attributes of the work itself, the most obvious being the overall title as well as the specific titles given to its thirteen movements. Drawing on a broad spectrum of narratological writings - both in the areas of literary theory (Genette, Barthes, Ricceur) and musicology (Adorno, Newcomb) - the author proposes analogies between the various elements of literary narrative and their counterparts in Schumann's Kinderszenen. Specifically, the "narrator" of the cycle is identified with the composer himself, the overall structure of the work is construed as an "epic" as opposed to a "dramatic" one (owing to its articulation in thirteen diminutive episodes), and "diatonicism" and "chromaticism" are viewed as the cycle's principal "characters". For the author, the latter analogy is the decisive one. A substantial portion of the article is devoted to showing how the narrative design of the work as a whole arises from the interaction, alternation, and ultimate synthesis of these domains.<br>

Abstract: Cette étude consiste en une introduction en neuf étapes à la pensée du philosophe japonais Nishida Kitarô (1870-1945). Le néant nous livre des traces diffuses, que nous aimierions bien effacer à la lumière de l'être. Cependant, une fois appréhendé logiquement et approché phénoménologiquement, le néant révèle une structuration topologique remarquable, qui met en question les problématiques de la métaphysique et de la morale, en particulier concernant la distinction entre l'espace et le lieu, le vide et le plein et les rapports de l'un et du multiple. This essay is a nine steps introduction to the Japanese philosopher Nishida Kitaro's thought (1870-1945). Nothingness shows us some diffuse traces we would like to clear out with the light of being. However, once logically apprehended and phenomenologically approached, nothingness reveals a remarkable topological structure, which puts into the problems of metaphysics and moral, in particular concerning the distinction between space and place, fullness and void and the relation of the one and the many.<br>

Abstract: La critique phénoménologique de la métaphysique a opposé « l'intuition » à la « représentation », et le débat philosophique contemporain une phénoménologie « minimaliste » à une phénoménologie « maximaliste ». Face à ces alternatives, l'approfondissement weilien de l'expérience n'oppose ni la présence et l'absence, ni le fini et l'absolu, mais cherche à éprouver et penser le lien qui les unit, à partir de la structure trinitaire du don de l'être. À distance d'une médiation extériorisante comme d'une immanence pure, le processus de révélation n'est jamais négateur du mystère, mais en manifeste au contraire la profondeur. Ainsi, depuis la perception jusqu'à l'amour surnaturel, « évidence » et « mystère » vont toujours de pair, ce qui permet de ne rejeter aucun des niveaux de l'être et de l'expérience. The phenomenological critique of metaphysics opposed intuition and representation as contemporary debates in philosophy opposed minimalist and maximalist phenomenologies. Confronted with these alternatives the Weilean thought of experience neither opposes presence and absence, nor finite and absolute, but it tries to verify and think what unites them - based on the Trinitarian structure of the giving of being. Standing apart from exteriorizing mediation as from pure immanence, the revelation process never makes ineffective the mystery but expresses its depth. Thus, from perception to supernatural love, 'obviousness' and 'mystery' go together, which allows not to reject any levels of being and experience.<br>

Abstract: Le discours philosophique, même lorsqu'il se propose comme chez Hegel de « sauver » intégralement les phénomènes, ne parvient pas vraiment à saisir (et en même temps dédaigne) le ceci en son individualité la plus contingente. La parole poétique est plus apte à le recueillir, comme on tente de le montrer à partir de l'exemple de l'incipit d'un roman de Claude Simon. Elle fait ainsi affleurer la vérité d'une obscure dimension de l'être que Heidegger désigne sous le nom de Terre. Seule une ontologie de la différence est susceptible de fournir une structure d'accueil adéquate à cette valorisation poétique de l'infra-conceptuel. Au niveau de l'herméneutique littéraire, il en résulte l'exigence d'une démarche particulièrement attentive aux détails les plus factuels à travers lesquels se configure cette dimension voilée de l'être. Even when it proposes, as in the works of Hegel, to « save » the phenomena in full, the philosophical discourse does not really succeed in seizing (and at once disdains) the this in its most contingent individuality. The poetic speech is more capable of catching it, as this article will attempt to show it from an incipit of a novel by Claude Simon. The poetic speech makes thus the truth of an unknown dimension of the being which Heidegger calls Earth emerge. Alone an ontology of the difference is liable to provide this poetic valorisation of the infra-conceptual with an adequate « home ». Asfar as literary hermeneutics are concerned, it results in the necessity of a method which must be particularly heedful of the most factual details through which this veiled dimension of the being forms itself.<br>

Abstract: Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari have proposed that the structure of western knowledge can be reconceived according to a 'rhizomatic' model, which focuses on the unlimited relations that interconnect all things in the cosmos and on the spaces of dynamic interaction between then. Applied to the field of biblical interpretation, rhizomatic hermeneutics promises to avert the nihilism latent within biblical historical positivism, provide a theoretical framework for exploring the relations between the interpreter and the text, and reintroduce ethics to the practice of biblical interpretation. A 'rhizomatic' model of hermeneutics has the advantage of recognizing the broader ecology within which biblical hermeneutics actually functions, including the subjectivity of the interpreter, and the role of interpreting communities.<br>

Abstract: À partir de plusieurs vagues d'enquêtes par entretiens approfondis, cet article s'efforce de montrer ce que le rapport au politique, notamment l'investissement dans les objets politiques et les préférences que l'on peut avoir ou ne pas avoir dans ces domaines, doivent aux diverses socialisations constitutives de l'expérience du monde social d'un individu. Il exemplifie la manière dont chacun s'appuie sur des visions et valorisations du monde élaborées à travers son histoire sociale personnelle pour appréhender les questions politiques. Au-delà de la description des instruments cognitifs mobilisés dans des situations, il s'agit d'expliquer les conditions de l'adhésion aux représentations et les facteurs de l'activation de leurs ressources cognitives. Ce travail est aussi l'occasion d'élargir les problématiques des travaux touchant à la socialisation politique et de questionner certains de leurs résultats. L'enjeu théorique est de dépasser les dualismes — explication versus compréhension, objectivisme et subjectivisme, déterminisme et liberté, intérêts et croyances, holisme et individualisme, méthodes quantitatives et qualitatives — qui structurent et bornent trop souvent les recherches des sciences sociales. Using several series of in depth interviews, this article shows what the relationship to politics, particularly the investment in political objects and one's preferences in these areas, owe to the various socializations that make up the experience of the social world of an individual. It exemplifies how people depend on visions and outlooks of the world worked out through their personal social history to grasp political questions. Beyond describing the cognitive instruments mobilized in these situations, there is the question of explaining the conditions for accepting these representations and the factors of the activation of their cognitive resources. This is also the opportunity to widen the problematics of researches touching upon political socialization and t~<br>

Abstract: The text aims at considering from various points of view the presence of the value of truth in the work of art. The first step is a phenomenological analysis of epistemológical, ontological and aesthetic phenomena connected with perception of the work of art. Its conclusion is the statement that truth belongs to the characteristics of both creation (contents, structure) and reception (cognition of various aspects) of the work. The very fact that the aesthetic value of the object claiming to be beautiful can be discussed proves the presence of the object on the rational-veritable plane. The next aspect undertaken in the article is concerned with the epistemological and methodological criticism of the view (represented here by R. Ingarden) that there is a radical difference between the objective domains of science and art. An attempt is made to show that the view is rooted rather in ideologically understood scientism and neo-positivism than in a realistic conception of cognition through art. In a completely realistic attitude the borderline between 'what is rationally cognised' and 'what is beautiful' (the sphere of quasi in Ingarden's meaning) is not an absolute borderline. The domain of the work of art also contains cognitive elements, often existentially and morally essential for man's life. As it appears, a similar position can be found in G. B. Vico's texts that proclaim the unity of poetic and metaphysical perspective in ancient beginnings of anthropological thought about the human world. Nowadays a methodological tendency is observed on the philosophical plane that allows joining the veritable and aesthetic aspects, and hence exploring the objective domain of art in the cognitive aspect. This is expressed today, among others, in the increase of the significance of art in social, cultural and scientific life.<br>

Abstract: D'une part, le suspense est implicite dans la structure d'une pièce de théâtre selon la façon dont le lecteur est interpellé par les événements. D'autre part, le suspense est aussi le produit d'une excitation cognitive et limbique. La dama duende de Calderón, un chef-d'œuvre dans la tradition de cape et d'épée, sert ici d'exemple pour illustrer la manière de constituer une pièce de théâtre afin de créer un état de suspense en rapport avec la constitution du cerveau darwinien.<br>

Abstract: The issues raised by different kinds of oral-historical research are explored here through a dialogue between two projects. In one case, the Alderley Sandhills Project, this work has been completed; in the other, the Ardnamurchan Transitions Project, the oral-historical research is in its early stages. Through a series of interactions, this article raises a number of different questions that oral-historical research posed at Alderley Sandhills, and it considers the ramifications of and the possible differences in these questions in the case of Ardnamurchan. Adoption of a nonlinear structure echoes one of the many fascinating aspects of oral-historical research itself.<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires du Mirail<br>
Issue: i40143884<br>
Date: 1 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): PAILLER Jean-Marie<br>
Abstract: L'âne des Métamorphoses d'Apulée est à la fois objet, vecteur et témoin de nombreuses activités commerciales de proximité. Le héros Lucius, avant sa transformation, est une figure représentative d'un autre commerce : celui qui s'exerce à grande échelle, fait appel au relais de manieurs d'argent, dépend de la prospérité de la navigation en Méditerranée. La structure d'ensemble du roman met en valeur la confrontation entre ces deux univers, mais aussi les relations qu'ils entretiennent. Apulée établit une série d'étroites correspondances, un véritable réseau métaphorique entre les déplacements et transformations qui sont de l'essence du commerce, d'une part, et d'autre part la série des métamorphoses qui forment l'objet avoué du récit. The donkey in Apuleius' Metamorphoses is at the same time the object, vector and witness to a number of short distance commercial activities. Lucius, the hero, before his transformation is a representative figure of another kind of commerce: a wide-scale operation calling on money changers as relays and depending on a thriving navigation in the Mediterranean. The overall structure of the novel sets into relief the confrontation between those two worlds but also the relationships they entertain. Apuleius set up a series of close correspondences, a real metaphorical network between the journeys and the transformations which are of the essence of commerce on one hand and on the other hand the series of metamorphoses which are the overt object of the narrative.<br>

Abstract: C'est d'abord s'étonner de la place qu'occupe dans l'œuvre novatrice de Freud la culture antique. Retracer l'itinéraire de la rencontre avec Œdipe, c'est faire comme un état des lieux. L'Interprétation des Rêves, Totem et Tabou, L'Homme Moïse et la religion monothéiste, mais aussi des articles moins connus, des extraits de sa correspondance, contiennent des analyses inattendues, sur l'origine de la tragédie grecque, son évolution, sa fonction, sur la catharsis, le plaisir tragique, etc... Le but n'est pas d'apprécier la pertinence des réponses, mais de dégager l'originalité d'une démarche qui lie fiction et réalité, structure et histoire, passé et présent. And our first response will be to marvel at the importance of the culture of antiquity in Freud’s innovating work. Tracing up the stages of his encounter with Œdipus is tantamount to an inventory of fixtures. The Interpretation of Dreams, Totem and Taboo, The Man Moses and monotheistic religion, but also less known articles and extracts from his correspondence contain unexpected analyses on the origin of Greek tragedy, its evolution, its function, on catharsis, tragic pleasure, etc. Our aim is not to assess the relevance of the answers but to bring out the originality of a procedure that links up fiction and fact, structure and history, past and present<br>

Abstract: Desde una perspectiva relacional y a partir de la información contenida en la correspondencia epistolar, este artículo estudia las prácticas mercantiles de los mercaderes vascos establecidos en Buenos Aires durante el período de guerras internacionales de finales del siglo XVIII. Tomando como mirador la Casa de comercio de don Martín de Álzaga, se explorar algunos de los mecanismos que articulaban la integración de los circuitos mercantiles rioplatenses en el sistema de la economía colonial. Entre ellos, las gestiones concretas llevadas a cabo por los «agentes de enlace» organizados por el jefe de la Casa dentro de una conformación familiar de la empresa. A partir d'une analyse en termes de réseaux sociaux et à partir des informations recueillies dans la correspondance, ce travail étudie les pratiques commerciales des commerçants basques installés à Buenos Aires durant la période des guerres internationales de la fin du XVIIIe siècle. Choisissant comme point d'observation la maison de commerce de don Martín de Álzaga il explore quelques-uns des mécanismes qui assuraient l'articulation des circuits commerciaux du Rio de la Plata avec le reste de l'économie coloniale. Parmi eux, le texte souligne l'importance des négociations menées par les « agents de contact » organisés par le chef de la maison commerciale dont la structure restait familiale. From a relational perspective and springing from information gotten form epistolary correspondence, this article studies the business practices of the Bask merchants who settled in Buenos Aires during the international war period towards the end of the eighteenth century. Having as observer Don Martin de Álzaga's business house, we will explore the mechanisms that articulated the integrations of the business circuits of the River Plate area in the colonial economic system. Among them, the concrete deals carried out by the «bond agents» organized by the House's boss within the familiar business constitution.<br>

Abstract: Kern Sakamoto's novel The Electrical Field successfully resists a new and insidious form of social amnesia surrounding the Japanese-Canadian internment. Perpetuated by the act of collective remembering and reinforced by the teleological structure of social and literary narratives representing the internment, this communal forgetting is resisted through the novel's use of discourses of hysteria.<br>

Issue: i40178582<br>

Author(s): Davies Oliver<br>
Abstract: In this paper I set out a phenomenology of social transformation, based on an analysis of the distinctively religious form of communication which underlies the trans-generational and trans-cultural transmission of world traditions, taking Confucianism and Christianity as their representatives. A phenomenological analysis of their communicative structure allows the possibility of a better understanding of what can be learnt from them in the context of contemporary debates in both China and the West on the relations between religion, ethics and politics. This analysis suggests that the ethical consistency of belief and act, which is the necessary condition for the engendering of long-term solidarity in religious community, has significant implications for ethics in politics, and especially for the legitimacy of representational leadership as a focal point for change in society. The paper concludes that the historical experience of world religions can offer new insights into the nature of political leadership and representation in today's globalised world and that the appropriate locus for this inquiry is the present negotiation and re-negotiation of relations between China and the West.<br>

Publisher: Pontificia Universitas Gregoriana<br>
Issue: i40180925<br>

Author(s): O'meara Thomas F.<br>
Abstract: Paul Tillich and Karl Rahner were Christian theologians who thought out of a modem perspective: transcendental, existential, and historical. One was from a Protestant church joining Calvinist and Lutheran traditions, and the other belonged to the Roman Catholic Society of Jesus; both studied Immanuel Kant and learned from Martin Heidegger. Tillich's theology unfolded amid and after the two World Wars with marked cultural changes, while Rahner's years were particularly marked by the changes of Vatican II and cultural shifts after 1960. Both are known for fashioning a theology of the Kingdom of God wider than church membership. This comparison looks at their audiences, the structure of the major systematic work of each, similarities illustrated in a few themes, and contrasting orientations. Paul Tillich e Karl Rahner sono teologi cristiani che hanno portato il pensiero verso prospettive trascendentali, esistenziali e storiche che andavano al di là delle vedute moderne. Il primo veniva da una chiesa protestante che univa le tradizioni calviniste e luterane; il secondo apparteneva alla Compagina di Gesù, cattolica e romana. Entrambi hanno studiato Kant e appreso da Heidegger. Tillich espone la sua teologia durante e dopo le due guerre mondiali, un periodo di cambiamenti culturali significativi; gli anni di Rahner furono segnati invece dai cambiamenti del Vaticano II e dalle svolte culturali dopo gli anni '60. Entrambi erano conosciuti per la loro proposta di una teologia del regno di Dio più ampio di una Chiesa d'aderenti. L'articolo paragona le loro 'audience', la struttura dell'opera più sistemática di ciascuno, le similitudini manifestate da alcuni termini e infine i loro orientamenti divergenti.<br>

Author(s): Neuberg Marc<br>
Abstract: L'idée qu'on se fait généralement, en philosophie de l'action, de la structure physique de l'agir, n'est-elle pas trop schématique? Si l'intentionnalité semble un élément incontournable de la définition de l'agir, n'est-ce pas parce qu'on n'attribue qu'un sens anémique à la notion de mouvement corporel? Il se peut que cette notion, analysée de façon adéquate, se révèle assez vigoureuse pour fonder à elle seule la notion d'agir. Is it not the case that in the philosophy of action we generally have a highly simplified idea of the physical structure of action? Does not defining action in terms of an intention seem unavoidable simply because we give such an anemic meaning to the notion of bodily movement? But if this notion were adequately analyzed, it would perhaps prove sufficient as a basis for the concept of action.<br>

Publisher: IMPRIMERIE ATAR S.A.<br>
Issue: i40182120<br>
Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Müller Denis<br>
Abstract: L'auteur esquisse la relation de l'utilitarisme et du christianisme sous l'angle triple des rapports entre le bien et le salut, le sacrifice et le sujet, la souffrance réduite ou affrontée. Le trépied ainsi proposé ne constitue pas une cage de fer, à laquelle toute comparaison et toute lecture devraient se soumettre ou se refuser, mais seulement une possible structure de dialogue et de débat, devant faciliter et fructifier l'interpellation réciproque de la morale utilitariste et de l'éthique chrétienne. The author sketches the link of utilitarianism and Christianity on three bases : the relation of goodness and faith ; of sacrifice and the individual, of suffering denied and suffering met. This three-legged stool is not an iron cage meant to be accepted or rejected by the reader, but only a possible framework for dialogue designed to allow the mutual questioning of utilitarian morals and Christian ethics.<br>

Abstract: Alors qu'il défend une extension du libéralisme politique au champ de la morale, Ruwen Ogien plaide pour la liberté. Mais l'assimilation de la liberté au consentement appauvrit le sens de la liberté, tout comme la supposée transparence du sujet à lui-même. En ce sens, le libéralisme politique comme structure formelle tourne à vide, s'il ne peut compter sur une mise en débat de perspectives plus substantielles de la liberté, des visions du monde, des éthiques et des convictions. In defending an extention of political liberalism to the field of morals, Ruwen Ogien makes a plea for freedom. But the assimilation of liberty to consent impoverishes the meaning of liberty, as does the supposed transparence of the subject to oneself. In this way, political liberalism as a formal structure runs in neutral, if it cannot depend on a debate concerning more substantial perspectives of liberty, of world visions, of ethics and convictions.<br>

Publisher: Department of Anthropology, University of Pittsburgh<br>
Issue: i40182557<br>
Date: 1 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Brown Gavin<br>
Abstract: This paper, theoretical in nature, discusses how the study of ritual has been re-conceptualized in terms of performance theory. This involves firstly defining the difficult term 'performance' and then proceeding to explore how ritual can be recast as a (cultural) performance. Building on this discussion, it is argued that recasting ritual as performance has led the scholar of ritual to pay closer attention to how indeterminacy inheres within all ritual performances. This is explored in two senses. Firstly, by 'privileging the moment' in ritual analysis, the essentially indeterminate nature of meaning in ritual performances becomes evident. Secondly, working with Victor Turner's idea of ritual anti-structure and cultural reflexivity, I explore how rituals are constituted by cultural indeterminacy, a condition most discernible in the execution of ritual action, that is, in performance.<br>

Publisher: Department of Religious Studies, University of Pittsburgh<br>
Issue: i40184391<br>
Date: 7 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: The manner in which the LDS Church administers its temple rite constitutes a strategic use of the conventions of an oral tradition in a modern, literate society. Three effects of this strategy are considered. First, refusing to make a text of the rite available and insisting that its specific content not be revealed or otherwise subjected to discursive thought sustains the rite's canonical authority as immutable truth, notwithstanding its periodic mutation. Secondly, the conventions of oral tradition structure the relationships created by the ritual and constitute a principal means by which the Church's historic separatism is maintained. Finally, these conventions when applied to the temple rite maximize ritual's capacity to adapt the canon to the needs of successive generations of the faithful while minimizing skepticism and schism.<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de P. Ricœur laisse envisager une articulation spécifique entre la structure métaphysique de l'existence, caractérisée comme réflexion décentrée, et le mode propre selon lequel le religieux fait sens. En son principe, le religieux est coextensif au mouvement même de la réflexion, dont l'herméneutique constitue à la fois la vérité et la méthode: tension temporelle du soi entre son acte propre et les signes qu'il produit (Nabert), au sein du sens qui le précède. Sans jamais combler spéculativement la faille entre le soi et l'absolu, le religieux présente à l'imagination (au sens kantien) le scheme de l'accomplissement de l'existence. The work of P. Ricœur allows one to envisage the possibility of a specific link between the metaphysical nature of existence, depicted as eccentric reflection, and the standart view which gives religion its direction. In its principle, the 'religious' factor is co-extensive with the flow of reflection, whose hermeneutic constitutes not only the truth, but also the method: a temporal tension in the Self as between one's own actions and the effects they produce (J. Nabert), in the context of the intention which precedes them. While never spcculativcly overloading the fissure between the Self and the Absolute, religiosity affords to the imagination (in the sense used by Kant) a pattern for the fulfilment of existence.<br>

Abstract: Cette étude propose une approche « textologique » du texte scripturaire, à l'interface de la philosophie de la religion et de la philosophie du texte. Elle repose sur deux hypothèses : 1. penser, c'est interroger; la pensée religieuse est une interrogation sur le salut. 2. le sens se textualise en achevant de saturer les trois dimensions de la signifiance (référence, communicabililé, symbolisme). Trois raisons sont données, après le textual turn en philosophie, pour distinguer « texte » et « discours » : structurelle, « érotétique », clause de clôture du Canon des Écritures. Du même coup, le rôle de l'expérience religieuse est dérivé. La méthode est celle de l'analyse conceptuelle des problématiques. This study proposes a "textological" approach to scriptural text, at the interface of the philosophy of religion with the philosophy of the text. It avances two hypothesis: 1. to think is to question; religious thought raises the question of salvation. 2. the meaning textualizes itself by completely saturating the three dimensions of signification (reference, communicabiliiy, symbolism). Three reasons are given, following the textual turn in philosophy, for distinguishing between "text" and "discourse": structure, "erotetics", and the closing clause of the scriptural Canon. At the same time the role of religious experience is explained. The method used is that of the conceptual analysis of problematics.<br>

Abstract: Le symbole opère en signifiant et signifie en opérant. Pour fonder plus tard ce propos philosophique, il convient de revenir sur trois débats qui ont contribué à résoudre le sens du symbole dans l'éthique : la scission du symbole d'avec le signe, sa reprise dans le langage, son expulsion du sacré. Si l'on est conduit à redéfinir les droits, mais aussi les conditions et les modes d'une ontologie du symbole, on ne saurait négliger ce qui rend celui-ci possible : la culture. Identifiée à la structure signifiante et opérante du symbole, la culture s'entremet entre les capacités de symbolisation du vécu sensible et l'actualisation cognitive et pratique des symboles effectifs. The symbol operates by signifying and signifies by operating. In order to justify this philosophical affirmation, it is convenient to look back at three debates which have contributed to determining the sense of the symbol in ethics: the distinction between the symbol and the sign, the symbol's reintegration in language, and its expulsion from the domain of the sacred. If one is led to redefine not only the rights, but also the conditions and modes of an ontology of the symbol, then one may not neglect the thing which makes this possible: culture. Identified with the significant and operative structure of the symbol, culture places itself between the capacities for symbolisation of sensitive living, and the cognitive and practical actualisation of existing symbols.<br>

Abstract: Cet article passe en revue les ouvrages suivants du neurobiologiste Jean-Pierre Changeux : L'homme neuronal, 1983, Raison et plaisir, 1982, Ce qui nous fait penser (un dialogue avec Paul Ricœur), 1998, L'homme de vérité, 2002. L'auteur y montre les changements dans les thèses de Changeux en les accompagnant de ses commentaires philosophiques et théologiques aussi bien critiques que constructifs. L'homme, ses origines et sa structure, le cerveau humain, la conscience de soi, la matière et sa complexité évolutive, la sensibilité artistique, la morale, la religion, la question d'une lecture intégrale de Darwin et de Spinoza, la signification du discours sur « l'homme de vérité » sont les principaux sujets traités. Le but de l'article est un dialogue interdisciplinaire entre neurosciences et théologie sur la compréhension de l'être humain. This article passes in revue the following works of the neurobiologist J.-P. Changeux : L'homme neuronal, 1983, Raison et plaisir, 1982, Ce qui nous fait penser (a dialogue with Paul Ricœur), 1998, and L'homme de vérité, 2002. The author shows the changes in Changeux's theses, accompanying them with his philosophical and theological commentaries, critical as well as constructive. Man, his origins and structure, the human brain, self consciousness, matter and its progressive complexity, artistic sensibility, morality, religion, the question of an integral reading of Darwin and Spinoza, and the significance of discourse upon « L'homme de vérité » are the principal subjects treated. The goal of the article is an interdisciplinary dialogue between the neurosciences and theology about the understanding of the human being.<br>

Abstract: Clark (2011) recently reviewed literature on cognitive phenomena such as automaticity, non-conscious processing, and the "illusion of conscious will," concluding that most learning theories and instructional design models are informed by faulty assumptions regarding psychological functioning—namely, that most cognitive activity is conscious and volitional. Clark offered a number of recommendations for educational technology research and design based on the view that cognitive activity is mostly automated, unconscious, and determined by psychological variables outside of personal control. This response presents an alternative perspective and accompanying recommendations distinct from those offered by Clark. It primarily argues that evidence pertaining to automaticity and related phenomena may be reinterpreted to fit within a view of agency that emphasizes meaning, purpose, tacit knowledge, and narrative structure; and that this agentic view leads to a number of potentially fruitful avenues for theorizing and research in educational technology.<br>

Abstract: Anderson, the possibility for persons to experience themselves as members of
a national community also depended on a shift towards "empty, homogeneous" time, which was in
turn motivated through the growing popularity of the novel as a literary genre. Anderson argues that
the narrative structure of the novel rests on a yardstick of empty, homogeneous time, which is lin-
early progressing, divisible into an infinite number of abstract, equivalent units, and independent
from any particular locale. Disparate characters in a novel, who may be in different locations
and completely unaware of the presence of certain other characters, and their actions in the unfold-
ing plot can be placed in relation to each other by virtue of temporal simultaneity on such an axis of
empty, homogeneous time. This narrative and temporal structuring particular to the literary genre of
the novel provides an analogy to the way in which persons imagine themselves as progressing
through history together in a national community, knowing that they exist together with other
co-nationals in a synchronic cross-section of time (1991: 25-26)<br>

Author(s): Barthes Charles F.<br>
Abstract: Northrop Frye's recent criticism confronts the contemporary problem raised most powerfully by the Vietnam War-can we find a telos or definition of man on which we can ground our moral reactions and our visions of human development. Frye establishes this telos by an analysis of origins. Contained in a civilization's statements of "concern," in its imaginative treatments of its own condition, one can find an underlying structure of desire which defines the ends of man. This structure and the recurrent images it produces then can serve as the middle terms people use to justify and value their actions. Frye shares his treatment of mediation with contemporary Hegelians like Sartre, Lukács, and Ricoeur, but grounds his absolute in tradition rather than in ideal absolutes or posited evolutionary patterns. Frye's idea of mediation also provides an ethical model for literary criticism: the critic tries to combine literature as product and as cultural possession by interpreting his materials as projections of imaginative desire. Furthermore, we can use Frye to criticize the relativist denial of origins in structuralist critics like Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219736<br>
Date: 3 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Bogel Dianne F.<br>
Abstract: Little Dorrit is both a narrative about authority and an examination of the authority of narrative. The novel links vocation with sonhood and storytelling with fatherhood and self-generation. Little Dorrit, however, tells a double story, of a daughter as well as of a son. If the son's story relates the search to replace the father and to discover paternal authority, the daughter's story details the horrors and consolations of incestuous desire and generational collapse. Storytelling that seeks the father as origin reveals paternal deception and inauthenticity; incestuous structures of desire attempt to collapse genealogy on the hero and heroine, making paternal origin unknowable and creating an overdetermined narrative ending. Dickens' double story, then, identifies yet questions genealogy and the patriarchal family as metaphors for narrative structure.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i413081<br>
Date: 3 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Zelinsky Jonathan M.<br>
Abstract: Concepts of place, narrative, tradition, and identity are employed in a conservative reading of the Texas A&M Bonfire. Texas A&M embodied regional narratives of a dual Southern commitment to economic and technological development and conservation of traditional cultural. Institutionalized at Texas A&M in the late nineteenth century, these narratives made a paradoxical place. Bonfire expressed and obscured this paradox. In line with the narrative of tradition, Texas A&M was an all-male military school until 1965. The students were uniform, isolated, and regimented. This social structure engendered intense feelings of loyalty and community. These social emotions were further aroused at events like yell practice, and projected onto Bonfire. After the Second World War the commitment of university administrators to economic and technological progress increasingly threatened the narrative of tradition and the cultivation of manliness. Student veneration of Bonfire intensified. After 1965 mandatory military drill was discontinued, women were enrolled, and the student body was enlarged. Social pluralism fragmented the meaning of Bonfire; conflict and disorderly behavior ensued. By the 1990s the university had partly rationalized Bonfire as a corporate symbol; however, this trend was tragically terminated in 1999 when the cumulative errors of the oral tradition caused Bonfire to collapse, killing twelve students.<br>

Abstract: The frames that Lewis Carroll provided for the two Alice books have largely been ignored, when not simply dismissed, in recent Carroll criticism. Their conventional form and diction may account for this negative response, but examination of their provenance, their function within the structure of the two books, and the artistry evident in the individual frame components indicate how and why the frames are important to our understanding of Carroll's vision and purpose. The frame poems are designed to lead the reader into and away from the central dream tales through a process of lyric transformation and estrangement.<br>

Abstract: This paper challenges the common assumption that the attention which modern literary theory pays to the textual aspects of literature is achieved at the expense of humanistic and moral concerns. It starts by outlining how modern literary theory differs epistemologically from the traditional critical approaches to literature. Traditional critical theory was developed in the defense of poetry against Plato's accusations, real or imagined, and this informed both its critical practice and its concept of man. It established its epistemology on an aesthetic, moral, social, philosophical or scientific basis in a manner that encumbered literature with the concepts of man inherent in them. In contrast, modern literary theory started from a different premise: instead of seeking to justify literature and its moral relevance, it strove to identify its literariness and the dynamics of its structure by using the disciplines of semiotics and linguistics. It posited the text as an autonomous entity and a complete structure aware of its existence in a society of texts with which it conducts a profoundly intertextual dialogue. As an autonomous structure, the literary work is independent of other social or philosophical constructs and thus capable of conducting a meaningful dialogue with them. The paper elaborates the various conceptual frameworks of Russian formalism, intertextuality, structuralism and deconstruction in order to examine their implicit assumptions about man. It shows how the autonomous and dialogical nature of the literary work in its Bakhtinian sense are relevant to the concept of man inherent in modern literary theory. In its elaboration of this concept, the paper shows how it was developed in conflict with the hierarchical nature of traditional, ethical and philosophical values. It illustrates also the relevance of autonomy, self-regulation, free-play and fair representation inherent in many concepts of modern literary theory to the question of human rights. The qu~<br>

Publisher: Routledge and Kegan Paul Ltd. For the London School of Economics<br>
Issue: i224978<br>
Date: 12 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Adorno Robert<br>
Abstract: This paper is an advocacy for the employment of psychoanalytical concepts within sociological theorizing about the individual. Through an exposition of Freud's views on the development of intra-psychic structure and a critique of Parson's reduction of psychoanalysis to a branch of learning theory, I attempt to show that the sociological approach to the individual is implicitly behavioural and imprisoned in a series of assumptions which, among other things, treats subjectivity as epiphenomenal and identity as an unmediated reflection of some external reality. In contrast, psychoanalysis presents to us a picture of the individual as flawed and ambivalent in his relation to society, formed by but at odds with the demands of culture. In particular, the psychoanalytic concept of identification reveals that the acquisition of identity is a hard-won achievement marked by the renunciation of lost and forbidden objects. I argue, following Freud and Lacan, that the ego, far from being an agency of reason, somehow directly 'plugged into' reality, constitutes itself in the fantasied image of another and that the quality of this identification crucially affects the way the world is experienced and believed by the individual. This argument is elaborated through a discussion of Peter Berger's remarks on the social causes of identity crisis which, when set against the work of object-relations theorists on those suffering from disturbances of identity such as, for example, schizoid personalities, are shown to be both superficial and misleading. I conclude the paper by arguing that while psychoanalysis can enhance our understanding of the way in which the individual is formed by and through culture it also cautions us against making simple generalizations about the impact of culture upon the person, showing that the individual never submits himself unequivocally to its demands and interdicts.<br>

Author(s): Traverso Regina M.<br>
Abstract: This article investigates the exchanges of letters of 1987 between the historians Martin Broszat and Saul Friedlander through the interpretive framework of "dialogue." It is suggested that dialogue does not have a dyadic structure, but involves ever shifting Thirds that function as mediators in dialogue, i.e., God, conscience, reason, or tradition. On one hand, Thirds provide a seemingly stable, external reference point; on the other hand, they open up space for the play of power and desire. Four categories of Thirds are identified and their place and role in the dialogue between Broszat and Friedlander analyzed. The psychoanalytically inspired notions of "acting-out" and "working-through" are employed in order to interpret the varying degrees of critical control Broszat and Friedlander were able to apply to these interfering Thirds. Finally, I give an overall interpretation of Broszat's and Friedlander's positions in the dialogue, guided by the concepts of acting-out and working-through.<br>

Abstract: Language is constitutive of social reality through the constant articulation and reinforcement of significant linguistic concepts, which give meaning to social relations. Among the Shuar of southeastern Ecuador, discourses on power and knowledge validate the traditional ideological structure and create a new ideological structure through the mobilization of meaning in political speech that legitimates relations of domination. Ideological transformation is assisted by a cultural predisposition to seek non-Shuar sources of technical and symbolic knowledge in the acquisition of power.

Abstract: Abundant and complex, Maya hieroglyphic texts serve as a crucial resource for understanding pre-Columbian narrative. This essay documents and discusses the discursive structure of Maya texts. New evidence on glyphic aspect and deixis show the presence of a "shifting now" or "alternating historical incompletive" in Classic narratives. There were two possible motivations for this pattern: to sequence events and establish textual boundaries between incompletive events and, more speculatively, to provide performance cues from hieroglyphic inscriptions.<br>

Abstract: The flight of Voyager 1 past Saturn in 1981 provides an occasion for a semiotic comparison of reports in French newspapers (Le Monde and Libération), a popular science article (in, La Recherche), and specialized scientific articles in Nature. The texts differ in the distance supposed between reader and writer, in the treatment of human and nonhuman actors, in characterization of the event and assumptions about readers' interest in it, and in their narrative structure. The analysis shows that popularizations and specialized scientific articles are not related in a simple dichotomy or scale and cannot be explained by a notion of the "general public"; rather, the various types of texts must be considered in terms of more complex relations between what are called in semiotic terms the enunciator and the enunciatee.<br>

Abstract: This paper applies the critical theory of Jürgen Habermas to theoretical issues in criminology. Since criminologists have generally neglected the critical tradition, we include a brief summation of concerns central to critical sociology. These concerns include a defense of reason and a provocative critique of both culture and science. We then apply the critical model to themes and issues in criminology. Specifically, our analysis uses Habermas' three "knowledge constitutive interests" to reconceptualize cultural explanations of crime, to address the linkage between macro-and micro-levels of explanation, and to outline a novel interpretation of the relationship between culture and social structure. We conclude with a critique of Habermas' prescription for social change.<br>

Abstract: A conflict is a relational space in crisis in which the antagonists determine, in an interactive dynamic, what is at stake. As the negotiation goes by, ego states his truth line, while alter builds his offensive line based on a truth that becomes reality. Defending one’s truth means also fighting for one’s integrity; in other words, defining my truth is also giving a structure to my integrity, to my own self. If the literature of the I has frequently conflicts in its pages, it is probably because the reading pact is tied up to the truth. But making a narrative of the self out of the configuration system can also get the text in another kind of conflict where the frontiers of the diegetic levels become more and more permeable. Despite everything, the illocutary power in autobiographic literature, seems to change the way the « I » sees himself, and gives him a new ethos that suits him fine.<br>

Abstract: Ruben Borg's
         The Measureless Time of Joyce, Deleuze and Derridaargues that James Joyce'sFinnegans Wakemust be read as a singular attempt to represent the eccentric structure of post-human temporality. The book relocates theWakewithin a long history of philosophies of time as well as recent post-structuralist and information theory. Drawing upon the work of Gilles Deleuze and Jacques Derrida, Borg shows how Joyce's formal and narratological innovations enabled him to present a structure of time that does not obey the linear, humanistic progression of thebildungsromanbut instead manifests mechanical temporal economies of production and waste.<br>

Abstract: Like Hayes's “Snow for Wallace Stevens,” “Thirteen Ways of Looking at Blackbird (After Wallace Stevens)” by Olive Senior, a Jamaican poet living in Canada, reimagines the blackbird as an enslaved African arriving in the Americas. In addition to the obvious constraint of following a thirteen-part, meditative structure, each of Senior's sections picks up and revises select elements from the corresponding sections of Stevens's poem. Where Stevens in section IV offers a non-dualist philosophy (“A man and a woman / Are one. / A man and a woman and a blackbird / Are one”), Senior's poem offers a more jagged portrait, in which Blackbird, arriving on a sugarcane plantation, “no longer knows / if he is man or woman or bird or simply is” (IV). Abased and enslaved, a “survivor of the crossing,” Blackbird is “the lucky one in three” (II), exhausted and without the luxury to contemplate in tranquility, as does Stevens's poetic speaker (“I was of three minds,” II). Senior's rewriting changes how we read Stevens. When turning back to Stevens, the reader will hear Senior's resonances. Senior doesn't call Stevens a “foe,” but the implicit comparison—her corrective to the narrative—makes clear her position as she inscribes America's violent history of slavery into Stevens's abstract reflection and poetic structure. (Her rewriting concords with Thylias Moss's “Reconsideration of the Blackbird,” in which she writes: “Problem: No one's in love with the blackbirds. / Solution: Paint them white, call them visions, everyone will want one.”)
         
               Hayes and Senior apply the principles of cannibalistic poetics to their rewritings of Stevens, and by metonymic extension, to their rewriting/writing into the blanks or white spaces of American poetics. They show that poetry is not impartial: it tells the history of national culture.96<br>

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Remembering is a function of the meaning-making process after the emptiness of loss. Spelder and Strickland suggest that “grief is the emotional response to bereavement, to the event of loss” (as qtd. in DuBose, 368). The theologian Todd J. DuBose explains that “grief gazes at an ever-receding present as it moves further and further into the past. The immediate reaction often involves bargaining for a reversal of the loss, denial, anger, shock, anguish, distress, sadness” (368). These reactions are the body's means of trying to make sense of the world in the wake of the emptiness created by bereavement. Interpreting Drew Leder and Maurice Merleau-Ponty's notion of chiasmic structure of the body, DuBose explains that the body realizes its existence only in relation to other bodies. It touches because it is being touched. Other bodies make ours perceptible. The disappearance of these other bodies in death is, in tune with the chiasmic structure of bodily existence, the disappearance of our own bodies. We experience that disappearance as pain, grief, sorrow. These manifestations of pain are, indeed, the ways our bodies adjust to vacuum and fill it with meaning. For DuBose, “meaning-making processes, which
         appearto be immaterial processes, are embodied phenomena. Reflection, perception, feeling, language, even logic make sense only through the influx of the body's ‘reading’ of space, time, action, and sensation” (370).<br>

Abstract: There are hints here for understanding Africa though the various oceans and waters that surround Africa, but the vastness of African space overwhelms the possibility of a continuous
         longue durée. Furthermore, what of the Sahara and the great interior of Africa? Still, I think that the introduction of thelongue duréeas a historical structure might yet be useful for coming to an alternate understanding and meaning of Africa. Perhaps this angle of vision will allow scholars to understand better the internal rhythms and meaning of time in Africa and in other cultures outside of Europe. Such matters were not considered to be important dimensions of a world history. As a matter of fact, the very notion of a “world history” was coincidental with European hegemony.<br>

Abstract: Questions like this have shaped much of my own work. Being surrounded by so many enthusiastic but incompatibly articulate spokespersons for neglected lifeworld concerns, I concluded that criticism of tradition is most powerful when offered by those who are already in the midst of trying to be better phenomenologists—not, of course, in the sense that they are trying to be better members of a philosophical school but in the sense that they are motivated by the urge to find better ways to articulate something that tradition distorts or neglects. Why
      shouldaccounts of what matters most in life first be measured against the standards of “clear and distinct” propositional speech? Does anyone reallylive though life, thinking of it as a process going on inside our bodies? Do we reallyexperiencefreedom as an unconceptualizable combination of limitlessness and limit? And why throw the metaphorical wet blanket of a rigorously trained consciousness and its “correlates” over thepretheoretical practices of everyday life? Negative genuflections to philosophy's traditional priorities, privileging the subjective instead of the objective, inner instead of outer, lived body instead of house-for-the-mind—all of these inversions ultimately foster the continuing and undeserved hegemony of a traditionally objectivist understanding of what is Really Real. Kockelmans once told me that Merleau-Ponty eventually decidedPhenomenology of Perception“was not yet a philosophical book.” To be sure, its content and much of its treatment of that content is phenomenological, but its structure is still Cartesian. To start with specificallybodilyperception, however generously reconceived, still implies that other dimensions of presence to the world—linguistic, social, cultural, political, historical—can be added on at a later time, perhaps along with discussions of abstractly identified and timeless “topics” like freedom, the self, and so on.<br>

Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: If Kant reconciles ethics and politics by appealing to the rationality and goodness of God, for Levinas they couldn't be further apart precisely because of the relationship between the ethical face-to-face and God as infinite. Ethics is of the singular, unique, infinite, and untranslatable, an encounter with absolute alterity, whereas justice or politics is generalizable, finite, necessarily translatable, and requires arbitrators of civil codes. For Levinas, the gap between ethics and politics could not be wider (cf. Levinas
      1989). So, how do we get from the Kantian concept of duty with its source in reason to the Levinasian notion of responsibility as “the essential, primary and fundamental structure of subjectivity” (Levinas1985, 95)?<br>

Abstract: Fourth, Merleau-Ponty's final project following upon his
            Phenomenology of Perceptionwas an ambitious undertaking that shared many of the aims of the philosophical endeavors all too briefly reviewed; yet there are significant differences that both draw close to Husserl's working practice and displace it with another aim and schematic of conceptuality. Like Husserl, Merleau-Ponty had a penchant for visuality as a primary example of a sense-modal integrative schematicity, even as he followed Husserl's turn inIdeas IIto begin valorizing the sense-modality of broader qualitative sense dimensions—and especially pathic corporeal awareness, principally kinesthesia, and proprioception—as all crucial in the constitution of sense for and in the world. Merleau-Ponty also took up the anonymity mode of protoconstitution that Husserl entertained in his manuscripts, despite Husserl's insisting upon a nonpersonal kind of “I-pole” in the now-structure of the living present.<br>

Abstract: A second strategy is Grosz's desubjectivation of memory: “Matter and life are thus not opposites, binary pairs (plus or minus vital force), but intimately implicated in each other, different degrees of one and the same force. Life is matter extended into the virtual; matter is life compressed into dormancy. Life erupts from (and transforms) the material conditions that enable matter to ‘remember’” (2011, 20). Focusing on memory as material event, I place Grosz's work alongside that of Paul Cilliers, author of the 1998 book
         Complexity and Postmodernism. Cilliers defines “memory” as a “physical condition of the brain: which pathways are breached (‘facilitated’) and which are not. Memory is not a cognitive function performed by a conscious subject, but an unconscious characteristic of the brain (which is an organ, part of the body). Memory is the substrate that sets up the conditions for all the functions of the brain” (1998, 45–46). Memory is a distributed pattern of valences across a complex system. It is an essential aspect of complex systems open to their environments, Cilliers maintains, because it offers resistance to environmental changes. Repeated patterns of distribution strengthen the connectedness of various nodes or elements involved in a given systemic pattern; repetition intensifies some networks at the expense of others. Without these transformations, an open system would simply mirror its environment (Cilliers1998, 92). However, such systems do not simply project immediate environmental inputs or conditions. Rather, in some configurations, matter retains or repeats patterns resulting from past stimulation; in some configurations, matterremembers. When it does, it differs from its environment while remaining fully within the impact and draw of whatever surrounds it. This differing is what enables a material system to organize itself, differing further from but responding constantly to its environment. Memory is not representation; Cilliers write~<br>

Abstract: If SPEP began to challenge sixties professional philosophy externally, internally positivism was also being challenged. Its dominant form was undergoing a different set of challenges, which related to the notion of science itself. This was the era of the positivist/antipositivist controversies (there was not yet what could be called a parallel or related philosophy of technology subdiscipline). For those of you too young to remember, or not even yet born, it should be noted that for many positivists and some analysts, philosophy of science was all that was needed for philosophy. Philosophy of science equaled philosophy. Metaphysics, aesthetics, and whole areas of traditional philosophy were to be abandoned or regarded as “nonsense.” This version of philosophy-science, however, was met by Thomas Kuhn's
               1962
                     The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, to become the twentieth-century's most cited book, along with his kin, Karl Popper, Imre Lakatos, and Paul Feyerabend, who collectively were depicting a very different science, discontinuous, historical, using technologies (instruments), no longer simply a logo-linguistic, propositional theory machine.<br>

Article Title: Ethics and Religion in Continental Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: In my own opinion the most interesting expression of the religious turn in Continental philosophy is found in Derrida because Derrida is by anyone's standards a secular thinker and even, by the standards of the local pastor or rabbi, an atheist. So it came as a shock to read about Derrida's “religion” in his famous “Circumfession” (1989), which is a deconstructive riff on Augustine's
            Confessionsin which Derrida restages the scene of theConfessions. We come upon a scene in which the speaker (Augustine/Jackie), an emigrant from North Africa to the Big Apple (Rome/Paris), has his back to us and is praying to someone (te, God/tu), while his mother (Monica/Georgette) lies dying on the northern shore of the Mediterranean (Ostia/Nice). Derrida tells us that he has been praying all his life and that no one, not even his mother, has understood this, which has led to a misunderstanding of his work.
                  But to whom is Derrida praying, and how could he be praying at all? Does he not “rightly pass for an atheist”?20
               
                  There is a more obscure sense of religion “without religion” in Derrida, and a prayer to a God not only unknown but nonexistent that nonetheless constitutes a genuine prayer. If, as Jean-Louis Chrétien says, himself one of the new religious phenomenologists,21
               prayeris a “wounded word,” what word is more wounded than a word from one who does not know to whom he is praying (a lost letter, destination unknown), or if anyone is there to hear his prayers, or if he is praying at all, who has to pray to be able to pray at all, for something, he knows not what, something “coming,” the coming or incoming (invention) of something unforeseeable?
                  Derrida's atheism is crucially important to his religion because it allows him to isolate the very structure of prayer, and hence of the religious posture, with or without what we in the great monotheisms call “God,” thereby putting into questi~<br>

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutics, moreover, challenges the central role that Husserl ascribes to intuition, especially in his early works. The call to return to the things themselves is heeded by a return to what is given in intuition. But, as Ricoeur puts it, “the Husserlian demand for the return to intuition is countered by the necessity for all understanding to be mediated by an interpretation.”
         
               In support of this claim, Ricoeur draws inspiration from Heidegger's conception of the as-structure of being, which maintains that being is always revealed in a partial manner, as this or as that.13
            
               This as-structure suggests that nothing is ever directly or fully given, and for this reason, what is given always calls for a process of interpretation enabling it to be seen as this or that. If it is the case that all givenness is perspectival and partial, Ricoeur contends that phenomenology “cannot constitute itself without a14
            hermeneutical presupposition. The hermeneutical condition of phenomenology is linked to the role ofAuslegungin the fulfillment of its philosophical project.”

Abstract: In this work, I argue that creative metaphors are formed when some persistent problem, caused by an inadequacy in preexisting knowledge, descends into the collective unconscious, is reconfigured unconsciously in novel ways, and then reemerges back into consciousness where the impasse is resolved by the metaphorical expression of new knowledge. To develop this position, I (1) review and critique some well-known language-based studies of metaphor, (2) summarize psychoanalytic and depth psychological approaches to the psyche as one way to overcome the shortcomings of the language-based scholarship, (3) relate C. G. Jung's account of the psyche and his related notion of synchronicity to creative metaphors, (4) graft a quantum physics approach to material reality back onto Jung's work as a provisional structure of the collective unconscious, and finally, (5) offer some suggestions about how creative metaphors might work psychologically.<br>

Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Derrida states that hyperbole is “the uneconomic expenditure,” which both can and cannot exceed economy. His statement has the structure of error without being an error. He speaks the language of extremity and of exceeding economy in order to emphasize the repetitive necessity of making the attempt to “throw beyond.” Through hyperbolic errancy, the repetition of the attempt-to-say-the-demonic-hyperbole, the signifier exceeds the signified that is already in excess. The attempt will never be completed but is always necessary. Thus, Derrida engages in a hyperbolic mode of thought regarding hyperbole itself in order to reveal that the radical attempt to throw beyond the economy of writing is an impossible possibility that must always be attempted but will never arrive.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Ultimately, faith is a condition of possibility—a necessary component—for an engaged and efficacious hope. Put differently, faith is primary and hope is secondary. This is true in two senses, neither of which diminishes the significance of hope in human affairs. First, faith undergirds hope in the same way that a solid foundation supports a subsequent structure. The substratum comes first, then the library or theater. Without a firm base, hope atrophies and may even collapse entirely when the harsh winds of life reach gale force velocity—just as poorly designed buildings come tumbling down during category 1 hurricanes. Second, faith is the core of the two major comprehensive belief systems that have guided
         Homo sapiens' growth and development through the ages: religion and science. Respectively, one grounds faith in a transcendent or supernatural agency that guarantees order, meaning, and purpose in the cosmos; and the second grounds faith in the power of the human mind to plumb the mysteries of the universe accurately on its own through observation, measurement, and verifiable experimentation. Though often at odds with each other, these tussling worldviews have at least one attribute in common. They each engender and nourish hope, much as the sun emits radiant energy. In this schema, hope is neutral with respect to religion and science. It can spring full-blown from either source and, in a manner of speaking, does not burden itself with determining what precisely presides over the earth and sky. It simply hungers fervently after a better tomorrow, delegating the underwriting of its activities to faith. All of this is germane to our efforts here because Shaw and Ricoeur were not only apostles of hope. They were also men of devout religious faith. They possessed a deep and lasting reverence for what they took to be the numinous, in all of its manifestations.<br>

Publisher: Norton<br>

Author(s): Matz Jesse<br>
Abstract: Mauriceis a novel that waits for the future (for completion, publication, and audience) but also looks nostagically to the past. This strange temporal location reflects a temporality basic to Forster's narrative structures and sexual identity: like philosophers who presently ascribe to the “tenseless theory of time,” Forster dispels identity among a tenseless order of moments, in a narrative structure that seeks likewise to trade “becoming” for a better order. InMaurice, such tactics as iterative seriality, overdetermined prolepsis, nonephiphany, and other modes of “detensing” give form to a version of homosexuality that would escape “identity,” with unusual implications for moderist temporality and narratological criticism. Forster's modernist time is eccentric for its interest in logical order; and the narratological criticism which would attend to his “tenseless” homosexual form must remember that it is often the combination of subversion and order that encourages the best narratological advances.<br>

Abstract: Elizabeth Bowen subjects both her characters and her readers to the dynamics of nostalgia in two of her novels.
         The House in ParisandThe Little Girlsare unique in Bowen'soeuvrein their use of “structural nostalgia”—a tripartite structure containing a section that takes place in the past put between two sections that take place in the present. Though this structure suggests that readers may simply engage in a nostalgic return along with the characters, Bowen uses it instead to force both her characters and her readers into a conscious examination of both the pleasures and the problems created by nostalgia.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge UP<br>
Issue: style.36.issue-1<br>
Date: February 25, 1984<br>
Author(s): Alber Jan<br>
Abstract: In
         Towards a ‘Natural’ Narratology(1996), Monika Fludernik reconstitutes narrativity on the basis of experientiality, i.e., humanity's embodiedness in the world, and claims that incomprehensible texts can be made more readable if one attempts to narrativize them. Since Samuel Beckett's short prose work “Lessness” is one of the most enigmatic texts of the twentieth century, it serves as an ideal test case for this new narratological paradigm. “Lessness” does indeed lose its initial strangeness if one reads this piece as narrative. Moreover, although a “natural” narratological analysis paves the way for a new interpretation of “Lessness,” the new paradigm provides only a partially satisfying analysis of it. To make the text fit into the new consciousness-oriented paradigm, Fludernik's quasi-universal naturalizing mode has to ignore certain aspects such as the mechanical structure of “Lessness.” Beckett's later prose work challenges narrativization and the “natural” narratological project. A reading of “Lessness” should be liberated from the confines of experientiality and instead concentrate on the role of chance and chaos. Beckett's text must be located in a counterworld, a limbo between signifier and signified. One should allow this limbo world to seep into the “real world” and not attempt to explain this different counterworld by means of “real-world” knowledge.<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: At the 1934 Congress of Soviet Writers, Karl Radek famously condemned Joyce's anally retentive bourgeois tendencies by comparing
         Ulysseswith “the component parts of a heap of dung.”
               It is certainly difficult to see bourgeois-suburban Joyce-Bloom as the epitome of the Modernist-Utopian tradition advanced by Jameson.71
            Ulyssesis a novel of immense and endless structuration, but one that resists structure itself, which resists the closure and determinism of epic or stereotypically Utopian mythologization. Joyce's work would most obviously take place in the comic-ironic—rather than the mythic—stages of Northrop Frye's generic cycle. As Jameson himself suggests, “The incomparable greatness of [Ulysses] comes from itsincompleteuse of myth: Joyce lets us see that the ‘myth’ is nothing but an organizational device, and his subject is not some fictive unity of experience which the myth is supposed to guarantee, but rather that fragmentation of life in the modern world.”
               So much, then, for artificial or organic unities: so much, then, for a Joycean Utopia.72<br>
