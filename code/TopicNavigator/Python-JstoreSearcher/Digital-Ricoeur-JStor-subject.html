  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76ttq">Exploring Jesuit Distinctiveness</a><br>
  Author(s) Leitão Henrique<br>
  Abstract: Due largely to their persecution of more radical strains of Enlightenment that emerged from Diderot’s editorship of the
                  Encyclopédie, many historians have too commonly neglected the important contributions of French Jesuit scholars to eighteenth-century culture. The distinctiveness of French Jesuit contributions to scholarship during the century of Enlightenment is the subject of this chapter. This chapter also emphasizes some of the ways in which the radicalization of the eighteenth-century Frenchsiècle de lumières—specifically its strains of atheism and materialism—were ironically shaped, however accidentally and indeed unintentionally, by debates already well underway among Jesuit intellectuals themselves.¹ Accordingly, this chapter<br>

  Abstract: I need to begin on two rather different notes—conventionally but sincerely with some words of gratitude and then somewhat unconventionally (and perhaps a bit less sincerely) with an apology. First, I want to express thanks to Tony Blair and his colleagues for their invitation to visit here and their kind hospitality over the past several days. It is real pleasure to meet and talk with members of the Centre for Research in Reasoning, Argumentation and Rhetoric and to make another pilgrimage to this mecca for the study of informal logic.

  Abstract: In 1919, Raymond Crist, the director of citizenship in the Bureau of Naturalization, appeared before a House committee hearing on proposed changes to naturalization laws. In his opening statement, Crist suggested that the true import of his testimony was to praise the recent education initiatives of Americanization: “There is, however, a far greater subject which I should like to present to the committee for its most careful consideration. That subject is the all-absorbing, Nation-wide question rather loosely referred to by the term ‘Americanization.’”¹ For Crist, effective Americanization altered the hearts and minds of the unnaturalized.

  Author(s) Alison James<br>
  Abstract: The subject of this essay is the role of fire and its explicit and implicit understandings in the Hindu and Buddhist traditions. At first glance, this appears to be a useful way of narrowing the scope of an essay that began with the impossible task of producing a mimetic analysis of Indian religions. But the scope thus narrowed is still much too broad to be manageable. As in Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism, and Judaism, the understanding of fire in the Hindu and Buddhist traditions is in equal measure heterogeneous, historically contingent, and (in some senses) foundational, which makes for a wide<br>

  Author(s) Ell Theodore<br>
  Abstract: In the last few years, religion has increasingly become a subject of dispute. Two positions seem to be the most popular. On the one hand, outspoken atheists reject religion in the name of reason and science. On the other hand, we witness an increase in scholarship sympathetic with conservative Christian movements. In this chapter, I will use the term “new atheists” to refer to the former approach, and the term “new theists” to refer to the latter approach.<br>

  Abstract: How can intimacy become a subject for critical reflection?¹ Intimacy is typically understood to focus on emotions of love and supportive family bonds. But if family life is the beginning point for reflection on intimacy, it is not the only terrain we can explore in an effort to understand it. Helpfully, Julia Kristeva both broadens and narrows the field for critical reflection on intimacy. She broadens it when she links intimacy to art, religion, and psychoanalysis and cites the unique capacity of these forms of cultural expression to
                  protect the singularity of human life.² Kristeva narrows the context for critical<br>

  Abstract: La mancornadorais a theme in Mexican music that depicts a heavy existential experience between men and women. The songs are filled with graphic and painful metaphors. The outcome is often tragic and violent, and often involves the killing of women. The termmancornarrepresents power and control, and the animal horn is its symbol. It is a difficult subject to broach, but its presence in a number of songs and in social life suggests certain commonalities that are worth exploring. It is important to locate these themes within a broader frame, which includes ideas from Norman Denzin, Ernest Becker,<br>

  Abstract: AT THE HEART OF THIS book is a basic question that has heretofore largely eluded serious attention: How does history make its subject? Clearly, not all subjects are deemed historical at all times—that much has been clear from the beginnings of the discipline. What is required, then, for a particular object to become a proper subject of history? And what are the implications of such constraints for the history that is being written? In other words, what this book explores is the

  Abstract: An experimental novelist earlier along (his objective, in the Rumanian phrase, to ʺsabotage historyʺ), Eliade became a historian of religion and the greatest living reinterpreter of the sacred dimensions of religion and thought, setting these against a contemporary ʺdesacralization of natureʺ through an impressive sweep of disciplines and cultures (shamanism, yoga, alchemy, etc.). His large work on shamanism is still the best guide to the subject, reinforcing an intuition long held of the shaman as artist and thinker as well as ʺmedicine man, priest and psychopompus.ʺ In the present co-editorʹs book, Technicians of the Sacred (the title itself is a<br>

  Abstract: The subject of Canto XX is avarice, for Dante the most detestable of vices. Avarice—in this case the collective avarice of the kings of France, who in the poet’s lifetime thwarted the election of an emperor and effectively subjugated the papacy—destroys the ordered fabric of life, and the canto is notable for an impassioned speech delivered by a shade, Hugh Capet, who is a mouthpiece for the poet’s anti-gallicism. Canto XX is virtually devoid of lyricism, as befits the gravity of the vice, and it can be seen to fall into three parts, with a sustained central speech<br>

  Abstract: This innovative volume is an extended intellectual conversation about the ways personal lives are being undone and remade today. Examining the ethnography of the modern subject, this preeminent group of scholars probes the continuity and diversity of modes of personhood across a range of Western and non-Western societies. Contributors consider what happens to individual subjectivity when stable or imagined environments such as nations and communities are transformed or displaced by free trade economics, terrorism, and war; how new information and medical technologies reshape the relation one has to oneself; and which forms of subjectivity and life possibilities are produced against a world in pieces. The transdisciplinary conversation includes anthropologists, historians of science, psychologists, a literary critic, a philosopher, physicians, and an economist. The authors touch on how we think and write about contingency, human agency, and ethics today.<br>

  Abstract: In ″Hamlet in Purgatory,″ literary scholar Stephen Greenblatt challenges Freud′s privileging of Oedipus as the modern representative of psychological interiority. Greenblatt maintains that Shakespeare′s Hamlet is the one who does this work (chapter 5 in this volume). ″Remember me″ is the haunting demand of the dead father to Prince Hamlet. Following Goethe′s lead in seeing the prince as more of a neurotic than a hero, Greenblatt tests Jacques Lacan′s idea that the subject is the doing of the phantasm (1979) by actually traversing Hamlet′s ghost in history, so to speak. ″Something have you heard of Hamlet′s transformation: so I call<br>

But this chapter is also about something more—namely, the ambiguous nature of the empirically concrete happenstance to which we, as objective and sensible beings, are always subject.

  Abstract: Physical anthropologist Ashley Montagu (1905–99) started his 1942 study on race by calling his subject one of the greatest and most tragic errors of his time.¹ As a scientist, Montagu felt the need to disprove scientifically what he considered “man’s most dangerous myth.” By 1942 the dangers of racial theories had become obvious in Nazi Germany, where racial dogmas were exploited to justify genocide. After World War II racial thinking became taboo in Europe. Replaced by “ethnicity” or banned altogether, the word

  Book Title: A Problem of Presence-Beyond Scripture in an African Church<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelke Matthew<br>
  Abstract: The Friday Masowe apostolics of Zimbabwe refer to themselves as “the Christians who don’t read the Bible.” They claim they do not need the Bible because they receive the Word of God “live and direct” from the Holy Spirit. In this insightful and sensitive historical ethnography, Matthew Engelke documents how this rejection of scripture speaks to longstanding concerns within Christianity over mediation and authority. The Bible, of course, has been a key medium through which Christians have recognized God’s presence. But the apostolics perceive scripture as an unnecessary, even dangerous, mediator. For them, the materiality of the Bible marks a distance from the divine and prohibits the realization of a live and direct faith. Situating the Masowe case within a broad comparative framework, Engelke shows how their rejection of textual authority poses a problem of presence—which is to say, how the religious subject defines, and claims to construct, a relationship with the spiritual world through the semiotic potentials of language, actions, and objects. Written in a lively and accessible style, A Problem of Presence makes important contributions to the anthropology of Christianity, the history of religions in Africa, semiotics, and material culture studies.<br>

In a way, this is a study of these “eyes” and the things they saw, failed to see, or chose to ignore. By talking about eyes, Hourani aimed at something more substantial than a mere perspective or view.

  Book Title: Transpacific Displacement-Ethnography, Translation, and Intertextual Travel in Twentieth-Century American Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Huang Yunte<br>
  Abstract: Yunte Huang takes a most original "ethnographic" approach to more and less well-known American texts as he traces what he calls the transpacific displacement of cultural meanings through twentieth-century America's imaging of Asia. Informed by the politics of linguistic appropriation and disappropriation,
      Transpacific Displacementopens with a radically new reading of Imagism through the work of Ezra Pound and Amy Lowell. Huang relates Imagism to earlier linguistic ethnographies of Asia and to racist representations of Asians in American pop culture, such as the book and movie character Charlie Chan, then shows that Asian American writers subject both literary Orientalism and racial stereotyping to double ventriloquism and countermockery. Going on to offer a provocative critique of some textually and culturally homogenizing tendencies exemplified in Maxine Hong Kingston's work and its reception, Huang ends with a study of American translations of contemporary Chinese poetry, which he views as new ethnographies that maintain linguistic and cultural boundaries.<br>

  Abstract: Sociology and its companion social sciences, such as cultural anthropology and psychology, enjoy ambivalent relations with one another, and with sections of the humanities, from cultural history to the study of languages. To complicate matters more, the relations with the natural sciences are ambiguous as well and subject to debate. Intellectuals never created a clear-cut and generally accepted classification of the arts and sciences concerned with human behavior. The cognitive quality of literature and the visual arts never disappeared. Literary authors still claim to enlighten

  Book Title: The Mission of Demythologizing-Rudolf Bultmann's Dialectical Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Congdon David W.<br>
  Abstract: Since 1941, Rudolf Bultmann’s program of demythologizing has been the subject of constant debate, widely held to indicate Bultmann’s departure from the dialectical theology he once shared with Karl Barth. In the 1950s, Barth referred to their relationship as that of a whale and an elephant: incapable of meaningful communication. This study proposes a contrary reading of demythologizing as the hermeneutical fulfillment of dialectical theology on the basis of a reinterpretation of Barth’s theological project. As such, the volume argues that dialectical theology is fundamentally governed by a missionary logic. Bultmann’s hermeneutical theology extends this dialectical, missionary theology into the field of interpretation. Contrary to many critics, the message of God’s saving work in Christ, and not modern science, funds Bultmann’s hermeneutical program. Like Barth’s own revolution, Bultmann’s program addresses a false relation between gospel and culture. Negatively, demythologizing is a program of deconstantinizing, opposing the objectifying conflation of kerygma and culture that he calls “myth.” Positively, demythologizing is a form of intercultural hermeneutics, composed of preunderstanding and self-understanding. Demythologizing is therefore a missionary hermeneutic of intercultural translation.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287gfz">Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture</a><br>
  Abstract: My way of formulating the contrast between metaphor and metonymy is indebted to various linguistic, structuralist, and semiotic discussions for some, but not all, of its elements. I have selectively synthesized certain aspects that characteristically emerge in those discussions and rejected others, so as to shift the emphasis of the distinction toward my focus on the problematics of culture change. Ever since Roman Jakobson placed the opposition between metaphor and metonymy at the foundations of language use, the terms have been subject to continuous definitional torquing and distension.¹ And although the privileged status of these tropes has been accepted or<br>

  Author(s) Segal Robert A.<br>
  Abstract: This is a book about how scholars make sense of what we study.¹ As a field of research whose primary focus is a fixed and finite set of data, biblical studies innovates less by discovering new objects of study than by finding fresh ways—or refining old ways—to examine its basic subject matter. Scholars investigate by designing categories of analysis and interpretation to achieve understanding. Regular assessment of the value of these categories—however recondite it may appear to a field’s outsiders—provokes scholarly self-consciousness and thereby strengthens the quality of research and advances knowledge.<br>

These Hispanic and Commonwealth migratory streams are linked by the legacies of colonial history or what the historian Gordon Lewis (1983) describes as an “agrosocial system of slavery developed in its fullest and most harsh form” (2).

  Abstract: "In the Holocaust novel, silence is always a character, and the word is always its subject matter." So writes David Patterson in this profound and original study of more than thirty important writers. Contrary to existing views, he argues, the Holocaust novel is not an attempt to depict an unimaginable reality or an ineffable horror. It is, rather, an endeavor to fetch the word from silence and restore it to meaning, to resurrect the human soul, to regenerate the relation between the self and God, the self and other, the self and itself.<br>

  Book Title: Questioning the Human: Toward a Theological Anthropology for the Twenty-First Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Van Stichel Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology is being put to the test: in the face of contemporary developments in the spheres of culture, politics, and science, traditional perspectives on the human person are no longer adequate. Yet can theological anthropology move beyond its previously established categories and renew itself in relation to contemporary insights? The present collection of essays sets out to answer this question. Uniting Roman Catholic theologians from across the globe, it tackles from a theological perspective challenges related to the classical natural law tradition (part 1), to the modern conception of the subject (part 2), and to the postmodern awareness of diversity in a globalizing context (part 3). Its contributors share a fundamental methodological choice of a critical-constructive dialogue with contemporary culture, science, and philosophy. This collection integrates a wider range of approaches than one usually finds in theological volumes, bringing together experts in systematic theology and in theological ethics. Authors come from different American contexts, including Black and Latino, and from a European context that include both French and German. Moreover, the interdisciplinary insights upon which the different contributions draw stem from both the natural sciences (such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and ethology) and the humanities (such as cultural studies, philosophy, and hermeneutics). This volume will be essential reading for anyone seeking a state-of-the-art account of theological anthropology, of the uncertainties it is facing, and of the responses it is in the process of formulating. The shared Roman Catholic background of the authors of this collection makes this volume a helpful complement to recent publications that predominantly represent views from other theological traditions.<br>

For centuries Christians have wrestled with defining what makes us particular in light of our humanity yet at the same time interconnected with God’s creation. Musings on this subject range from abstract philosophical speculation, to dialogue with the natural sciences, to a serious consideration of the diversity and complexity of the embodied human condition.

Instead, I want to turn to the question of justice (the preoccupation of the Hebrew Bible), for the infusion of this ethical concern is vital: political life must be lived under the horizon of justice.

  Book Title: Regard for the Other: Autothanatography in Rousseau, De Quincey, Baudelaire, and Wilde-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt E. S.<br>
  Abstract: Although much has been written on autobiography, the same cannot be said of autothanatography, the writing of one's death. This study starts from the deconstructive premise that autobiography is aporetic, not or not only a matter of a subject strategizing with language to produce an exemplary identity but a matter also of its responding to an exorbitant call to write its death. The I-dominated representations of particular others and of the privileged other to whom a work is addressed, must therefore be set against an alterity plaguing the I from within or shadowing it from without. This alterity makes itself known in writing as the potential of the text to carry messages that remain secret to the confessing subject. Anticipation of the potential for the confessional text to say what Augustine calls the secret I do not know,the secret of death, engages the autothanatographical subject in a dynamic, inventive, and open-ended process of identification. The subject presented in these texts is not one that has already evolved an interior life that it seeks to reveal to others, but one that speaks to us as still in process. Through its exorbitant response, it gives intimations of an interiority and an ethical existence to come. Baudelaire emerges as a central figure for this understanding of autobiography as autothanatography through his critique of the narcissism of a certain Rousseau, his translation of De Quincey's confessions, with their vertiginously ungrounded subject-in-construction, his artistic practice of self-conscious, thorough-going doubleness, and his service to Wilde as model for an aporetic secrecy. The author discusses the interruption of narrative that must be central to the writing of one's death and addresses the I's dealings with the aporias of such structuring principles as secrecy, Levinasian hospitality, or interiorization as translation. The book makes a strong intervention in the debate over one of the most-read genres of our time.<br>

  Abstract: What would a Levinasian autobiography look like? Is such a thing imaginable? The question is directed in the first instance at autobiography, as a question concerning its ability to go beyond the representation of the subject to write the encounter with the absolutely other for which Levinas’s ethical philosophy calls. But it is also, in the second instance, a question for Levinas, concerning the potential of autobiography to represent an alterity perhaps not fully accounted for by his philosophy. This double question presides over the reflection that follows.<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapter has tracked the alterations in the conceptual architecture of rights across the eighteenth century in English: In the early decades of the century, rights understood in the most general sense were conjugated through an early modern juristic conception of “right,” where that concept was hinged to a claim and tied to an ethico-theological description of society. The purpose of a right (and of rights, therefore) was to uphold and protect both civic and religious institutions within which the subject appeared as a coherent and cohesive social entity. Although such entities could only, also, be political, it was<br>

  Abstract: During the last few decades of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth century, there was what we could call an idealist consensus among most US philosophers. This idealist consensus emerged in the late 1870s as American postsecondary education underwent a profound transformation. As research universities emerged from 1875 until 1910,¹ philosophy transitioned from being a subject studied primarily in the senior seminar in moral philosophy, and often taught by the president of a college, to being an autonomous discipline which trained professionals who were qualified to teach the main areas of philosophy (e.g., logic, metaphysics, and<br>

  Book Title: Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): MACKENDRICK KARMEN<br>
  Abstract: Theology usually appears to us to be dogmatic, judgmental, condescending, maybe therapeutic, or perhaps downright fantastical-but seldom enticing. Divine Enticement takes as its starting point that the meanings of theological concepts are not so much logical, truth-valued propositions-affirmative or negative-as they are provocations and evocations. Thus it argues for the seductiveness of both theology and its subject-for, in fact, infinite seduction and enticement as the very sense of theological query. The divine name is one by which we are drawn toward the limits of thought, language, and flesh. The use of language in such conceptualization calls more than it designates. This is not a flaw or a result of vagueness or imprecision in theological language but rather marks the correspondence of such language to its subject: that which, outside of or at the limit of our thought, draws us as an enticement to desire, not least to intellectual desire. Central to the text is the strange semiotics of divine naming, as a call on that for which there cannot be a standard referent. The entanglement of sign and body, not least in interpretations of the Christian incarnation, both grounds and complicates the theological abstractions. A number of traditional notions in Christian theology are reconceived here as enticements, modes of drawing the desires of both body and mind: faith as "thinking with assent"; sacraments as "visible words" read in community; ethics as responsiveness to beauty; prayer as the language of address; scripture as the story of meaning-making. All of these culminate in a sense of a call to and from the purely possible, the open space into which we can be enticed, within which we can be divinely enticing.<br>

  Thoughts on a Prior Possible from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x08ps">Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions</a><br>
  Abstract: The very notion of seductive ethics is likely to give us pause, to seem more error than paradox. Ethics is more often than not conceived as the very resistance to seduction, if not in fact to any sort of pleasure (or bliss, which seems to undermine the ethical subject).¹ It is dutiful, we think, a little bit ascetic (provided we don’t overly enjoy our asceticism), rule-bound or abstemiously virtuous. And if seduction is about sustaining the possible, then to prescribe, whether character or behavior, seems contradictory to it. But the prescriptions of ethics are not always a matter of foreclosure;<br>

  Abstract: Insofar as Western philosophy, like Christianity, begins with a scene of capital punishment—that of Socrates being sentenced and put to death—doesn’t it also have its beginnings in the death penalty? Derrida answers that philosophers from Kant to Levinas justify the death penalty and “just” wars on the basis of
                  lex talionis, which takes us back not only to its theological roots but also to the basis of sovereignty (2004, 146).¹ For the sake of protection by the state, citizens subject themselves to state sovereignty and grant to the state, and only to the state, the power to kill.<br>

  Book Title: Reading Descartes Otherwise: Blind, Mad, Dreamy, and Bad-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lee Kyoo<br>
  Abstract: Focusing on the first four images of the Other mobilized in Descartes' Meditations--namely, the blind, the mad, the dreamy, and the bad--Reading Descartes Otherwise casts light on what have heretofore been the phenomenological shadows of "Cartesian rationality." In doing so, it discovers dynamic signs of spectral alterity lodged both at the core and on the edges of modern Cartesian subjectivity. Calling for a Copernican reorientation of the very notion "Cartesianism," the book's series of close, creatively critical readings of Descartes' signature images brings the dramatic forces, moments, and scenes of the cogito into our own contemporary moment. The author patiently unravels the knotted skeins of ambiguity that have been spun within philosophical modernity out of such cliches as "Descartes, the abstract modern subject" and "Descartes, the father of modern philosophy"--a figure who is at once everywhere and nowhere. In the process, she revitalizes and reframes the legacy of Cartesian modernity, in a way more mindful of its proto-phenomenological traces.<br>

  Abstract: This study focuses on the obstinate obtrusiveness of what Martin Heidegger calls

Often translated by “equipment,” the term is probably better understood as the underlying stuff of everyday life,¹ the tools and equipment that are at one’s disposal. Malicious objects refuse to disappear into their automatic, unconscious functionality and instead remain stubbornly conspicuous. Endowed with agency, these cunning and perfidious intruders into the lifeworld of the subject seem to actively interrupt his or her intentions, unleashing anger and rage<br>

By the time we arrive at Calderón’s dream play, the effects of sovereignty’s rupture from the King’s body, staged in Shakespeare’sRichard II, could be said to be complete. Sovereignty, inLife Is a Dream, no longer speaks through—at least the human—body at all.

To act properly as a mayor of a city, a chief of a police department, a head of a large corporation, or a commander of an engaged military unit, one must have morally dirty hands. Further, this theory insists, we do not want leaders who are so concerned with their own personal morality<br>

  Book Title: Citizenship in Heaven and on Earth-Karl Barth's Ethics<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Massmann Alexander<br>
  Abstract: While Karl Barth is one of the most significant theologians of the twentieth century, his contribution to ethics is less well known and subject to controversy among interpreters. Barth combined his commitment to the church and its particular task in faith and theology with a concern for ethics and politics in wider society. By examining the historical development of Barth’s ethics, this study traces the vital influences and considerable shifts in Barth’s understanding of the ethical task, situating him within his political context. Alexander Massmann provides a comprehensive explication and assessment of the full scope of Barth’s ethics, from the first edition of the Romans commentary to the final volume of the Church Dogmatics. General questions of Barth’s methodology in ethics and case studies in applied ethics are both analyzed in their intricate connection to his dogmatic thought. The study highlights how an ethical approach emerged in which the freedom of the gospel allows for considerable openness to empirical insights from other disciplines. The author reevaluates Barth’s ethics in a constructive vision of the role of the church in the quest for a just society.<br>

  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Renshaw Sal<br>
  Abstract: *The Subject of Love: Hélène Cixous and the Feminine Divine* is about abundant, generous, other-regarding love. In the history of Western ideas of love, such a configuration has been inseparable from our ideas about divinity and the sacred; often reserved only for God; and rarely thought of as a human achievement. This book is a substantial engagement with her philosophies of love, inviting the reader to reflect on the conditions of subjectivity that just might open us to something like a divine love of the other. Renshaw follows this thread in this genealogy of abundant love: the thread that connects the subject of love from 5th century B.C.E. Greece and Plato, to the 20th century protestant theology of agapic love of Anders Nygren, to the late 20th century poetico-philosophy of Hélène Cixous. This study will be of particular interest to academics and students of the history of gender, cultural studies, criticism and gender studies<br>

  Abstract: "Shakespeare and Spenser: Attractive Opposites" is a much-needed volume that brings together ten original papers by the experts, on the relations between Spenser and Shakespeare. There has been much noteworthy work on the linguistic borrowings of Shakespeare from Spenser, but the subject has never before been treated systematically, and the linguistic borrowings lead to broader-scale borrowings and influences which are treated here. An additional feature of the book is that for the first time a large bibliography of previous work is offered which will be of the greatest help to those who follow up the opportunities offered by this collection. "Shakespeare and Spenser: Attractive Opposites" presents new approaches, heralding a resurgence of interest in the relations between two of the greatest Renaissance English poets to a wider scholarly group and in a more systematic manner than before.

I will focus on his analysis of suffering, and its application to his Christology, in particular to the death of Christ. In a second part, I will then subject Schillebeeckx’s negative contrast experience to some critical analysis by engaging with a southern global experience still struggling with remnants of colonialism. Thirdly, I will bring the results of my investigation into dialogue with insights from indigenous New Zealand Maori theologian, Henare Tate, as he reflects upon<br>

  A Conversation between Bonhoeffer and Levinas on Vulnerability from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt163t8jp">The Bonhoeffer Legacy</a><br>
  Author(s) Barnett Victoria J<br>
  Abstract: The article focuses on the understanding of vulnerability that is found in the thought of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Emmanuel Levinas. For Bonhoeffer, vulnerability is best understood as a form of ‘vulnerable discipleship’, that is, a choosing to be vulnerable for the other which aligns with his understanding of costly grace. For Levinas, vulnerability is primarily concerned with the vulnerability of the other person and, later in his thought, the vulnerability of the subject who is responsible for the other person. In exploring the grounds for possible conversation between these two thinkers, we argue that Levinas has potential to offer a<br>

  Abstract: Biblical interpretation is a crucial subject for all Christian believers. If the Bible is the Magna Carta for the Christian community (2 Tim 3:16–17), it is important that the community and individuals within it understand and apply the Scriptures correctly. The Seventh-day Adventist Church is an example of a denomination that has long recognised the necessity of following proper hermeneutical rules.

  Abstract: In 1984, delivering a speech commemorating peace in Europe, Emmanuel Lévinas underlines how the West lacks “a sensibility in which the scandal of murder is not suppressed even when the violence is rationally necessary.”¹ If the vitalist mask of the subject holds war inevitable and even healthy, the rationalist mask holds it all the more necessary to secure peace. Intuiting that the two masks demonstrate a substantial complicity and distrusting an idea of peace that continues to be based on war, Lévinas elaborates a radical critique of violence that is based on an atypical reading of the sixth commandment—or,<br>

  Abstract: Reexamining Emmanuel Levinas's essays on Jewish education, Claire Elise Katz provides new insights into the importance of education and its potential to transform a democratic society, for Levinas's larger philosophical project. Katz examines Levinas's "Crisis of Humanism," which motivated his effort to describe a new ethical subject. Taking into account his multiple influences on social science and the humanities, and his various identities as a Jewish thinker, philosopher, and educator, Katz delves deeply into Levinas's works to understand the grounding of this ethical subject.<br>

  Abstract: “How does one become the kind of ethical subject Levinas describes?” This question typically emerges in response to discussions about Levinas’s ethical project. In other words, the discussion frequently shifts from the description of the ethical subject to the question of origin: Is Levinas simply describing an ethical subjectivity that already exists or is he describing a subjectivity that is “not yet”? Implicit in these questions is an underlying concern that there is a normative dimension to this ethical subject. And of course, one response to this type of question is simply to say that it is the wrong question<br>

Unlike other texts on the subject, Small Places, Large Issues incorporates the anthropology of complex modern societies. Using reviews of key monographs to illustrate his argument, Eriksen's lucid and accessible text remains an established introductory text in anthropology. This new, fourth edition is updated throughout and increases the emphasis on the interdependence of human worlds. There is a new discussion of the new influence cultural studies and natural science on anthropology.

  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Garsten Christina<br>
  Abstract: Fredrik Barth is one of the towering figures of twentieth-century anthropology. This intellectual history traces the development of Barth’s ideas and explores the substance of his contributions. In an accessible style, Thomas Eriksen’s biographical study reveals the magic of ethnography to professional anthropologists and non-practitioners alike. Exploring his six decade career, it follows Barth from early ecological studies in Pakistan, to political studies in Iran, to groundbreaking fieldwork in Norway, New Guinea, Bali and Bhutan. Eriksen argues that Barth's voracious appetite for fieldwork holds the key to understanding his remarkable intellectual development and the insights it produced. The book raises many of the same questions that emerge from Barth's own work - of unity and diversity, of culture and relativism, of art and science. Thomas Eriksen is himself a major contributor to the study of anthropology, as well as a distinguished educator, and is therefore ideally placed to introduce the life and work of Fredrik Barth. This will surely be the definitive book on its subject for many years to come.<br>

The book is divided into two parts. Part One traces the institutional fortunes of Irish Studies in Ireland, the USA, Canada, Australia and Britain. Part Two features in-depth critical accounts of specific trends and themes within Irish historiography, literary criticism, religion, migration, music, cultural geography, sport and media culture. Throughout the collection there is a recurring engagement with the role of interdisciplinary approaches within Irish Studies and its impact on teaching and research. Combining synoptic overviews with informed analyses, Ireland Beyond Boundaries is an essential text for all those working in the field.<br>

Cultural creativity is investigated as an ever-emergent feature in the world (Wagner 1981), and it is generally acknowledged that the ‘healthy perpetuation of cultural traditions requires invention as well as rote repetition’ (Rosaldo et al. 1993:5).<br>

  Abstract: If individual consciousness and agency is seen as responsible for creating and maintaining the diversity of cultural worlds, then anthropologically to ‘decolonize’ the individual human subject also entails the anthropologist proclaiming the value of the former as a prerequisite of the latter. It becomes an anthropological duty to explain that individuals make communities and create traditions, likewise to champion those social environments in which such individuality is recognized and respected, and to declaim against those which bury individual worth under a weight of so-called traditional or revelational or institutional knowledge and practice. Anthropology, in other words, becomes, at least in<br>

This had been recognized already by Alberti’s contemporaries; the striking versatility of his writings led Cristoforo Landino to characterize him as a “new chameleon” (nuovo cameleonta) in 1481.² A few years later, in 1486 , Angelo Poliziano’s preface to the first edition ofDe re aedificatoriafor Lorenzo de’ Medici noted the many-sidedness of this<br>

  Abstract: In the decade between 1395 and 1405, Christine de Pizan successfully established herself as a major figure in French literary history. This process necessarily involved a complex coming to terms with the dominant discursive practices of the late-medieval literary tradition: the creation of a new and distinctive voice within the context of this tradition. For Christine, this posed a special set of problems. It was not simply a question of attaining and demonstrating her formal mastery of various established literary genres. Her identity as a woman inevitably problematized her status as an “official” speaking subject in all of these generic<br>

  Author(s) Neville Robert Cummings<br>
  Abstract: As with all the classical pragmatists, Peirce’s interest in the subject of religion is subordinate to his more central questions. What Peirce has to say about God, creation, the church, faith, and love is systematically derived from a philosophy that, having semiotics at its core, spans a broad range of topics, such as mathematics, logic, epistemology, cosmology, linguistics, and occasionally even bridges design and engineering. It is this subsidiary status that, to my mind, lends methodological soundness as well as modernity to Peirce’s reflections, because the clear implication is that religion is not a primary phenomenon but something that develops<br>

  Book Title: Into the Far Country-Karl Barth and the Modern Subject<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Long D. Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Into the Far Country is an investigation of Karl Barth’s response to modernity as seen through the prism of the subject under judgment. By suggesting that Barth offers a form of theological resistance to the Enlightenment’s construal of human subjectivity as “absolute," this piece offers a way of talking about the formation of human persons as the process of being kenotically laid bare before the cross and resurrection of Christ. It does so by reevaluating the relationship between Barth and modernity, making the case that Barth understands Protestantism to have become the agent of its own demise by capitulating to modernity’s insistence on the axiomatic priority of the isolated Cartesian ego. Conversations are hosted with figures including Fyodor Dostoevsky, Rowan Williams, Gillian Rose and Donald MacKinnon in the service of elucidating an account of the human person liberated from captivity to what Barth names “self-judgment," and freed for creative participation in the super-abundant source of life that is the prayerful movement from the Son to the Father in the Spirit. Therefore, an account of Barth’s theology is offered that is deeply concerned with the triune God’s revelatory presence as that which drives the community into the crucible of difficulty that is the life of kenotic dispossession.<br>

  Abstract: The question I posed at the beginning of this book was whether or not Barth’s construction of subjectivity is Kantian, and what the theological consequence of the answer might be. Bruce McCormack maintains that Barth was attempting to be “orthodox under the conditions of modernity,” meaning Barth arrives at an armistice with Kantian epistemics—indeed, with the turn to the subject—while at the same time finding noetic space for revelatory encounter in a christologically grounded dialectical relation between veiling and unveiling. At this stage my argument with McCormack is over, and I do not wish to cover this ground<br>

Jameson’s negative utopianism embraces this aspect of failure, but it is important to understand that this failure is not simply the commonplace fatality of a compromised individual or authorial imagination. It is, instead, what Jameson calls “the systemic, cultural, and ideological closure of which we are all in one way or another prisoners.”¹ Despite Thomas More’s inspiration for, and association with, utopianism of<br>

Public history is defined by this extension of the domain within which the scholar operates. The audience for historical literature defines the discipline as much as the professional credentials of the practitioner. Public history is thus an attempt to flee from the increasing specialisation and decreasing readership of professional academic work, both in journals and in monograph form.

The subject—seen as the “interpretant” in a triadic semiotic process—becomes an instance in the self-interpretation of the universe of signs. Thus, perception of reality and reality itself coincide. This can be experienced in what Peirce calls the category of “Firstness.” Following Peirce, the contemplation of reality in the immediate experience of its quality (Firstness) is a phenomenological task. In Peirce’s “humble argument” for the reality of God, the experience of Firstness can account<br>

  Abstract: The purpose of the present part is to examine the philosophical development of the hermeneutical subject and ethics of the Other in the Western context, viewing the struggle with the enlightenment project and also in the aftermath of modernity. A philosophical debate concerning the legacy of the Enlightenment finds its voice in a postcolonial argument in the aftermath of colonialism. In order to understand and develop a global-critical and postcolonial study of Confucian philosophy of interpretation and ethical integrity in the dialogue of civilizations (in Part IV), it is important to review the modernist and postmodernist debate concerning the hermeneutical<br>

  Abstract: I have explored the relationships between David and Saulides, with a narrative critical approach, in the last three chapters. In chapter four, which deals with the civil war years, two prominent Saulides, Abner and ishbosheth were brutally murdered in cold blood. While there were no sufficient grounds for directly linking David with ishbosheth’s murder, there was significant circumstantial evidence implicating him in Abner’s murder. David’s dealing with Michal and her kin was the subject of study in chapter 5. David not only abandoned Michal when he fled Saul’s palace, but upon his return to israel had her removed, without concern<br>

  Book Title: A Double Vision Hermeneutic-Interpreting a Chinese Pastor's Intersubjective Experience of Shi Engaging Yìzhuàn and Pauline Texts<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Ooi Samuel Hio-Kee<br>
  Abstract: The aim of this thesis is to unfold the multilayered intersubjective experience of the author himself, a Chinese pastor. The author postulates himself as the subject in whom the said experience was evident, so that it can be analyzed and interpreted. The author argues for a cultural-linguistic experience of shì as the locus at which the intersubjective experience takes place. He then shows that such experience embodies a Chinese Christian’s ‘two texts’ inheritance, and argues that it is through unfolding or revealing of such experience that the nature of his relationship with them can be demonstrated.<br>

Admittedly, at first glance, this may appear as a rather farfetched idea, since Bonhoeffer was neither trained nor known as an economist and has left us no systematic treatment of his thought on that subject. Yet, there is the curious fact that Bonhoeffer’s entire adult life unfolded within an inexorable economic downward spiral. The height of that spiral was for Bonhoeffer in all probability the granting of his doctoral degree in theology in 1927.

  Book Title: Religion and Violence-A Dialectical Engagement through the Insights of Bernard Lonergan<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Arcamone Dominic<br>
  Abstract: The aim of Religion and Violence is to engage dialectically key symbols of religiously motivated violence through the insights of Bernard Lonergan. Sociologists and psychologists argue the link between religion and violence. Religion is viewed more as part of the problem and not part of the solution to violence. Bernard Lonergan’s insights have helped the author arrive at a number of conclusions regarding the link between religion and violence. He argues that there is a difference between distorted religion and genuine religion, between authenticity and inauthenticity of the subject. Distorted religion has the capacity to shape traditions in ways that justify violence, while genuine religion heals persons, helps them make different moral decisions when confronted with situations of conflict, and aims to explore new ways of understanding themselves as shaping history toward progress. Further, Religion and Violence, while arguing from within the Catholic Christian tradition, nevertheless seeks to provide a number of categories that will speak to people from other cultural traditions. Since many of the examples of religious violence cited by commentators come out of the Islamic tradition, the author has evidenced and explored more authentic aspects of the Islamic tradition that would help provide a solution to violence.<br>

To teach the reality of social class as both a literary trope and a socio-political category, in other words, raises issues concerning, not solely pedagogy or social hierarchy, but personal agency, identity politics, and subject formation.

Like Fabian’s (1983) perceptions regarding the subject of anthropology, kinship became the “Other,” perpetually locked in direct association with Africanist structuralist theory. Nevertheless, kinship “has insidiously slipped back everywhere” (Herzfeld 2007:315) and is here to stay. Grecanici kinship is highly politicized and contributes to dense networks of governance and representation. With a strong emphasis on patrilineality, kinship is a political and genealogical order with far-reaching consequences for socioeconomic organization. The coordination of the next generation of relatives is desired by people who know exactly their own lines of relatedness.<br>

  Abstract: By the time Sigmund Freud published
                  The Interpretation of Dreams(1900), the principles of psychoanalysis were in place. What were they? Laplanche and Pontalis’s scrupulous definition of psychoanalysis begins: “a method of investigation which consists essentially in bringing out the unconscious meanings of the words, the actions and the products of the imagination … of a particular subject” (367; cf. Freud, 1923b:235). This discovery or institution of the unconscious, that dark realm that governs us but which we cannot govern, whose contents express themselves obliquely—not transparently—in displacements, sublimations, condensations, and substitutions, was to be defining for psychoanalysis.

  Book Title: Citizen Subject-Foundations for Philosophical Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Steven<br>
  Abstract: What can the universals of political philosophy offer to those who experience the living paradox of an inegalitarian construction of egalitarian citizenship? Citizen Subject is the summation of +ëtienne BalibarGÇÖs career-long project to think the necessary and necessarily antagonistic relation between the categories of citizen and subject. In this magnum opus, the question of modernity is framed anew with special attention to the self-enunciation of the subject (in Descartes, Locke, Rousseau, and Derrida), the constitution of the community as GÇ£weGÇ¥ (in Hegel, Marx, and Tolstoy), and the aporia of the judgment of self and others (in Foucualt, Freud, Kelsen, and Blanchot)._x000D_ After the GÇ£humanist controversyGÇ¥ that preoccupied twentieth-century philosophy, Citizen Subject proposes foundations for philosophical anthropology today, in terms of two contrary movements: the becoming-citizen of the subject and the becoming-subject of the citizen. The citizen-subject who is constituted in the claim to a GÇ£right to have rightsGÇ¥ (Arendt) cannot exist without an underside that contests and defies it. HeGÇöor she, because Balibar is concerned throughout this volume with questions of sexual differenceGÇöfigures not only the social relation but also the discontent or the uneasiness at the heart of this relation. The human can be instituted only if it betrays itself by upholding GÇ£anthropological differencesGÇ¥ that impose normality and identity as conditions of belonging to the community._x000D_ The violence of GÇ£civilGÇ¥ bourgeois universality, Balibar argues, is greater (and less legitimate, therefore less stable) than that of theological or cosmological universality. Right is thus founded on insubordination, and emancipation derives its force from otherness._x000D_ Ultimately, Citizen Subject offers a revolutionary rewriting of the dialectic of universality and differences in the bourgeois epoch, revealing in the relationship between the common and the universal ~<br>

It can have a general neutral signification (that of an evaluation about the adequacy of means to ends or to the quality of the ends themselves). But more often it designates, in dissymmetrical fashion, the determination of a deserved or undeserved sanction upon the action of a subject, especially when the action in question is a “crime” or a “delict.”<br>

  Book Title: At the Limits of Memory-Legacies of Slavery in the Francophone World<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hodgson Kate<br>
  Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing body of literature dedicated to memories of slavery in the Anglophone world, yet little has been done to approach this subject from Francophone perspectives. This collection responds to the urgent need to contribute to current research on slavery and memory studies by focusing specifically on the Francophone world. Featuring the scholarship of leading academics in France, Britain, the United States and Canada, the collection reflects upon contemporary commemorative practices that relate to the history of slavery and the slave trade, and questions how they function in relationship to other, less memorialized histories of exploitation, such as indentured and forced labour. The volume is set against the context of France’s growing body of memory legislation, as well as its close cultural and political connections to its former empire, all of which make it an influential player in how slavery continues to be memorialized and conceptualized in the public sphere. Contributors retrace and redraw the narrative map of slavery and its legacies in the Francophone world through a comparative understanding of how these different, but interconnected forms of labour exploitation have been remembered and/or forgotten from European, West African, Indian Ocean and Caribbean perspectives.<br>

Forced migration patterns across the Atlantic form the majority of the commemorative discourses on slavery in West Africa. Conversely, domestic slavery, which not only pre-dated and co-existed with the transatlantic and trans-Saharan trades, but has also outlived both, is often relegated to the<br>

It is on this basis that a consideration of music is undertaken. Music operates by means of thresholds, encouraging a certain porosity that mediates notions of “inner” and “outer” in a unique way, and facilitating the development of the subject as both “interior” and “exterior,” both “active” and “passive,” as both “giver”<br>

As the primary instrument of this absolute subject, philosophy shares in its autonomy and therefore is a discipline that rises above the determinations of history and everyday life. The distinguishing characteristics of Afro-Caribbean philosophy do not support this view.

  Abstract: The petroleum industry emerged alongside the late-Victorian imperial romance, a genre of FICTION in which white men have violent adventures at the Empire’s periphery before returning, usually enriched, to its core. Because petroleum exploration was global, it would not be surprising to see cross-pollination between the romance and discourses on petroleum, in the form, for instance, of adventure novels about oil explorers.¹ Yet no such subgenre of Victorian petro-romance exists.² Still, even if the major imperial romances do not make oil an explicit subject, certain well-known works are demonstrably interested in petromodernity.

  Book Title: Supper at Emmaus-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): OLSEN GLENN W.<br>
  Abstract: Supper at Emmaus traces various important intellectual topics from the ancient world to the modern period. Generally, as in its treatment of the question of whether the long-standing contrast between cyclical and linear views of history is helpful, it introduces important thinkers who have considered the question. A preoccupation of the book is the appearance and reappearance across the centuries of patterns used to organize temporal and cultural experience. After an opening essay on transcendental truth and cultural relativism, the second chapter traces a distinction, common in historical writings during the past two centuries, between an alleged ancient classical "cyclic" view of time and history, used to describe the claimed repetitiveness of and similarities between historical events ("nothing is new under the sun"), and a contrasting Jewish-Christian linear view, sometimes described as providential in that it moves through a series of unique events to some end intended by God. In the latter, history is "about something," the education of the human race or the redemption of humankind. As in each of the remaining essays, the book then attempts to draw out the limitations of what the current consensus on this topic has become. It does this for such things as our current understanding of religious toleration, humanism, natural law, and teleology. Some of the essays, such as those on debate about Augustine's understanding of marriage or the concluding illustrated essay on the baroque city of Lecce, are published for the first time. Others are based on previously published contributions to the scholarly literature, though generally each of these chapters concludes with a postscript that engages with current scholarly debate on the subject.<br>

  Book Title: Memory Ireland-Diaspora and Memory Practices, Volume 2<br>
  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frawley Oona<br>
  Abstract: In the second volume of a series that will ultimately include four, the authors consider Irish diasporic memory and memory practices. While the Irish diaspora has become the subject of a wide range of scholar­ship, there has been little work focused on its relationship to memory. The first half of the volume asks how diasporic memory functions in dif­ferent places and times, and what forms it takes on. As an island nation with a history of emigration, Ireland has developed a rich diasporic cultural memory, one that draws on multiple traditions and his­toriographies of both "home" and "away." Native traditions are not imported wholesale, but instead develop their own curious hybridity, reflecting the nature of emigrant memory that absorbs new ways of thinking about home. How do immigrants remember their homeland? How do descendants of immigrants "remem­ber" a land they rarely visit? How does diasporic memory pass through families, and how is it represented in cultural forms such as literature, festivals, and souvenirs?<br>

  Abstract: Joyce scholars have always been interested in situating Joyce in historical context, but only since the late 1980s has the “Joyce and History” formulation become central. In part, this turn toward “history” has been philosophical. Less concerned with Joyce as a historical subject, the American academy in the 1980s and early 1990s produced a Joyce engaged with the subject of history—that is with history as historiography. Such critics as Robert Spoo and James Fairhall, then, constructed a Joyce preoccupied with history as ideological formation, particularly in relation to the orthodoxies of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century historiography (Fairhall 1993;<br>

  Book Title: Memory Ireland-History and Modernity, Volume 1<br>
  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frawley Oona<br>
  Abstract: Despite the ease with which scholars have used the term "memory" in recent decades, its definition remains enigmatic. Does cultural memory rely on the memories of individuals, or does it take shape beyond the borders of the individual mind? Cultural memory has garnered particular attention within Irish studies. With its trauma-filled history and sizable global diaspora, Ireland presents an ideal subject for work in this vein. What do stereotypes of Irish memory—as extensive, unforgiving, begrudging, but also blank on particular, usually traumatic, subjects—reveal about the ways in which cultural remembrance works in contemporary Irish culture and in Irish diasporic culture? How do icons of Irishness—from the harp to the cottage, from the Celtic cross to a figure like James Joyce—function in cultural memory? This collection seeks to address these questions as it maps a landscape of cultural memory in Ireland through theoretical, historical, literary, and cultural explorations by top scholars in the field of Irish studies. In a series that will ultimately include four volumes, the sixteen essays in this first volume explore remembrance and forgetting throughout history, from early modern Ireland to contemporary multicultural Ireland. Among the many subjects addressed: Guy Beiner disentangles "collective" from "folk" memory in "Remembering and Forgetting the Irish Rebellion of 1798," and Anne Dolan looks at local memory of the civil war in "Embodying the Memory of War and Civil War." The volume concludes with Alan Titley’s "The Great Forgetting," a compelling argument for viewing modern Irish culture as an artifact of the Europeanization of Ireland and for bringing into focus the urgent need for further, wide-ranging Irishlanguage scholarship.<br>

  Author(s) NIELSEN HENRIK SKOV<br>
  Abstract: In the theory of autobiography, theoretical developments in literary studies are clearly reflected. From an earlier mimetic understanding of the genre as the representation of an autonomous and homogeneous self the pendulum swung to the deconstructionist view, dominant in the late 1970s and early 1980s. According to deconstructionist tenets, there can be no representation of self in language, but only an illusion of “self” generated by a purely textual subject. It was at this point that theorists like Michael Sprinker even went as far as to proclaim the “end of autobiography” (Sprinker 1980). Since the late 1980s, however, the pendulum<br>

  Abstract: People’s relations with signs in Java, the degree to which they are master of or subject to them, at once indicate and determine their potency. This assumption about the relationship between self and Signs has important consequences for Javanese epistemology. Exegesis of wayang exemplifies these consequences, and I will take it as a starting point for a more general discussion of Javanese interpretation. My point is that, like speech, the signs that are an art form, a tract of ngèlmu, or a dream, all pose a challenge to a person’s autonomy, a challenge to which modes of interpretation are the<br>

  Abstract: Any account of the relation between myth and literature has a responsibility first to define “myth.” And there, with historical stubbornness, lies not merely a problem, but perhaps the entire subject of myth studies. On the one hand, there is a question as to what myths actually refer to, since they have come to mean many things, from primitive and sacred ritual to propaganda and ideological statements. On the other, there is a good deal of confusion and conflicting argument over how to define the significance of myth. Is it primarily a matter of thematics, or form, or function—or<br>

  Book Title: Sin and Evil-Moral Values in Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): PAULSON RONALD<br>
  Abstract: The confusion of sin and evil, or religious and moral transgression, is the subject of Ronald Paulson's latest book. He calls attention to the important distinction between sin and Evil (with a capital E) that in our times is largely ignored, and to the further confusion caused by the term "moral values." Ranging widely through the history of Western literature, Paulson focuses particularly on American and English works of the eighteenth through twentieth centuries to discover how questions of evil and sin-and evil and sinful behavior-have been discussed and represented.The breadth of Paulson's discussion is enormous, taking the reader from Greek and Roman tragedy, to Christian satire in the work of Swift and Hogarth, to Hawthorne's and Melville's novels, and finally to twentieth-century studies of good and evil by such authors as James, Conrad, Faulkner, Greene, Heller, Vonnegut, and O'Brien. Where does evil come from? What are "moral values"? If evil is a cultural construct, what does that imply? Paulson's literary tour of sin and evil over the past two hundred years provides not only a historical perspective but also new ways of thinking about important issues that characterize our own era of violence, intolerance, and war.<br>

Thus, a significant portion of the history of moving pictures involves dance movement.

  Book Title: The God of All Flesh-and Other Essays<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hanson K.C.<br>
  Abstract: Biblical faith is passionately and relentlessly material in its emphasis. This claim is rooted in the conviction that the creator God loves the creation and summons creation to be in sync with the will of the creator God. This collection of essays is focussed on the bodily life of the world as it ordered in all of its problematic political and economic forms. The phrase of the title “all flesh" in the flood narrative of Genesis 9 refers to all living creatures who are in covenant with God – human beings, animals, birds, and fish – as recipients of God’s grace, as dependent upon God’s generosity, and as destined for praise and obedience to God. The insistence on the materiality of life as the subject of the Bible means that the difficult issues of economics and the demanding questions of politics are front and centre in the text. So the Pentateuch pivots around the Exodus narrative and the emancipation from an unbearable context of abusive labour practices. In a similar manner, the prophets endlessly address such questions of social policy and the wisdom teachers reflect on how to manage the material things of life and social relationships for the well-being of the community. This emphasis, pervasive in these essays, is a powerful alternative and a strong resistance against all of the contemporary efforts to transcend (escape!) the material into some form of the “spiritual". All around us are efforts to find an easier, more harmonious faith. This may be evoked simply because of a desire to shield economic, political advantage from the inescapable critique of biblical faith. Such a temptation is a serious misreading of the Bible and a critical misjudgment about the nature of human existence. Thus the Bible addressed the most urgent issues of our day, and refuses the “religious temptation" that avoids lived reality where the power of God is a work.<br>

  Book Title: Researching the lifecourse-Critical reflections from the social sciences<br>
  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Hardill Irene<br>
  Abstract: Researching the Lifecourse features methods linking time, space and mobilities and provides practitioners with practical detail in each chapter. It covers the full lifecourse and includes innovative methods and case study examples from different European and North American contexts.The lifecourse perspective continues to be an important subject in the social sciences. Researching the Lifecourse offers a distinctive approach in that it truly covers the lifecourse (childhood, adulthood and older age), focusing on innovative methods and case study examples from a variety of European and North American contexts. This original approach connects theory and practice from across the social sciences by situating methodology and research design within relevant conceptual frameworks. This diverse collection features methods that are linked to questions of time, space and mobilities while providing practitioners with practical detail in each chapter.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter asks questions about the conceptualisation of the ontology of the social subject that informs biographical methods of research. Arguing from a psychoanalytically informed view of the subject, I suggest that emotionality and creativity as it derives from our capacity to dream (or what Freud referred to as primary process thinking), and our hesitant and uncertain development as subjects out of infantile states of near complete inarticulacy, are all necessary dimensions of a fully developed concept of what it is to be a subject.<br>

  Book Title: Zhou Zuoren and an Alternative Chinese Response to Modernity-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Daruvala Susan<br>
  Abstract: This book explores the issues of nation and modernity in China by focusing on the work of Zhou Zuoren (1885-1967), one of the most controversial of modern Chinese intellectuals and brother of the writer Lu Xun. Zhou was radically at odds with many of his contemporaries and opposed their nation-building and modernization projects. Through his literary and aesthetic practice as an essayist, Zhou espoused a way of constructing the individual and affirming the individual’s importance in opposition to the normative national subject of most May Fourth reformers. Zhou’s work presents an alternative vision of the nation and questions the monolithic claims of modernity by promoting traditional aesthetic categories, the locality rather than the nation, and a literary history that values openness and individualism.<br>

  Book Title: How to Do Comparative Theology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VON STOSCH KLAUS<br>
  Abstract: For a generation and more, the contribution of Christian theology to interreligious understanding has been a subject of debate. Some think of theological perspectives are of themselves inherently too narrow to support interreligious learning, and argue for an approach that is neutral or, on a more popular level, grounded simply open-minded direct experience. In response, comparative theology argues that theology, as faith seeking understanding, offers a vital perspective and a way of advancing interreligious dialogue, aided rather than hindered by commitments; theological perspectives can both complement and step beyond the study of religions by methods detached and merely neutral. Thus comparative theology has been successful in persuading many that interreligious learning from one faith perspective to another is both possible and worthwhile, and so the work of comparative theology has become more recognized and established globally. With this success there has come to the fore new challenges regarding method: How does one do comparative theological work in a way that is theologically grounded, genuinely open to learning from the other, sophisticated in pursuing comparisons, and fruitful on both the academic and practical levels?<br>

However, the intuitions of a fictionalized biography motivated by love for its subject might convey a “plausible” life bearing a mysterious affinity for “the poet’s work, if not the poet himself.”⁴ This relatively early statement on this subject by Nabokov, made during centennial celebrations of Aleksandr Pushkin’s death, becomes poignant in light of Nabokov’s novel Pale Fire<br>

  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Coe Cynthia D.<br>
  Abstract: Levinas's account of responsibility challenges dominant notions of time, autonomy, and subjectivity according to Cynthia D. Coe. Employing the concept of trauma in Levinas's late writings, Coe draws together his understanding of time and his claim that responsibility is an obligation to the other that cannot be anticipated or warded off. Tracing the broad significance of these ideas, Coe shows how Levinas revises our notions of moral agency, knowledge, and embodiment. Her focus on time brings a new interpretive lens to Levinas's work and reflects on a wider discussion of the fragmentation of human experience as an ethical subject. Coe's understanding of trauma and time offers a new appreciation of how Levinas can inform debates about gender, race, mortality, and animality.<br>

  Abstract: What is the relation of the sacred to religion? Could it be that the sacred is always already sacrilegious? What if the sacred is always already blasphemous, always already on the verge of unbearable? And what if this blasphemous, intolerable sacred is imagined to be the very foundation of religion?

  Book Title: Echoes of the Tambaran-Masculinity, history and the subject in the work of Donald F. Tuzin<br>
  Publisher: ANU E Press<br>
  Author(s): Roscoe Paul<br>
  Abstract: In the Sepik Basin of Papua New Guinea, ritual culture was dominated by the Tambaran —a male tutelary spirit that acted as a social and intellectual guardian or patron to those under its aegis as they made their way through life. To Melanesian scholarship, the cultural and psychological anthropologist, Donald F. Tuzin, was something of a Tambaran, a figure whose brilliant and fine-grained ethnographic project in the Arapesh village of Ilahita was immensely influential within and beyond New Guinea anthropology. Tuzin died in 2007, at the age of 61. In his memory, the editors of this collection commissioned a set of original and thought provoking essays from eminent and accomplished anthropologists who knew and were influenced by his work. They are echoes of the Tambaran. The anthology begins with a biographical sketch of Tuzin's life and scholarship. It is divided into four sections, each of which focuses loosely around one of his preoccupations. The first concerns warfare history, the male cult and changing masculinity, all in Melanesia. The second addresses the relationship between actor and structure. Here, the ethnographic focus momentarily shifts to the Caribbean before turning back to Papua New Guinea in essays that examine uncanny phenomena, narratives about childhood and messianic promises. The third part goes on to offer comparative and psychoanalytic perspectives on the subject in Fiji, Bali, the Amazon as well as Melanesia. Appropriately, the last section concludes with essays on Tuzin's fieldwork style and his distinctive authorial voice.<br>

Here, however, I do not intend to theorise the emptiness of the subject in an abstract, psychoanalytic sense. Instead, my conceptual and empirical focus is on a particular group of rural, post-colonial men. Specifically, this chapter concerns shifting signifiers of masculinity in the Sepik region in Melanesia, this being the issue and region that so vexed Tuzin (1997) in his magisterial account of the demise of the male cult in Ilahita<br>

  Abstract: Cultural historians necessarily deal in broad generalizations. Whatever is affirmed of a period, a people, or a nation, no matter how well-grounded by factual study and reflection, is subject to qualification. Exceptions to broad characterizations may always be found without mitigating the value of the broader insight. We grasp something when an author refers to the Greeks, to Roman civilization, to the Hellenic period, to Christendom, to the Benedictines, to the Renaissance, or to the Enlightenment. These designations, all generalizations formed by an examination of a host of particulars, indeed refer to something intelligible, something quite apart from the mind.¹<br>

Heidegger’s debt to Scotus manifests itself on the opening page of Sein und Zeit. Heidegger asks about the meaning of being, that is, to what essence (logos) does the word “being” refer (SZ 2/1). He assumes a single meaning of being, a univocatio entis, which determines and makes possible all thinking and discourse. And he assumes that this notion of being is the a priori possession of Dasein; it is pre-understood in all that Dasein thinks and says. Further on,<br>

For him the judgment in its fundamental nature is not simply a union of subject and predicate, but is rather the surge of the mind itself towards rest in the being of things 
                  (esse rerum). The judgment terminates not in a mental construction but in the thing itself (ad rem). This has led many Thomists to salute the judgment as the cash value of knowledge. Usually our attention<br>

  Book Title: Time in the Philosophy of Gabriel Marcel-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Tattam Helen<br>
  Abstract: Gabriel Marcel (1889–1973) stands outside the traditional canon of twentieth-century French philosophers. Where he is not simply forgotten or overlooked, he is dismissed as a ‘relentlessly unsystematic’ thinker, or, following Jean-Paul Sartre’s lead, labelled a ‘Christian existentialist’ — a label that avoids consideration of Marcel’s work on its own terms. How is one to appreciate Marcel’s contribution, especially when his oeuvre appears to be at odds with philosophical convention? Helen Tattam proposes a range of readings, as opposed to one single interpretation: a series of departures or explorations that bring Marcel’s work into contact with critical partners such as Henri Bergson, Paul Ricoeur and Emmanuel Lévinas and other insights into a host of twentieth-century philosophical shifts concerning time, the subject, the other, ethics, and religion.<br>

  Abstract: In addition to war, terrorism, and unchecked military violence, modernity is also subject to less visible but no less venomous conflicts. Global in nature, these "culture wars" exacerbate the tensions between tradition and innovation, virtue and freedom. Internationally acclaimed scholar Fred Dallmayr charts a course beyond these persistent but curable dichotomies in Integral Pluralism: Beyond Culture Wars. Consulting diverse fields such as philosophy, literature, political science, and religious studies, Dallmayr equates modern history with a process of steady pluralization. This process, which Dallmayr calls "integral pluralism," requires new connections and creates ethical responsibilities.<br>

  Book Title: Truth Matters-Knowledge, Politics, Ethics, Religion<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Shuker Ronnie<br>
  Abstract: Why should we seek and tell the truth? Does anyone know what truth is? Many are skeptical about the relevance of truth. Truth Matters endeavours to show why truth is important in a world where the very idea of truth is contested. Putting philosophers in conversation with educators, literary scholars, physicists, political theorists, and theologians, Truth Matters ranges across both analytic and continental philosophy and draws on the ideas of thinkers such as Aquinas, Balthasar, Brandom, Davidson, Dooyeweerd, Gadamer, Habermas, Kierkegaard, Plantinga, Ricoeur, and Wolterstorff. Some essays attempt to provide a systematic account of truth, while others wrestle with the question of how truth is told and what it means to live truthfully. Contributors address debates between realists and anti-realists, explore issues surrounding relativism and constructivism in education and the social sciences, examine the politics of truth telling and the ethics of authenticity, and consider various religious perspectives on truth. Most scholars agree that truth is propositional, being expressed in statements that are subject to proof or disproof. This book goes a step farther: yes, propositional truth is important, but truth is more than propositional. To recognize how it is more than propositional is crucial for understanding why truth truly matters.

  Author(s) SEERVELD CALVIN<br>
  Abstract: Writing in the wake of the furor over her account of the Eichmann trial, Hannah Arendt reflects on why truth and politics are, in her words, “on rather bad terms.”¹ Her analysis rests on dividing truth into two different types. The first type, rational truth, is the subject of mathematics and philosophy. It has a long history of tension with politics, going back at least to Plato, who worried about the displacement of rational truth by mere opinion. In the modern age, Arendt says, opinion has generally won the day, rendering rational truth politically irrelevant.² The second type, factual truth,<br>

Crassus replies that this is a familiar theme among the Greeks, but when Plato is eloquent against eloquence, he exhibits a failure of self-comprehension. The orator cannot be potent without having grasped the subject he discusses (1.48). Unlike the<br>

  Abstract: Any effort at devising and using a suitable form of scientific method must be clear about the subject of study. What are the phenomena into which we inquire? What are their boundaries? Once the field is established, we can ask what techniques (instruments, ways of collecting data, institutional supports, modes of employing evidence, modes of inference) may be suitable to its materials. Involved in this question is the issue of classification, which appears to be a necessary feature of most attempts at science: How can the phenomena under investigation be meaningfully ordered?<br>

  Abstract: The idea of Abstract Expressionism having a rhetoric—of artists such as Jackson Pollock or Mark Rothko having recourse to a set of verbal skills—will appear to most as a contradiction in terms. Abstract Expressionism has become synonymous with a reluctance to explain, and that reluctance has become associated with the assumption that it is irrelevant to discuss meaning as the relation between form and subject matter. The idea that explication is antithetical to Abstract Expressionist art was generated in part by critics who took artists at their word.

  Author(s): Evdokimova Svetlana<br>
  Abstract: This book explores the historical insights of Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837), Russia's most celebrated poet and arguably its greatest thinker. Svetlana Evdokimova examines for the first time the full range of Pushkin's fictional and nonfictional writings on the subject of history-writings that have strongly influenced Russians' views of themselves and their past. Through new readings of his drama,
      Boris Godunov; such narrative poems asPoltava, The Bronze Horseman,andCount Nulin; prose fiction, includingThe Captain's DaughterandBlackamoor of Peter the Great; lyrical poems; and a variety of nonfictional texts, the author presents Pushkin not only as a progenitor of Russian national mythology but also as an original historical and political thinker.Evdokimova considers Pushkin within the context of Romantic historiography and addresses the tension between Pushkin the historian and Pushkin the fiction writer . She also discusses Pushkin's ideas on the complex relations between chance and necessity in historical processes, on the particular significance of great individuals in Russian history, and on historical truth.<br>

  Abstract: The rhetorical modes of “negative” or “apophatic” theology — and of its twin, “mystical” theology — have since the 1970s attracted serious inquiry and extended discussion not only among theologians but also among literary theorists, and philosophers, who tend to share three interconnected concerns: the human subject’s finitude, its situation in language, and its desire. Among post-Heideggerian thinkers in particular, the fascination with textual and discursive traditions deriving from the negative theology of Pseudo-Dionysius (flourished ca. 500) almost always involves a fascination as well with the radically finite, desiring subject of language—to the point that one might suspect contemporary interest in<br>

  Book Title: Metaphysics in Ordinary Language-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosen Stanley<br>
  Abstract: In this rich collection of philosophical writings, Stanley Rosen addresses a wide range of topics-from eros, poetry, and freedom to problems like negation and the epistemological status of sense perception. Though diverse in subject, Rosen's essays share two unifying principles: there can be no legitimate separation of textual hermeneutics from philosophical analysis, and philosophical investigation must be oriented in terms of everyday language and experience, although it cannot simply remain within these confines. Ordinary experience provides a minimal criterion for the assessment of extraordinary discourses, Rosen argues, and without such a criterion we would have no basis for evaluating conflicting discourses: philosophy would give way to poetry.Philosophical problems are not so deeply embedded in a specific historical context that they cannot be restated in terms as valid for us today as they were for those who formulated them, the author maintains. Rosen shows that the history of philosophy-a story of conflicting interpretations of human life and the structure of intelligibility-is a story that comes to life only when it is rethought in terms of the philosophical problems of our own personal and historical situation.<br>

  Abstract: The theme “Aquinas the Augustinian” provides an occasion to overcome some contemporary stereotypes that pit a Platonic St. Augustine against an Aristotelian St. Thomas Aquinas. Augustine, in this scenario, is a world-despising rigorist wrapped up in a subject-centered, self-communicative approach to questions, whereas Aquinas is identified with a world-affirming, object-centered metaphysical approach.¹ There are differences between the two theological giants. But the differences are far more complementary than contradictory. The erection of contradictory contrasts has occasioned misreadings by contemporary writers unaware of the Cartesian or Kantian lenses through which they project onto the ancient texts typically modern and postmodern dualisms<br>

  Abstract: In recent years, scholarship on translation has moved well beyond the technicalities of converting one language into another and beyond conventional translation theory. With new technologies blurring distinctions between "the original" and its reproductions, and with globalization redefining national and cultural boundaries, "translation" is now emerging as a reformulated subject of lively, interdisciplinary debate. Nation, Language, and the Ethics of Translation enters the heart of this debate. It covers an exceptional range of topics, from simultaneous translation to legal theory, from the language of exile to the language of new nations, from the press to the cinema; and cultures and languages from contemporary Bengal to ancient Japan, from translations of Homer to the work of Don DeLillo.<br>

Metaphysical detection calls into question structures taken for granted after Edgar Allan Poe’s “Murders in the Rue Morgue” (1841): the hermeneutic strategies of rendering meaningful those signs which are unintelligible to others, and of divining the mind of an opponent; the epistemological method of discovering truth by questioning sources of knowledge; and the adept detective’s triumph over<br>

  Book Title: The Children's Table-Childhood Studies and the Humanities<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): DUANE ANNA MAE<br>
  Abstract: Like the occupants of the children's table at a family dinner, scholars working in childhood studies can seem sidelined from the "adult" labor of humanities scholarship. The Children's Table brings together scholars from architecture, philosophy, law, and literary and cultural criticism to provide an overview of the innovative work being done in childhood studies-a transcript of what is being said at the children's table. Together, these scholars argue for rethinking the academic seating arrangement in a way that acknowledges the centrality of childhood to the work of the humanities. The figure we now recognize as a child was created in tandem with forms of modernity that the Enlightenment generated and that the humanities are now working to rethink. Thus the growth of childhood studies allows for new approaches to some of the most important and provocative issues in humanities scholarship: the viability of the social contract, the definition of agency, the performance of identity, and the construction of gender, sexuality, and race. Because defining childhood is a means of defining and distributing power and obligation, studying childhood requires a radically altered approach to what constitutes knowledge about the human subject. The diverse essays in The Children's Table share a unifying premise: to include the child in any field of study realigns the shape of that field, changing the terms of inquiry and forcing a different set of questions. Taken as a whole, the essays argue that, at this key moment in the state of the humanities, rethinking the child is both necessary and revolutionary.

  Abstract: One of the challenges to theorizing masculinity in relationship to history is the way in which historical narratives are often implicitly gendered as masculine. Typically, this gendering takes the form of allegory, in which the imagined subject of a period is presented as implicitly or, less often, explicitly male.¹ Such a subject, then, becomes the bearer of temporality in the narrative constructed by the historical text. The modern male subject, for example, becomes imagined as exemplary of the universal modern experience. In such a context, temporality and narrative history become gendered, and it becomes a challenge to imagine other forms<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy of Communication-  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Butchart Garnet C.<br>
  Abstract: To philosophize is to communicate philosophically. From its inception, philosophy has communicated forcefully. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle talk a lot, and talk ardently. Because philosophy and communication have belonged together from the beginning--and because philosophy comes into its own and solidifies its stance through communication--it is logical that we subject communication to philosophical investigation. This collection of key works of classical, modern, and contemporary philosophers brings communication back into philosophy's orbit. It is the first anthology to gather in a single volume foundational works that address the core questions, concepts, and problems of communication in philosophical terms. The editors have chosen thirty-two selections from the work of Plato, Leibniz, Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Benjamin, Lacan, Derrida, Sloterdijk, and others. They have organized these texts thematically, rather than historically, in seven sections: consciousness; intersubjective understanding; language; writing and context; difference and subjectivity; gift and exchange; and communicability and community. Taken together, these texts not only lay the foundation for establishing communication as a distinct philosophical topic but also provide an outline of what philosophy of communication might look like.<br>

  Abstract: Part of the reason for taking on this subject, I guess, was the memory of teenage irritation, more than fifty years ago, when I found myself increasingly frustrated at the many occurrences of “thou,” “thee,” and “ye”; the suffixes “-eth” and “-est”; and “hath,” “spake,” “wist,” “wax,” and “brethren.” It was all so old-fashioned, out of date, not language I would use in any other context than reading the Bible.

  Book Title: Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory-Collected Essays of Werner H. Kelber<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Kelber Werner H.<br>
  Abstract: Jesus and his followers defined their allegiances and expressed their identities in a communications culture that manifested itself in voice and chirographic practices, in oral-scribal interfaces, and in performative activities rooted in memory. In the sixteen essays gathered in Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory, Werner Kelber explores the verbal arts of early Christian word processing operative in a media world that was separated by two millennia from our contemporary media history. The title articulates the fact that the ancient culture of voiced texts, hand-copying, and remembering is chiefly accessible to us in print format and predominantly assimilated from print perspectives. The oral-scribal-memorial-performative paradigm developed in these essays challenges the reigning historical-critical model in biblical scholarship. Notions of tradition, the fixation on the single original saying, the dominant methodology of form criticism, and the heroic labors of the Quest—stalwart features of the historical, documentary paradigm—are all subject to a critical review. A number of essays reach beyond New Testament texts, ranging from the pre-Socratic Gorgias through medieval manuscript culture on to print’s triumphant apotheosis in Gutenberg’s Vulgate, product of the high tech of the fifteenth century, all the way to conflicting commemorations of Auschwitz—taking tentative steps toward a history of media technologies, culture, and cognition of the Christian tradition in the West.<br>

  Abstract: Most pedagogical discourse in the 1990s revolved around critical pedagogies that generally mirror James Berlin’s image of social-epistemic rhetoric. While much other work was done in the period, it inevitably evoked the social-epistemic question: does this pedagogy seek to produce the proper political subject and corresponding critical text? The emergence of technological contexts in the middle and later 1990s changed the landscape in which this question would arise. The Internet opened the way for completely new social and pedagogical contexts. Much critical pedagogy began to focus on media literacy as decoding the dominant political assumptions and values in films and<br>

I have also held that what can be known and subsequently valued about the body and the self through dance is known and valued aesthetically. Such statements require further explanations of the aesthetic and, more particularly, the aesthetic in dance, which involves the ever-present subjective dimension of embodiment – the body-subject, which is impossible to know as the body-object is known.

It is certainly a controversial subject: it was probably one of the main causes for the impact that Modiano’s first novels had on the public, instantly creating a reputation for the young author.¹ We may wonder, however, whether there was more to this reaction than that of simple choice of subject matter.

                  Oedipus Rex and Antigone. It is Antigone whom the chorus describes as follows: ‘You alone among mortals live according to your own law.’ Her path thus takes her ‘down into the realm of the dead’.¹ The chorus means this partly as a rebuke: to obey her own and only her own laws<br>

This may help to explain why Hardy’s novels make more direct reference to painters and their works than do those of Thackeray, although an equally plausible explanation could be found in the later date at which Hardy was writing.

  Abstract: Globalization is changing the way we argue about justice. Not so long ago, in the heyday of social democracy, disputes about justice presumed what I shall call a ‘Keynesian–Westphalian frame’. Typically played out within modern territorial states, arguments about justice were assumed to concern relations among fellow citizens, to be subject to debate within national publics, and to contemplate redress by national states. This was true for each of two major families of justice claims: claims for socioeconomic redistribution and claims for legal or cultural recognition.

  Author(s): DURNIN KATHERINE<br>
  Abstract: On Diary is the second collection in English of the groundbreaking and profoundly influential work of one of the best-known and provocative theorists of autobiography and diary. Ranging from the diary’s historical origins to its pervasive presence on the Internet, from the spiritual journey of the sixteenth century to the diary of Anne Frank, and from the materials and methods of diary writing to the question of how diaries end, these essays display Philippe Lejeune’s expertise, eloquence, passion, and humor as a commentator on the functions, practices, and significance of keeping or reading a diary. Lejeune is a leading European critic and theorist of diary and autobiography. His landmark essay, "The Autobiographical Pact," has shaped life writing studies for more than thirty years, and his many books and essays have repeatedly opened up new vistas for scholarship. As Michael Riffaterre notes, "Lejeune’s work on autobiography is the most original, powerful, effective approach to a difficult subject. . . . His style is very personal, lively. It grabs the reader as scholarship rarely does. Lejeune’s erudition and methodology are impeccable." Two substantial introductory essays by Jeremy Popkin and Julie Rak place Lejeune’s work within its critical and theoretical traditions and comment on his central importance within the fields of life writing, literary genetic studies, and cultural studies.<br>

  Book Title: The Subject in Crisis in Contemporary Chinese Literature-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Cai Rong<br>
  Abstract: Post-Mao China produced two parallel discourses on the human subject in the New Era (1976–1989). One was an autonomous, Enlightenment humanist self aimed at replacing the revolutionary paragon that had dominated under Mao. The other was a more problematic subject suffering from either a symbolic physical deformity or some kind of spiritual paralysis that undermines its apparent normalcy. How do we explain the stubborn presence, in the literature of the 1980s and 1990s, of this crippled agent who fails to realize the humanist autonomy envisioned by post-Mao theorists? What are the anxieties and tensions embedded in this incongruity and what do they reveal? This illuminating and original critical study of the crippled subject in post-Mao literature offers a detailed textual analysis of the work of five well-known contemporary writers: Han Shaogong, Can Xue, Yu Hua, Mo Yan, and Jia Pingwa. The author investigates not only the literary characters within the texts, but also their creators—real subjects in history, Chinese writers whose own agency was being tested and established in the search for a new subjectivity. She argues that, reenacting the Maoist legacy, the literary search failed to provide a viable model for a postrevolutionary China. In addition, the deficiency and inadequacy of the subject cannot always be contained in the Communist past—a history to be transcended in the design of modernity after Mao. The representation of the problematic subject thus punctured post-Mao optimism and foreshadowed the eventual abandonment of the move to rethink subjectivity in the 1990s. By diving beneath the euphoria of the 1980s and the confusion and frustration of the 1990s, these critical readings offer a unique perspective with which to gauge the complexity of China’s quest for modernity and a fuller understanding of the self’s multifaceted experience in the post-Mao era.<br>

  Abstract: The fictional characters’ lack of subjective powers I have discussed so far unquestionably contradicts the humanist model of individual worth, rationality, and self-autonomy. But this should not lead to a simplistic denial of the recovery of the writers’ own creative agency. As Lacan would tell us, the attempt to represent absence is the first step toward replacing the void, opening up possibilities for signification. The breadth and depth of the postrevolutionary inquiry into the Chinese soul in literature attest to the autonomy the writers have reclaimed from Mao’s dictatorial cultural policy. Behind the variegated representations of the subject, there is<br>

  Book Title: The Phantom Heroine-Ghosts and Gender in Seventeenth-Century Chinese Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): ZEITLIN JUDITH T.<br>
  Abstract: The "phantom heroine"—in particular the fantasy of her resurrection through sex with a living man—is one of the most striking features of traditional Chinese literature. Even today the hypersexual female ghost continues to be a source of fascination in East Asian media, much like the sexually predatory vampire in American and European movies, TV, and novels. But while vampires can be of either gender, erotic Chinese ghosts are almost exclusively female. The significance of this gender asymmetry in Chinese literary history is the subject of Judith Zeitlin’s elegantly written and meticulously researched new book. Zeitlin’s study centers on the seventeenth century, one of the most interesting and creative periods of Chinese literature and politically one of the most traumatic, witnessing the overthrow of the Ming, the Manchu conquest, and the subsequent founding of the Qing. Drawing on fiction, drama, poetry, medical cases, and visual culture, the author departs from more traditional literary studies, which tend to focus on a single genre or author. Ranging widely across disciplines, she integrates detailed analyses of great literary works with insights drawn from the history of medicine, art history, comparative literature, anthropology, religion, and performance studies. The Phantom Heroine probes the complex literary and cultural roots of the Chinese ghost tradition. Zeitlin is the first to address its most remarkable feature: the phenomenon of verse attributed to phantom writers—that is, authors actually reputed to be spirits of the deceased. She also makes the case for the importance of lyric poetry in developing a ghostly aesthetics and image code. Most strikingly, Zeitlin shows that the representation of female ghosts, far from being a marginal preoccupation, expresses cultural concerns of central importance.<br>

  Abstract: In this paper, I will defend a feminist poststructuralist position as a nonrelativist standpoint. This position rests on the assumption, which I shall outline presently, of the historical decline of the classical view of the human subject. By way of introduction, let me say that I see it as one of the historical tasks of feminism to elaborate an epistemological and ethical position that is suitable to postmodernity in a gendered perspective. I would also want to suggest that this position conveys a posthumanist vision of subjectivity as a de-essentialized and historicized entity—a multilayered (not a fixed) phenomenon, more<br>

  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): DROR OLGA<br>
  Abstract: Princess Liễu Hạnh, often called the Mother of the Vietnamese people by her followers, is one of the most prominent goddesses in Vietnamese popular religion. First emerging some four centuries ago as a local sect appealing to women, the princess’ cult has since transcended its geographical and gender boundaries and remains vibrant today. Who was this revered deity? Was she a virtuous woman or a prostitute? Why did people begin worshiping her and why have they continued? Cult, Culture, and Authority traces Liễu Hạnh’s cult from its ostensible appearance in the sixteenth century to its present-day prominence in North Vietnam and considers it from a broad range of perspectives, as religion and literature and in the context of politics and society. Over time, Liễu Hạnh’s personality and cult became the subject of numerous literary accounts, and these historical texts are a major source for this book. Author Olga Dror explores the authorship and historical context of each text considered, treating her subject in an interdisciplinary way. Her interest lies in how these accounts reflect the various political agendas of successive generations of intellectuals and officials. The same cult was called into service for a variety of ideological ends: feminism, nationalism, Buddhism, or Daoism.<br>

While ʺsurvivalʺ conjures images of a stark minimalist clinging at the edge of existence, survivance goes beyond mere survival to acknowledge the dynamic and creative nature of Indigenous rhetoric.

Whiteside argues that Merleau-Ponty's objective in his political writings was to make existentialism into the foundation for a philosophically consistent mode of political thinking. This study discusses the inadequacies Merleau-Ponty found in the traditional philosophies of empiricism and idealism, and then examines the subject-object dualism that he believed deprived previous forms of existentialism of political significance.<br>

Writing is spacing, writing is woman, the inauthentic, the mime, at once present and absent, same and different (Jardine 184).<br>

  Abstract: Some friends have suggested that I begin these inquiries with a word about method. By what method can we apprehend a way of understanding that is not linguistic, and that is not equivalent with interpretation? The idea of an introduction on this subject is appealing. However, in some important ways, every text discussed or referred to in the following pages requires the development of a special method. When I work with texts, I read them to grasp the message of the letter and also to explore what is unsaid between the lines of written words. Sometimes this work requires attention<br>

  Abstract: In his famous 1967 essay “Art and Objecthood” Michael Fried argues that minimalist, or as he calls it, “literalist” art is an art of theatricality; that in its promise of interpretative endlessness—offered by Donald Judd’s boxes in figure 2, for example, which thematize the seriality of return—it fosters solipistic emptyheadedness; and that, banking on its anthropomorphic, dramatically powerful presence, it greets the viewer as a subject and panders to that subjectivity.¹ Pieces like Tony Smith’s black-painted steel box and Carl André’s figure-eight stack of rough cedar logs evade art’s primary responsibility and pleasure by dumping the job of<br>

  Abstract: The contemplative tradition in Western art was an erotic tradition. Violent and exalted, eroticism took many forms, but it was always present in that moment when the contemplator took to his heart the object of his desire. When this kind of absorption occurred in the asymmetry of viewer and painting, it generally hinged on invention, that is, on the subject portrayed. When it occurred in the asymmetry of artist and painting, it hinged on the manifold experience of previsualization, that is, on the instant of choosing the subject. The pathetic and affective fallacies played a role in both asymmetries.<br>

In Hardy and Conrad, “become who you are” is a calamitous and unwanted pronouncement. What these protagonists want is immaculate self-fulfillment, achieved in the idiom of their culture’s prescriptions. Tess would be pure, Jude would be learned, Jim would be a hero, Nostromo would be admired.

  Abstract: In the first section of this paper I will explain the necessity of posing the problem of nihilism differently from the way Nietzsche posed it. In the second section I elaborate on the idea that the philosophy of subjectivity—which is closely woven with the phenomenon of nihilism—is an attempt by Western thinking to compensate for the unhomeliness (Unheimlichkeit) of the world by means of a forced quest within oneself.

This hidden predicament lies in the fact that cosmology is being constructed from within the

While previously arguing that theological accounts of freedom and subjectivity must be cast in reference to the sovereignty of God, more must be said about the possibility of subjectivity for those made objects by normative “mankind.” In this regard, the emergence of feminist Pentecostal studies poses a sharp challenge to both systematic theology and gender studies. The experiences of Pentecostal women, often in non-Western contexts, confront common assumptions regarding women’s ritual experience and the emergence of subjectivity.<br>

  Book Title: Consider Leviathan-Narratives of Nature and the Self in Job<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Doak Brian R.<br>
  Abstract: Theologians and philosophers are turning again to questions of the meaning, or non-meaning, of the natural world for human self-understanding. Brian R. Doak observes that the book of Job, more than any other book in the Bible, uses metaphors drawn from the natural world, especially of plants and animals, as raw material for thinking about human suffering. Doak argues that Job should be viewed as an anthropological “ground zero” for the traumatic definition of the post-exilic human self in ancient Israel. Furthermore, the battered shape of the Joban experience should provide a starting point for reconfiguring our thinking about “natural theology” as a category of intellectual history in the ancient world. Doak examines how the development of the human subject is portrayed in the biblical text in either radical continuity or discontinuity with plants and animals. Consider Leviathan explores the text at the intersection of anthropology, theology, and ecology, opening up new possibilities for charting the view of nature in the Hebrew Bible.<br>

Among the many authors dealing with this subject, Farrell (1999) has examined rhetoric in terms of practice, and practice in terms of rhetoric, and his questions are very close to those I pose below.

  Author(s) Lim Jie-Hyun<br>
  Abstract: Modern historiography has often been a tool to legitimate the nation-state ‘objectively and scientifically’. Despite its proclamation of objectivity and scientific inquiry, modern historiography has promoted the political project of constructing national history. Its underlying logic was to find the course of historical development that led to the nation-state. Thus, national history has made the nation-state both the subject and the object of its own discipline. The ‘Prussian school’ provides a typical example. Not only was Ranke the official historiographer of the Prussian state, Droysen’s distinction between ‘History’ (

  Book Title: Conflicted Memories-Europeanizing Contemporary Histories<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Ramsbrock Annelie<br>
  Abstract: Despite the growing interest in general European history, the European dimension is surprisingly absent from the writing of contemporary history. In most countries, the historiography on the 20th century continues to be dominated by national perspectives. Although there is cross-national work on specific topics such as occupation or resistance, transnational conceptions and narratives of contemporary European history have yet to be worked out. This volume focuses on the development of a shared conception of recent European history that will be required as an underpinning for further economic and political integration so as to make lasting cooperation on the old continent possible. It tries to overcome the traditional national framing that ironically persists just at a time when organized efforts to transform Europe from an object of debate to an actual subject have some chance of succeeding in making it into a polity in its own right.<br>

  Abstract: It was bound to happen. After some supposed authority boldly announces ten commandments for good research practices in his domain (Depaepe, 2010), another one suddenly pops up – in this case a ‘real’ authority – who cannot resist the urge to give a sermon on almost the same subject (Labaree, 2011). The historical but often repressed relationship between theology and pedagogy, repeatedly trumpeted by people like Fritz Osterwalder (2003), must have stuck in the subconscious of the historians of education.

  Book Title: Beyond Federal Dogmatics (pdf)-The Influence of EU Law on Belgian Constitutional Case Law Regarding Federalism<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Feyen Stef<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between EU law and national constitutional law, including constitutional law in federalism matters, has been subject to an ongoing scholarly debate. This monograph contributes to this debate in two ways. The author argues for an approach to constitutional law that goes beyond the classic - coined dogmatic - understanding of constitutional case law regarding federalism as expounded in Belgian academia. Building on that basis, he sets out to rethink the framework within which the connection between EU law and national constitutional law can be understood. The analysis delves into the relationship (and sometimes tension) between ‘rule-of-law' values (which may serve as checks upon instrumental forms of reasoning) and the toolbox deployed in constitutional court case law to accommodate several rather pragmatic needs.<br>

  Abstract: We mentioned that the object of our investigation would be how European Union law
                  influencesBelgian constitutional case law on federalism. “Influence”, however, is a difficult concept to grasp here, because it may mean a myriad of things depending on the perspective, because the object and subject of influence do not always allow for a clear definition, and because of issues related to understanding how law in general should be conceived of. The latter reason will lead us to consider the toolbox concept we deploy here in order to enrich our understanding of Belgian constitutional case law relating to federalism.<br>

  Abstract: Through a detailed analysis of Marçal’s poetic evolution in the previous chapter, I have examined the conceptual and iconic frameworks that allow the poet to reelaborate her experience around the concept of being, particularly of her

Imagining women as important actors shaping the destiny of humanity was an act of faith, necessary for her to challenge historians to approach their work with an enlarged understanding of how societies advanced. She had to review books across a variety of fields to cull any references to women’s contributions in previous societies.

In chapter 7 I raised that question, but in the years since then, I have learned more about the subject. The main point that I have found out is simple: the Torah in fact portrays God as androgynous.

  Abstract: The question of the subject remains both central and contentious in poststructuralist thought, despite – or perhaps in accordance with – the poststructuralist declaration of the subject’s death. The issue primarily concerns where a revised notion of the subject will be positioned and what role it will take in relation to concepts of meaning, agency, thinking and politics. The matter, however, is not usually posed in this way, as many thinkers who broadly fall within poststructuralist circles have instead framed the question of the subject as a debate between those who would retain it and those who would throw away<br>

  Abstract: In contemporary philosophy the phenomenological movement has offered a compelling challenge to the mind–body dualism that was instituted by Descartes amongst others in the seventeenth century. This challenge, perhaps most notably in the work of the French phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty, does not consist in the reduction of one of the opposed terms to the other in the manner of a thoroughgoing or ‘eliminative’ materialism but rather rests on a broader critique of both terms. The self, it is argued, is not originally an isolated thinking subject, certain of its own thoughts and separable from the body, whilst the body is<br>

  Abstract: Metaphor, as will already be evident from ‘Figure: Walter Ralegh’, has been thought characteristic of poetic language. A recent book on the subject states that ‘metaphor has always been, and still is, the main device of poetry’.¹ Several important accounts of metaphor have been offered from diverse quarters in recent decades, and I want to engage with three of them in this chapter: the cognitive account of metaphor as conceptual mapping; Donald Davidson’s insistence that the meaning of a metaphor is just its literal meaning; Paul de Man’s argument that knowledge about the operations of the mind has the structure<br>

  Abstract: The English Parliament is the subject of much mythology, both in its origins and in its development. It is often suggested that prior to the Norman Conquest, rather than having government imposed from above, the English governed themselves through local assemblies often referred to as folk moots (Oman 1919). The best evidence for pre-Conquest folk moots comes from place names such as Thingwall on the Wirral peninsula, Merseyside, and a lost

  Abstract: It seems that a rule is a paradox, a seemingly blatant contradiction. In order for a rule to exist, one must claim that it is impossible to do certain things that can be done. For example, it is
                  impossible, in French, to combine a verb conjugated in the second person with a first person subject; it isimpossible, in English, to write word ‘bird’ as ‘burd’. Of course these rules, by definition, vary with use, context, register, and through all the regular and irregular articulations which a linguistic theory can shed light on.¹ To modalise<br>

  Book Title: Virginia Woolf and Being-in-the-world-A Heideggerian Study<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Simone Emma<br>
  Abstract: Emma Simone argues that at the heart of what it means to be an individual making his or her way in the world, the perspectives of Woolf and Heidegger are founded upon certain shared concerns, including the sustained critique of Cartesian dualism, particularly the resultant binary oppositions of subject and object, and self and Other; the understanding that the individual is a temporal being; an emphasis upon intersubjective relations insofar as Being-in-the-world is defined by Being-with-Others; and a consistent emphasis upon average everydayness as both determinative and representative of the individual's relationship to and with the world.<br>

  Abstract: The previous two chapters have considered Woolf’s sense of Beingin-the-world principally from the perspective of her treatment of place. In this chapter, the focus shifts to the notion of temporality, an area of study that is granted particular emphasis in Heidegger’s
                  Being and Time. Specifically, Woolf’s approach to history and historical discourse from the perspective of Being-in-the-world is investigated.¹ Woolf’s interest in the subject of history began at an early age under the instruction of her father, the historian, biographer and man of letters, Sir Leslie Stephen.² A willing student in terms of her adolescent submission to her father’s direction,<br>

  Abstract: It is often supposed that politics operates by way of conscious deliberation and the rational pursuit of an interest of some kind. There are innumerable instances, historical and contemporary, that immediately put this view into doubt. Instances that warrant a closer examination of the nature of the human subject at the centre of such deliberation. It is apparent that in the Westernised world, the working class seldom vote for political parties or pursue political matters representative of their real interests.

  Abstract: If there is one branch of contemporary political theory that has many concrete examples of ‘evil’ as its subject matter, it is international political theory. Indeed, the word has made a spectacular return to international political discourse since 9/11. In this chapter I suggest a novel approach to theorising ‘evil’ in international political theory. It is an approach that diverges from much of the established (and very useful) commentary that has explored the concept as it emerges in the rhetoric of political leaders on both sides of the war on terror. I think that dealing with evil in that context<br>

The first section of this chapter draws on a range of modes of thinking about memory, from the philosophical to the psycho-sociological to the scientific.

  Abstract: In the complex pedagogical scene of projection that endeavors to produce the subject as a disembodied witness who exercises rational vision, the action of shedding light to cast out or eliminate the shadows of superstition, false belief, the susceptibility of witness, and the spectator’s own bodily vulnerability is not only to illumine. Such shadow projecting is also to participate in a volatile but also potentially self-perpetuating motion machine, for to shed light upon is also to cast the very shadows the scene is to eliminate. Indeed, the scene of projection necessarily depends precariously on the fungible dynamics of the umbral<br>

  Book Title: Cannibal Metaphysics-  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Skafish Peter<br>
  Abstract: The iconoclastic Brazilian anthropologist and theoretician Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, well known in his discipline for helping initiate its "ontological turn," offers a vision of anthropology as "the practice of the permanent decolonization of thought." After showing that Amazonian and other Amerindian groups inhabit a radically different conceptual universe than ours-in which nature and culture, human and nonhuman, subject and object are conceived in terms that reverse our own-he presents the case for anthropology as the study of such "other" metaphysical schemes, and as the corresponding critique of the concepts imposed on them by the human sciences. Along the way, he spells out the consequences of this anthropology for thinking in general via a major reassessment of the work of Claude Lévi-Strauss, arguments for the continued relevance of Deleuze and Guattari, dialogues with the work of Philippe Descola, Bruno Latour, and Marilyn Strathern, and inventive treatments of problems of ontology, translation, and transformation. Bold, unexpected, and profound,
      Cannibal Metaphysicsis one of the chief works marking anthropology's current return to the theoretical center stage.<br>

  Abstract: Poet and critic, sometimes surrealist and sublime schizophrenic, Antonin Artaud has been the subject of vastly greater posthumous interest than he ever enjoyed during his relatively short life. His fame derives primarily from his poetry, plays, letters, and essays—above all, from the revolutionary Theater of Cruelty he developed “to restore a passionate and convulsive conception of life” to the stage.³ Still, his writings acquired a significant readership only after he died, alone in a psychiatric clinic, in 1948.⁴ Thus, Artaud was as much discovered as rediscovered in the subsequent decades, when the initial publication of the

  Abstract: When the past is painful, as riddled with violence and injustice as it is in postapartheid South Africa, remembrance presents a problem at once practical and ethical: how much of the past to preserve and recollect and how much to erase and forget if the new nation is to ever unify and move forward? The new South Africa's confrontation of this dilemma is Martin J. Murray's subject in
         Commemorating and Forgetting. More broadly, this book explores how collective memory works-how framing events, persons, and places worthy of recognition and honor entails a selective appropriation of the past, not a mastery of history.<br>

  Book Title: Heidegger and Criticism-Retrieving the Cultural Politics of Destruction<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Pease Donald E.<br>
  Abstract: In Heidegger and Criticism: Retrieving the Cultural Politics of Destruction, William Spanos examines the controversy, both in Europe and the United States, surrounding Heidegger and recent disclosures about his Nazi past. Not intended as a defense or apology for Heidegger’s thought, Spanos instead affirms the importance of Heidegger’s “antihumanist” interrogation of the modern age, its globalization of technology, and its neo-imperialist politics. The attack on Heidegger’s “antihumanist” discourse (by “liberal humanists” who have imported the European debated into the United States) aligns ideologically with the ongoing policing operations of William Bennett, Allan Bloom, E.D. Hirsch, Roger Kimball, Dinesh D”Souza, and others in the spheres of higher education and cultural production. Throughout his arguments, Spanos focuses not so much on Heidegger the historical subject as on the transformative cultural political discourses and practices, implicit in and enabled by Heidegger’s interrogations of Being and Time, that have led to the contemporary emergence of the multiplicity of resistant “Others” colonized by hegemonic discursive formations, all the while reminding us that Heidegger’s philosophic interrogations eventually generate a diverse body of transgressive writing and an oppositional intellectual climate in the West.<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, I tried to show that Modernism in Western literature—and in the New Critical and structuralist hermeneutics to which it gave rise—is grounded in a representational strategy that spatializes the temporal process of existence as being-in-the-world. It is, in other words, a strategy that is subject to a vicious circularity that closes off the phenomenological/existential understanding of the temporal being of existence, and analogously, of the literary text: the sequence of words. It is no accident that the autotelic and in-clusive circle—the circle, that is, as image or figure, or, as I prefer, as<br>

  Abstract: To grasp the paradox of instant and flux in moving images could be compared to the vain attempt in philosophy to locate the instant within the flow of consciousness. Identifying the paradoxical instant is therefore a problem where the phenomenology of time meets with classical attempts to specify the ontology of cinema. Attempts at identifying this paradoxical instant have resulted in describing both film in analogy with human perception and film in analogy with machine perception beyond and independent of the subject. In this chapter I will depart from the point of intersection between phenomenology and cinema, which illuminates the<br>

  Abstract: The relationship between memory and history is nowadays a central preoccupation within several fields of the social sciences. Debates and reflection on the subject are most extensive and intensive within the discipline of history itself, particularly among those scholars who, recognizing that the historian’s craft extends beyond the mere “reconstruction” of what “actually” happened, deploy more complex modes of analysis in their work. An initial complexity emerges from the recognition that what “actually happened” includes the subjective perceptions and experiences of social actors. Furthermore, historical knowledge includes interpretive processes, the construction and selection of the “facts,” and the selection of<br>

  Abstract: Some of the most enduring questions inspiring the modern study of medieval European cultures have concerned the relationship between person and community. How did medieval people relate to their communities, and what shaped or determined the nature of this relationship at certain moments and in particular places? To what extent can the self in the Middle Ages be understood as an autonomous individual or subject independent of the pressures of community, institution, and locality—as a “modern” subject, as some might characterize this species of individualism?

  Author(s) Kleinberg Ethan<br>
  Abstract: Existentialism is the quintessential philosophy of modernity. At the center of all existentialist thinking is the inescapably free subject who must make herself in a world bereft of meaning. Yet the obduracy of this world is determined by the limits of a circumstance that is traced by the freedom of others. I am thrown into the world, condemned to freedom, and what I encounter are always other freedoms. God is useless, for my freedom is never breached by a sovereignty that reigns by granting absolute freedom. I am born unfinished and have nothing but a vacuum at the core of<br>

Gadamer’s development of hermeneutics as an interpretive method of theories and traditions proved fruitful for many areas of social knowledge.¹ The major contribution of hermeneutics is its ability to articulate the relationship between language and history as traditions. After the linguistic turn, the English school of the history of political theory, exemplified by Quentin Skinner,² developed its own versions of<br>

  Abstract: Colonial enterprises and colonial encounters generate the need to produce and possess the knowledge of other(s). There is an urgent need for the colonizing subject to acquire information on the colonized people, in order to aid in the management of its newly acquired territory, and it is equally pressing for the colonized to gain knowledge of their overlord. This transculturation, or the exchange of colonial knowledge, is nevertheless a reluctant liaison fraught with asymmetrical, nonreciprocal, and at times dangerous misreadings.

  Abstract: In this chapter I continue to trace the movement of cultural translation designated by the term “Sikh theology” into the humanities program of the modern Western university, specifically the discourse of the history of religions. To do this it is necessary to determine how the subject of Sikhism, or the Sikh subject, came to be determined as a distinctly “religious” subject. I argue that a certain understanding of violence, or, rather, a set of unexamined assumptions about the relationship between religion and violence, is necessary for the construction and deployment of this subject as “religious” in the modern academic study<br>

  Book Title: Encountering Religion-Responsibility and Criticism After Secularism<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS TYLER<br>
  Abstract: To respond to religion is to ask what religious behaviors and representations mean to us in our individual worlds, and scholars must confront questions of possibility and becoming that arise from testing their beliefs, imperatives, and practices. Roberts refers to the work of Hent de Vries, Eric Santner, and Stanley Cavell, each of whom exemplifies encounter and response in their writings as they traverse philosophy and religion to expose secular thinking to religious thought and practice. This approach highlights the resources religious discourse can offer to a fundamental reorientation of critical thought. In humanistic criticism after secularism, the lines separating the creative, the pious, and the critical themselves become the subject of question and experimentation.<br>

  Author(s): LYNCH RICHARD A.<br>
  Abstract: Philosophers debate the death of philosophy as much as they debate the death of God. Kant claimed responsibility for both philosophy's beginning and end, while Heidegger argued it concluded with Nietzsche. In the twentieth century, figures as diverse as John Austin and Richard Rorty have proclaimed philosophy's end, with some even calling for the advent of "postphilosophy." In an effort to make sense of these conflicting positions-which often say as much about the philosopher as his subject-Isabelle Thomas-Fogiel undertakes the first systematic treatment of "the end of philosophy," while also recasting the history of western thought itself.<br>

  Abstract: The return to Kant is in fact the choice of a single path that brings an end to the tension in the critical project. It is a matter of “returning” to the question of representation as an explication of the relation between a subject and an object. Let’s first of all recall that, from 1810 to 1850, Hegel and his disciples were the main figures on the philosophical scene. Henri Dussort points this out, “From 1800 to about 1840, speculative thought, its famous developers and their disciples occupied the center stage.”¹ Friedrich Engels himself noted that this enthusiasm for the<br>

Whatever there is to be said about ethics, it is always bound to certain forms of saying, certain ways of telling, certain modes of narration.

  Book Title: Secret Police Files from the Eastern Bloc-Between Surveillance and Life Writing<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Petrescu Corina L.<br>
  Abstract: The communist secret police services of Central and Eastern Europe kept detailed records not only of their victims but also of the vast networks of informants and collaborators upon whom their totalitarian systems depended. These records, now open to the public in many former Eastern Bloc countries, reflect a textually mediated reality that has defined and shaped the lives of former victims and informers, creating a tension between official records and personal memories. Exploring this tension between a textually and technically mediated past and the subject/victim's reclaiming and retrospective interpretation of that past in biography is the goal of this volume. While victims' secret police files have often been examined as a type of unauthorized archival life writing, the contributors to this volume are among the first to analyze the fragmentary and sometimes remedial nature of these biographies and to examine the subject/victims' rewriting and remediation of them in various creative forms. Essays focus, variously, on the files of the East German Stasi, the Romanian Securitate (in relation to Transylvanian Germans in Romania), and the Hungarian State Security Agency.

That commemoration, however, contains one notable error that offers a point of entry into this chapter’s subject, which is the peculiarly redoubled participation of the early sixteenth-century humanist, occult philosopher, skeptic, satirist, and protofeminist Cornelius Agrippa—or Henricus Cornelius Agrippa ab Nettesheym, to give his full Latin name—in what we are calling in<br>

  Abstract: The Parliament that assembled to construct a settlement around the revolution of 1688 took a new approach to the question of remembering and forgetting the conflicted past. Several laws enacted by the Convention Parliament had profound implications for the cultural memory of the civil wars and Interregnum. Most significantly, under the Toleration Act of 1689, Trinitarian Protestant Dissenters could worship freely, subject to the granting of licences by local magistrates.¹ This meant that for the first time since the Reformation, the crown legally relinquished its role as promoter and enforcer of religious conformity. Moreover, religious toleration implied that the spiritual<br>

  Abstract: Roland Barthes’ insistence on the death of the author (1968),¹ closely followed by Michel Foucault’s equally provocative interrogation of the writing subject (‘What is an Author?’ 1969),² have been elaborated, qualified, denigrated and newly historicised in almost half a century’s literary theorisings. Common sense alone suggests that in denying a critical need to relate the individual subject (whether author or reader) to a larger cultural, historically specific field of operations, Barthes’ theory of textual construction went too far.

  Book Title: Expressing Identities in the Basque Arena-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Allen N.J.<br>
  Abstract: Everyday nationalism, the human and cultural aspects of identity, is a neglected subject in the literature on nationalism in Europe. Jeremy MacClancy redresses the balance in this unusual and sharp book on the human and cultural aspects of the idea of being Basque in the modern world. The style is fresh and colloquial, dealing with several of the kinds of issues that usually appear in popular magazines - cuisine, football, art and graffiti - but the treatment is serious and illustrative of underlying currents in social life. MacClancy argues that the ethnographic understanding of nationalisms, rather than the orthodox studies of ideology, political parties, social classes and centre-periphery clashes - offers a more nuanced comprehension of the lived reality of people in areas where nationalism is a significant force. This is very much nationalism from the bottom up. JEREMY MACCLANCY is Professor of Social Anthropology at Oxford Brookes University. Series editors: Wendy James & Nick Allen<br>

  Book Title: War and Literature-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Patterson Ian<br>
  Abstract: War was the first subject of literature; at times, war has been its only subject. In this volume, the contributors reflect on the uneasy yet symbiotic relations of war and writing, from medieval to modern literature. War writing emerges in multiple forms, celebratory and critical, awed and disgusted; the rhetoric of inexpressibility fights its own battle with the urgent necessity of representation, record and recognition. This is shown to be true even to the present day: whether mimetic or metaphorical, literature that concerns itself overtly or covertly with the real pressures of war continues to speak to issues of pressing significance. Particular topics addressed include writings of and about the Crusades and battles during the Hundred Years War; Shakespeare's "Casus Belly"; Auden's "Journal of an Airman"; and War and Peace.

  Book Title: Love and Death in Goethe-`One and Double'<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Dye Ellis<br>
  Abstract: Goethe, in association with his younger Romantic compatriots the Schlegels, Novalis, Fichte, and Schelling, struggled with the subject-object dichotomy, and tried to bridge the gap between self and other, consciousness and nature. His theory and practice prefigured the Romantics' determination to display and interrogate the linguistic and cultural structures informing their own thinking and modes of representation--what Goethe calls one's "Vorstellungsart." His work exploits, subverts, and supplants inherited conventions and signs, demonstrating with virtuosic irony that literature is a system of texts, pre-texts, and pre-established but dynamic conceptual models. 'Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double"' explores Goethe's use, in a wide range of his poetry and prose, of the theme of 'Liebestod' (love and death) and related embodiments of the paradox of unity in duality. Ellis Dye also examines Goethe's use of other themes related to love and death--the 'femme fatale', the 'vagina dentata, Frau Welt', the Lorelei, venereal disease, the 'Lustmord' --and considers issues of selfhood and individuation as well as the possibility that the love-death theme contains an implicit gender bias toward the existential fact of personal separateness. Poems, plays, and novels are dealt with, nevertheless, as works of art, not only as illustrations of an idea or as points of intersection in a system of rhetorical conventions, and are examined for intellectual cohesiveness, elegance, and integrity of design as well as special meanings and effects. ' Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double" ' explores the meaning of the central theme of Romantic poetry in the works of the most important Romantic poet of all. Students of literary culture, both the lay reader and the Goethe specialist, will be enlightened by its approach and find pleasure and instruction in its revelations. Robert Ellis Dye is professor of German at Macalester College.<br>

The notion of identity as a psycho-social entity only dates back about 100 years to the psychology of William James who differentiated an outer perspective, the “social self” (me) as the self recognized by others, from an inner perspective, the “continuous, inner self” (I) that denoted the self as experienced<br>

In line with the widespread recognition of a “ religious turn”¹ or “(re)sacralization”² that is transforming political and cultural discourse in the “post-secular society”³ in which we live, the role of religion in contemporary German-language literature is subject to increasing scrutiny. In German literary studies the depiction of Islam in Germanic culture and the history of German-Jewish identity currently receive much more explicit attention than the place of Christian faith.⁴ Julian Preece<br>

The practice of autobiography necessarily confers on the autobiographical text an implied truth value upon which the weight of contemporary theory since existentialism and structuralism has cast considerable doubt.

  Book Title: Friendship and Love, Ethics and Politics-Studies in Mediaeval and Early Modern History<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Österberg Eva<br>
  Abstract: Today, friendship, love and sexuality are mostly viewed as private, personal and informal relations. In the mediaeval and early modern period, just like in ancient times, this was different. The classical philosophy of friendship (Aristotle) included both friendship and love in the concept of philia. It was also linked to an argument about the virtues needed to become an excellent member of the city state. Thus, close relations were not only thought to be a matter of pleasant gatherings in privacy, but just as much a matter of ethics and politics. What, then, happened to the classical ideas of close relations when they were transmitted to philosophers, clerical and monastic thinkers, state officials or other people in the medieval and early modern period? To what extent did friendship transcend the distinctions between private and public that then existed? How were close relations shaped in practice? Did dialogues with close friends help to contribute to the process of subject-formation in the Renaissance and Enlightenment? To what degree did institutions of power or individual thinkers find it necessary to caution against friendship or love and sexuality?<br>

The communist regime shaped and strictly controlled knowledge about itself, its genesis, and its past. The regime’s ideologically distorted self-image is of interest to historiography as an extreme case in which historical knowledge is subject to direct politicization and ideologization in legitimating power. At first sight, notions about the past would seem to be fixed once and for all. But precisely because knowledge of the past<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: While Ricoeur suggests that recourse to solidarity can go too far in answering these questions, an appeal to the conditions of solidarity provides the basis for his criticism of Rawls. As his account of the subject of rights would suggest, and agreeing with many in the Anglo‐American world, Ricoeur denies that a procedural theory of justice can substitute for the bonds of an ethical community or replace a collective conception of the good. At the same time, he sees Rawls’s analysis as a brilliant articulation of the deontological level of the structure of moral action. For Ricoeur, Rawls’s revisions of his theory of justice in his later work mark his own recognition of the connection between the deontological and teleological levels of moral action since he now explicitly grounds the theory of justice in a particular sort of political community.<br>

Abstract: The group bonds bid members to respect one another’s private motivations without having to revere the same cultural and political traditions. So one member could speak as an “anticapitalist,” while another member presented herself simply as a “good citizen,” and another as a New Age spiritualist, because the group validated all sincere expression that did not tread on other individuals’ autonomy. The few times members did talk about their own motives for involvement in the group, they got a respectful hearing, but no members of the group insisted that their own beliefs become a subject of sustained conversation. Carrie briefly described her church’s “church and society” group at one meeting. Stacey once said that she found Airdale’s environmental issues so overwhelming that she would “meditate to release the energy” that these issues generated inside her. But neither Carrie nor Stacey invited, much less enjoined, other members of the group to talk about Christianity or New Age precepts about personal energy; they simply mentioned them. Unprompted, ACES’s informal leader said that members did not “come on too strong” with their own moral or political motivations. “Carrie doesn’t come on with Christianity” at meetings, and the leader herself said she had “certain spiritual commitments to peace, justice, and the environment, but I don’t come on strong with them at meetings.”<br>

         Primary and secondary language socialization. The acquisition of language became a major subject of investigation in the 1960s and 1970stheJournal of Child Languagewas started in 1974 to join journals in psycholinguistics and developmental psychology that focused mainly on adult language (Crystal1974). Simultaneously, the acquisition of communicative competence was identified by Hymes and his students (e.g., Sherzer and Darnell1972) as an important part of the ethnographic study of language use. Little empirical work was, however, being done on the basic issues of the second paradigm. Despite the efforts of interdisciplinary groups such as the one organized by Dan Slobin at the University of California at Berkeley in the mid1960s, the early attempts to produce ethnographically informed acquisition studies were not very successful (Duranti2001:2324). The situation radically changed in the 1980s when, in an article in a major collection in cultural anthropology, Elinor Ochs and Bambi Schieffelin (a
            1984) identified language socialization as a bridge between anthropology and language development, viewing it as both socialization to language (the missing part in linguistics and psycholinguistics) and socializationthroughlanguage (the takenforgranted part in cultural anthropology). On the basis of their work among Samoans (Ochs) and the Kaluli of Papua New Guinea (Schieffelin), they described current research on language acquisition as informed by local theories of mind and society and sketched out a program of study integrating methods developed in developmental psychology (longitudinal studies) with methods developed in cultural anthropology (ethnography). Their claim that baby talk (a feature of Motherese) was not a universal was only the tip of the iceberg for a model of socialization to be documented by fieldworkers around the world (see also Ochs and Schieffelin1995). One of the most promising outcomes of this line of research has been the a~<br>

Abstract: Theories are always, in some way, about their theorists. While Luhmann’s variant of mutant functionalism is not palatable to American tastes, his theories are as reflective of late‐20th‐century European sensibilities as Parsons’s were of mid‐20th‐century America or Bellah and Geertz’s of the upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, some art critics have warmed to Luhmann’s book as an exemplar of one of the newer “cool” theories of art; that is, those that challenge more subject‐centered and humanist theories and aim to accommodate the growth of new mediums such as digital art and cyberspace. But in any conception of art that includes culture, the medium is only as good as the meaning it conveys. And it is the meaning of art that is sorely lacking in Luhmann’s appraisal. Paul Ricoeur once wrote that “materialism is the truth of a world without truth.” It might then be said of Luhmann’s conception of the art system that it is the truth of art without meaning.<br>

Abstract: We have thus followed a strange movement, a sort of coming and going between perceiving subjects and perceived objects, a zoom effect like that of a camera trying to set the right distance with its object in order to achieve a maximum degree of clarity—total transparency. On the one hand, we have seen how the tricky adjustment between the multiplicity of stabilized representations of Hawking and my face‐to‐face interaction with him has fragmented his identity. Like an impressionist painting, distance allows us to see what proximity causes us to lose. The layering of the multiplicity of narratives about Hawking reveals the stable identity of an individual that face‐to‐face contact does not allow. The closer we get to the object‐subject, the further we move from it. We no longer know who or where he is. All the categories we normally use in thinking about a person, a body, a machine, a mind, an interaction, a conversation, a text, and speech are blurred. In his presence, Hawking seems even more difficult to seize than we had imagined. The reason is, first, because, as we have shown, the depth of the social body (the one that talks of the other as much as of itself and allows the accumulation of self‐definitions), normally visible but unnoticed in any interaction, is absent in his case. Second, the internal functioning of the flesh‐and‐blood body, normally invisible, becomes visible and distributed here (the
      Iandlegsare mixed in the same discourse and are detached from the body; they are before him while his voice is next to him, and the flesh‐and‐blood body is collectively taken care of) and omnipresent (it appears at different moments during the interaction). Third, the machine, by the coordination of the actions it allows, disturbs the interaction as much as it creates it. This is where the confusion and fragmentation of identity is pursued by recomposition. Here we follow, step by step, how the machine to which this silent body is attached makes the component~<br>

Abstract: On the other hand, the Oedipus complex is likened to a basic unit of kinship subject to a set of transformative possibilities that lead, ideally, through the resolution of (incestuous) intrafamilial conflict, to wider extrafamilial relations through marriage and the social institutions and cultural expression that derive therefrom. The move, as Ricoeur (
      1969:121) would have it, is from destiny to history. Juillerat is more cautious, recognizing, as he does, the structural constraints of marital exchange.<br>

Abstract: Calamy’s
      Abridgmentwas more than a rebuttal of High Church slander against individual ejected ministers. It was a political intervention that provoked considerable controversy. His account of the experience of Baxter and many other ejected ministers painted a harsh picture of the treatment of these men by the Restoration authorities and visibly undercut the kind of history that would serve High Tory interests. Chapter 9, in particular, was uncompromising in the vivid picture it drew of the illegalities, the violence, the injustices of the regime, running from the king and the court down through the church hierarchy to local magistrates, clergy, and laymen. Some ejected ministers lived on quietly through the reigns of the last of the Stuarts. But many others were subject to official harassment, troublesome court appearances and fines, confiscation of property, and spells of imprisonment. They endured violent threats and intimidation, official and unofficial. They were abused in the street. Their private meetings and meetinghouses were broken into during religious worship and minister and congregation threatened and abused. At various times ministers were forced into hiding, living as fugitives separated from their families. Calamy provided names not just of Dissenting victims but also of particular authorities who persecuted them. Chapter 9 began the work of preserving the evidence of the brutal character of the Stuart regime and its local servants, many of them of course still living.<br>

Abstract: No one exposed this alienation of the thing by the concept that precedes and reconstitutes it into an object better than Hegel. In naming a thing, man substitutes for its immediate being and its qualities of sensible representation “a
         name, asoundmade by [his] voice, something entirely different from what [the thing] is in intuition”; but this name that is not the immediacy of the thing, this name into which the thing “withdraws,” becomes “something spiritual, something altogether different.” Thus nature transforms itself into “a realm of names,” because “the external object itself was negated in that very synthesis.”16The object appears henceforth as such—as alienated being, which has lost its being in order to receive it from theI: “the object is not what it is … the thingis notwhat itis.”17Thus, “man speaks to the thing ashis. And this is thebeingof the object.”18The being of the object only consists in receiving its being from man, who alienates it in so very far as he names it. Put another way, “by means of the name … the object has been born out of the I [and has emerged] asbeing. This is the primal creativity exercised by Spirit. Adam gave a name to all things.”19Hegel obviously alludes to the Biblical episode in which God gives to man power over the animals by giving him the right to name them: “[He] brought them to the man to see what he would call them” (Gen. 2:19). Adam gives a name, and thus a definition to the animals, which thus become subject to him, because in general all knowledge by concept reduces what is known to the rank of object. Adam thus names in the manner by which theIknows—by concepts of objects. However, Adam has the power thus to name only that which can legitimately become for him an object: the animals (and the rest of the world), and perhaps the angels, but not God, and not himself. If, moreover, he claimed to name them, either this name would have no validity, or, if it had validity, what he named would not be man as such (~<br>

Abstract: If I must pause here, at the threshold of a subject that would appear to be of less than universal current interest—composition pedagogy—it is in the recognition that the subject of composition, how to compose one’s thoughts and words, was the greater part of education from antiquity to the nineteenth century. What we call expository writing, the one‐ or two‐course sequence that our university students are everywhere compelled to take, is only an echo of this immemorial “method of tradition.” The failure to reduce writing to method in our modern post‐Ramistic sense, to a quasi‐science of transmission, is related to the larger failure, perhaps the necessary failure, of modern educational theory to bring communication within the system of the disciplines, as both object of knowledge and means of transmitting knowledge. In this postrhetorical condition, information technologies proliferate with familiar paradoxical effects, such as the degradation in the communicative efficacy of writing lamented by Tufte and Lanham. Without falling back upon a narrative of decline, which would in any case concede a failure of historical understanding, I conclude on the threshold of a second question, much larger than that of composition pedagogy in the contemporary university. On this threshold, I envision, or call for (in the spirit of my epigraph from Bacon) an inquiry into the question of why writing has remained the indispensable “art of transmission” in the era of technologically mediated information.

Abstract: We have seen that the same feature of human experience presupposed in the intratextual method, namely, the self’s capacity to be shaped by a religious tradition, represents the key for understanding the problem of cross‐cultural hermeneutics. I can only interpret the religious other by allowing the religious other to interpret me. Now a critical number of such encounters will have a noticeable effect on the tradition of which I am a bearer.

Abstract: Accordingly, Meyers examines the role of a series of gender‐specific images in women’s agency, addressing pronatalism, mother‐child imagery, the family, narcissism, aging, and sexuality. Each of these topics could occupy a book, and one hopes that Meyers will expand on the ideas developed here. The strength of this approach is the familiarity of the subject matter to a large audience—although not to all women—and Meyers strives to remain conscious of the fact that she cannot make universal claims about women. But many readers will find something in the text that resonates with their own experience. (Meyers’s discussion relies in part on interviews with women.) For example, when she criticizes “matrigyno‐idolatry” (32) or the pressure to become a mother, she does not merely report on tensions that some women face. Nor does she simply analyze the power of social discourse to manipulate women’s choices. Rather, she sticks to her middle path, demonstrating persuasively that there is currently no space in matrigyno‐idolatrous discourse for genuine autonomy for women, and she makes a parallel point for each set of images she examines. Whatever choice one makes—including the choice to remain childless, which, she correctly points out, is seldom considered by feminist theorists—there is a cultural image ready at hand to define and constrict women’s agency.<br>

Abstract: Mandry offers a relatively concise and convincing reading of Ricoeur on the ethical self and its relation to ethical aims for the good life and the moral demand for justice. Mandry’s concern is to clarify what is meant by “ethical identity” and how this idea might aid theological ethics. The principle contribution is to show the place of religious conviction (
      Überzeugung) in relation to ethical aims, moral duties, and practical reasoning. Mandry’s contention is that philosophy and theology offer different perspectives on the ethical subject which can fruitfully engage each other. The question then becomes, of course, whether or not the question that provoked the discussion in the first case has simply been pushed back one further step in reflection. What provides the warrant for multiple perspectives on the ethical subject? Is it a philosophical warrant or a theological one?<br>

Abstract: By extending these ideas on reading to a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur is able to argue that identity is a temporal structure that rests on narrative, as well as a project that is ongoing for individuals during their lifetime. Reading is central to this project because it is only in reading that the dynamism of configuration completes its course; in other words, the passage from prefiguration via configuration to refiguration results in transfiguration of worlds. In this relationship of worlds, it is the person as reader who takes this journey [
         21]. His thesis is that “the process of composition, of configuration, does not realize itself in the text but in the reader, and under this condition configuration makes possible refiguration of a life by way of the narrative” [44, p. 430]. As part of this, a person can be called upon to make an account of herself, and such an account, Ricoeur argues, involves a positing of a beginning, a middle with its highs and lows, and an ending [14]. Through composition, or configuration, this account is dynamic; we can weave different plots about our lives. Ricoeur reminds us that “just as it is possible to compose several plots on the subject of the same incidents … so it is always possible to weave different, even opposed, plots about our lives” [30, p. 248]. But, simultaneously, a life can have the quality of being singular and complete. In terms of a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur best captures this when he argues that “to understand oneself is to understand oneself as one confronts the text and to receive from it the conditions for a self other than that which first undertakes the reading. Neither of the two subjectivities, neither that of the author nor that of the reader, is thus primary in the sense of an originary presence of the self to itself” [44, p. 17]. For Ricoeur, it is through this task that we achieve, by dint of effort, a dynamic balancing of a sense of self, which is, on the one~<br>

Abstract: I want to focus here specifically on questions of race and appropriation, particularly brought to light by bell hooks’s criticism of
         Paris Is Burning, to which Butler responds (see hooks1992, 145–56). Butler considers the ways in which drag is a site that questions the manner in which hegemonic heterosexuality reproduces itself through imitation and performance. Reading the desire on the part of Venus Xtravaganza, the drag queen who is the subject ofParis Is Burning, to become a “real” woman, and drag performance as a “contesting of realness” (1993, 130), Butler argues that such performances expose the norms that regulate realness and also the fact that “norms of realness by which the subject is produced are racially informed conceptions of ‘sex’” (1993, 130). hooks’s critique of the film centers on director Jennie Livingston’s role as a white lesbian woman ethnographer photographing subjects of color but imperialistically concealing her own standpoint in the film. Butler accedes to the problem of the raced gaze but offers a reading that presents itself as problematically analogical. Butler writes, “hooks is right to argue that within this culture the ethnographic conceit of a neutral gaze will always be a white gaze. … But what does it mean to think about this camera as an instrument and effect of lesbian desire?” (1993, 136). In other words, Butler rewrites the question of race as a question of sexuality, the underlying assumption being that one can be substituted for the other. Thus, although Butler suggests that to an extent the camera assumes the place of the phallus, she suggests that the cinematic gaze is not simply white and phallicbecausethe occasion of drag balls constructs kinship relations outside the heterosexual family. Being outside heterosexuality, by analogy, means being outside whiteness. Butler writes, “If the signifiers of whiteness and femaleness … are sites of phantasmatic promise, then it is clear that women of color and lesbians are ~<br>

Abstract: See Homi K. Bhabha,
            Location of Culture(London and New York: Routledge, 1994). Following in Fanon’s footsteps, he provides a pertinent analysis of how the identity‐shaping recognitive process within the concrete historical conditions of colonialism and its postcolonial aftermath has worked to suppress the play of difference within each cultural identity. Part of the strategy of colonial rule and ideological justification for the European colonizers, he points out, was always to construct rules and standards of recognition around the notions of “modernity,” “rationality,” and “progress” and to produce a totalizing and hierarchically structured binary opposition between the colonizers and the colonized by recognizing the full presence of modernity and rationality in the former while assigning to the latter their complete absence or merely partial presence. The colonizing Europe accomplished this by disavowing the presence of heterogeneity within itself, such as the feminine and the irrational, and symbolically constructing and representing the colonized cultures as the essentialized Other of its now homogeneous rational self (and civilized, muscular Christianity)—e.g., the bestially sexual Africans, the duplicitous Chinese, and the effeminate and degenerate Hindus. But the artificial construction of such a binary opposition is inherently unstable, Bhabha argues, as can be seen for instance from the self‐contradictory nature of the colonizers’ attempt to convert the subject population to Christianity and to create a class of colonial elites educated in the ways of Europe, which was tantamount to an implicit recognition of the capacity of the colonized for rationality and self‐government, while at the same time deprecating and deriding that recognized presence of the “civilized” qualities in them as mere mimicry or even mockery of the authentic European, Christian identity. According to Bhabha, it is precisely the practice of mimicry on the part of the colon~<br>

Abstract: Compare Marino,
            Dicerie sacre, “La pittura,” pt. 1, 119. Marino compares God to a mirror that reflects the soul’s truthful image. If God withdraws, the soul becomes unable to see itself. The image of mirrors reflecting mirrors is a topos of baroque love poetry. The innumerable sonnets written in seventeenth‐century Italy on this subject aim to create a sense of labyrinthine astonishment, an inner vertigo, the baroque “marvel.” For example, see Giovan Battista Marino,Rime amorose, ed. Ottavio Besomi and Alessandro Martini (Ferrara: Edizioni Panini, 1987), sonnets 11–13. This series of poems is entirely dedicated to the topos of the mirror. The most complex and accomplished is the third in which Marino imagines that the mirror reflecting his beloved’s image was made of the tears he had shed and that had become a lucid surface (sonnet 13, verse 2, 61). “The angelic splendor of this goddess” (i.e., his beloved) has turned the mirror into a small heaven, since it reflects the woman’s luminosity (verses 3–4). Love has allowed the metamorphosis of the poet’s tears into mirror, so that his “beautiful sun” (his woman, verse 6) can see what he hides “in the mirror of my heart” (verses 7–8) and detect her beauty in the surface of his visible sorrow. The external mirror is thus a reflection of the poet’s inner mirror in which the luminous woman reflects upon her own image.<br>

Abstract: Of course, Midrash provides such an example of grammatical interpretation that is not harnessed by psychological interpretation, or the unity of the subject—nor, indeed, that defines the grammatical sense in strictly historical terms, but rather in terms of “verbal connections” between uses of words within scripture. In my opinion, it is therefore not accidental that Frei turns with increased frequency to Midrash in his later work. While perhaps not sufficient for Christian reading, it thus may model a necessary practice of reading that, in the wake of modern hermeneutics, can help in the retrieval of the narrative sense of scripture, in part by opening the possibility of a grammatical sense
         withinthe world of scripture. The consequences of such Midrash for Christian community, as well as differences in their practices of reading, remain to be considered.<br>

Abstract: That future did not take place. Our study confirms the trend in academia in favor of more professionalized, footnoted writing and shows how
      Critical Inquiry,for all its idiosyncrasies, still reflects major changes in the academic profession. Footnotes in the early years of the journal tended to be short and to cite a single work in each note. In the last fifteen years or so the average length of the footnote has more than doubled. With increasing frequency, an author will cite a range of significant books and articles on a given topic, such as trauma or utopianism, even when these works have no direct bearing on the main argument of the paper. The proliferation of footnotes in the last fifteen years of the journal can be traced in part to the increasing professionalization of the humanities. The ongoing crisis in American higher education—the scarcity of jobs, increasing expectations for obtaining tenure, and rest of the old familiar laments—has put pressure on scholars to perform their scholarly credentials, even at the bottom of the page. By citing a list of ten or fifteen works on a subject tangentially related to their immediate topic, scholars demonstrate their knowledge, even mastery, of the larger context in which their argument can be placed. This type of footnote is especially common among younger or untenured scholars.13Our study in fact shows that not only have footnotes grown in length but that nearly half of the footnotes we counted appeared in only the last ten years.<br>

Abstract: Maurice Halbwachs’s (
         1992) notions of collective memory can help to conceptualize the processing of history that went on in Mrs. Barrett’s room. To do so, however, it’s worth contextualizing Halbwachs’s own work, as his most famous writing,La memoire collective, was published in 1950, five years after Halbwachs's death at Buchenwald concentration camp. He had been working on the volume when the Nazis invaded the French city of Strasbourg, where he lived. Patrick Hutton suggests that, in light of these circumstances, “one senses … that [Halbwachs’s] thoughts on the subject were still provisional” (1993, 74). Specifically, Hutton critiques Halbwachs’s positivistic notions of history, his passionate loyalty to the claim that history exists outside of collective memory, inaccessible though it may be. Hutton explains, “To Halbwachs’s way of thinking, history considers a past from which living memory has been distilled, one that may be reconstructed from its evidentiary leavings but whose mentality or subjective state of mind cannot be resurrected. As he remarked in a telling simile: ‘History is like a crowded graveyard to which new tombstones are continually being added’” (76). In short, history’s chambers are inaccessible to the living, opposed intrinsically and forever to the needs and dictates of the present.<br>

Abstract: Perspective exchange.—The idea that perspective exchange differs from information exchange, as well as the fact that it is essential for interreligious dialogue, crops up only sporadically in the theology of religions. There are three possible reasons: philosophical, civilizational, and religious reasons. Concerning the first reason: following a period of modern subject philosophy and ego psychology the insight in the “other as other,” “the other astotaliter aliter” in postmodern philosophy, has influenced people in such a manner that the simple fact of perspective exchange, as the basis of all relationships and communication of (higher animal species and) people, may have been lost. This is actually depressing, because the concept already has a long history. It emerged for the first time in American pragmatism, specifically in the symbolic interactionism of G. H. Mead.43Since then there has been a lot of research in both developmental and social psychology, and it has become a standard textbook concept.44In the past twenty years we have witnessed intensified interest in this concept, specifically in cognitive science, including cognitive psychology and cognitive anthropology, whether these disciplines use different, traditional, or new terms like role taking, social attribution, empathy, and “theory of the mind.”45According to research in these disciplines, perspective exchange seems to be a natural disposition of (higher animal species and) people; it starts developing at a very young age, and its roots lie in the functioning of the brain. Expressed negatively, the concept refers to the socioemotional disposition that enables people to step out of their own perspective in which they experience and interpret situations, other people, and themselves. It indicates, moreover, their ability to let go of their own desires, preferences, intentions, plans, and expectations. Expressed positively, it is the socioemotional disposition that enables people to switch to the per~<br>

Abstract: Through various techniques of careful observation, the human sciences stand in a unique position, methodologically, to dig beneath assumptions and stereotypes and explain what makes American child poverty so problematic. This is the case in at least three important respects. First, they can explain how poverty plays into children’s underlying developmental vulnerabilities. For example, the younger a child is, the fewer basic capabilities he or she is likely to possess for such things as securing social capital, supporting parents leaving home to work, resisting mass media exploitation to sell toys, or making heard his or her plight. Second, the human sciences can describe the unique conditions that contribute toward poverty in contemporary families. For example, families in the United States bear significant burdens for children’s health and economic well‐being, so that high rates of family and marital disruption represent a major cause of children’s economic hardship. And third, the human sciences can map the multiple and diverse ways in which children’s poverty is related to larger social structures. These include inequalities in the job market, impacts of mass media, and access to political power. The human sciences are particularly well suited to understanding such experiences from the point of view of children because empirical methods can test and disrupt the ordinary assumptions by which adults so easily oversimplify children’s lives. Somewhat as in environmental ethics, the theological ethics of childhood relies deeply on empirical observation for fully understanding the complexities of its subject.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur aims to make explicit the connections linking the modern notions of self with those of ancient world thinkers. This quite intriguing story begins with the chanting heroes of canonical Greek literature, who question their selves as they strive to explain the choices they have made. In so doing, says Ricoeur, these heroes recognize for themselves a sense of responsibility. The story then develops with the ethics of virtues developed by Aristotle, especially the virtue of wisdom. Following the correct rules of this virtue engages one to act as would a “wise man” under a given set of circumstances. Such a wise man directs his action under a second‐order rule about rational action—the rule of
      phronesis, of prudence. Through the exercise of his discretion, he reveals an important part of himself: his own point of view. This emergence of the moral self in action is the reason why Ricoeur wishes to trace back in Ancient Greece “the emergence of the point of view of the subject in the description of rational action” (87). To be sure, Ricoeur admits that this analysis is a retrospective reach. But it is no small feat to have been able to reach through many centuries of writing and thinking with such a clear and concise canvas.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: The Christian version of the care of the soul plumbs into the soul deeper than Platonism because this responsibility—which originates in the gaze of an unfathomable other—precedes the subject/object relation that informs the classical version of the responsible self. Derrida writes: “The dissymmetry of the gaze, this disproportion that relates me, and whatever concerns me, to a gaze that I don’t see and that remains secret from me although it commands me, is, according to Patočka, what promises itself [
      s’annonce] in Christian mystery as the frightening, terrifying mystery, themysterium tremendum. Such a terror has no place in the transcendent experience that relates Platonic responsibility to theagathon. Nor does it have any place in the politics that is so instituted. But the terror of this secret exceeds and precedes the complacent relation of a subject to an object” (GD,pp. 27–28; trans. mod.). Yet such a radical way of conceiving responsibility is only announced or is only promised by Christianity. Christianity as a whole cannot be identified with this understanding of responsibility because its persistent Platonism has prevented it from thinking through this deepened conception. What is thus announced by Christianity is perhaps no longer anything Christian unless it is Christian in a hyperbolic sense.15In any case, Christianity remains the privileged locus in which the depths of responsibility can best be plumbed.<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: If, as Koselleck has envisaged, history was elevated as the subject of its own absolute self‐knowledge—history itself a unified history of humanity, imperially gathering up all special histories into the unifying realm of the collective singular—it was also empowered by what Ricoeur calls a “hidden form of the same claim” that could act against its untenable status as self‐knowledge and singular time (
         MHF,p. 305). The historical present, now established as the perspective for all temporal formations, is centered as an absolute. Once the collective singular is discredited in its impossible universalizing mission to singularize the history of humanity, it turns to the singular historical moment, which is the now of the historical present. Even today, it insists on the developmental imperative and its familiar claim of a totalizing history; the “vocables of world history” and the imposition of odious comparisons promote programs of catching up with the parade of the historical present attained by modern Euro‐America (MHF,p. 305). The here and now is henceforth distinguished from times past, to be sure, but also from those different temporalities that exist immanently in the modern present but are hidden from it, as in the there and the then, since it is our time that provides both perspective and tribunal. The here and now of actual experience, our modernity, is our history, our time, and never theirs. The distancing of expectation from past experiences thus becomes the condition of asserting the difference of our self‐valorizing and self‐referring modernity and its superiority over both its antecedents and others. But the decision to shift the concept of modernity to the register of an absolute historical present eventually required misrecognizing the apparent contradiction that our time and place is characterized by its unique difference from others. Moreover, the change of index directs attention instead to generalizing the values our modernity embodies an~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Both literally and figuratively speaking, Smith’s narrative presents a dramatic departure from the traditional Adamic myth whose “intention is to set up a
         radicalorigin of evil distinct from the moreprimordialorigin of goodness of things.”72Mormonism’s evil is as uncreated and preexistent as is good. Both are always potential to the act, as choice, of the uncreated person. As the attendees to the counsel and, later, earth’s inhabitants, humans must choose between the two plans and their personal fate is decided by their choice. Implicit in this personal struggle is the notion that the power is in these persons not only to discern but also to vanquish evil. This, too, is a central dynamic in Smith’s challenge to traditional Christianity’s theological anthropology. In Smith’s completely original Genesis 1, Moses's experience of the divine at the burning bush is followed by an assertion of his newly realized identity against Satan, who comes demanding to be worshipped: “Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten; and where is thy glory, that I should worship thee?” Moses then summarily dismisses him with the command “Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not.” Subject to Moses's superior power, Satan must comply.73Thus, the agency and power of persons to effect their will, first manifested in the narrative of a heavenly council, characterizes earthly life as well.<br>

Abstract: An alternative end to my account of the fate of re‐vision and its place in feminism today presented itself when, recently, a student came to me to discuss a possible subject for her bachelor’s thesis. She wanted to write something that would contribute to the current debate: a feminist topic, she said, but not, as she put it, “women on the barricades.” One idea she had was to write about Anita Diamant’s
         The Red Tent(1997). This novel tells the story of the biblical Dinah, daughter of Leah and Jacob. My student had picked up the book while on holiday in Spain and had been deeply moved by it. It had transformed her views on the Bible and made her rethink the relation of women to the biblical narratives.<br>

Abstract: It is important to clarify at this point that the historicism we espouse is strictly a methodology to preserve the historical record. As stated above, the historicism we are advocating is founded upon the works of Johann Gottfried von Herder. We see in his reflections on mankind’s intellectual development a way to avoid the question of objective truth in librarianship for the sake of historical comprehension. It is very similar to Descartes suspending the truth value of the propositions of his beliefs in order to arrive at epistemological certainty. Our suspension of truth value does not arrive at epistemological certainty about the propositions contained in the many volumes housed in a library but rather at certainty that the historical record has not been compromised by the elimination of any these volumes. In other words, librarians must suspend the truth value of singular items and artifacts in the historical record in order that the whole truth of any given period of history be accurately analyzed and understood. As Herder states: “If history in its simplest sense were nothing but a description of an occurrence, of a production, then the first requirement is that the description be
         whole, exhaust the subject, show it to use from all sides” [74].<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: Airy theoretical statements like these begin to sound downright saccharine when the subject turns to religion. Consider the following statement: “Presence [oddly, this term is sometimes capitalized by Reynolds, sometimes not] is an inescapable existential presupposition, a kind of eschatological affirmation built into the praxis of availability. … When we encounter the presence of the other, we cannot help but say ‘it is good’” (147). One wants to know how these sentences would be received by a Palestinian attempting to negotiate an Israeli checkpoint or by a student at one of the stricter jihadist‐leaning madrassas in Pakistan. For approximately two pages (150–52), Reynolds dwells on the darker realities of pluralism and difference: violence, mistrust, fear, imperialism, and domination. Undeterred, however, he moves swiftly to “the recovery of trust,” arguing that despite all appearances to the contrary, “religious faith [is] a ‘saving’ performance” that “places us … in a trustworthy and gratuitous ultimate environment, one that resists falsification by the conditions of finitude” (158). One senses that reality is not receiving due attention.<br>

Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: Then, too, another slip of syntax has preceded this one in the same sentimental vein, where through indirect discourse Arthur muses on Amy Dorrit as the fixed point in his life, the “termination” (as in destination) of all its good: “Everything in its
         perspectiveled to her innocent figure” (LD,p. 702; emphasis added). But disorientation within the extended painterly metaphor—life as a landscape with only one figure—has set in a sentence before and could easily have been prevented.Surveying the vista of his own poor story, Clennam saw all lines converge upon Amy:that might have been one version of the sentence's intent. Instead, the phrasal grammar is so thoroughly decoupled as to drift again into solecism: “Looking back upon his own poor story, she was its vanishing-point” (LD,p. 702). A dangling modifier for a life left hanging. It is not just that the famously precinematic Dickens here breaks the 180-degree rule of continuity within point-of-view editing, so that directionality itself—and priority with it—spins on a dime. In this respect, Amy does unnervingly offer a rearview horizon as well as an arriving point of rest—as much lost maternal care as present alleviation. Beyond this spatial reversal, however, there is the grammatical lapse itself. For in the loosened grip of syntax, Amy is also, for Arthur, his life's preemption, eliding the male subject-position altogether at its evacuated focal point. Paradoxically, cooptively, with the pronoun “she” taking the hero (in his retrospective “looking”) as the only available antecedent, Clennam is as much feminized by such unlicensed syntax as he will later be in his grammatical subsumption to a mother's role. This whole moment of narrowed but totalized “perspective” is prototypical in its shift of scale and orientation.28Even in providing a graphic or painterly mastertrope for its own implied narratology of closure, the novel's summary gesture invites the less-settled narratography of contradiction in proces~<br>

Abstract: The mourning strategies adopted respectively by Augustine and Marcel suggest that the death of the beloved may teach us how to disrupt the foundation of self‐reflexivity upon which, as we saw with regard to the split selves of Augustine and Marcel, we tend to erect our own identity. In
         Memory, History, Forgetting, Ricoeur advocates a mourning strategy equivalent with a similar goal. At first, he says, the death of the beloved brings about “a genuine amputation of oneself.” But then the experience of mourning entails “internalization,” a new level of personal identification for both the love object, lost to death, and our own self as a subject predicated on affections that now manifest themselves in absentia. This new self‐identification, in turn, trains us in the “anticipation” of our own futural self as predicated on the “plurality” that death will one day bestow on us in the memory of our dear ones.67This is the equivalent of the compassionate reciprocity with the subject of one’s grief that, as mentioned in my opening remarks, justifies the state of mourning, or, in Nussbaum’s words, makes compassion “comprehensible.”68<br>

Abstract: This kind of humanism, we can say, encodes a specific way of seeing and evaluating the world, a mentality or sensibility, and thereby forms part of the structure of lived reality within which people dwell. Its hallmark is the creative self‐formation of human beings.
         16The best expression of this outlook, as often noted, is found in the Renaissance thinker Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. In his famousOration on the Dignity of Man, Pico depicts the deity speaking to human beings: “The nature of all other creatures is defined and restricted within laws which We have laid down; you, by contrast, impeded by no such restriction, may, by your own free will, to whose custody We have assigned you, trace for yourself the lineaments of your own nature.”17Humanisticpaideiais nothing else, in this exalted form, than the formation of human “nature,” the core of which is the strangely wonderful and yet also vulnerable power of will. Human beings are subject to nothing beyond their kind, not even the divine, and the norm or measure of existence must arise within the will itself. Renaissance and modern humanism, in converse to much classical humanism, holds that the right orientation of human life is the creative exercise of power to shape one’s existence, rather than an ascent or unity with the “divine.” The modern vision of human existence thus linked an account of the good as finite flourishing with the drive to liberate human beings from ignorance and want.<br>

Abstract: This shift was visible across the humanities.

Author(s): Mrozik,  Susanne<br>
Abstract: Susanne Mrozik’s
      Virtuous Bodiesrepresents a significant contribution to this current rethinking of religion and Buddhist studies. The author explicitly locates her approach within the interdisciplinary field of feminist studies while also effectively placing the subject of her analysis, Śāntideva’sCompendium of Training(Śikṣ āsamuccaya), in dialogue with the work of such scholars as Michel Foucault, Elizabeth Grosz, Paul Ricoeur, and Charles Hallisey. In one respect, this study can be seen as quite traditional: the author develops her argument through a close reading of an influential Buddhist text, paying careful attention to the subtleties of its Sanskrit vocabulary and attempting to situate it within the medieval North Indian monastic milieu within which it took shape. This textual analysis provides the basis on which Mrozik advances toward the first stated goal of her work, to correct “the widespread misconception in scholarship on Buddhism and Buddhist ethics that South Asian Buddhists (with the exception of practitioners of Vajrayana or Tantric Buddhism) ascribed little value to bodies” (6). And Mrozik succeeds admirably in this regard, skillfully articulating how diverse and often seemingly contradictory perspectives on human embodiment come together in support of a religious ideal in which the “bodied being” (ātmabhāva) of bodhisattvas, interacting with the bodies of those whom they aim to liberate, plays a foundational role. Having first identified two dominant and contrasting somatic discourses in theCompendium of Training, one “physiomoral” and the other “ascetic,” Mrozik argues that the text presents a coherent ethical perspective, one in which “an ascetic discourse is in service of producing a range of virtuous bodied beings, valued for their physical as well as moral qualities” (116). As she notes, ascetic disciplines are grounded in an implicit assumption that embodiment matters greatly, even if these disciplines or “technologies of the self” ~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: In conclusion, Coleridge testifies, in poetry and theological reflection alike, to an internal struggle constitutive of prayer and its language. Going back to the most recent philosophical discussions, this is not incompatible with Derrida’s insistence that the words of prayer are always inappropriate to the Other. Yet because Coleridgean prayer is a response, this struggle is entirely fitting: the call of God upon the subject is to open up the for‐God in one’s being, thus by definition practicing a kind of violence against one’s current being—including one’s speech. In
         Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit, Coleridge describes the name of God, the “I Am,” as part of a religious category called “stasis.” Prayer, however, is part ofmetastasis‐anastasis(change of state/rising up): the conflictual, dynamic, unfinished scene of human redemption that includes grace, love, hope, and perseverance.71Appropriately enough, the primary signification of metastasis is a transition between rhetorical figures. For Coleridge, there can be no transformation in one’s spiritual state unless the language in which one responds is also transformed, wrenched toward the improper. The heart of Coleridgean prayer is the metastasis between proper signification and catachresis that cuts against one’s language, one’s understanding, and hence one’s being in order to open oneself up to God. Perhaps one may even argue that in this cut, this wound, made against the “fleshly Understanding” (N6666, fol. 83), “the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered” (Rom. 8:26). This, certainly, is a hope on which much of his poetry and certainly his philosophy of prayer is founded.<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: Franke’s book has considerable merit, but I have a theoretical and a practical concern with his appropriation of negative theology. First, negative theology is never entirely negative, and while Franke recognizes that poetic language is both deconstructive and open, he nevertheless insists that our various theologies—literary or religious—finally have no positive content. Perhaps this is the postmodernism in his negative theology because this is not entirely consistent with the theological tradition. A good counterexample is Pseudo‐Dionysius, whose mystical theology seeks finally to overcome the limitations of both positive and negative speaking. Dionysius insists that God is love in a way that is both negative and positive. On this, Franke should consider the work of Jean‐Luc Marion and especially his response to Jacques Derrida on the subject of negative theology, and this omission is a considerable oversight. Second, many people of various faiths will never accept that their understanding of the transcendent has no positive content, and if this is a precondition for dialogue, then it is unlikely to occur. On this, the practical dimension of Franke’s study needs more development, as well as more traditional examples of poetic and theological openness from contemporary religious life.<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: D'Holbach's caveat is essential for understanding the implications of his system for the relationship between person and nature, but also between the transcendent and the immanent. If nature is meant to assume the role once assigned to the divine in Christian theology, it does so in an entirely different manner—not as an all-knowing, all-powerful subject, but as a blind and will-less force. At the same time, the human person is both identified with and in large part reduced to an effect of this force. D'Holbach's abandonment of transcendence in his materialist system thus drastically altered the relationship between God and soul as it was understood in orthodox religion. What had been an exchange between two distinct, albeit unequal persons, was reduced to an arrangement between two objects. The meaning of immanence likewise changed. Once mainline Christian theology began to assert the self's inward transcendence vis-à-vis the world as “masters and possessors of nature” (to cite Descartes), atheist philosophes such as d'Holbach reacted by asserting the immanent power of things to dispossess the self in order to repudiate the concept of divinity that stood behind it. However, this was no mere reversion to the world of “enchantment.” While d'Holbach was momentarily willing to anthropomorphize nature for rhetorical effect, he and Spinoza persistently applied the mechanized organization of the universe to human beings as well. In lieu of the semitranscendent, personified objects of the enchanted universe, one was left with the prospect of a world inhabited by wholly immanent, objectified entities.<br>

Author(s): Kitts Margo<br>
Abstract: Sections 7 and 8 reinforce this theme:
            
                  Paradise is won by purity of heart and, by implication from section 15 above, of body.7. Purify your heart and cleanse it from all uncleanliness. Forget and become oblivious to that thing called “this world.”
                  8. Let your breast be open, tranquil to the bounty of God because it is only a few minutes before the happy, satisfying life and the eternal Paradise begins in the company of the prophets, the upright people, the martyrs and the righteous, may God have mercy on all of them.
               40Upon death, the purified ritual actor will be delivered to the select company of the prophets, the upright and righteous (presumably the companions of old), and the martyrs. As pointed out in the discussion of Fernandez, the semantic movement in ritual transformation tends to narrow from the obscure and inchoate in the subject (or “tenor”)—who were these young men, anyway?—to the concrete and ostensive in the metaphoric predicate (the “vehicle”); now they rank with the prophets, martyrs, and the righteous. Through purification, among other things, the ritual actor has shifted his identity to the holy sphere, which clearly enlists an entire network of fecund associations. Inferring from Sura 9:111, he has been initiated to a holy mission:
                  
            God has verily bought the souls and possessions of the faithful in exchange for a promise of Paradise. They fight in the cause of God, and kill and are killed. This is a promise incumbent on Him, as in the Torah, so the Gospel and the Quran. And who is more true to his promises than God?<br>

Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: Though actuality appears to be the result of potentiality’s gift, it is not all of what potency is. The gift of actuality to itself exhausts neither the possible nor sovereign. In practical terms, the inalienability of the gift means that the sovereign, even when operating within the limits of a constitution or other political order, always retains the possibility to decide for an exceptional situation and so may suspend the ordinary constitution again. Yet, when the sovereign decides that his or her polity has encountered an exceptional state, it gives without loss, without appearance so as not to violate the conditions for possibility and impossibility of all giving. For potentiality to appear in its entirety as potentiality would amount to its full actualization and so lose its ability to not be. If the gift were to appear at all and so be recognized as a gift, it would appear within a larger field of constraints and subject to critique or demand.
         25As the exchange of the gift of being from itself to itself, potentiality or sovereign power demands a return of the being it gives so far as it appears.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: The importance of literature as a political tool is revealed most clearly when we differentiate it from what Jean-Luc Nancy and Phillipe Lacoue-Labarthe, influenced by Blanchot, come to define as myth. They configure myth as “a fiction, in the strong, active sense of ‘fashioning,' . . . whose role is to propose, if not to impose, models or types . . . , types in imitation of which an individual, or a city, or an entire people, can grasp themselves and identify themselves.” Myth creates community by providing a narrative of origin and installs the nexus for the political subject's identification with that community. Myth is thus the mechanism by which social fusion is created. It serves its function when it produces, as Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy write, “a total belief, an immediate, unreserved adhesion to the dreamed figure. . . . It is both the model of identity
         andits present, effective,formedreality.”33In contrast, literature, as Blanchot defines it, would be that mode of speech that mocks any mythic claim to fusion by expressing disjunction. Most importantly it disallows the act of identification that is a form of self-presencing. From its very beginnings, Blanchot's theory of literature zeros in on the capacity of figurative language to disrupt identification.<br>

Author(s): Schildgen Brenda Deen<br>
Abstract: Here, once again we find a collection of verbs in the present, some both reflexives and neologisms, which simultaneously render eternal action and linguistic impossibility (because of the neologisms) while eliding the difference between the actor and action: “s'infiora” (enflower themselves), a neologism; “si ritorna” (return themselves); “s'insapora” (ensavors itself), a second neologism; “s'addorna” (adorns itself); “risaliva” (re-ascends), and “soggiorna” (abides). With the reflexives and the present tense, Dante emphasizes the perpetual movement of angels as they sing God's praises; with the linguistic play of the neologisms he conveys the impossibility of actually describing them; and by likening them to their analogy in the created world, bees, he also heightens our awareness that in the actions of bees we can see something of the divine realm in our world of nature. This focus on the detail of creaturely action, through the verbs and this observable natural environment, once more overcomes the separation between the transcendent and the immanent, sign and signified, vehicle and referent, with the analogy hinting that alterity can become sameness or, as Badiou puts it, poetry's melding with philosophy allows it to bond object and subject and to overcome the rupture between what would otherwise be two modes of discourse.

Abstract: It is a truism to state that there are as many Augustines as there are interpreters or, in any case, schools of interpretation.
      
            His work could be called an1
         opera aperta, albeit in quite a different sense from the way this expression was meant by its inventor, Umberto Eco.
            Eco's use of this phrase mainly concerned modernist works, such as Joyce's2
         Ulysses, whose very structure allows the reader to find his way in the labyrinth of the artwork without ever arriving at—or, for that matter, departing from—one single, fixed level of meaning. The metaphor of theopera apertaopened up a peculiar combination of structure and randomness, the latter made even more mysterious by modernism's emphasis on austerity of form. While it cannot be denied that for Joyce the fact that every line and every word were meticulously planned and put in their proper place was the precondition for the emergence of riddles and clues, thus widening up the scope of language and meaning, for Augustine things seem to be quite different inasmuch as the flow and width of his discourse is in place right from the beginning. In his case, randomness seems to be part of the structure of the discourse itself, to the extent of beguiling Henri-Irénée Marrou—still the most prominent historian of Augustinian rhetoric—into accusing Augustine of a lack of rhetorical skills: “Saint Augustin compose mal.”
            Fortunately, Marrou retracted this accusation in a later edition of his book:3
         
            One wonders whether this new appreciation of Augustine's style, being part of aI took for incapacity or indifference what was in fact conscious discretion, calculated flexibility, expressive deformation, brought about by adroit maneuvering. I took for barbarism or decadence what was in fact the supreme sophistication of an art that was completely in control of its own techniques and in search of subtle effects.

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: And just as the play solicits sympathy with Faustus in its spectacle and its comedy, so does it invite pity for Faustus in its tragedy. Such pity emerges from a slightly different kind of theatrical identification, however. Rather than accompanying the spectator's recognition that a character shares his or her interests, pity may arise when the spectator recognizes the character's otherness, when he apprehends or infers that the character suffers inwardly in an extraordinary way. Yet in pity the spectator also identifies in some sense with the tragic character, for he feels psychic pain in his imagination of the character's suffering. For Levinas, for instance, pity, as an expression of the subject's irreducibly asymmetrical obligation to the other, is fundamental to ethics.
      34But inDoctor Faustus, pity has no salutary ethical or moral value; on the contrary, the play explicitly contrasts the quality of human pity to that of divine mercy, thereby fashioning pity for Faustus as an aesthetic response that undermines the spectator's faith in God. It is the old man who thus devalues tragic pity. After Helen leaves the stage for the first time, the old man tells Faustus that an “angel” hovers over his head “with a vial full of precious grace” to “pour” into his “soul” (5.1.54–56), and he urges Faustus to repent—to “break heart, drop blood, and mingle it with tears” (5.1.40)—warning him that he has endangered his inward soul “with such flagitious crimes of heinous sins / As no commiseration may expel / But mercy, Faustus, of thy Savior sweet, / Whose blood alone must wash away thy guilt” (5.1.43–46). “Commiseration” is, of course, the contemporaneous word for the pity inspired by tragedy; Sidney uses it as such inThe Defense of Poesy.35The old man argues, then, that Faustus is no less damnable for being pitiful, yet his argument, orthodox as it may be, not only makes God seem somehow less compassionate than even the crudest member of the audience moved by Faustus's ~<br>

Abstract: The guiding maxims of the morality of anthropology as a social practice have been adapted from the principles of medical and therapeutic ethics. “Above all, do no harm.” “Preserve autonomy.” “Treat the subject as a whole.” “Maintain trust.” “Honor the rights of privacy and informed consent.”
         
                  What these maxims actually demand is neither clear nor determinate. In the face of familiar conflicts among their contestable applications, anthropologists are left to improvise as best they can. For counsel on these matters—for the costs of infringing the morality of anthropology—we must be grateful to Tom Csordas’s searching article.21<br>

Abstract: Bridging holds true on different levels. Within a universalistic framework, religious traditions of different peoples offer a heritage that might be shared.

Even a negative trait like images of the divine could be shared by many polities (frag. 18). Roman precepts for ritual action as well as Greek precepts for ritual abstinence were resources for the solution of human problems (frags. 49–50):

               I have already pointed to the stress placed on the import of Italian deities into Rome by the first kings as well as on documenting the contemporary local deities of middle-Italian townships. Varro, born 116 BC, had witnessed the start of the Italian civil war as a military tribune and was much aware of the problem of the unification of Italy. But in a book published late in 47 or in 46 he was aware of internal cleavages in Roman society, too. If Caesar, the murderer, is the dedicatee of the(50) et religiones et castus id possunt, ut ex periculo eripiant nostro.

Abstract: Like the first three chapters of Genesis, the story of Eve’s dream retains the power to surprise us on any given rereading by virtue of what it does not say. There is no mention of a voice, satanic or otherwise, and whatever Satan does here it involves treating Eve more as medical subject than as coy mistress. “Inspiring venom” might be read as a metaphor for “speaking evil words,” but the language of animal spirits in fact asks us to see something very different. Satan is inspiring Eve—literally pouring noxious matter into the porches of her ears. This attempt at material defilement has some causal relation to the dream voice as Eve articulates it the following morning, but in connection with what other catalysts we cannot say. We have no ground for asserting that Satan spoke, scripted, or serenaded. But such is the nature of Eve’s dream—always seducing us into making our own “additions strange” to Milton’s elliptical account.<br>

Abstract: In scripting this physical reaction, Massinger foreshadows modern neurological research on the biological effects of seeing another person in pain.
      
            Recent medical research utilizing MRI scans has revealed that subjects display similar brain responses when they experience pain themselves and when they know another person is in pain, a tangible bodily reaction to others’ physical suffering. These results show the involvement of the somatosensory cortex and limbic areas of the brain as well as what is called the “pain matrix”—the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral anterior insula, brain stem, and cerebellum. These areas of the brain differ from those involved in cognitively adopting the perspective of someone in pain or actively trying to put oneself in his or her position.27
         
            The findings suggest a physical basis for empathy, as seeing someone in pain generates a bodily response in the subject that is more reflective of the current state of the other than of the self.28
         
            Or, as one study defines empathy, “shar[ing] the other person’s feelings in an embodied manner.”29

Abstract: In an effort to overcome David Hume's skepticism, Immanuel Kant attempted, among other things, to establish both the validity of knowledge and the impossibility of knowledge without sensory experience. The idea of times derives from the succession of our perceptions. For, as it is from the disposition of visible and tangible objects that we receive the ideas of space, it is also from the succession of ideas and impressions that we form the idea of time. Time, then for Kant, becomes a “necessary” representation that underlies all “time,” he remarks, “is therefore a purely subjective condition of our (human) intuition [ … ] and in itself, apart from the subject, is nothing” (p. 166). G. F. W. Hegel proceeded beyond Kant to posit that “the narration of history and historical deeds and events appear at the same time; a common inner principle brings them forth together.” In discussing Paul Ricoeur's approach to the question of time, formulated in
      Time and Narrative, Mooij traces the philosophic traditions of idealism, phenomenology, and hermeneutics in that three‐volume work. For Ricoeur, “time requires narratives in order to manifest itself fully” (p. 240).<br>

Author(s): Anderson Judith H<br>
Abstract: Anderson’s argument covers a lot of ground — from the works of Shakespeare, Spenser, and Donne to the Vestiarian Controversy of the 1560s and the economic writings of Gerrard de Malynes — but she takes her first bearings from the twentieth-century theorists Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur. Derrida offers her an account of the persistence of the etymological trace, a theory of metaphor grounded in words. Ricoeur — from whom she also borrows a sense of metaphorical productivity as Hegelian sublation — describes the process of “lexicalization” through which a lively metaphor loses its polyvalence, governed by its role in particular sentences (and, by extension, in particular rhetorical and cultural contexts). The contest between surplus and lexicalization is this book’s subject, and Anderson teaches us how to measure the pressures in each direction. If she takes a side, it is Derrida’s, and her reasons are historical: the vernacular ferment of the period, its polylingualism, and the humanist grammarians’ emphasis on
      verbumover syntax (a subject central to her previous book,Words That Matter).<br>

Abstract: Although the clarity with which Wu writes makes this book accessible to nonspecialists, he evidently assumes the reader is familiar with China and the subject of tombs. For example, no maps are included, despite frequent mentions made of specific provinces and cities. Additionally, no matter how obscure or technical the terms, he provides Chinese characters in only one instance (128). The reliance on pinyin romanization may make it somewhat frustrating for specialists encountering these terms for the first time to understand them or even to look them up in a dictionary. Oddly, several line drawings and diagrams only employ Chinese characters; it would have been helpful for Wu to translate these. However, these minor shortcomings do not overshadow the overall importance of this book. On account of its remarkably original theoretical approach,
   The Art of the Yellow Springsis essential reading material for anyone interested in a new interpretation of Chinese tombs.<br>

Author(s): Moreno Jairo<br>
Abstract: In nearly thirty densely argued pages, Gottfried Weber (1832) analyzed four measures from Mozart's"Dissonance" Quartet; the "ear" subjects each note and chord to multiple possible interpretations. This paper examines Weber's interpretive practice in light of his theory of harmony, considering his cognitive teasing of potential meanings from the perspective of philosophical notions of consciousness (Kant and Fichte) and the poetics of self-reflective subjectivity proposed by the Early Romantics (F.Schlegel and Novalis) in their critiques of linguistic representation, temporality,and subject-object relations.The Early Romantic conception of irony and allegory brings the subject fully within the fold of linguistic representation, as does Weber,marking a key moment in the history of the representation of listening by music theory.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ncm.2012.36.issue-1<br>
Date: July 2012<br>
Abstract: Framed in such a way, the early movements of Mahler's Second Symphony—characterized by the alternation between halting sections that dissolve almost as soon as they begin and long-breathed melodies that seem to unfold effortlessly—suggest the melancholic subject's struggle between despair in the face of abject meaninglessness and a manic euphoria, neither of which addresses the loss. By contrast, the text in the symphony's final movement, adapted by Mahler from Friedrich Klopstock's chorale on the resurrection of the dead, encourages true remembrance of the deceased as a figure beyond death. Heard as a musical enactment of mourning, the final movement suggests that the dead who are mourned are resurrected through remembrance. Forcing us to acknowledge Mahler's death on some level, the final movement completes the work of mourning by engendering the composer's own resurrection in our memories as we witness each performance of his Second Symphony.<br>

Abstract: Every text aims to seduce its reader. If the text at the same time lays claim to having scientific value, we readers must ask whether seduction stands in the way of truth. As a concept, seduction lies halfway between an assault and conversation. As opposed to assault, seduction conveys a dimension of voluntarily being swept off one's feet. As opposed to conversation, seduction implies that one loses one's senses for a moment. Who, then, is really subject and who is object in seduction? The thesis I will argue here is that the readership's or audience's only chance of taking on the role of subjects, in a textual seduction, is to lose their senses first. Rather than being an assault against scientific ethics, seduction is a necessary premise for a sensible conversation to take place.<br>

Author(s): VetterAbstract: Arguments by Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta for evidence of a Self that is one and the same as the Great Lord Śiva are interpreted. The views of these authors are clarified and the contradictory relationship between the limited individual subject and the recognition of the true Self is shown. With the help of Utpaladeva's distinction between "seeing" and "noticing," a further interpretation is attempted. Some remarks are made concerning practical meditation and the theoretical presuppositions of this way of thinking in order to find starting points for a comparison with Western philosophy.<br>

Publisher: University of Notre Dame<br>
Issue: i261382<br>
Date: 10 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Pangle Fred<br>
Abstract: Recent literature on Heidegger concentrates heavily on his (temporary) involvement in or collusion with Nazi ideology and policies. Without belittling the gravity of the issue, this article shifts the focus somewhat by invoking a distinction which recently has emerged (or reemerged) in political thought: namely, the distinction between "politics" and "the political" or between politics viewed as partisan ideology or policy making, on the one hand, and politics seen as regime or paradigmatic framework, on the other. The main thesis of the article is that Heidegger's promising contributions to political theory are located on the level of ontology or paradigmatic framework rather than that of ideological partisanship. While not neglecting the dismal intrusions of the latter plane, the article probes Heideggerian cues for a "rethinking of the political" by placing the accent on four topical areas: first, the status of the subject or individual as political agent; second, the character of the political community, that is, of the polity or (in modern terms) the "state"; thirdly, the issue of cultural and political development or modernization; and finally, the problem of an emerging cosmopolis or world order beyond the confines of Western culture. In discussing these topics, an effort is made to disentangle Heidegger from possible misinterpretations and to indicate how, in each area, his thought pointed in the direction of an "overcoming" of Western political metaphysics.<br>

Author(s): Whitehead Charles E.<br>
Abstract: The focus of contemporary studies in religion on methodology can be explored as the recognition of a fundamental epistemological problem. This paper is first an acknowledgment that we do not have an adequate conceptuality to render intelligible inward turning and then an experiment with the meaning of intelligibility. The dispossession of consciousness as the sole place and origin of meaning constituting an intellectual aporia is presented as an experience of the subversion of the subject by the discovery of the unconscious in depth psychologies and the discovery of the transcendence of the subject in foundational theologies. Taking account of this duplex expression of what lingers in disguise behind the scripts of ordinary life is defined as a fundamental exigency in the further development of human understanding and theological reflection.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263710<br>
Date: 12 1, 1966<br>
Author(s): Winter Charles R.<br>
Abstract: Through the provision of a set of theses for the interpretation and evaluation of theologies of liberation, this paper attempts to mediate the existing conflict between academic theologians and theologians of liberation. It seeks to establish the legitimacy of theological discourse focused on the problem of alienation and liberation if carefully executed according to a clear set of guidelines. The paper begins with the argument that all interpretations of theologies of liberation must begin with an analysis of the theological genre within which these works fall. After insisting that theologies of liberation belong neither to the genre of systematic theology nor that of Christian social ethics, the paper develops the second thesis that theologies of liberation are best understood as members of a genre whose distinctive characteristics and functions are analogous to those intrinsic to secular ideologies. This thesis hinges upon a revisionist understanding of ideology drawn from the works of Clifford Geertz et al. and upon a careful specification of the generic similarities between the two forms of discourse. The second part of the paper moves from the level of interpretation to that of evaluation. It argues that theologies of liberation share with ideologies a tendency to occlude self-critical reflection. It suggests that a conscious recognition that theologies of liberation do not exhaust the possibilities of theological discourse but are relative models which select and interpret Christian symbols and doctrines in the light of the central dynamic of alienation and liberation might provide an antidote to this pathology. It maintains with Rosemary Ruether that there is no absolutely adequate model of alienation and liberation and that various models of alienation and liberation must be "interstructured" in order to overcome the perspectival biases of models which focus upon a single root of oppression. To establish relative degrees of adequacy between various theologi~<br>

Abstract: This article analyses a recently completed research project, to answer the question, on what were the findings based? It draws on the hermeneutics of Gadamer to explore the relationship between researcher and research subject in qualitative educational research. It argues that all qualitative research findings are simultaneously subjective and objective, being essentially constructed interpretations of data which are partly, but only partly, external to the researcher. Yet many contemporary educational researchers tend to focus almost exclusively on either the subject matter under investigation or upon the standpoint of the researcher him/herself. A simultaneous combination of both is necessary to understand the nature of research findings.<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303101<br>
Date: 7 1, 1938<br>
Author(s): Al-Zayyat Israel<br>
Abstract: This paper is an attempt to rethink the much-discussed topic of the so-called crisis of orientation among, or shift of, Egyptian intellectuals who turned to Islamic subjects in the 1930s. Those intellectuals who, during the 1920s, had adhered to the principles of Westernization and secularization were said to have abandoned these principles to embrace Islam and Arabism a decade later. The commonly ventured historical account of this shift attempted to describe and explain it from the "top down," that is, from the perspective of the intellectual producers, either on the basis of content analysis of their texts or through the reconstruction of authorial intentions. It was assumed that the impact of this shift on the culture and politics of contemporary society could be extracted from the meanings invested by the authors in their texts or from the context of the act of writing. This paper approaches the subject from a different perspective, namely, from the "bottom up." While not ignoring authorial intentions or the meanings with which authors invested their texts, I emphasize the ways in which readers reinterpreted intellectual literature on Islam as they consumed it and argue that a proper understanding of the social and political impact of literary products cannot be attained without also understanding the reception of these products. I concentrate especially on one of the major representative texts of this shift, Muhammad Husayn Haykal's biography of the Prophet, and reconstruct the different interpretations of this work's major communities of contemporary readers in the discursive context of their different "horizons of expectations." Through recontextualizing the "crisis of orientation" debate in the paradigm of reader-response criticism and reception theory, the paper is intended to show that each community of readers produces an autonomous interpretation, "another reading." Despite differences among the various reading communities, some common features emerge f~<br>

Author(s): Skinner John G.<br>
Abstract: Recent challenges to traditional approaches and purposes for studying the history of political theory have raised questions about its constitution as both a subject matter and subfield of political science. Methodological arguments advocating what is characterized as a more truly historical mode of inquiry for understanding political ideas and recovering textual meaning have become increasingly popular. The relationship of these hermeneutical claims about historicity, such as that advanced by Quentin Skinner, to the actual practice of interpretation is problematical. Such claims are more a defense of a certain norm of historical investigation than a method of interpretation, and the implications of this norm for the reconstitution of the history of political theory require careful consideration.<br>

Abstract: Several recent studies of Soviet foreign policy formation have sought to bring organizational and cognitive considerations to bear on the subject. The article evaluates these perspectives and suggests how future research may, through the use of cognitive methods of analysis, distinguish formally between different conceptualizations of Soviet foreign policy formation, thus permitting a more rigorous empirical examination of the organizational issues involved. A model of inference that accounts for organizational and cognitive links between the Soviet press and Soviet foreign policy formation is also constructed; examples are drawn from the items under review. In conclusion, the article outlines a research strategy for cumulating knowledge about how the Soviet system works, and specifies what the organizational and cognitive frameworks for the study of Soviet foreign policy formation may contribute to such a project.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i20117410<br>
Date: 7 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Horst Steven<br>
Abstract: It has recently been claimed (1) that mental states such as beliefs are theoretical entities and (2) that they are therefore, in principle, subject to theoretical elimination if intentional psychology were to be supplanted by a psychology not employing mentalistic notions. Debate over these two issues is seriously hampered by the fact that the key terms 'theoretical' and 'belief' are ambiguous. This article argues that there is only one sense of 'theoretical' that is of use to the eliminativist, and in this sense some kinds of "belief" (dispositional states, infra-conscious states and the Freudian unconscious) are indeed "theoretical" and hence possible candidates for elimination, while others (consciously occurring thoughts like judgements and perceptual Gestalten) are not theoretical and hence not candidates for elimination.<br>

Author(s): Kedar Asaf<br>
Abstract: This article offers an anti-naturalist philosophical critique of the naturalist tendencies within qualitative concept formation as developed most prominently by Giovanni Sartori and David Collier. We begin by articulating the philosophical distinction between naturalism and anti-naturalism. Whereas naturalism assumes that the study of human life is not essentially different from the study of natural phenomena, anti-naturalism highlights the meaningful and contingent nature of social life, the situatedness of the scholar, and so the dialogical nature of social science. These two contrasting philosophical approaches inspire, in turn, different strategies of concept formation. Naturalism encourages concept formation that involves reification, essentialism, and an instrumentalist view of language. Anti-naturalism, conversely, challenges reified concepts for eliding the place of meanings, essentialist concepts for eliding the place of contingency, and linguistic instrumentalism for eliding the situatedness of the scholar and the dialogical nature of social science. Based on this philosophical framework, we subject qualitative concept formation to a philosophical critique. We show how the conceptual strategies developed by Sartori and Collier embody a reification, essentialism, and instrumentalist view of language associated with naturalism. Although Collier's work on concept formation is much more flexible and nuanced than Sartori's, it too remains attached to a discredited naturalism.<br>

Abstract: The logic of Indonesian subjectless and tenseless expressions appears to have cultural implications, just as the use of tenses in English scientific writing entails much more than grammatical minutiae. A. L. Becker has pointed out that tense in English functions in a "coherence system" that pervades and transcends grammar. A parallel coherence system is suggested for Indonesian, based not on tense but on topic. Paul Ricoeur's distinction between LANGUAGE and DISCOURSE is the basis of the claim that Indonesian sentences cohere on the bond between grammatical subject and discourse topic. Examples are drawn from a number of contexts that call forth passive sentences in Indonesian. The article concludes on another suggestion by Becker. The Indonesian topic may be part of a larger deictic category of person, which may be related in discourse to orientation in space--both physical and social--of participants in the speech event. If this suggestion is correct, then the contrast between English and Indonesian coherence systems may be found in the opposition tense/time vs. person/space.<br>

Abstract: El presente trabajo se centra en el acontecimiento traumático de la guerra, la posibilidad del sujeto de realizar una experiencia y sostenerse en cuanto tal, pese a la anulación que recae sobre él. El análisis se lleva a cabo en dos poemarios del poeta chileno Tomás Harris: "Encuentros al fin de la batalla" (de Encuentros con hombres oscuros) y "Balada del soldado de Oklahoma" (de Tridente). Ambos poemarios entran en diálogo y choque, puesto que uno aborda la Segunda Guerra Mundial y el segundo la guerra mediática del Golfo. La poesía pone a prueba sus propias posibilidades y nos muestra un sujeto que oscila entre el duelo y la melancolía y que se niega a ser reducido a un mero espectador pasivo. This article aims at exploring the possibility of surviving and realizing an experience from the traumatic event of war. The analysis is focused on two works by the Chilean poet Tomás Harris: "Encuentros al fin de la batalla" of Encuentros con hombres oscuros and "Balada del soldado de Oklahoma" of Tridente. Both poems are related to the issue of war trauma: in the first work, it approaches World War II and the second, the mediatic Gulf War. Thus, the poetry of Harris questions its own limits by means of a subject who oscillates between mourning and melancholy, and rejects to be reduced to a mere passive spectator.<br>

Abstract: At its most a typical sports narrative records what happens in space and time. Alongside this traditional history of events there has emerged a research approach that might be called structural sports history. Its methods move in the world under the surface of facts, explored by researchers in ways that resemble archaeology. The aim is to uncover the changed human relationships and new forms of presence in sport-figurations of corporeality, space and time. Where the event-history approach recounts and recapitulates, the new approach works towards interpretation and understanding. These two are joined by yet a third element, the most intimate aspect of sports narratives: microhistory and the routes that it opens to the interfaces between the public and the private and the general and the particular, where the reader-oriented focus of the experiencing and narrating subject is necessarily foregrounded and at this point surface such elements of narrativity as the "confessional", the "meditative" and the "fragmentary" (auto)biography. The article describes different levels of a sports narrative and their conventions in qualitative sports research.<br>

Abstract: The paper considers early death as violent death caused by another person in the context of the Nazi concentration camps. With Hannah Arendt death is understood as destruction of personal identity, because writers cannot write a poem about their own physical death. Therefore, the present contribution based on the concept of the narrative identity (Paul Ricœur) will examine by the example of the poem „Der Häftling“ („The Inmate“) by Fritz Löhner-Beda how identity can be destroyed and stabilized by techniques of narrative defiguration and refiguration at level of the first person narrator of the poem and at level of the author's subject.<br>

Abstract: The Subject of this essay, as well as the intention behind it, is to examine the problems connected with the relationship between sociology and the theme of the person. The paper's position is that this theme has a substantial (and not only formal) centrality within a sociological analysis, which is intended to be critical, in the sense used by Theodor Adorno of this term, and is, therefore, naturally, problematic. This discourse implies that the analysis cannot be limited only to codes and factual dynamics (numbering, classify, aggregating-disaggregating) which reduce the sociological discourse to mere sociography.<br>

Abstract: The Phenomenology says that every knowledge is a perspective knowledge, because every knowledge is situated in a time and in a space. The human's embodiment discloses a perspective overview on the world. The paper claims the aim to analyze how the sexual and gender dimensions, which are incarnated in a determinate body, are present in the qualitative research, specifically into the ethnographic observation. First for all, we hypothesize that the gender is a border for the access into a field and not in other, so to be man or woman is not neutral for the knowledge of a specific social context. Moreover, the performative dimension of the gender, which shows the norms that pre-exist and that conduct the role's interaction (i.e. the role's gendered content and the role's gendered language) is another tie in the participant observation. The awareness that all the knowledge is gendered, requires to the fieldworker to play a double competence (ability). The researcher must use the self reflexivity to point out his gender identity and his background on this theme: he must point out his background frame relatively to the gender, his gender behaviour's expectations in the interaction, and his correlated opinions. The researcher, moreover, must know that exist a cultural mainstream about the gender, but that the concrete gender playing is based on the interaction in a concrete frame. So, we have a lot of concrete ways in which the gender is embodied. The researcher on the field, so, must enter in a knowledge's circulation in which must point attention to: the epistemic interdependence, i.e. the knowledge borns in the symbolic interaction between the researcher and the subject; the gendered nature of the communicative interaction between the researcher and the subject; the negotiable nature of the concrete managing of the gendered role in the interaction.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i23011419<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Ram Kalpana<br>
Abstract: The long-standing dominance of history in the adjudication of debates on postcolonialism and modernity in India has resulted in the relegation of the knowledge claims of `classical' performance traditions and aesthetic concepts to the domain of the essentializing and the untrustworthy. This paper argues that performances of music and dance have preserved an understanding of tradition that is more dynamic and agential than that put forward by nationalist understandings of tradition, and that aesthetic conceptions continue to illuminate the values and efficacy of these practices in engaging the affects of spectators. The paper explores in particular the subject position of the rasika as offering a distinctive way of inhabiting the present. The class privilege implicit in being able to take up such an invitation is explored in the second part of the paper. La longue domination de l'histoire dans l'orientation des débats sur le post-colonialisme et la modernité en Inde a relégué les prétentions au statut de savoir des arts performatifs et des concepts esthétiques « classiques » au domaine des choses essentialisantes et peu fiables. Le présent article fait valoir que les performances de musique et de danse ont préservé une compréhension de la tradition plus dynamique et agentielle que celle mise en avant dans les interprétations nationalistes, et que les conceptions esthétiques continuent de mettre en lumière les valeurs et l'efficacité de ces pratiques en faisant appel aux affects des spectateurs. L'article explore en particulier la position de sujet du rasika comme une manière différente d'habiter le présent. Le privilège de classe, implicite dans la possibilité d'accepter une telle invitation, est exploré dans la deuxième partie de l'article.<br>

Issue: i23083926<br>
Date: 10 1, 1981<br>
Author(s): Youniss James<br>
Abstract: This paper offers a discussion of contemporary theories of moral development. At present, these theories are at odds regarding the origins of morality. One camp has proposed a cognitive basis, while the other claims that morality consists in affectivity. Both these positions are discussed, and a third alternative is proposed for their resolution, based upon the model of the subject within communicative relations, whose life involves constructing reality through social procedures with others. This model is described and contrasted with the model of the self-reflecting individual which seems to underlie most current theories. In addition, a number of studies are reviewed in order to show more clearly how this third alternative provides insight into the social basis of moral judgment. Throughout the paper, two themes remain central: (a) that rationality can be considered to result from consensual validation which is obtained through communication; and (b) that sense of community, the grounds for moral action, is not incompatible with establishing or maintaining one's own individual identity.<br>

Author(s): Youniss James<br>
Abstract: A theory of the moral subject of cooperative relations proceeds from a different point of departure than a formalistic ethics based on individualism and rationalism. Shweder (Merrill-Palmer Quarterly, 1982, 28, 41–69) fails to see that, in this theory, persons communicate in order to co-construct knowledge and to maintain and promote mutual respect. Moral principles are, thus, cooperatively generated because validity is grounded in the structure of reciprocal relations.<br>

Abstract: Derrida and Foucault provide key starting points to understanding archives. They see archives as hegemonic, characterizing ways of thought, modes of colonization, and the control of citizens. However, they also make clear that archives can be read subversively. With patience, counter-readings allow the excavation of the voices (sometimes names) of subaltern and otherwise suppressed others from the archive. By reading along and across the archival grain, researchers can follow the development of ideas and processes across historical periods. Archives can be seen as orphanages, containing surrogates of performances. Archives (paper and digital) also provide access to the results of anthropological research in ways mandated by ethics codes, but these are subject to controversy. What sorts of consent and what sorts of anonymization should be provided? Archives run by the groups traditionally studied by anthropologists provide models of radical archives that are very different from those conceived of by traditional archivists.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

felicitous remarks on the subject of the exegetical method of Akiba: "Most potent and conse-
quential is Akiba's rule that every seemingly 'superfluous' text element of the Torah, such as
את... has a specific meaning.... As a result, Akiba became the foremost champion of
eisegesis,while other scholars tried to stay (somewhat) closer to the actual meaning of the text,
as did R. Yishmael who maintained דברה תורה כלשון בני אדם.... From the scientific point of view
Ishmael was right, but Akiba's point of view was more useful and mostly prevailed."<br>

Abstract: The major thesis developed in Sartre's L'imaginaire is that all imaginary acts can be subsumed under the heading of one "image family" and, therefore, that imagination as a whole can be theorized in terms of pictorial representation. Yet this theory fails to meet the objective of Sartre's study, to demonstrate that imaginary activity is not a derivative of perception but an attitude with a character and dignity of its own. The subsidiary account of imagination in terms of neutralization of belief has the advantage of not being constrained by the requirement that imaginary activity serve a purely reproductive function of bringing an absent "original" into a quasi presence and, thus, leaves room for free creativity and fiction. It also points to a concrete lived experience of alterity at the heart of subjective life where the subject stages its life as if it were the life of an other, putting pressure onto Sartre's contention that the cogito defines subjectivity.<br>

Abstract: The aim is to show how formations of discourse can be seen as the subject matter for the historian of religions, drawing on structuralist and hermeneutic approaches. Although these may differ on important theoretical and methodological issues, I find the way in which they correspond, namely by pointing to the topic of discourse as their field of investigation, even more important. In this article a discourse is understood as a framework of communication, and the focus is laid upon religious discourse as a special kind of authorization. In ancient Greece, for example, "authors" such as Homer and Orpheus were the authorities of two different discursive traditions. The analysis of discourse can present us with a view of how certain frames of communication were interacting by means of contest, and how, eventually, it was the very strategy of authorization that was contested. Hence, what has often been seen as a paradigmatic shift from mythos to logos could more fruitfully be viewed from a discursive angle than from a perspective of different mentalities. Discourse analysis, as presented in this article, is a way of coming to terms with the process of transformation by regarding dynamic properties of communication, that is, as interrelated strategies on connected levels of system and event.<br>

Abstract: L'histoire contrefactuelle — «que se serait-il passé si?» — connaît actuellement un certain engouement éditorial et a fait l'objet dans les pays anglophones d'un vigoureux débat il y a une dizaine d'années, qui s'est achevé sur un consensus prudent. Pourtant, loin de ces usages polémiques dont les raisons sont explorées ici, un examen plus serré suggère, comme l'avait déjà identifié Max Weber, qu'il s'agit aussi d'un mode plus ordinaire du raisonnement, notamment en sciences sociales. La question n'est donc pas de savoir s'il faut promouvoir ou rejeter cette démarche, mais plutôt, à partir d'une lecture interdisciplinaire, de détecter les enjeux, risques et propositions que recouvre son explicitation. Trois aspects sont analysés ici: le rapport histoire/ fiction, le poids du déterminisme et de la causalité, les implications politiques d'une attention aux futurs non advenus. À partir du constat des tensions que fait saillir l'examen contrefactuel, l'article reprend ensuite de manière détaillée la critique de divers usages courants, et propose d'autres manières de faire qui semblent plus pertinentes, certaines évidentes, d'autres expérimentales, dans le but d'enrichir la boîte à outils historienne. Favorisant, ainsi, la relecture des sources, le rejet de la téléologie, l'analyse de moments critiques, l'élaboration de conceptions plus fines et discontinues des temporalités, et la mise en œuvre d'exercices pédagogiques et ludiques, la démarche contrefactuelle permet surtout au chercheur d'appréhender la question essentielle, mais délicate, des possibles en histoire. Counterfactual history — "what would have happened if?" — is currently receiving keen editorial interest and was, roughly ten years ago in anglophone countries, the subject of vigorous debate, which concluded with a cautious consensus. Yet, far from any polemical uses, the reasons for which are explored here, closer examination suggests, as already identified by Max Weber, that it is also a more ordinary way~<br>

Abstract: Today, bioethical themes are no longer the exclusive patrimony of university classrooms. Everyone is talking about them; "secular" and "catholics" alike. Catholics are often accused of imposing a "confessional" point of view. This article wishes to clarify this point given its importance in themes regarding the life and death of man, such as: artificial fecundation, abortion, cloning, brain death, organ transplants, and euthanasia. The article is based on a philosophical reflection starting with anthropological considerations. The extensive number of themes does not allow taking all of them into consideration. Thus the article adheres to the following outline: 1. Establish the epistemological bases for a rational discourse based on universal premises, with particular reference to artificial fecundation and the nature of human sexuality. 2. Analize the "human nature" condition of the embryo, of the physically and mentally disabled, of the terminally ill, and their status as "human persons"; this discourse is founded on the ontological status of the human body. 3. Present the value of the human body as a psycho-biological unity, which constitutes man's substantial unity. 4. We call this psycho-biological unity "person": "corpore et anima unus"; an individual subject with a rational nature, with its own singularity and oneness. The person has an absolute value, therefore cloning, even for "therapeutic reasons", is contrary to its ontological status. 5. From the consideration that a "person is", while a "personality becomes", we can explain how the person develops and matures his biological and spiritual capacities, without incurring changes in his ontological status. 6. The psycho-biological unity of the human person (corpore et anima unus) is at the basis of death in man, a unique reality. In analysing "human death" we should avoid two reductions: a biological reduction which curtails death to physical-biological processes and events (medical diagnosis of brain death)~<br>

Abstract: Rosenzweig e Levinas pensano la Rivelazione di Dio nella storia richiamandosi su diversi aspetti, anche se con sottolineature specifiche. Per la tradizione ebraica il problema di Dio e della possibilità della sua rivelazione è di sapere come Egli agisca nei confronti dell'uomo. Per Rosenzweig, il riferimento alla vita vissuta apre la possibilità di un pensiero nuovo, dove il tempo diventa l'altro del soggetto. Allo stesso modo, per Levinas il soggetto e il suo potere richiamano, nell'incontro con l'altro, ad un Altro. Entrambi gli autori mettono quindi in risalto la centralità della chiamata dell'uomo all'obbedienza. Per Rosenzweig però, la Rivelazione di Dio è legata al comandamento dell'amore del prossimo, che è legato all'amore di Dio. Per Levinas invece, il rapporto con Dio si riduce al suo aver donato la legge agli uomini. Rosenzweig and Levinas reflect on the revelation of God in history drawing on different aspects of the question and offering different emphases. In both of these authors we recognize how it is central to Jewish tradition to reflect on the problem of God and on the possibility of his revelation by reflecting on the question of just how it is that he acts towards man. For Rosenzweig, a reference to life as lived opens the possibility of a new way of thinking where time becomes the 'other' that confronts the subject. Similarly, for Levinas the ability that the subject has to recall an encounter with the 'other' enables an openness to an encounter with the 'Other'. In each of these authors we witness a stress on man's call to obedience. However, for Rosenzweig, the revelation of God is linked to the commandment of love of one's neighbor, which is tied to God's love for us; for Levinas the relationship with God is reduced to his having given the law to men.<br>

Abstract: L'approche par les capabilités proposée par A. Sen a été considérée comme une révolution dans l'analyse du développement et, en particulier, de la pauvreté. Si elle a exercé une influence sur les indicateurs du développement, elle pose néanmoins la question de la conception sous-jacente du sujet. Cet article montre que la conception de la personne utilisée par Sen est insuffisante et qu'il pratique un individualisme très standard. Cette approche est d'autant plus problématique qu'elle n'est pas simplement compréhensive, mais aussi normative. En ne tenant pas compte de la fragilité de la personne, son analyse aboutit finalement à une faiblesse morale. The capability approach proposed by A. Sen constitutes a real change in the poverty analysis. It influenced considerably development indicators. However, the question who really is the subject behind this approach is at stake. In this paper we defend the idea that the conception of the person used by Sen is relatively standard. It is then problematic because his approach is not only comprehensive but also normative. His analyse finally conducts to a moral weakness. El enfoque de las capabilidades propuesto por A. Sen fue considerado como una revolución en el análisis del desarrollo y, en particular, en el de la pobreza. Si bien ejerció una influencia sobre los indicadores de desarrollo, plantea la cuestión de la concepción subyacente del sujeto. Este artículo muestra que la concepción de la persona utilizada por Sen es insuficiente y que practica un individualismo muy estándar. Este enfoque es aún más problemático dado que no es simplemente comprensivo sino también normativo. Al no considerar la fragilidad de la persona, su análisis desemboca finalmente en una debilidad moral.<br>

Abstract: Cette contribution s'intéresse à ce que peut signifier construire la paix dans des sociétés où des crimes de masse ont été commis. Elle souligne les difficultés spécifiques que posent ces situations au chercheur comme au praticien. Ils doivent s'efforcer d'une part de « comprendre » comment de tels massacres ont pu être commis, par-delà bon nombre d'idées reçues en la matière et, d'autre part, d'identifier les ressources à partir desquelles la paix pourra être construite dans la société considérée. Pour ce faire, il leur faudra plonger au cœur de situations hautement paradoxales, une aventure pour laquelle la première partie de l'article avance plusieurs propositions méthodologiques. This contribution is concerned with what it may mean to « construct » peace, in societies that have been subjected to mass crimes. It underlines the specific difficulties that researchers are confronted with in practical situations. On the one hand, they have to understand how such massacres could be committed beyond common beliefs on the subject; on the other, they have to identify resources from which peace may be built in the given society. In so doing, they have to delve deeply into highly paradoxical situations. Such is the adventure for which the first part of this article advances several methodological propositions.<br>

Abstract: This article critically revisits the Foucauldian perspective on modernity by exploring the constitutive importance of limits of transparency in relations of power and knowledge. It differentiates between Foucault's Panopticon as a model for modernity, which posits a total visibility of subject under modern gaze, and what I call cybernetic ways of knowing that posit the 'black box' of the inner self that is blocked from visibility. The case in point is a comparative study of two anthropologies — two groups of anthropological cadres — the American anthropologists who in the 1940s were involved in emerging Soviet studies, and Soviet anthropologists of the 1920s and 1930s who took part in Soviet reforms. The article draws attention to similarities in their perspective of images and notions of the enemy: the 'enemy of the people' within Soviet society and the Soviet society as the West's Cold War enemy. In doing so, the aim of this article is to develop an ethnographic perspective on state socialism that does not depend on a foundational dualist distinction between 'Soviet' and 'Western' or 'socialist' and 'capitalist' modernity as a starting point.<br>

Abstract: The Anglo-American discipline of International Relations defends its main principles and resists with an almost religious fervor any change to them, although the explanation of world affairs has been eluding it since its inception. The article attempts to draw up possibly the first historiography of the IR scholarship about religion in world affairs since the 90s, showing the heightened interest in the subject from most other social sciences and humanities. The article proposes the use of the term 'International Political Theology' to bridge the multiple literatures as well as to underscore the theological commitment of the IR discipline to its basic creeds and dogmas.<br>

Abstract: Tolerance is a concept fundamental to the order of a pluralistic society. The concept, however, contains within it various dimensions and is therefore subject to misunderstanding (I). This article will first examine the ways in which tolerance as a social behavioural virtue differs from the duty of neutrality required of the public authorities (II). Furthermore, it will discuss whether and to what extend the public authorities are authorised to educate society in tolerance (III). Finally, a distinction will be drawn between the expectation of tolerance and the more far-reaching principle of recognition (IV).<br>

Abstract: Although Hannah Arendt distinguishes three human activities from each other in Human Condition — labor, work and action — they are supposed not to be three different types of human activities but to be three different aspects of human activity. Assuming this to be the case, this paper demonstrates that social theory has not enough taken action in the sense of Arendt into account, even modern scholars such as Bourdieu, but it has continued to remain almost always on the level of work because of its concept of time. The second question is what consequence social theory may draw, if this aspect of human activity is recognized as essential and its concept of time changed. One answer proposed by the author is the sociology of forgiveness even though it has not been treated as a subject for modern sociology.<br>

Author(s): Schmitz Heinz-Gerd<br>
Abstract: Discussing some aspects of Carl Schmitt's, Chantal Mouffe's, Paul Ricœur's, and Jacques Rancière's political theories the paper tries to determine the proper subject of political and social philosophy. To that end the author constructs two terminological oppositions: ‚the social‘ versus 'the society', 'the political' versus 'politics'. These four nouns form a terminological square which marks the social and the political difference. The social appears when underprivileged people demand a redistribution of wealth and influence, i.e. a reconstruction of a given society. The political emerges when the hidden normative framework of politics comes into vie. Confronting the social and the political difference in this way makes it possible to determine: politics are the matter of the political sciences, the difference between politics and the political, conversely, is the theme of political philosophy; society is the subject of sociology, the difference between the social and any form of society, however, is the issue of social philosophy.<br>

Author(s): Sabete Wagdi<br>
Abstract: This article aims at explaining, on the one hand, the inadequacy of the formalist positivist method in answering the essential questions of constitutional Law, such as the validity of the constitutional norm, the sovereignty of the people which comes before the original constitutional act and the effects of a theory of values on the limitation of the revision power. On the other hand, it proposes an onto-axiological approach, which refers to the Philosophy of Law. A relevant methodology of constitutional science of Liberty helps the specialists to follow the progress of knowledge. It puts forward means for approaching the subject matter of science (the norm), the constitutional environment and the theoretical basis of the norm. Following this proposed method would help not only in describing the norms but also in checking their validity, their justification and their imperfection when compared with their aims. These thought processes are a never ending search, that is to say a characteristic of science itself.<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i23730893<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Scuccimarra Luca<br>
Abstract: Moving from Koselleck's most recent essays on Historik, the author explores the role played by historiography in the constitution of historicity as a peculiar experiential dimension of human existence. The essay focuses on the complex link between difference and repetition which, according to Koselleck's theory of experience, constitutes a "specific historical temporality" and its inner articulation. Actually, it is by exploring the "formal temporal structures" which constitute the horizon of historical intelligibility that Koselleck brings to light the decisive role that the point of view of historiography has for the constitution of man as the subject of historical knowledge and action. It is difficult to ignore the importance of this theory of historical temporalization in an age in which the End of History rhetoric tends to transform itself in a sort of media gospel.<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the theoretical and methodological debates concerning the experience and consequences of upward social mobility between generations. The methods employed by researchers working on this subject are diverse, and the results they arrive at are sometimes contradictory. This article proposes, firstly, to give an overview of the different traditions of studying the experience of social mobility in order to identify the conditions for potential "cumulative" knowledge. In a second step, we argue that it is mainly through a study of the narratives of mobility that one can, simultaneously and comprehensively, grasp the ambivalence and multiplicity of effects that produce upward social mobility. Cet article revient sur les débats théoriques et méthodologiques sur l'expérience et les conséquences de la mobilité sociale ascendante intergénérationnelle. Les méthodes mobilisées par les chercheurs travaillant sur ce sujet sont multiples, et les résultats auxquels ils parviennent parfois contradictoires. Cet article se propose donc, dans un premier temps, de donner une vue d'ensemble des différentes traditions d'étude de l'expérience de la mobilité sociale afin de cerner les conditions d'une potentielle «cumulativité» des savoirs qu'elles produisent. Dans un second temps, nous défendons l'idée que c'est principalement à travers une étude du discours des personnes en mobilité que l'on peut, dans un même temps et dans un même élan, saisir l'ambivalence et la multiplicité des effets que produit la mobilité sociale ascendante.<br>

Abstract: Albert Camus's interrogation of the ethical and spiritual vacuity of the twentieth century convinced him that authentic political existence requires a vision that embraces while transcending the human condition. He found his ethical model in art. The work of the artist can be analogous to that of the just political actor. The principal components of ethical political being are all present in Camus's aesthetics: a vision of life in human community (lucidity), a grounded sense of justice subject to the limitations of human existence (beauty), a need to redress the defects of political reality (the urge to create), and an understanding that any structural solution is of necessity temporary (the need to rearticulate the initial vision). Camus's vision requires him to reject our positive political categories in the name of creative, grounded human being.<br>

Abstract: Lo studio della funzione e del significato dei nomi propri nelle opere letterarie è già da tempo al centro degli interessi della critica internazionale, ma in Italia esso si è accresciuto in maniera determinante soltanto durante gli anni '90. Si propone qui dunque una rassegna bibliografica sugli orientamenti della critica italiana intorno al tema in questione, guardando alle tendenze attuali della ricerca, ai numerosi campi di applicazione e alle prospettive future, e mostrando il contributo riginarle apportato dall'Italia agli studi di Onomastica letteraria. The study of function and meaning of proper names utilized in works of fiction has already been at the centre of international critical interests for many years, but increased considerely in Italy only during the 1990's. Thus, we provide here a bibliographical survey of the critical Italian approach to this subject, looking at the present trends of research, at several fields of application and future perspectives, and showing innovative Italian contribution to Literary Onomastics studies.<br>

Abstract: Unsere Literaturübersicht diskutiert die Frage, ob und inwieweit eine reife Liebesfähigkeit Erwachsener von entsprechenden Früherfahrungen abhängt bzw. inwieweit Liebe und Partnerschaft eine Korrektur ungünstiger emotionaler Erfahrungen der frühen Kindheit ermöglichen. Bestimmte Partnerschaftsstörungen stehen zu konkreten familiären Gegebenheiten der ersten Lebensjahre in keinem zwingenden Bezug. Sind Partnerschaftsstörungen nach traditioneller psychoanalytischer Auffassung als Folge eines ungelösten infantilen Konfliktes anzusehen, so greifen neuere Ansätze angesichts des weitgehenden Fehlens einer psychoanalytischen Interaktionstheorie bei der Beschreibung und Erklärung interpersoneller Phänomene zunehmend auf systemische Ansätze zurück. Äußerungen psychoanalytischer Autoren zur Entwicklung der Liebesfähigkeit reflektieren im historischen Überblick wesentliche Veränderungen der Theoriebildung. Neuere empirische Arbeiten weisen auf Korrektur- und Kompensationsmöglichkeiten ungünstiger Früherfahrungen von mittlerem Schweregrad hin. Dafür aber dürfte die warme und bedürfnisgerechte Zuwendung durch eine oder mehrere feste Bezugspersonen (möglichst durch die liebevoll und partnerschaftlich aufeinander bezogenen Eltern) in den ersten Lebensjahren eine grundlegende Voraussetzung erwachsener Liebes- und Partnerschaftsfähigkeit sein. In this survey of literature on the subject, we discuss the question of whether or not and if so to what extent a mature, adult ability to love depends on relevant early experience, or whether it functions as a corrective to unfavorable emotional experience in early childhood. There is no compelling connection between certain disturbances of partner relations and concrete family circumstances in the first years of life. Such disturbances are regarded by traditional psychoanalysis as the result of an unresolved infantile conflict; however, since there is no psychoanalytical interaction theory for the description and explanation of interpersonal~<br>

Abstract: Bynum, p. 133: "Moreover, in medieval physiological theories — however confused they may
be on the subject — the female in some sense provides the matter of the foetus, the male the life or
spirit. Medieval theologians sometimes stressed that, as Eve came from the matter of Adam, so
Christ came from the matter of Mary." Si senta Lochrie, pp. 117-118: "The centrality of the first
two kinds of imitatio Christi, particularly to female spirituality, is further complicated by the
medieval medical and theological alignment of the female with flesh, and the male with the spirit.
Both Galenic and Aristotelian theories of conception consider the woman's contribution to the
fetus to be a material one, that is, the woman provides the matter of flesh to the developing human
being. This medieval conception theory carries important theological implications for the Virgin
Mary's role in the incarnation of Christ and ultimately for imitatio Christi. The Virgin's humanity is
celebrated for providing Christ with sinless flesh — the materia redeemed from the Fall — In
Hildegard of Bingen's idea of her as tunica humanitatis, the 'clothing of humanity' that Christ puts
on."<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h~<br>

Abstract: In this introduction to HSR Supplement 26, the findings of the journal Historical Social Research from 2004 to 2014 are presented. With the journal being in its 40th year of existence, one could split the journal's history into three phases: First, the constitutional period (1976-1988), then, second, the establishing period (1988-2000). The third period consists of the last 10-14 years. It may be characterized by processes of focusing, digitalization and internationalization, and it is this third period which is the subject of this article. In a short overview, some developments with respect to the contents are highlighted. Afterward, some structural changes in HSR publication formats and journal management are given. Finally, the article presents some bibliometric analyses, particularly concerning download and citation statistics.<br>

Abstract: The article calls attention to the role and function of exemplary "models", defined as evoking signs that move people to reflect their own values and orientations. It was Albert Bandura who first showed that human learning generally has the form of learning from models. Recent insights of neuroscience confirm and explain Bandura's theories: The human brain as a neuronal network estimates things according to similarities of their entire structure. Thus it can be called a "machine estimating structural connections". These insights can inspire moral theology: A concrete model can show the wide range of possibilities christian faith can open to believers. Christian tradition has always maintained this idea by understanding christian life as imitatio Christi. However, "imitatio" must be understood as the free and creative act of an autonomous subject.<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to examine the development of the notion of "The Other" and to trace the implications of its effect on the dialoguic Philosophy. In "I and Thou" this category was not developed, at best it was suggested only vaguely, for in this text Buber does not carry out any ontological explication of this category. But such an explication was necessary and was later formulated gradualy by Buber. The clearer the ontological explication, the sharper the category of "the Other" is delineated. It is this category which establishes the I-Thou relationship. This development is expressed in Buber's writings with great tension, and we analyze it in detail, for the category of "the Other" and the central position which it occupies undermine the significance of the I-Thou relationship as it is presented in the book "I and Thou". Together with an acceptance of the primacy of "the Other" in this relationship, we must also assert the primacy of the "I" as the subject of reflective action, of the recognition of the other in his otherness. In this situation it is not the relationship which comes first but the detachment and the aloneness which exist between the I and Thou. We now have to rewise the notion of the dialogue from that purety of an event without content to that of an action of mutual assertion between I and the Other, where each one asserts the other in his otherness, where at the same time each is conscious of being asserted by the Other.<br>

Abstract: Le terme de Monarchomaque renvoie à cinq critères: le rejet de la tyrannie, la double alliance, la souveraineté du peuple, l'obéissance conditionnelle, enfin le droit de résistance armée. A partir de là, il est possible d'établir un corpus monarchomaque composé de dix textes. Ce corpus permet de conduire une étude des liens entre théorie politique et représentation du temps. Celle-ci porte à la fois sur les origines de la monarchie et sur les traces du passé dans le présent (Etats). The monarchomach theory is based on five criteria: the rejection of tyranny, the mutual alliance, the sovereignty of the people, limited obedience, and finally the right to armed resistance. Such a definition leads to the establishment of a corpus of ten monarchomach treatises. This corpus allows us to study the links between political theory and the representation of time. This latter subject involves both the origins of the monarchy and the traces of the past in the present (the Estates). Der Begriff von «Monarchomaque» verweist auf fünf Kriterien: die Ablehnung der Tyrannei, die verdoppelte Allianz, die Souveränität des Volkes, der bedingte Gehorsam, schließlich das Recht bewaffneten Widerstandes. Von daher ist es möglich, ein aus zehn Texten zusammengesetztes «monarchomaque» Corpus aufzustellen. Dieser Bestand erlaubt, eine Studie der Verbindungen zwischen politischer Theorie und Darstellung der Zeit zu führen. Sie bezieht sich sowohl auf die Ursprünge der Monarchie als auch auf die Spuren der Vergangenheit in der Gegenwart (Staaten).<br>

Abstract: L'apport de l'œuvre de Paul Ricœur est fondamental pour la pratique historienne d'aujourd'hui. Depuis la fin du XIXe siècle, les historiens s'étaient dotés, en se professionnalisant, d'une méthode. Grâce à Paul Ricœur, ils peuvent désormais accéder à une dimension épistémologqiue et mieux comprendre les catégories qui leur sont familières comme celle de temps, de vérité, de causalité ou de sujet. Cet article entend montrer en quoi notamment trois thématiques classiques de l'historien que sont l'événement, la mémoire et la biographie trouvent un éclairage particulièrement enrichissant chez Paul Ricœur et s'en trouvent très sensiblement renouvelées. Paul Ricœur's work has made a fundamental contribution to the contemporary practice of history. Since the end of the 19th century historians had become more professional and had defined an historical method. Thanks to Paul Ricœur, they are now able to achieve an epistemological dimension and to understand better familiar categories such as time, truth, causality or subject. This article seeks to show how three classic historical themes in particular, namely event, memory and biography, are illuminated in a singularly enriching fashion in the work of Paul Ricœur and are very perceptibly renewed by him. Auch für die heutige Geschichtswissenschaft erweist sich Paul Ricœurs philosophisches Œuvre als grundlegend. Im Zuge ihres Professionalisierungsprozesses hatte die historische Zunft gegen Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts nach einer einheitlichen Methode gestrebt. Über das Werk Paul Ricœurs findet sie nun Zugang zur wissenschaftstheoretischen Dimension. Ziel des Aufsatzes ist es, aufzuzeigen, wie drei für den Historiker entscheidende Fragen – nämlich die des Ereignisses, des Gedächtnisses und der Biographie – bei Ricœur einer neuen Behandlung unterzogen wurden.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo contém uma leitura em contraponto: a noção de situação em Simone de Beauvoir e a de intersecções em Donna Haraway expressariam supostos relacionais; mulher estaria para Beauvoir como ciborgue está para Haraway; Beauvoir distingue a situação das mulheres, dos judeus e dos negros, considerando a relação entre situações e consciências históricas e|ou biológicas. A biologia aparece em situação como construção mítica de uma identidade a ser ultrapassada para a constituição do sujeito; em Haraway, o ciborgue seria uma narrativa sobre como o biológico e a realidade social de raça e gênero situam-se em uma rede de interações, informação e semiologia. Relação e constituição do "objeto", temas caros à teoria social, seriam instituídos em (e pela) alteridade sem a dicotomia dura entre realidade e ficção, natureza e cultura, literatura e ciência. In this article I will present a counterpoint between notions of 'situation' by Simone de Beauvoir and 'intersections' by Donna Haraway, which express ideas of relation. I will argue that woman for Beauvoir is like cyborg for Haraway. Beauvoir distinguishes the situation of women, Jews and blacks by considering the relationship between situations and historical consciousness and | or biological weapons. For Beauvoir, the biology in situation appears as construction of a mythical identity to be overcome for the formation of the subject. Alternatively, Haraway uses the cyborg as a narrative of how the biological and social reality of race and gender are into a network of interactions, information and semiology. With this claiming for alterity inside the relation and constitution of the "object", both authors bring important challenges to two of the most important issues of social theory. Moreover, they do it without the hard dichotomy between reality and fiction, nature and culture, literature and science.<br>

Abstract: The concept Deckerinnerung (en. screen-memory), which appeared in Freud's work in 1899, points towards the important epistemological question about the possibility of adequation or coincidence (Deckung) between past experience and the current act that is being presentified. This can take the form of remembering as such or be conceived as fantasy. In order to clarify the differences between fantasy and memory, or rather their interconnection in the Deckerinnerung, they need to be looked at phenomenologically, and in doing so various aspects should be analysed, such as: the character of positional and neutralised acts of presentification; the interference of conscious attention and the phenomenon of inhibition in the act of presentification; the state of memories in the unconscious and the possibilities of their association between themselves or modification by other current acts. While Freud introduces the subject without further analysing it, Husserl's theories offer a valuable contribution here. In this context, there is first a need to outline the way in which Husserl's investigations into memory come close to Freud's discourse, in the sense that they lead to a "Phenomenology of the Unconscious" (Hua XI; Mat. VIII).<br>

Article Title: NARRATIVE UNITY AS A CONDITION OF PERSONHOOD<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>
Issue: i24439507<br>
Date: 10 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): CHRISTMAN JOHN<br>
Abstract: In this article I critically discuss a claim made by several writers in philosophy and the social sciences that for an individual to count as a person, a single personality, or the subject of a life, the experiences of the subject in question must take a narrative form. I argue that narrativity is a misleading and, in some ways of understanding it, implausible condition of what it is that adds unity to personhood and personality. I pursue this critique by considering canonical accounts of narrativity in philosophy and literary studies. I consider those connections between events that must hold for the sequence to be considered a narrative: causal, teleological, and thematic connections. I argue that for each of these, the condition that experiential sequences (for a given subject) must have this structure is empty: any life sequence that is reflected upon in an interpretive spirit can meet it. What the condition of narrativity amounts to, then, is the more basic requirement that the person must be able to look upon the factors and events of her life with a certain interpretive reflection, whether or not those factors and events have any particular narrative unity in a traditional sense.<br>

Abstract: The subject of the presented research is the analysis of relations between Post-Critical Belief and Sense of Coherence in women and men in early, middle, and late adulthood. Six hundred and thirty-six individuals participated in the research, 332 women and 304 men, at the age of 18–79 years. We applied the Post-Critical Belief scale by Hutsebaut (J Empir Theol 9:48–66, 1996) and the Sense of Coherence scale (SOC-29) by Antonovsky (Soc Sci Med 36:725–733, 1993). The results suggest that the salutogenic function of religiosity is related to age and gender—in women, it is most strongly marked in late, and in men, in middle adulthood<br>

Abstract: Les années 1960 apparaissent comme un moment de profonde remise en question du système scolaire (particulièrement du modèle secondaire), tant du fait des réformes initiées par les premiers gouvernements de la Cinquième République que de la dynamique des débats publics de cette décennie, couronnée par le colloque d'Amiens, en mars 1968. Or l'étude systématique du discours tenu dans la presse sur ce sujet montre que l'affichage zélé d'un consensus apparent masque de profondes incertitudes quant au modèle scolaire qu'il faudrait inventer en remplacement du système présenté comme unanimement condamné. On constate également que ce large accord ignore l'importance des pesanteurs conservatrices, qui, même marginalisées, peuvent facilement alimenter des doutes, qui ne manqueront pas de s'exprimer si une situation conflictuelle vient à se présenter. The 1960's appear as a moment when real doubts concerning the French School system (particularly the traditional Secondary model) came to light, partly because of the reforms initiated by the first governments of the Fifth Republic but also as a result of the state of the discussions arising over that decade, and coming to a head at the colloquium held in Amiens in March 1968. However, the systematic study of the discourse held in the newspapers about this subject reveals that the zealous show of an apparent consensus masked deep uncertainties relating to the school model which needed to be invented to replace the widely condemned system. We also notice that this broad agreement ignored the importance of conservative obstacles which, even when marginalised, could easily fuel doubts, and would certainly be expressed as soon as a conflictual situation arose.<br>

Publisher: University of Tulsa<br>
Issue: i24598607<br>
Date: 7 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Bruns Gerald L.<br>
Abstract: The basic unit of Joyce's fiction is, arguably, the encounter, a reminder of the Dubliners story of that name. This essay explores the many occasions of self-encounter, as when Joyce's characters see themselves in mirrors, in the eyes of others, or in the guise of someone other than they are or appear to be: when Gerty MacDowell projects her "Lady Bountiful" self onto Bloom's erotic gaze, for instance. The regulating idea here (as in Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception) is that we perceive ourselves through our bodies, but this perception is not an empirical mirror-image; it is an image mediated (and thus transformed) by an array of intentions, memories, desires, and ongoing experiences of ourselves and others, including our experiences of how others see us (something to which Stephen is particularly subject). Joyce's mirror-experiences range from ironic unmasking—"The Dead"—to phantasmagorias—the "Circe" episode of Ulysses, where no image is unreal, and every misnomer (like "Henry Flower") has its moment of truth.<br>

Abstract: This was a leading subject in my "Mapping Bhakti in the Sanskrit Epics,'
presented at the 214th meeting of the American Oriental Society at San Diego,
March 2004. Here I draw on an old interest: see Hiltebeitel, Ritual of Battle,
254-66; "Brothers, Friends, and Charioteers: Parallel Episodes in the Irish and
Indian Epics," ed. Edgar C. Polom, Homage to Georges Dumézil: Journal of Indo-
European Studies Monograph, No. 3 (1982): 85-112; "The Two Krsnas on One
Chariot: Upanisadic Imagery and Epic Mythology," History of Religions 24
(1984): 1-26. As I hope to show in Mapping, friendship relates to a whole cluster
of themes that can be tied together in and around Kama, while friendship in rela-
tion to enmity is the epic ground of dvesa bhakti, "devotion by hatred," for which
the above-mentioned Sisupäla - whom Fitzgerald would like to excise from the
Mbh - is the most prominent Mbh example and, like Karna and Arjuna, a son of
one of Krsna's paternal aunts; see Georges Dumézil, Mythe et épopée, 2: Types

Publisher: Islamic Research Institute<br>
Issue: i24666682<br>
Date: 7 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): AKRAM MUHAMMAD<br>
Abstract: This paper discusses the issue of the relationship between theology and religious studies, drawing on certain principles of Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutical theory. Leaving aside differences between Gadamer and his critics, it is argued that his rehabilitation of prejudice, authority and tradition as well as his notions of the fusion of horizons and intersubjective dialogue put into question the utility of dichotomous categories like subjective-objective, normative-descriptive, and insider-outsider in approaches to religion. It is suggested, therefore, that a clearer distinction between theology and religious studies can be established in terms of the subject matter of these disciplines rather than on the basis of their methodological principles. However, as both disciplines venture to understand at least some overlapping dimensions of religious phenomena which make up their common subject matter, to this extent, they can be viewed as dialogical partners and as providing different but complementary perspectives on religion.<br>

Abstract: See Ricoeur in the essay mentioned in note 33 on the transition from 'sub-
ject' to 'structure' in Althusser's works: 'Zugleich wird damit die Wachsamkeit
gegenüber Verifizierung und Falsifizierung geschwàcht' (p. 208). Openness on this
point cannot, in my opinion, be expected until followers of Althusser show a
readiness to abandon the disastrous notion that the appealing, interpellating
^uthority which demands accountibility can be no other than Ideology. See for
instance Althusser, 'Ideologie en ideologische staatsapparaten' ('Ideology and
ideological state apparatuses'), in Te elfder ure (At the eleventh hour), 24 (1978,
no. 1), pp. 99f: 'the individual is addressed as a (free) subject, so that it subjects
itself in freedom to the commandments of the Subject' (100), '... the ideology
brings about simultaneously (1) the addressing of the 'individuals' as subjects; (2)
their subjection to the Subject' (99).<br>

Abstract: In Reformational philosophy the term 'structure' can be used in two different senses: It could
refer to the factual or subject-side of reality and is then used in the sense of the structure of
reality. It could also refer to the law-side of reality, i.e. the structural laws governing and
conditioning the regularities perceived in phenomena. Then it is understood in the sense of the
structure for reality. When the term 'structure mapping' is used in this article it refers primarily
to the latter sense of the term, although it is conceded that analysis of the structures for reality
are inextricably bound to the analysis of the structures of reality.<br>

Abstract: I take distance here from the language used by K.-O. Apel. Apel speaks of a 'transcenden-
tal-hermeneutical synthesis' which would be proper to the pre-theoretical constitution of
the Lebenstaeli (Heidegger, Wittgenstein) and which would found the kantian synthesis of
apperception. See Apel, Transformation der Philosophie, vol. 1, pp. 246, 308.1 reject however
the notion of pre-theoretical 'synthesis' and prefer the notion of 'systasis', i.e., the oneness
(één-zijri) of man and world, subject and object, in pre-scientific experience. Transcendental
hermeneutical reflection can for the rest not be called pre-scientific, because and insofar as
it is explicitly engaged in tracing man's transcendental openness.<br>

Abstract: The phrase 'objectly taking place' means 'that which is the object of the history-
keeping subject's attention'. The events which the history-keeper notes, like the art object
which an art critic examines, make the subject dépendent upon them, although it is surely
possible for the inquiring subject as would-be history-keeper or art critic, in the name of
co-dependence, to make the object over into its own subjective image. We might call such
a mistake the Narcissistic fallacy.<br>

Author(s): Klapwijk Jacob<br>
Abstract: Ernst Troeltsch distinguished between naive, apologetic and evolutionistic absoluteness.
From the original spontaneity of 'naive absoluteness' and its artificial (partly super-
naturalistic, partly rationalistic) defence as 'apologetic absoluteness' (in the Middle Ages and
in the Enlightenment, respectively) there came forth in Hegel the idea of 'evolutionistic
absoluteness' — an ingenious but untenable attempt to reconcile the solid apologetic
conception of absoluteness of that day with the dynamics of history by presenting it as the
outcome and terminus of historical progression. See Troeltsch, Die Absolutheit des Christen-
tums, 87ff. Cf. J. Klapwijk, Tussen historisme en relativisme, 222-29. At present the belief in
progress and thus also the mix of it with the idea of absoluteness is no longer a subject of
discussion.<br>

Abstract: One could ask whether the soul's being subject to death does not imply an element of
discontinuity as well. Cooper stresses the continued, personal existence of the soul. The Bible
however speaks of death as a mortification of sin and that, surely, implies a profound change.
In death personal identity remains, 1 stay my-self, yet become wholly different from what I was
prior to my death.<br>

Abstract: Sabemos cómo debemos comer pero no comemos como debemos. Esta paradoja del comensal actual es objeto de debate entre sociólogos, nutricionistas y responsables de salud. Las dificultades para afrontarla sugieren ensayar aproximaciones diferentes a las habituales. Pensar el comer desde los imaginarios colectivos que pueden entrar en colisión quizá arroje nueva luz sobre dicha paradoja. Aquí ensayamos ese acercamiento a partir de cuatro textos canónicos de la literatura utópica en los albores de la revolución industrial. Su análisis revela un conflicto de larga duración entre dos modos de imaginar la comida ideal: el de las utopías modernas e ilustradas, que comparten los expertos en nutrición, y el de las utopías populares, donde una cierta racionalidad social, basada en los hábitos y tradiciones culinarias, se opone a una alimentación racional. We know how we should eat but we don't eat as we should. This paradox of the modern eater has long been the subject of debate amongst sociologists, nutritionists and healthcare workers. The difficulties faced when dealing with this paradox suggest the need for new approaches. By considering food from the potentially conflictive social imageries, it may be possible to shed some light on this paradox. In this work, we have approached this issue from the perspective of four canonical texts of utopian literature that were created at the dawn of the industrial revolution. Our analysis reveals a long-lasting conflict between two views of the ideal diet: that of modern and enlightened utopias, which is shared by nutrition experts, and that of the "popular" utopias, in which social rationality, based on culinary habits and traditions, opposed a rational approach to eating.<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the conduct and evaluation of interpretive research in information systems. While the conventions for evaluating information systems case studies conducted according to the natural science model of social science are now widely accepted, this is not the case for interpretive field studies. A set of principles for the conduct and evaluation of interpretive field research in information systems is proposed, along with their philosophical rationale. The usefulness of the principles is illustrated by evaluating three published interpretive field studies drawn from the IS research literature. The intention of the paper is to further reflection and debate on the important subject of grounding interpretive research methodology.<br>

Author(s): Meiyi Prasenjit<br>
Abstract: While there is much writing on the nation as the subject of linear history, considerably less attention has been paid to the dimension of the nation as the always identifiable, unchanging subject of history. This unchanging subject is necessitated by the ascendancy of the conception of linear time in capitalism in which change is viewed not only as accelerating, but can no longer be framed by an ultimate source of meaning such as God. Ostensibly, linear history is the falling of events into the "river of time," but national history also posits a continuous subject to gather these changes. Such a subject is recognizable only by the spiritual qualities of authenticity, purity, and sacrality. The nation-state and nationalists stake their claim to sovereign authority, in part, as custodians of this authenticity. A range of figures, human and non-human, come to symbolize a regime of authenticity manipulable to some extent by nationalists and state-builders. This essay focuses on the instance of women in early twentieth-century China. Nationalists and cultural essentialists tended to depict women as embodying the eternal Chinese civilizational virtues of self-sacrifice and loyalty and to elevate them as national exemplars. The essay also examines cases of how women themselves may have perceived this role as exemplars and concludes that while there was considerable subversion in their enunciation of this role (to their advantage), there was sufficient reference to the prescriptive code of authenticity in their self-formation to sustain the regime of authenticity.

Author(s): Radford Luis<br>
Abstract: Meaning is one of the recent terms which have gained great currency in mathematics education. It is generally used as a correlate of individuals' intentions and considered a central element in contemporary accounts of knowledge formation. One important question that arises in this context is the following: if, in one way or another, knowledge rests on the intrinsically subjective intentions and deeds of the individual, how can the objectivity of conceptual mathematical entities be guaranteed? In the first part of this paper, both Peirce's and Husserl's theories of meaning are discussed in light of the aforementioned question. I examine their attempts to reconcile the subjective dimension of knowing with the alleged transcendental nature of mathematical objects. I argue that transcendentalism, either in Peirce's or Husserl's theory of meaning, leads to an irresolvable tension between subject and object. In the final part of the article, I sketch a notion of meaning and conceptual objects based on a semiotic-cultural approach to cognition and knowledge which gives up transcendentalism and instead conveys the notion of contextual objectivity.<br>

Abstract: Kearney thus summarizes Kant's "Copernican Revolution": "Being would henceforth
be conceived not as the transcendent origin of meaning, but as a representation of the human
subject—or, more precisely, as a production of the human imagination. This is what Kant had
in mind when he affirmed that 'being is not a real predicate . . . but only the positing of a
thing'" (Wake 157-58<br>

Publisher: Society for Historical Archaeology<br>
Issue: i25616488<br>
Date: 1 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): McCarthy John P.<br>
Abstract: Much archaeological scholarship on consumption has approached its subject matter as the means to an end—e.g., as a way of studying socioeconomic status—rather than as a proper object of study in its own right. The "consumer choice" school, and, more recently, advocates of consumer behavior studies, have supported approaches that emphasize quantitative methods, at the same time downplaying the "qualitative" or symbolic aspects of consumption. A considerable body of literature on the symbolic aspects of consumption exists both in historical archaeology and other fields. The intention of this essay is to draw together this recent literature on consumption and combine it into a single approach that emphasizes shopping as the meaningful action at the very heart of consumption. With the emphasis on agency, this approach presents shopping as that crucial moment of transformation where identity, intention, and symbol combine in the decision to purchase, to own, an object.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines how activists in rural southern India have sought to reshape the field of political communication by encouraging lower-caste women to submit written, signed petitions to district-level government offices, and so represent themselves to the state. I argue that contradictions between democratic recognition and the will to development that inhere to the political structure of contemporary governance in rural India correspond to tensions within the semiotic structure of signature itself, between constative representation and performative creation. Governmentality and the forms of communication that it requires often rest on the notion that written self-representation constitutes an act of political agency. But the limits of a governmental communicative reason that would conflate written subject and agent become especially clear in postcolonial contexts where the construction of those citizens that would be represented is in fact a product of the very act of representation. It is the narrative of development-as-pedagogy that holds out the promise of a future alignment of communicative frameworks, technologies, and participant roles, allowing for the transparent self-representation of an already-constituted citizen. By tracking the ambivalent experience of one group of women in particular, this account focuses on how the logic of signature as self-representation has served to recontextualize the marginality of petitioners as something within the state's broader field of power.<br>

Article Title: Photography after the Photograph: Event, Archive, and the Non-Symbolic<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i25650854<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Roberts John<br>
Abstract: This article looks at the continuing social crisis of documentary image culture, in the light of both the political demise of a left-bloc of social forces, which historically has underwritten its critical ideals from the 1920s to the late 1980s, and the continued expansion of the 'non-symbolic' forces (Vilém Flusser) of mass culture — the de-politicization of the public sphere through the circulation of a range of narrow and circumscribed (generic) images. In this I take seriously the notion that documentary photography is subject to an increasing 'lateness' in its effects (that is, in terms of its effective representation of the social world and of access to distribution). However, this sense of documentary photography as existing after-the-event does not mean we should mourn the loss or photography's active relationship to the 'event'. This is because the documentary ideal of the 1920s and 1930s had no privileged access to 'photographic truth', just as it was in no greater position of autonomy within the political economy of photography than it is now. Rather, what distinguished documentary photography during its modernist heyday was a partisan political confidence in its ideals and aims. It is this that is missing today. Thus, once we look at the history of documentary practice as a set of subordinate practices culturally, we can than avoid all the historicist pitfalls of assuming this is the 'worst of all times' and begin to rethink the political and theoretical parameters of documentary practice. As such, this article addresses why, in this present period, we need an adequate politics of 'lateness'.<br>

Abstract: Le mot « traduction » est à l'honneur: le philosophe Paul Ricœur l'érige en principe éthique, la « traductologie » se pose en nouvelle discipline littéraire et un courant de la sociologie des sciences le prend pour paradigme. Au-delà de ce dernier usage analogique, n'y a-t-il pas place pour une sociologie de la traduction qui ne soit pas seulement une sociographie des traducteurs amateurs ou professionnels, ni même une annexe fonctionnelle de la théorie des champs culturels et de leurs échanges inégaux? L'événement éditorial que constitue une nouvelle traduction littéraire de la Bible offre ainsi au sociologue matière à associer ses dimensions linguistiques, institutionnelles et relationnelles pour déterminer une « configuration traductive » exemplaire de la rencontre équivoque entre mondes littéraires, médiatiques et religieux en contexte de modernité avancée. The word « translation » has pride of place at the present time: the philosopher Paul Ricœur sets it up as an ethical principle, « translation studies » become a new international subject and the sociology of sciences takes it up as paradigm. Beyond this last figurative use, the question is how can we draw up a sociology of translation apart from studies of professional sets and transnational cultural exchanges? The New Bible Translation, a recent literary event in the French-speaking world, gives matter for combining linguistic, institutional and relational points of view. This translation case as a sociological configuration accounts for this ambiguous meeting point — at the crossroads between literature, religion and publishing — in advanced modernity.<br>

Abstract: This article reflects on the question of the disappearance of the individual subject of experience in Beckett's writing, and its gradual replacement by an anonymous subject. After The Unnamable, the voice becomes increasingly ambiguous or plural. It can no longer be ascribed to any distinct individual. In the light of Paul Ricœur's analysis of narrative identity, I intend to show how Beckett's work gradually goes, through the notion of alterity, beyond the problematic of subjectivity. By suspending the question who, the Beckettian text appears to be more and more organized by a missing presence, and moves toward a gradual reinforcement of the notion of past.<br>

Abstract: I take up the question of political identity as the continuity of a community across time. In particular, I examine what it means to think of a political community as the subject of attribution across generations, that is, what is meant when it is made the bearer of responsibility for the past and a custodian of the future. In doing that, I focus on identity, memory, and responsibility and discuss that cluster of concepts using as an illustrative example the idea of constitutional patriotism and its relationship to the past.<br>

Abstract: How does international interaction shape states' patterns of thought, emotion, and action? This paper examines the processes by which motives and practices feed each other in reproducing historical structures. An artificial intelligence model defines state-subjects as cultures combining special meanings that produce causal attribution, state self-identification, emotions, and action motives. These special meanings are built from subjective cultural categories describing social acts and group character of the self and others. Anger, pride, fear, and relief motivate action. A collection of such subject-cultures may produce a pattern of actions that reiterates the cultures. The model discriminates between those combinations of elements in special meanings which reproduce subjects and historical structures, and those which do not. The meanings discovered in such reproduction analysis can be validated by discourse analysis.<br>

Abstract: Freud, 'The Uncanny', XVII, p. 220. There is, of course, a vast literature on Freud' s
concept of the uncanny, most of which is not concerned with the self-civilization relation
that is explored in this essay. Julia Kristeva, for example, examines the uncanny in the
context of the self-other relation. 'The uncanny strangeness', she writes, 'allows for
many variations: They all repeat the difficulty I have in situating myself with respect to
the other.' See Julia Kristeva, Strangers to Ourselves, trans. Leon S. Roudiez (New York,
1991), p. 187. While Kristeva's interpretation underscores the place of the uncanny in
human intercourse, Samuel Weber finds the uncanny important in forming a correct
theory of knowledge, one that does not hold to the Cartesian illusion of an objectivizing,
insulated and reliable cognition. 'Whereas for Descartes the essential condition for
attaining certitude was the subject's withdrawal from a world that in its alterity could no
longer be relied on, it is precisely the discovery that such withdrawal is a fata morgana,
an unsustainable construct that informs the misrecognition, that constitutes the uncanny. '
See Samuel Weber, The Legend of Freud (Stanford, CA, 2000), p. 20. For a political
interpretation of the concept, see Derrida's brief but illuminating discussion of the
uncanny element in Marxism, in Jacques Derrida, Specters of Marx (New York, 1994),
pp. 172-5. For a general discussion of Freud's theory of memory, see Richard Terdiman,
Present Past: Modernity and the Memory Crisis (Ithaca, NY, 1993).<br>

Abstract: This paper aims to stress the anthropological relevance of
         La vendetta barbaricina come ordinamento giuridico(1959), the most famous Antonio Pigliaru’s book, by showing some methodological affinities with Mauss’sEssai sur le don. The author maintains that, exactly as it was affirmed by Alain Caillé in this latter case, it is possible to single out a sort of “third paradigm” operating in Pigliaru’s analysis ofvendettain traditional Sardinia. To emphasize this feature of Pigliaru’s book also allows us to throw a fresh look at the lasting but often unprofitable debate concerning the most appropriate label – Law or Anthropology – for defining the subject of his most important work.<br>

Abstract: I focus on Nietzsche's architectural metaphor of self-construction in arguing for the claim that postmodern readings of Nietzsche misunderstand his various attacks on dogmatic philosophy as paving the way for acceptance of a self characterized by fundamental disunity. Nietzsche's attack on essentialist dogmatic metaphysics is a call to engage in a purposive self-creation under a unifying will, a will that possesses the strength to reinterpret history as a pathway to "the problem that we are". Nietzsche agrees with the postmodernists that unity is not a pre-given, however he would disavow their rejection of unity as a goal. Where the postmodernists celebrate "the death of the subject" Nietzsche rejects this valorization of disunity as a form of Nihilism and prescribes the creation of a genuine unified subjectivity to those few capable of such a goal. Postmodernists are nearer Nietzsche's idea of the Last Man than his idea of the Overman.<br>

A key conclusion is that Evans-Pritchard distinguishes among three aspects of the "systems" he describes: (1) logical possibilities immanent in all forms of action, (2) cultural or local idioms in terms of which action is formulated and expressed, and (3) conditions and patterns of action. With this framework he develops, through an examination of the way interests in cattle are translated into political practices, an analysis in which the central theoretical problem is the relationship of structure to human agency. Our reading raises questions about the utility of standard classifications of theoretical orientations in social and cultural anthropology, particularly of the category of structural-functionalism, of which The Nuer is taken to be a central text.<br>

Abstract: Temporal lobe epilepsy and certain personality disorders often result in experiences described as "religious." TLE research suggests a possible neurological basis for such experiences. Immediately the question arises about the authenticity of these experiences as religious. An experience is authentic if it furthers the authentic growth of the subject, regardless of what triggered it. So pathology may occasion authentic religious experiences, even as history exemplifies. For practical purposes, the further question about God in religious experience is secondary. The exception, miraculous occurrences, should not be granted without sufficient reason. This approach dissolves all conflict between science and faith.<br>

Author(s): Bulkley Kelly<br>
Abstract: The subject of dreams and spirituality has received a great deal of attention in recent years. It has not, however, been seriously examined by religious studies scholars; thus, our ability to explore the spiritual potentials of dreams has been left sadly undeveloped. This essay attempts to improve that understanding. The concept of "root metaphors" will be presented as a means of developing a sophisticated, critical understanding of dreams and spirituality. Three dreams in which root metaphors emerge to provide important spiritual meanings for the dreamer will be discussed. Some practical guidelines, oriented around the model of playing with dreams, will also be presented to help make the spiritual dimension of dreams more accessible to psychotherapists, pastoral counselors, and lay people.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i27646172<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Anderson Pamela Sue<br>
Abstract: I begin with the assumption that a philosophically significant tension exists today in feminist philosophy of religion between those subjects who seek to become divine and those who seek their identity in mutual recognition. My critical engagement with the ambiguous assertions of Luce Irigaray seeks to demonstrate, on the one hand, that a woman needs to recognize her own identity but, on the other hand, that each subject whether male or female must struggle in relation to the other in order to maintain realism about life and death. No one can avoid the recognition that we are each given life but each of us also dies. In addition, I raise a more general, philosophical problem for analytic philosophers who attempt to read Continental philosophy of religion: how should philosophers interpret deliberately ambiguous assertions? For example, what does Irigaray mean in asserting, 'Divinity is what we need to become free, autonomous, sovereign'? To find an answer, I turn to the distinctively French readings of the Hegelian struggle for recognition which have preoccupied Continental philosophers especially since the first half of the last century. I explore the struggle for mutual recognition between women and men who must face the reality of life and death in order to avoid the projection of their fear of mortality onto the other sex. This includes a critical look at Irigaray's account of subjectivity and divinity. I turn to the French philosopher Michèle Le Doeuff in order to shift the focus from divinity to intersubjectivity. I conclude that taking seriously the struggle for mutual recognition between subjects forces contemporary philosophers of religion to be realist in their living and dying. With this in mind, the lesson from the Continent for philosophy of religion is that we must not stop yearning for recognition. Indeed, we must even risk our autonomy/divinity in seeking to recognize intersubjectivity.<br>

Article Title: Vision and Voice: Phenomenology and Theology in the Work of Jean-Luc Marion<br>
Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i27646172<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
Abstract: The kind of phenomenology that can be useful to theology will be a hermeneutical phenomenology, one that takes us beyond the Cartesian/Husserlian ideal of presuppositionless intuition. It will also be a phenomenology of inverse intentionality, one in which the constituting subject is constituted by the look and the voice of another. In light of these suggestions, the phenomenology of Jean-Luc Marion is defended against three critiques, namely that it compromises the boundary between phenomenology and theology, that the theology it serves is a bad one to boot, and that it has an inadequate account of the subject. At the heart of this defense is Marion's clear distinction between phenomenology as a description of possible experience, and theology as the claim that a certain kind of experience, namely revelation or epiphany, is not merely actual but veridical. Phenomenology says, If revelation occurs it will be in the form of a saturated phenomenon. Theology says, for example, the burning bush was an epiphany, or Jesus Christ is a revelation. The attentive reader should have no trouble distinguishing Marion's phenomenological analyses, which should be persuasive to believer and unbeliever alike, from his theological claims. Marion's account of the subject falls under the heading of inverse intentionality, and there are hints that vision is aufgehoben in the voice. The seer is first of all the one seen, but above all the one addressed, called forth into response-able being.<br>

Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies<br>
Issue: i27652935<br>
Date: 10 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Kliger Ilya<br>
Abstract: Ilya Kliger addresses the question of Mikhail Bakhtin's intervention in modernist discourse by taking a step back from Bakhtin's views on modernist literature and outlining instead a more general Bakhtinian conception of the modernist condition as characterized by what Kliger calls "a crisis of authorship." The article focuses on Bakhtin's early work in narratological aesthetics and situates it within the longue durée context of debates about the status of the subject of aesthetic experience and, more generally, of knowledge, debates that can provisionally be seen as originating at the end of the eighteenth century and coming to a head within the intellectual and creative milieu of twentieth-century modernism. Early Bakhtin helps us formulate a specifically modernist—by contrast with what will be called "transcendental" and "realist"—critique, a critique not limited to the field of literary analysis alone but applying to all forms of thinking that either presuppose abstract subject-object division or rely on modes of synthetic reconciliation.<br>

Publisher: BMJ Publishing Group<br>
Issue: i27718647<br>
Date: 4 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Berghmans Ron<br>
Abstract: Advance directives for psychiatric care are the subject of debate in a number of Western societies. By using psychiatric advance directives (or so-called "Ulysses contracts"), it would be possible for mentally ill persons who are competent and with their disease in remission, and who want timely intervention in case of future mental crisis, to give prior authorisation to treatment at a later time when they are incompetent, have become non-compliant, and are refusing care. Thus the devastating consequences of recurrent psychosis could be minimised. Ulysses contracts raise a number of ethical questions. In this article the central issues of concern and debate are discussed from a narrative perspective. Ulysses contracts are viewed as elements of an ongoing narrative in which patient and doctor try to make sense of and get a hold on the recurrent crisis inherent in the patient's psychiatric condition.<br>

Publisher: Society of Spanish and Spanish-American Studies<br>
Issue: i27741343<br>
Date: 1 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Fajardo Salvador J.<br>
Abstract: The present essay examines the ideological implications of Luis Cernuda's "Ninfa y pastor por Ticiano." In the Poem Cernuda uses ekphrasis as a springboard for the exploration of creative desire, transforming Titian's painting into an erotic generator of creativity. The erotic center of the painting—the nymph's form—becomes a mirror in whose light are reflected and merged the speaker's, Titian's, and the reader's creative desires. Starting from a position of radical dissent, the poem critiques canonical visual values with respect to the viewing subject, moral values as expressed and represented by the Christian story of man/woman's creation, and, more widely, by producing a deviation of readerly desire, it critiques the traditional codes of control and power relations in which we are immersed.<br>

Abstract: Cogito, as the first principle of Descartes' metaphysical system, initiated the modern philosophy of consciousness, becoming both the source and subject of modern Western philosophical discourse. The philosophies of Maine de Biran, Kant, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and others developed by answering the following questions? Is consciousness substantial or not? Does consciousness require the guarantee of a transcendental subject? Is Cogito epistemological or ontological? Am I a being-for-myself or a being-for-others? Outlining the developmental history of the idea of Cogito from Descartes to Sartre is important for totally comprehending the evolution and development of Western philosophy.<br>

Publisher: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland<br>
Issue: i330145<br>
Date: 9 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Clifford James<br>
Abstract: Maurice Leenhardt's ethnographic work in New Caledonia spanned nearly half a century, from 1902-1948. The first part of this field research is described and analysed, as background to his later anthropological writings. Leenhardt's specific position as a missionary-ethnographer is discussed, its advantages and disadvantages weighed. A liberal missionary perspective is found, in this case, to be conducive to a portrayal of cultural process. Leenhardt's translation methodology and his relations with key informants are detailed. Transcription, the means by which ethnographic texts are constituted by more than a single subject, is speculatively extended to ethnographic practice generally. Field research may be seen as a collective, reciprocal endeavour through which textualised translations are made. This viewpoint calls into question common notions of description, interpretation and authorship in the writing of ethnography.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i345794<br>
Date: 12 1, 1909<br>
Author(s): James Kevin<br>
Abstract: This essay argues that in Henry James's The Ambassadors (1903) Mrs. Newsome, who appears to be merely a representative of everything un-Jamesian, particularly a lack of moral and aesthetic imagination, should not be so quickly dismissed. Post-structuralist critics do not hesitate to denounce her. They typically identify Mrs. Newsome's "book" of expectations for Strether, her emissary, and for Chad, her successor, with the closed book of logocentric tyranny; both are said to rely on unambiguous reference and to enforce the cold rationality of linear causation. Derridean readers of The Ambassadors unmistakably prefer Madame de Vionnet's Paris, embodying as it apparently does their own essentially skeptical doctrines about representation. James, however, plays a more subtle game of balance and synthesis, suggesting that while Newsome's book is firm against new impressions, expecting experience to submit utterly to preconceived plans and moralistic evaluations, it also successfully asserts against Parisian representational openness and mystery the viability of reasonable explanation. Her book is vindicated insofar as it stands for the persistent relevance of linear causality and for the nonabsolute grounding of speculation in the concrete world of events and consequences. Newsome's extreme rationalism is in fact denied full authority early in the novel, whose true subject is located when extreme skepticism seems to dominate and explanation seems irrelevant. During the course of the story, time's subtle order slowly reemerges, and James the realist steps forward from behind the post-structuralist veil.<br>

Abstract: Before World War II the intellectual climate of American sociology was congenial to the growth of a sociology of knowledge akin to Mannheim's. Yet in the postwar period American sociologists committed themselves to ahistorical theory, positivist methodology, and team research; their "scientistic" sociology did not permit the historicism, relativism, and holism necessary to Mannheimian analysis. Currently, however, convergent trends in a number of disciplines--not only sociology but also philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, and the histories of ideas, science, and art--favor a revival of the Mannheimian program. Analysts of culture now seek to integrate the sociological goals of "explanation" and "understanding"--the formulation of quasi-laws of behavior, based on identification of the social structural elements of culture production, and the interpretation of the subjective meaning of culture, based on recovery of actors' intentions. Their research program requires investigation of the peculiar sociohistorical circumstances that condition actors' perceptions, necessitating attention to the cognitive content of culture. This article surveys both the theoretical justifications for such a research program and recent exemplifications of it, focusing on anlyses of what Mannheim termed "objective culture"--such symbolic vehicles for conceptions as religion, the arts, science, and political thought that acquire independent existence, becoming subject to diverse interpretations.<br>

Author(s): Lin Yu-chen<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the drama of selfhood and the attendant problem of ethics in Brian Friel's Faith Healer. Drawing from the tenets of Freudian psychoanalysis, I scrutinize the protagonist's narrative identity through fissures created by the discrepancy between his story and the other two characters' versions. These crevices register the protagonist's post-traumatic affects for an uncanny home, which, intertwined with his equally uncanny talent to become the place of trauma, compels him to return time and again instead of acknowledging its loss. Symptomatically, in his fixation on an uncanny home in order to disavow its loss, the protagonist sutures his privation, to such an extent that he not only bars memory exchange with other characters, but appropriates them into a master narrative. Given the fact that the three characters' stories are addressed to invisible auditors who converge with the play's actual audience, the healer's final act of authority is limited as long as it is subject to the audience's interpretation of his memory narrative. In its appeal to the audience's decision on ethical justice for the healer's narrative imagination among multiple proposals, this play is an exercise of poetical ethics of memory.<br>

Abstract: It is striking that Kant omits the ruin-as emblem and as idea-from his philosophical enterprise, considering the immense popularity of ruins at the end of the eighteenth century. His blindness to the contemporaneous cult of ruins may be emblematic of his own unwillingness to consider the ruination of his overconfident systematics, as well as a less than idealized, or "ruined," subject. While an idealized notion of the Kantian subject has been fundamental to the history of art, the essay demonstrates how the Kantian subject is itself divided, thereby raising questions concerning subjectivity and objectivity in art history.<br>

Abstract: This article introduces a special issue of the British Journal of Ethnomusicology on "music and meaning". It does so by offering some thoughts on "meaning" in the context of north Indian rāga music and by sketching the outline of an approach to musical meaning influenced by perspectives from ethnomusicology, psychological anthropology, cognitive science and cultural studies. The article proposes that all music is necessarily meaningful insofar as it offers to the perceiving subject possibilities for action and imagination, and that meaning is wholly dependent neither on semiosis nor on the apprehension of formal or structural relationships.<br>

Abstract: The combined works of John Dewey and Jerome Bruner provide a framework spanning a century of educational thought which can inform curriculum decisions concerning students' educational development, especially for middle school students whose waning of motivation toward school has been well documented by researchers and has long concerned parents and teachers. This framework, combined with recent contributions of motivation and interest researchers, can create broad understandings of how to collaboratively construct effective educational contexts. As early as 1913, Dewey specifically looked at the pivotal role of students' genuine interests in Interest and Effort in Education. Our current research focus on how students' interest can inform curricular contexts marks the recent shift showing an increased use of interest in education research since 1990. In this article, we discuss our study of a team-taught double classroom of sixth grade students whose interests were determined through a series of brainstorming sessions, and individual and focus group interviews. Students' interests fell into six categories centering around subject areas such as Drama, Science, and Animal Studies. Learning contexts were constructed around four of these subject areas. Students participated in their first or second choice of subject area group. We found significantly higher scores on measures of Affect and Activation if students participated in their first choice group. We found intra-group unities of preferred and dispreferred ways of learning which distinguished each group from the class as a whole. Finally, our findings indicated that students reliably described their genuine interests over time. Students' interests were found to be effective tools for informing curriculum decisions in the creation of sixth grade learning contexts.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses several problems in experimental ethnographies: the integration of first- and third-person texts, ethnographic authority, and incorporation of dialogue in ethnographies. These problems can be traced to a relationship between discourse and text that hinges on splitting subject/object and process/product. Both splits are antithetical to dialogue in defining relationships between self and social life. A dialogic approach is developed through use of indexing in social distance, and discussed in Japanese usage of register. Implications for intersubjective, reflexive, and pluralistic approaches to social life are traced out.<br>

Abstract: Le seul fait de déclarer son activité peut faire problème lorsque celle-ci s'inscrit non dans le régime occupationnel de l'emploi, du métier ou de la profession, mais dans celui de la vocation, comme c'est le cas pour les écrivains. Cet article cherche à expliciter les raisons pour lesquelles l'auto-déclaration de profession peut être aussi problématique pour les écrivains. A cette fin sont mis en évidence les paramètres organisant de façon générale l'identité professionnelle telle qu'elle est vécue et construite par les sujets: non seulement la représentation de soi telle que la réalise la déclaration de profession, mais aussi la désignation par autrui et l'auto-perception du sujet. Cette recherche s'inscrit ainsi à la fois dans une sociologie des professions artistiques et dans une sociologie de l'identité, ce qui permet de conférer à cette dernière notion une acception rigoureuse et donc utilisable par les sciences sociales. /// Declaring an activity can in itself be a problem if that activity does not belong to the occupational regime of employment, career or profession, but to that of a vocation, as is the case for writers. This article is an attempt to explain the reasons why self declaration of a profession can cause so many problems for a writer. The article deals with the parameters which go to form a professional identity as it is seen and developed by the subjects: a personal representation formed by the professional declaration as well as the designation made by other people and how it is perceived by the subject. This research is both part of a sociology on the artistic profession and of a sociology on identity which means that this notion can be given firm signification and may thus be used by social sciences. /// Allein die Tatsache seine Beschäftigung anzugeben kann ein Problem darstellen, wenn diese Beschäftigung nicht in den Arbeitsrahmen des Angestellten, des Gewerbs- oder Berufstätigen fällt, sondern in die Berufung wie es bei den Schriftstellern~<br>

Article Title: Theory, Pragmatism and Truth: Post-Modernism in the Context of Action<br>
Publisher: University of Alberta<br>
Issue: i275803<br>
Date: 4 1, 1969<br>
Author(s): WittgensteinAbstract: This paper criticizes post-modern and interpretive challenges to positivism by incorporating pragmatism into sociological theory. As an interpretive method, pragmatism is based on the notion that the meaning of ideas is to be found in their consequences for action in definite situations. In contrast to the post-modern "linguistic turn" in which language replaces activity, the pragmatist linkage of meaning to action points to the centrality of experience in realizing the mode of being projected by discourse. By stressing the interrelation of subject and object in definite situations, pragmatism avoids both the subjectivity inherent in the interpretive reliance on actors' perceptions and the false search for universal, abstract theory. The pragmatic emphasis on the consequences of ideas resolves the tension between relativism and objectivism in interpretation by its focus on theory and discourse as guides to action. /// Cet article critique les défis post-moderniste et interprétif au positivisme en incorporant le pragmatisme à la théorie sociologique. Comme méthode interprétative, le pragmatisme est fondé sur le principe que le sens des idées se retrouve dans leurs conséquences pour l'action dans les situations déterminées. Par contraste à la 'tournure linguistique' post-moderniste dans laquelle la langue remplace l'activité, la relation entre le sens et l'action suggérée par le pragmatisme indique la centralité de l'expérience dans la prise de conscience de soi projetée par le discours. En soulignant la relation réciproque entre le sujet et l'objet en situations déterminées, le pragmatisme évite la subjectivité inhérente dans la dépendance de la méthode interprétative sur les perceptions de l'acteur, ainsi que la recherche futile d'une théorie abstraite et universelle. L'importance que le pragmatisme porte sur la conséquence des idées résout la tension entre le relativisme et l'objectivisme de l'interprétation par sa concentration sur la théorie et le discours comme ~<br>

Abstract: Progressive constitutional scholarship has yet fully to confront the implications of the conservative shift in constitutional law. Liberal critics continue to seek governing constitutional theories with which to constrain decisionmaking by judges of a notably different mind. Other, more radical scholars employ the indeterminacy and "law is politics" critiques in a more open attempt at displacement. Neither approach is viable, however. Each presumes the primacy of the autonomous, self-directing subject; each resists recognition of the situated nature of all human endeavor. This essay adopts the alternative strategy: exploring the implications of situatedness as they apply to the development, practice, and attempted reconstruction of modern constitutional law. After evaluating the lessons of history, the essay suggests a reconceptualization of "constitutional politics" which better reflects the parameters that both limit and enable change. It explores the possibilities for reconstruction through revisionist readings of three familiar cases-West Coast Hotel v. Parrish, Brown v. Board of Education, and Griswold v. Connecticut. These rereadings reveal not only that the recognition of situatedness and its constitutional implications are already a part of the canon, but also that they are the very center of modern constitutional concern.<br>

Abstract: The radical constructivist assertion that the student constructs his or her own knowledge as opposed to receiving it "ready made" echoes the classical debate as to whether the human subject constitutes the world or is constituted by it. This paper shows how the philosophical traditions of post-structuralism and hermeneutic phenomenology offer approaches to effacing this dichotomy and how this forces a re-assertion of the teacher's role in the student's constructing of mathematical knowledge. It is also shown how hermeneutic phenomenology provides an opportunity to ground constructivist mathematical thinking in the material qualities of the world.<br>

Author(s): Sund Brendan<br>
Abstract: In 1957, Francis Bacon rapidly painted a series of five numbered paintings after van Gogh's "Self-Portrait on the Road to Tarason," to fill an exhibition. They are exceptional in his work, both as to subject and in the way they are painted. A painter who regularly took reproduced images as his sources, he chose in this unique case the self-portrait of another artist, and used -- also uniquely -- methods evidently akin to those of 'action painting'. So selfhood and the practice of painting come into unusual conjunction in these works. Paul Ricoeur's attempt, in "Oneself as Another," to overcome the perennial self--other opposition, and his account of a constitutionally unstable self, lacking a 'core', are suggestive for discussion of the relationship between viewer and painting, specifically with reference to portraiture. He presents an alternative to the antinomial theories of the self which have long dominated criticism of visual art, theories according to which visual images mirror, and so crucially help to construct, an ego enclosed against the other; such a model is presumed in Ernst van Alphen's "Francis Bacon and the Loss of Self." Admittedly, this series of paintings is itself bound to invoke what Ricoeur terms 'hyperbolic' concepts of selfhood: van, Gogh, through his biographers, became the type of artist-as-genius; Minelli's biopic "Lust for Life," which Bacon probably saw, came out in 1956, and in the same year Jackson Pollock, prototypical 'action painter' died in a way that contributed to a comparable mythology. Against that, it is important to consider what Bacon does, and to notice the kinds of action, or interaction, tended to us as viewers. In context, the link with cinema assumes a different importance. Also crucial is Bacon's process of variation. Unlike philosophy, as Ricoeur shows, art can engage in play, freely varying all terms without a view to conclusion -- art experiments with the self. Bacon takes selfhood apart, recombines its elements; he~<br>

Article Title: Workers in the New Economy: Transformation as Border Crossing<br>
Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i370173<br>
Date: 3 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Walkerdine Valerie<br>
Abstract: In this article, I seek to make an intervention in debates between psychological and postmodern anthropology by engaging with the theme of border crossing. I argue that the theme of the border is one that fundamentally instantiates a separation between interior and exterior with respect to subjectivity, itself a fundamental transformation and a painful and difficult border. This is related to a Cartesian distinction critiqued in this article. How the distinction between interior and exterior may be transcended is discussed in relation to examples of transformation from the crossing of class borders to the production and regulation of workers in a globalized and neoliberal economy. I begin with reference to postwar transformations of class with its anxious borders and go on to think about changes in the labor market and how these demand huge transformations that tear apart communities, destroy work-places, and sunder the sense of safety and stability that those gave. Advanced liberalism or neoliberalism brings with it a speeding up of the transformations of liberalism in which subjects are constantly invoked as self-contained, with a transportable self that must be produced through the developmental processes of personality and rationality. This self must be carried like a snail carries a shell. It must be coherent yet mutable, fixed yet multiple and flexible. But this view of the subject covers over the many connections that make subjectivity possible. I conclude by asking what it would mean to rethink this issue of the production of safe spaces beyond an essentialist psychological conception of only one mother-child space, separated from the social world, as having the power to produce feelings of safety? I end the article with an argument for a relational approach to subjectivity and sociality.<br>

Author(s): Waal Anne-Lise<br>
Abstract: This article looks at HIV prevention projects in which established stigmatized and stigmatizing roles were actively reversed and manipulated in pursuit of HIV harm reduction. In two Norwegian projects, sex workers and drug users carried out harm-reduction activities with other drug users and sex workers. Although HIV-related harm reduction was the aim of the projects, termination or reduction of drug use or sex work was not. Such changes nevertheless occurred among the sex workers and drug users who took active part in the project. The article considers these changes in order to reflect on the meanings and roles of participation in HIV prevention work. In particular, the discussion theorizes on possible ways in which alteration of roles and subject positions may produce self-reflective effects with transformative potentials.<br>

Abstract: L'histoire de l'Europe restera problématique tant que l'on ne s'entendra pas sur son objet. Parlons-nous d'Europe-continent, d'Europe-civilisation, d'Europe-idéal ou d'Europe-construction? Quelle quadrature du cercle européen voulons-nous ainsi apprendre et enseigner? Pour réduire cette incertitude, Robert Frank appelle en renfort l'histoire comparée, l'histoire des relations internationales et l'histoire du temps présent. Il invoque les "forces profondes" signalées naguère par Pierre Renouvin. Il montre à très juste titre qu'identité et conscience européenne, pour être des acquis du 20e siècle, n'en sont pas moins des concepts opératoires ou, plus utilement, de fortes hypothèses de travail.

He refers to the "deep forces" Pierre Renouvin brought up earlier.

Abstract: L'étude de l'engagement de "Frères du Monde" contre la guerre du Vietnam (1965-1973) permet de mettre en évidence les tensions existant entre la sphère du religieux et celle du politique, au sein d'un groupe de catholiques engagés, au cours de la décennie marquée par mai 68. Au début de la guerre du Vietnam, en février 1965, cette revue catholique, dirigée par des Franciscains bordelais, prend une position originale dans les milieux chrétiens: elle condamne très rapidement et très fermement l'intervention américaine. Ses rédacteurs "témoignent" en faveur du peuple vietnamien et dénoncent, en termes marxistes-léninistes, l'impérialisme américain. A travers les analyses, les prises de positions et les actions de "Frères du Monde" à propos du Vietnam, c'est le glissement vers le gauchisme d'une fraction minoritaire de la gauche chrétienne que l'on peut observer. Après 1968, le discours de la revue sur la guerre du Vietnam perd toute référence religieuse pour devenir, apparemment, exclusivement politique. Il reflète cependant une évolution théologique qui conduit des Franciscains, destinés à l'origine à la Mission, vers une théologie de la Libération, en gestation, à la même époque, en Amérique latine. L'engagement de "Frères du Monde" contre la guerre du Vietnam prend fin prématurément en septembre 1971. Alors que les combats redoublent de violence, la rédaction de la revue ne s'exprime plus sur cette guerre. En proie à des divisions internes, la revue disparaît au cours de l'année 1973. /// The study of "Frères du Monde's" commitment against the Vietnam War brings to the fore the tensions existing between the religious field and the political one, within a group of politically involved Catholics during the decade around May 1968. At the beginning of the Vietnam War, in February 1965, this Catholic review, published by a Franciscan friary from Bordeaux, takes an original stand among Christian circles: it quickly and firmly comdemns the American military intervention.

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i371617<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur Michael<br>
Abstract: The last thirty years have brought about a fundamental revision of historical epistemology. So intense a concentration on the nature of history as a form of inquiry has diminished attention given to the thing that history inquires into: the nature of the past itself. Too readily, that entire domain has turned into a place for dreams, as Hayden White put it: a lost world only available now through the imagination of the author and subject to aesthetic whim. The next thirty years will, I propose, be the period in which ontology returns to the center of historical theory. And nothing short of the reconceptualization of the past-indeed of time itself-must be its objective. It must achieve that objective, moreover, in establishing arguments that are congruent with what revisions of epistemology have taught us about the limits of historical knowledge and the inevitability of textual representation. This paper enters this field by discussing some of the issues involved in rethinking the place of time in historical constructions since Bergson. It demonstrates the confusions inherent in spatial reductions of temporality, which historians have done so much to entrench rather than eradicate, and argues that historians have yet to accommodate the fundamental conceptual shifts inaugurated by Heidegger. It then moves to propose a methodological doctrine to which I have given the name "chronism" and seeks to sketch the utility of such a doctrine for bringing one form of presence-that of authenticity-back into the domain of historical study. Doing so invites a number of conceptual and practical difficulties that the paper will address in its conclusions; these may disturb those who have closed their minds to anything beyond the present. Taking ontology seriously interferes both with structuralist assumptions about the nothingness of time and with some of the styles of historical representation that have become fashionable in the postmodern climate. There may be painful lessons to b~<br>

Issue: i371629<br>
Date: 1 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Vindhya Srila<br>
Abstract: Marriage practices, the dynamics of interpersonal relationships and the politics of sexuality are relatively under-researched themes in the study of Bengali communism. Historical scholarship on the revolutionary politics of the extreme left Naxalbari andoian of the late 1960s-1970s, the object of this piece of study, is no exception. The article engages with women and men's narratives on the practice of 'revolutionary' marriage in the movement through the prism of contemporary popular memory studies and narrative analysis. Drawing on field interviews with middle-class male and female activists, the article draws attention to the contestatory nature of marriage in the collective memory of the movement. Narrative contestations over marriage in the Naxalite movement underscore, I argue, a tension between a Utopian ideal of transgressive interpersonal relations and dominant middle-class codes of sexual morality. At the same time, individual attempts to 'compose' (in storytelling) socially recognizable and acceptable subject positions are grounded upon the silencing and abjection of more risky memories. Given the discrepancies and contradictions within the narrative repertoire from which individuals construct their identities, these 'marriage stories' are a tremendous resource for investigating the politics of love, sexuality and subject-formation in middle-class Bengali society.<br>

Abstract: Aristotle's discussion of political deliberation fixes the practice in that it implicitly addresses critiques found in the writings of earlier authors such as Aristophanes, the Old Oligarch, Thucydides, Plato and Isocrates. His perspective likewise fixes political deliberation by securing its status as the central means by which the polis is able to confront the contingent and pursue the expedient. The acceptance of argument from probability, and the disciplining of that argument into proper and improper forms, made his position in favor of political deliberation tenable. Finally, his perspective fixes political deliberation in that it stands as the latest and most thorough treatment of the subject in the classical period.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>

Date: 6 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Schofer Jonathan Wyn<br>
Abstract: This paper formulates the categories of "ethics," "self," and "subject" for an analysis of classical rabbinic ethics centered on the text, "The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan." Early rabbis were concerned with the realms of life that today's scholars describe as ethics and self-cultivation, yet they had no overarching concepts for either the self/person or for ethics. This analysis, then, cannot rely only upon native rabbinic terminology, but also requires a careful use of contemporary categories. This paper first sets out basic features of "Rabbi Nathan" and presents appropriate formulations of the relevant scholarly terms. The latter sections address possibilities for employing and revising these categories in descriptive and comparative studies more broadly, first surveying relevant scholarship on Christian, Muslim, and Manichaean sources, and then turning to ancient East Asian sources with a particular focus upon passages in the "Zhuangzi".<br>

Author(s): Findlay L. M.<br>
Abstract: In "Ulysses" Tennyson adapts and refines the traditional techniques of ars memoria to create a poem that is vivid, specific, yet rich in allusion. Ulysses draws on present sensation and a well-stocked memory to help him face the future. This process is highly selective and manipulative, and Tennyson exposes its dangers by subtly appealing to a greater memory: that collective literary memory where Homer and Dante reign. Personal memory furnishes the immediate and attractive subject matter of the poem: its fabric of allusion implies and controls its larger and more cautionary meanings.<br>

Date: 7 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): Campbell Heather<br>
Abstract: The development of the intellectual basis for planning activity has been a slow and problematic process. This paper seeks to build on existing intellectual understanding to argue that future developments in planning thought must take questions of ethical value as their starting point. The paper is essentially divided into three parts. The first makes the important distinction between planning as a narrow set of regulatory practices and planning as an idea, or more particularly a long-enduring societal activity. It is the latter concept of planning that frames the discussion in the remainder of the paper. The second, in which the core of the argument is developed, explores the nature of planning as an activity; an activity that is centrally concerned with making ethical judgements about better and worse, with and for others, in just institutions. It is about an idea of value. The third section examines the implications of this perspective for planning as a subject of academic endeavour. The argument is illustrated throughout with examples drawn from the author's research.<br>

Abstract: This introduction to the special issue of Human Studies on postphenomenology outlines specific developments which have led to this style of phenomenology. Postphenomenology adapts aspects of pragmatism, including its anti-Cartesian program against early modern subject/object epistemology. Postphenomenology retains and emphasizes the use of phenomenological variations as an analytic tool, and in practice postphenomenology takes what is commonly now called "an empirical turn," which deeply analyzes case studies or concrete issues under its purview.<br>

Abstract: Examining historical photographs can open paths to improved understanding of the history of most disciplines, including medicine. Images can be "read" and advantageously integrated with other historical "traces." Documents, including photographs, are "orphaned" when separated from their creators and used out of context. Archivists share with historians the responsibility for considering interpretations of the documentary record. Cultivating subject-specific understanding as well as general historical awareness expands our competency to read photographs and promotes more contextualized and historically grounded uses of information.<br>

Tais tópicos, que se desenvolvem em torno dos elementos já considerados, gravitam à volta da inteligibilidade do sentido e do sentido da inteligibilidade, da complementaridade dos métodos, e dos níveis semiológico e semântico, este último estabelecido mediante a pregnância da frase na linguagem, e da palavra (mot) como operador entre a estrutura e o acontecimento. /// La présente analyse commence par mettre en relief quelques présupposés qui explicitent la question nucléaire de "l'instance du sajet" dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur (présupposés antérieurs ou contemporains du débat avec le structuralisme) et qui caractérisent le chemin philosophique de celui-ci; on prend également pour point de départ l'articulation centrale de la pensée de Lévi-Strauss relative à ce débat, afin de proposer ensuite les lignes mai-tresses de cette controverse.

Abstract: Por ocasião do cinquentenário da morte de Freud, ocorrida em 1989, multiplicaram-se as homenagens e as publicaçães que acentuaram não só os aspectos clínicos da sua obra científica, mas também o valor e a significação cultural da Psicanálise. O mesmo haveria de ocorrer uma década mais tarde por ocasião do centenário da publicação de A Interpretação dos Sonhos, obra inaugural da técnica psicanalítica e uma das principais marcas na história da psicologia contemporânea. Com opresente artigo, o autor pretende demonstrar até que ponto a Psicanálise é ainda hoje uma teoria e uma prática tão viva como conflitiva, mostrando, além disso, até que ponto ela assumiu, tal como Freud previra, um carácter de autêntica revolução científica e epistemológica, similar à copernicana ou a darwiniana nos seus respectivos momentos historicos. Neste sentido, para la de analisar diversas posturas culturais em relação à Psicanálise, as quais nos interrogam acerca da sua presumível universalidade, o artigo mostra também até que ponto a descoberta do Inconsciente constitui profundo abalo no estatuto do sujeito humano. /// At the time the fiftieth anniversary of Freud's death occurred, which happened in 1989, many celebrations and publications took place, many of which highlighting not only the clinical aspects of Freud's work, but also the cultural value and meaning of Psychoanalysis. Something similar occurred ten years later on the occasion of the centenary of the publication of the The Interpretation of Dreams, work of fundamental importance for the understanding of the psychoanalytic method and one of the main moments in the history of modern psychology With the present article, the author aims at demonstrating to what extent Psychoanalysis is still a theory and a practice as lively as it is conflictive, showing, among other things how it came to assume, as Freud himself had predicted, a character of an authentic scientific and epistemological revolution, in many ways similar to the Copern~<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo procura apresentar algumas das principais características do diálogo de Paul Ricoeur com a psicanálise freudiana no contexto da sua hermenêutica filosófica. Num primeiro momento, o artigo começa por se referir ao contacto inicial de Ricoeur com a problemática da psicanálise na obra La symbolique du mal. Num segundo momento, considerando a obra Essai sur Freud, o artigo procura situar a psicanálise como uma arqueologia do sujeito a ser conjugada com as instâncias teleológica (Hegel) e escatológica (filosofia da religião). A cumplicidade das três instâncias representa o terceiro ponto do presente ensaio: o desejo transforma-se na instância comum entre elas. O quarto ponto explicita a articulação entre o arqueo-lógico/pulsional e o teleológico/espiritual no domínio da arte: o passado pulsional é subsumido nas dimensões teleológica e escatológica do sentido. O quinto ponto trata da figura do pai presente na imagem de Deus que se encontra na Bíblia: ele regressa de um modo que está para além do mero antropomorfismo, assinalado como está pela realização de promessas futuras. Uma tal figura provoca um repensar dos afectos arcaicos referentes ao medo da punição. Um sexto ponto oferece uma apreciação geral da hermenêutica filosófica de Ricoeur e da resistência que ela propõe a todas as formas de subjectivismo. Finalmente, o artigo refere-se ainda ao modo como fé e filosofia se encontram e se afectam mutuamente ao mesmo tempo que uma e outra mantêm as suas características distintas. /// The present article seeks to present some of the main features of Paul Ricoeur's dialogue with Freudian psychoanalysis in the context of his philosophical hermeneutics.

Abstract: The view of language is greatly changed from early modern philosophy to later modern philosophy and to postmodern philosophy. The linguistic question in early modern philosophy, which is characterized by rationalism and empiricism, is discussed in this paper. Linguistic phenomena are not at the center of philosophical reflections in early modern philosophy. The subject of consciousness is at the center of the philosophy, which makes language serve purely as an instrument for representing thoughts. Locke, Leibniz and Descartes consider language from a representationalist point of view. To them, language itself is idealized and represents thought as if it were thought representing itself. Like the structural linguist Saussure, the founders of phenomenology and analytical philosophy give much attention to the logical or static structure of language, and stick up for the representationalism of early modern philosophy. However, their successors refuse to accept this attitude, meaning the final collapse of representationalism. /// 从早期现代哲学到后期现代哲学再到后现代哲学，在语言观上产生了重大的 变化。早期现代哲学以唯理论和经验论为典型形式。语言现象没有成为该时期哲学 反思的中心问题; 意识主体处于哲学的中心，这使得语言仅仅充当着表象思想的工 具。洛克、莱布尼茨和笛卡尔都从表象论的角度看待语言，在他们那里，语言本身 被观念化了，它们表象思想，就像思想在表象它自身。正像结构语言学家索绪尔一 样，现象学和分析哲学的创始人关注的都是语言的逻辑结构或静态结构，他们延续 了早期现代哲学的表象论，但他们的后继者拒绝接受这种态度，而这意味着最终突 破表象论。<br>

Author(s): Hart Curtis W.<br>
Abstract: J. Robert Oppenheimer was among the most important and enigmatic figures in 20th century science. He is best known for successfully directing the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan at the end of World War II. Subsequently, he became a scientist and statesman who advised the United States government in the areas of atomic weapons development and public policy. He later became subject to an investigation in 1954 into his previous political affiliations and his personal behavior that ended in the revoking of his security clearance. This essay seeks to chronicle Oppenheimer's coming of age as a public intellectual with a view toward his own psychological history and most especially in relationship to the stages of faith development articulated by James Fowler and colleagues. Moreover, though not conventionally religious, Oppenheimer's life and thought were permeated with themes and ideas of a religious and ethical nature that shaped his adult character and informed his view of the world. This essay was originally presented at The Richardson History of Psychiatry Research Seminar at Weill Cornell Medical College.<br>

Abstract: The paper considers the map and the milieu of Europe. Five distinguishing characteristics are discussed. Special attention is given to the "states system" of Europe, the intensity of the boundary network and the increasing tendency from the point of view of human geography to treat the continent as divided rather than as unitary. The first post-war generation of British geographers tended to neglect Europe in favour of North America. Sweden and France have been important in restoring the connection. Those whose research focuses on European topics will encounter bibliographical, linguistic and other problems; but these will be offset by the cordial working relationships among European geographers which, as among colleagues in the English-speaking world, seem to spring from the nature of the subject itself.<br>

Author(s): ZahaviAbstract: A criticism of all totalizing knowledge, deconstruction rejects all appeals to ontological, epistemological or ethical absolutes as a metaphysics of presence. Like all postmodernist philosophies, it presents serious difficulties for traditional monotheistic theologies and their basic affirmations about the human subject. Some are apprehensive of the atheistic tendencies of deconstruction, but others have enthusiastically argued for the possibility of a theistic appropriation of postmodern themes and their hermeneutics of suspicion and finitude. This article provides an outline of the ethico-theroretical basis of deconstruction, and examines its ethical claims. Derrida's views on Islam as reflected in his discourse on hospitality are examined, and a critical evaluation of the ethical propositions of deconstruction from an Islamic perspective is presented.<br>

Abstract: L'article passe en revue certains emplois assumés du terme fiction et écarte la conception ultra-relativiste selon laquelle tout serait fiction puisque la vérité des faits est impossible à établir et que le langage, a fortiori tout récit, sont par nature fictionnels. Envisager par ailleurs l'acception large de la notion de fiction comme quelque chose de construit se révèle peu productif car tout texte, toute oeuvre, même celle qui vise à la neutralité documentaire, peut dès lors être qualifiée de fiction. La recherche de vérité(s) doit demeurer à l'horizon des efforts des scientifiques. À cet égard, il convient de considérer la fiction artistique comme la véritable fiction. Son cadre pragmatique est celui que l'on désigne par les expressions de « feintise ludique » ou de « feintise partagée ». Sur ce plan, la fiction se distingue du faux (du mensonge), de l'erreur (de l'illusion) et de l'hypothèse (de la théorie). Si elle se distingue des discours liés aux intentions scientifiques, la fiction artistique intéresse néanmoins, en tant qu'objet, les anthropologues : imagination artistique et imaginaire collectif entretiennent en effet des relations d'influences réciproques. The ultra-relativististic conception whereby everything is fiction is shunned. It claims that the truth of facts cannot be established and that language and even more so narratives are fictional by nature. A broader acceptation of fiction as something « constructed » turns out to be of little use since any text or writing – even one with the intention of documentary neutrality – falls under the label of fiction. The quest for truth(s) must remain a scientific pursuit. In this respect, « artistic fiction » should be considered to be genuine fiction. Phrases such as « shared » or « playful pretense » refer to its pragmatic framework. Fiction thus stands apart from falsehood (lies), error (illusions) and hypothesis (theories). Though distinct from scientific intentionality, artistic fiction is of intere~<br>

Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Abstract: La sociologie, née au XIXe siècle, fut trop contaminée par les métaphores biologiques ou mécanistes, alors que la psychologie, depuis Freud, constituait son objet spécifique. Jung, parachevant les topiques célèbres, leur ajoutait les couches profondes de l'Inconscient collectif. Dans le sillage de l'épistémè, et de ses logiques, de la fin du XX e siècle, la sociologie se doit à son tour d'élaborer sa topique propre, où le mythe se découvre comme l'uliime « implicant » (implicate), à partir duquel s'explicitent les rôles, les idéologies, les axiologies et les codes d'une société. Sociology, emerging in the XlXth century, was too contaminated by biological or mechanistic metaphors; psychology however, from Freud's time on, formed its own specific subject. Jung, in amplifying and perfecting the crucial topics, added to them the deep-seated strata of the Collective Unconscious. Following in the wake of epistemy and of its logic, sociology must in turn, by the end of the XXlh century, develop its own subject, in which myth is revealed as the ultimate « implicant » (implicator), on the basis of which the roles, ideologies, axiologies and codes of a society are expounded.<br>

Date: 6 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Gosselin Gabriel<br>
Abstract: Expliciter les fondements d'une éthique des sciences sociales engage hors d'une sociologie de l'éthique. C'est une recherche peu pratiquée dans ces disciplines qui conduit nécessairement à des affirmations en première personne, et entraîne des présuppositions épislémologiques. Trois postulats sont ici dégagés : 1 / Reconnaître en tout autre un sujet, c'est admettre que le sujet est seul porteur de sens ; 2 / L'affirmation d'une commune humanité introduit une universalité en valeur et une relativité épistémologique, dans une démarche interprétative et une éthique des limites ; 3 / Dire que ce n'est pas l'ordre qui nous constitue, mais nous qui le constituons, c'est dire le risque éthique de nous concevoir comme les éléments d'un Tout, et c'est supposer un individualisme d'ordre épistemologique. Accurately defining the basis of an ethic of social sciences requires an approach which is outside the sociology of ethics. The little amount of research which has been conducted in these fields has necessarily led the author to present personal assertions and has also resulted in epistemological presuppositions. Three assumptions are presented here : 1 / To consider that any one else is a subject amounts in effect to admitting that only the subject carries a real meaning ; 2 / The assertion that mankind is a common whole is introducing both the concept of universality and an epistemological relativity, through an approach based on interpretation and an ethical understanding of limits ; 3 / To state that society does not legitimate ourselves, but that ourselves legitimate society amounts to drawing attention to the ethical risk of considering ourselves as lhe components of a whole, which is presupposing an individualism of an espistemological nature.<br>

Abstract: Cet article traite du rapport de l'engagement et de la connaissance sociologique, en prenant pour terrain la problématique des rapports sociaux de sexe et le féminisme. Plus exactement, c'est la question de l'utopie et de sa fonction heuristique et cognitive éventuelle pour la recherche qui fait l'objet de l'étude. Après avoir rappelé et présenté certains des travaux les plus importants sur la question, il est procédé à une tentative d'élucidation des vertus cognitives de l'utopie féministe matérialiste pour les recherches sur le genre, la différence des sexes et la domination masculine. La conclusion revient sur les implications épistémologiques et méthodologiques de cette étude. This article is devoted to the study of the relationship between engagement and soaological knowledge, in the field of research relevant to gender and feminism. More exactly, the question concerns the heuristic and cognitive functions of utopia. Firstly, the author introduces some of the most significant works on the subject. Then, he tries to clarify the cognitive virtues of the feminist utopia for a better understanding of gender, sex difference and male domination. The conclusion reconsiders the epistemological and methodological implications of the study.<br>

Abstract: This essay is the first attempt to compare Reinhart Koselleck's Historik with Hannah Arendt's political anthropology and her critique of the modern concept of history. Koselleck is well-known for his work on conceptual history as well as for his theory of historical time(s). It is my contention that these different projects are bound together by Koselleck's Historik, that is, his theory of possible histories. This can be shown through an examination of his writings from Critique and Crisis to his final essays on historical anthropology, most of which have not yet been translated into English. Conversely, Arendt's political theory has in recent years been the subject of numerous interpretations that do not take into account her views about history. By comparing the anthropological categories found in Koselleck's Historik with Arendt's political anthropology, I identify similar intellectual lineages in them (Heidegger, Löwith, Schmitt) as well as shared political sentiments, in particular the anti-totalitarian impulse of the postwar era. More importantly, Koselleck's theory of the preconditions of possible histories and Arendt's theory of the preconditions of the political, I argue, transcend these lineages and sentiments by providing essential categories for the analysis of historical experience.<br>

Comparing these concepts the notion of social structures seems to be dissolving: from a desubstantialization and desubjectivation to a destructuralization and detotalization of the ,social'. This raises the question of the end of sociology.<br>

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: To see, to speak, to think : these are the three main topics of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, tragically interrupted in 1961. He intended to write two works on The Origin of Truth. To understand the relationship between Merleau-Ponty I and Merleau-Ponty II it is a good lead to pay attention to the relationship between seeing, speaking and thinking. In a central passage of Phenomenology of Perception (p. 451) this relationship is called Fundierung. Merleau-Ponty conceives it as a two way relationship, which excludes every possibility of reducing one term (thinking, reason) to another (perception, language). Yet, at that time he is not able to point out clearly the originality of thinking. L'Oeil et l'Esprit and Le Visible et l'Invisible provide a first outline of l'Origine de la Vérité. The 'second' Merleau-Ponty wants to 'reassume' his whole philosophy in what he calls : fundamental thinking. Painting opens the way to the mystery of seeing : something visible begins to see. Subject and object are no longer opposed to one another ; not even related by intentionality. The new key-word is Ineinander (interrelatedness, to be in one another, chiasm). 'La chair' (the flesh) is a new notion, broader and more fundamental than the body. The sensible reflects upon itself. This 're-flection' (reflexivity or reversibility) is a work of Being. The visible can be seen in principle. Philosophy should accompany the coming-to-see of the visible. In this perspective the transition to thinking (or ideality) must be seen as a new case of 'reversibilité'. The generality of the visible opens up to the 'invisible', that which in principle cannot be seen, but is 'the other side' of the visible. The basic phenomenon of expression is central here. Language is not an absolute starting point. Language is rather a new and more subtile form of coporeity, a new instance of the same basic reversibility, which already contains the seeds of ideality (logos endiathetor). The idea is of the word (logos ~<br>

Abstract: In this paper a distinction is made between two conceptions of the ego in freudian metapsychology. According to the first conception, a conception which Freud never gave up, the ego is conceived as a specific function on the surface of the living organism ; it is the result of a progressive differentiation of the Id ('Es') under the driving power of internal stimuli and external reality. Fitted with specific neutral, i.e. non-conflictual functions as perception, memory, control of the bodily motions and consciousness, the ego has to defend the individual as a biological living organism against the threats from without and within. In this conception the ego is treated as an instance that doesn't take part in the different psychic conflicts. We analyse the philosophical presuppositions and show the metapsychological disadvantages of this hypothesis that has been worked out especially in the American ego-psychology. According to the second conception, that takes into account important clinical pheno mena as identification, idealisation, narcissism, ideal of the ego, the ego is conceived as a metaphorical effect of a specific psychic act. With Lacan, we try to analyse and to interpret this specific act as an act that causes an infinite splitting in the ego : the ego is constituted as a subject that from its origin is separated from itself. Instead of being a biological function that lives in the immediate metonymical prolongiation of the living organism, it rather has to defend a certain representation of himself. This point of view doesn't exclude a purely functional description of the ego ; but the different functions have now to be interpreted differently because the ego is the effect of conflicts in which it takes part (consciousness is interlaced with unconsciousness, perception with denying...). In the last part of our study we show how Freud makes the philosophically important distinction between the ego as an object of the Id and the ego as a subject that has to~<br>

Abstract: Le rapport entre « conscience » et « identité » forme l'un des deux versants de la conception lockienne du sujet (l'autre étant constitué par la « propriété de soi-même »). La théorie lockienne repose sur la distinction du « mental » et du « verbal », et l'isolement du premier comme élément de la vérité. Elle suppose une reformulation du principe d'identité sous la forme d'une double négation inhérente à l'esprit (Mind) : il est impossible que l'homme ne sache pas qu'il pense, ou pense sans penser. Enfin elle caractérise comme « intériorité » la différentielle de perception et de réflexion qui opère tout au long de l'expérience. Dès lors le temps intérieur peut être intellectuellement et moralement ressaisi dans l'unité de la « conscience de soi ». Consciousness and Personal Identity form together one half of Locke's theory of the Subject (the other half being « self-ownership »). First of all, « mental » and « verbal » propositions (viz. truths) must be clearly distinguished. The principle of identity has to be reformulated in logico-psychological terms, as a double negation: it is impossible for the Mind to think, without knowing that it thinks. Finally the difference of perception and reflexion, which operates throughout « experience », is called an « internal sense » or interiority. As a consequence, Locke was able to call « self-consciousness » the typical unity of morality and understanding which forms the internal « duration » of the Mind.<br>

Abstract: At the heart of this article is a structural approach to narrative, based on the work of Propp, Labov, van Dijk, Halliday, and others. The article highlights the structural features of narrative—basically, the organization of the genre around the semantic template actor-action-actor (syntactically rendered as subject-verb-object but where, in narrative, the subject is typically a social actor and the verb a social action) and the modifiers of each element of this triplet, such as time and space of action—and shows how to implement this structure in a computer environment and how to use this methodological tool in socio-historical research (namely, the rise of Italian fascism, 1919-22). But, taking a cue from Halliday's cover jacket of his An Introduction to Functional Grammar, with its representation of a color circle, the paper takes the reader on an intellectual journey from Newton to Goethe—and the quality versus quantity debate—to Goethe and Propp, to end, back home, with Simmel and Weber.<br>

Abstract: In 1758, Mary Jemison was captured by a party of Indians and adopted by two Seneca sisters. She progressively accommodated herself to Indian life, married two Indian warriors and bore them several children. Sixty-five years after her abduction, the woman agreed to tell James E. Seaver the story of her life. My goal is to use Lorrayne Carroll's rhetorical drag as a hermeneutic to analyze authorial impersonation in A Narrative of the Life of Mrs Mary Jemison, to underline the failure of the white male impersonator to marginalize the speaking voice of the narrative and to highlight the capacity of the I object/subject to destabilize canonical readings of the text and to offer a revisionist history of cross-cultural encounters. Thus, it is my intention to present this account as an instrument of defiance of hegemonic cultural models and as an example of how intercultural manifestations negotiate and hybridise fixed paradigms. En 1758, Mary Jemison fue capturada por un grupo de indios y adoptada por dos hermanas Seneca. Poco a poco, Mary se fue adaptando a la vida india y acabó casándose con dos guerreros indios con los que tuvo varios hijos. Sesenta y cinco años después de su secuestro, la mujer accedió a contarle a James E. Seaver la historia de su vida. Mis objetivos son: analizar El relato de la vida de la señora Mary Jemison mediante el concepto de máscara retórica acuñado por Lorrayne Carroll; destacar el fracaso del imitador hombre y blanco para marginalizar la voz narrativa; y subrayar la capacidad del yo objeto/sujeto para desestabilizar lecturas canónicas del texto y ofrecer una historia revisionista de los encuentros interculturales. Es mi intención presentar este relato como un desafío a los modelos culturales hegemónicos y como ejemplo de cómo las manifestaciones interculturales negocian y combinan paradigmas establecidos.<br>

Issue: i40048276<br>
Date: 9 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Keck Frédéric<br>
Abstract: En lisant l'œuvre de Lévy-Bruhl à travers le problème de la causalité mentale, on voit que le concept de participation, emprunté à la philosophie de Malebranche, lui permet de dépasser l'opposition entre deux conceptions : — d'une part, la « causalité naturelle » , empruntée à Tylor et à Tassociationnisme britannique, qui explique les opérations magiques par des erreurs intellectuelles ; — d'autre part, la « causalité sociale » , élaborée par Durkheim et la sociologie française, qui explique les phénomènes moraux et religieux par l'intervention de la « société » comme sujet collectif. Le concept de participation désigne un mode de causalité qui opère au niveau de l'expérience naturelle sans lui ajouter un niveau surnaturel et proprement social : « Cette analyse est comparable à celle de l'imagination chez Bergson et éclaire la réception ambivalente de Lévy-Bruhl dans la phénoménologie et dans le structuralisme. » Reading Lévy-Bruhl's work through the topic of mental causality, one sees that the concept of participation – borrowed from Malebranche's philosophy – enables him to overpass the opposition between two conceptions : — on the one hand, « natural causality », borrowed from Tylor and British associationnism, which accounts for magical operations through intellectual mistakes, and — on the other hand, « social causality », elaborated by Durkheim and French sociology, which accounts for moral and religious events through the intervention of society as a collective subject. The concept of participation refers to a mode of causality which works on the level of natural experience without adding to it a supernatural and specifically social level: « This analysis can be compared to that of imagination by Bergson, and throws a light on the ambivalent reception of Lévy-Bruhl by phenomenology and structuralism. »<br>

Author(s): Vieillard-Baron Jean-Louis<br>
Abstract: Divers ouvrages sur saint Augustin conduisent à reposer la question du temps et celle du sujet qui ont alors été réunies pour la première fois comme un unique problème : memoria, conscience et conscience de soi, sont pensées selon le temps comme un sentir primordial. Celui-ci suppose un lieu, le ciel des ciels, qui est le lieu temporel de l'homme auprès de Dieu. L'intériorité augustinienne a des antécédents dans la pensée antique ; elle a influencé la philosophie récente ; Heidegger interprète l'ego de Descartes d'une façon augustinienne dans son herméneutique de la facticité. Les questions suscitées par ces ouvrages viennent du manque actuel d'une histoire spéculative de l'ego, en même temps que d'une résurgence évidente de celui-ci dans le champ de la philosophie contemporaine. Several books about Augustine lead to question once more the topic of time and of the subject which then were united for the first time as a single problem : memoria, conscionsness and self conscionsness are thought according to time as a prime feeling. The latter supposes a place, heaven in heaven, which is the temporal seat of man next to God. Augustinian interiority has its antecedents within classical thought. It influenced recent philosophy. Heidegger interprets Descartes' ego in an Augustinian way within his hermeneutics of facticity. The topics at stake from these books surge from the present lack of a speculative history of the ego, together with an obvious resurgence of the latter within the field of contemporary philosophy.<br>

Abstract: En 1950, Paul Ricœur publia une imposante Philosophie de la volonté, vite brocardée par la vague structuraliste et les critiques de toute « philosophie de la conscience ». On y trouve notamment une analyse du phénomène de l'hésitation qui contient bien des éléments encore pertinents. Phénomène bien connu, l'hésitation n'a pas été vraiment thématisée en tant que telle, même si, comme le montre Ricœur, l'histoire de la philosophie est susceptible d'aider à le faire. Mais le doute cartésien, par exemple, n'est guère hésitant. Ce chapitre fourmille d'analyses denses mais claires, d'allusions qu'il faut expliciter, de métaphores « vives » très riches, qui permettent de concevoir un sujet se cherchant dans l'hésitation avant de se choisir dans la décision. Il y a là un concept indispensable à toute théorie de l'action. Philosophie de la volonté (Philosophy of Will), a major work published by Ricœur in 1950, was quickly derided by members of the structuralist trend and by those critical of every single « philosophy of consciousness ». The book includes notably an analysis of the phenomenon of hesitation, many elements of which are still relevant. Although a well known phenomenon, hesitation has never been fully analyzed in itself, even though the history of philosophy, as Ricœur shows, might be helpful in such an endeavor. Cartesian doubt, for instance, shows hardly any hesitation. This chapter is replete with dense yet clear discussions, with allusions that require elucidation, and with a wealth of vivid metaphors which help us to envisage a subject in search of himself through hesitation, before choosing himself through decision. Such a concept is indispensable for any theory of action.<br>

Abstract: Les préoccupations et les discours relatifs à l'Ethique ont peu à peu envahi la pensée contemporaine dans de nombreux domaines : médecine, biologie, économie, politique, sexualité, vie en société, etc. , Parallèlement, et en apparence de façon paradoxale, l'école s'est désintéressée de l'enseignement de la morale et fuit les sujets brûlants dont nous abreuvent les médias. Seule l'Instruction civique a retrouvé une place dans les programmes depuis 1985. L'article décrit l'évolution des conceptions en la matière depuis la fondation de l'école républicaine en 1880 jusqu'à nos jours et cherche à estimer l'impact qu'ont eu les instructions officielles dans les classes. Il apporte une explication hypothétique de la désaffection constatée et plaide pour une prise en compte, à tous les niveaux, des problèmes de valeurs dans l'enseignement. Debates concerning ethics sweep through contemporary thinking in many fields : médecine, biology, economics... Surprisingly school has neglected the teaching of ethics. Only civics has regained its place in the curriculum since 1985. The author makes a review of this subject teaching from 1880. He proposes an explanation for this loss of interest observed and set the case for taking into account the problems related to the teaching of values.<br>

Abstract: À partir d'une définition de l'éducation comme « relation dissymétrique, nécessaire et provisoire, visant à l'émergence d'un sujet », la pédagogie est proposée comme effort pour penser cette activité dans des situations données. Refusant une posture philosophique qui décrète l'existence du sujet pour le faire advenir, comme une attitude inspirée des sciences humaines qui abolit le sujet en réduisant ses actes à la résultante des forces qui s'exercent sur lui, la pédagogie peut se définir comme « anticipation contextualisée ». Dans cette perspective, elle requiert un discours qui exprime la singularité des sujets en situation et la mette en perspective d'universalité. Le récit peut avoir cette fonction et « faire théorie » sans, pour autant, s'abstraire des situations particulières qu'il décrit. La pédagogie comme « récits d'éducation » a alors pour fonction de favoriser la prise de décision éducative. Education being defined as "a dissymetric, necessary and temporary relation focusing on the emergence of a subject", pedagogy is considered as an endeavour to think this activity in given situations. If we refuse a philosophical position which decides the existence of a subject to make it turn into a reality - as an attitude inspired by human sciences which reduces the subject's acts to the resultant of forces exerced on him - pedagogy may be defined as a "contextualized anticipation". In this perspective, we must display the uniqueness of subjects in a specific situation and set it in a universal perspective. Narratives may have this function without neglecting the specificity of situations. Pedagogy as "narratives on education" is able to facilitate educational decision making.<br>

Abstract: Le discours de la recherche sur les enseignants et leurs savoirs est souvent tenté de détacher la connaissance du sujet connaissant, traduisant des préoccupations de fonctionnalité et de transférabilité des savoirs. À cette perspective rationaliste résiste néanmoins une mouvance de recherche qui défend une approche anthropologique du savoir enseignant, moins soucieuse de légiférer l'acte d'enseignement que de mettre au jour les formes complexes et locales de construction de l'enseignant-sujet et de ses savoirs, que ceux-ci soient inscrits dans une forme de vie, incarnés, ou dessinés réflexivement dans l'espace narratif. Ce courant phénoménologique et herméneutique, pluriel et très vivace dans le monde anglo-saxon, promeut le savoir ordinaire des enseignants, se démarquant ainsi des études attentives aux seuls savoirs ' extraordinaires' de l'expert. Traduisant un retour du sujet qui traverse les sciences sociales depuis la dernière décennie, cette tendance dans la recherche éducative à réhabiliter la subjectivité enseignante, sans pour autant la magnifier, adresse des questions importantes à notre champ de recherche sur les choix épistémologiques qui le guident. Research discourse on teachers and their knowledge has a tendency to separate knowledge from the one who knows as it is focusing on knowledge functionality and transfer. Nevertheless, one research movement is resisting to this rationalist perspective, preferring an anthropological approach of teachers' knowledge focusing on sophisticated and local forms of construction of knowledge and knowing subject rather than on teaching laws (these constructions being embodied or reflexively designed in narrative space). This multifaceted phenomenological and hermeneutic trend, observed in anglosaxon world, is promoting teachers' ordinary knowledge, when the majority of investigations focus only on expert knowledge. As it can be observed in all social sciences in this last decade, the importance of the subject - the teac~<br>

Abstract: Le rapport qu'entretiennent histoire et mémoire à l'école est complexe et ambigu. Jusqu'aux années quatrevingt-dix, il a surtout été posé comme la relation, légitimée ou dénoncée, entre savoirs historiques, histoire scolaire et mémoire nationale. Dès les années soixante, le débat prend en compte le rapport entre le récit national et des histoires régionalistes qui revendiquent une place dans la culture scolaire, au nom des identités et du droit au passé. Cette dernière acception prévaut largement à l'heure actuelle mais cette fois au nom des minorités dépossédées de leur histoire, dès lors qu'elle n'a pas d'expression publique. Dans ces débats, la mémoire serait la forme d'une histoire parallèle, occultée et clandestine ; de leur côté les historiens tendent à distinguer histoire et mémoire. L'histoire scolaire, elle, admet l'histoire mais non les mémoires comme savoir de référence légitime ; pourtant les commémorations et le « devoir de mémoire » s'y invitent de plus en plus fréquemment. De telles évolutions interrogent les composantes de la discipline scolaire : au premier chef les finalités et les contenus mais aussi les pratiques, inégalement connues dans ce domaine et, finalement, les apprentissages souvent plus espérés qu'avérés. The connection that exists at school between history and memory is complicated and ambiguous; it is source of debate and demands which recently intensified with public and political uses. School history accepts history but not memories as good legitimate reference. And yet commemoration ceremonies and the "duty to remember" are more and more in the schools. Such changes question the elements of that school subject: its purpose of building identity and citizenship, its contents and their changes, its teaching practices, not really evenly known in this field, and finally the learning that is more often wished for than actually delivered.

Abstract: Cette note de synthèse souligne la spécificité de la discipline enseignée. L'histoire scolaire occupe une position originale dans le champ des didactiques par la complexité de ses références (production savante, auto-référence scolaire et usages publics de l'histoire). Tendus entre une transmission de connaissances consensuelles et la recherche d'une posture critique, les objets d'histoire enseignés demeurent soumis à des questionnements renouvelés au gré de la demande sociale comme le montrent les récents débats autour des questions mémorielles vives et concurrentes. L'histoire enseignée apparaît ainsi comme un mixte articulant représentations sociales, savoirs privés et connaissances validées. Depuis une quinzaine d'années, des travaux ont permis de mieux cerner le « penser en histoire » et les processus cognitifs spécifiques en jeu dans la classe (temps historique, conceptualisation, problématisation, construction de schemes explicatifs). Des recherches contextualisées ont permis d'explorer les pratiques professionnelles effectives et d'en modéliser le fonctionnement « normal » : une discipline qui privilégie la transmission de savoirs disant la réalité du passé et attachée à la neutralité du texte enseigné ; une discipline qui peine à mettre en cohérence des finalités intellectuelles ambitieuses (outiller le citoyen actif dans la cité de demain) et des activités dans la classe souvent cantonnées à la mémorisation, au repérage et à la catégorisation. Aussi voit-on se dessiner dans les travaux actuels, une problématique centrée sur les écarts entre les intentions et les pratiques. En articulant la notion de soumission aux règles du « contrat didactique » avec les autres modèles théoriques des sciences humaines et sociales mobilisés au sein des équipes de recherche, les travaux menés de manière encore trop dispersée, laissent apparaître des acquis importants qui pourraient être pris en compte dans la formation des enseignants This paper underlines the specificity o~<br>

Abstract: Inspired by Pierre-Jean-Georges Cabanis' claim in 1798 that physicians might learn forms of medical reasoning from les anciens rhéteurs, in this paper I explore intimate associations between medicine and rhetoric over the longue durée. Gravely susceptible to error, medical reasoning relies on signs and examples, both gleaned from experience and both the subject of rhetorical inquiry; like rhetoric, medicine reaches plausible conclusions from probable premises. Here, ranging from Hippocrates and Plato through Aristotle to early modern England, I argue that forms of inference developed and refined in the history of rhetoric offer ancient and early modern philosophers and physicians models and metaphors for their own forays into the probable.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues that Meiji Shrine Memorial Art Gallery (Meiji Jingū Seitoku Kinen Kaigakan) was constructed as a mnemonic space, and that its construction concerned the making of history. The purpose of the gallery was to provide a historical narration of the Meiji period through 80 paintings depicting Emperor Meiji's life. It took over 20 years from the initial planning of the gallery to its completion in 1936 and, throughout the course of its creation, different acts of remembering took place both inside and outside the space of the gallery. It was the lengthy process of gallery construction, rather than the place itself that shaped what was to be remembered. Historiographers and painters strove to portray "real" history in the gallery's paintings. Historiographers investigated historical facts and determined the gallery's picture topics. Importantly, most of them were responsible for compiling two national historiographies, Dai Nihon ishin shiryō in the Ministry of Education and Meiji tennōki in the Imperial Household Agency. For the painters, the challenge lay in determining "realistic" styles of painting adequate to the representation of "real" history. Furthermore, physical constructors of the gallery played a part in perfecting its narrative structure, such as spatial arrangement of the pictures. The contrast between the expectations of the gallery's creators and the experience of the visitors, in terms of how the gallery was viewed as well as how it was to be viewed, is also the subject of this paper.<br>

Abstract: Taking seriously Linda Martin Alcoff s suggestion that we reevaluate the extent to which poststructuralist artkuhtions of the subject are truly socially constituted, as well as the centrality of Latina identity to her own account of such constitution, I argue that the discussion Alcoff and other Latina feminists offer of the experience of being Latina in North America is illustrative of the extent to which the refotional and globally situated constitution of subjects needs further development in many social-constructionist accounts of selfhood. I argue, however — contra Alcoff — that Michel Foucault I s mode of investigating subjectivation, particularly as it is articulated in his later work, has room for just such an account, especially when it is supplemented by postcohnial theory. With this end in mind, I take as a case study the public discourse surrounding Sonia Sotomayor prior to her confirmation as the first Latina woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court, suggesting that an analysis of this discourse (including its position within and contribution to wider discourses of ethnicity, race, gender, and chss) shows why the accounts of relational subject-constitution offered by both Foucault and Alcoff are indispensable.<br>

Abstract: By deliberately placing ethics under the category of communication, Kierkegaard intended to show that it is like no other science. He distinguished between direct communication and indirect communication. Direct communication concerns objectivity and knowledge; indirect communication, on the other hand, has to do with subjectivity ("becoming-subject"). In this paper, the author presents Kierkegaard's philosophy of communication and ethics with special emphasis on his irony and pseudonymous authorship. He also examines the possibility of a discourse in business ethics, focusing on the educational perspective. He discusses Kierkegaard's aspects of communication—the communicator, the receiver, and the object—with particular reference to applied ethics. He argues that the Kierkegaardian notion of indirect communication can contribute to renewing business ethics teaching—which in his view is more art than science—in two important ways: (1) when the ethics teacher changes his position in the teacher/learner relationship; and (2) when the relationship between communicator/receiver is strengthened at the expense of the object.<br>

Abstract: Attention to bodies has transformed the study of religion in the past thirty years, aiding the effort to overcome the discipline's Protestant biases by shifting interest from beliefs to practices. And yet much of this work has unwittingly perpetuated an individualist notion of the religious subject. Although religionists are now well aware that bodies cannot be studied apart from the social forces that shape them, all too often the religious subject stands alone in a crowd, participating in communal rituals, subject to religious authorities and disciplinary practices, but oddly detached from intimate relationships. In this article, I first argue that the turn to the body was motivated by what it appeared to reject: theoretical questions about subjectivity. I then seek to challenge prevailing trends by arguing that these same theoretical insights should now prod us to attend to the import of intimacy and personal relationships.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I sketch a reconstruction of the basic psychoanalytic conception of the mind in terms of two historical resources: the conception of the subject developed in post-Kantian idealism, and Spinoza's laws of the affects in Part Three of the Ethics. The former, I suggest, supplies the conceptual basis for the psychoanalytic notion of the unconscious, while the latter defines the type of psychological causality of psychoanalytic explanations. The imperfect fit between these two elements, I claim, is reflected in familiar conceptual difficulties surrounding psychoanalytic theory and explanation.<br>

Abstract: The author presents a concise and peculiar view on the studies and researches which have been developed in the last 30 years or so about the social dimension of time. The article underlies the persisting validity of the idea of time as a socio-cultural institution (Durkheim and his school) and as a social construction (Berger and Luckmann); it also hints at the concept of «temporal culture», which has been rarely employed in studies concerning social times. According to the author, the main transformation concerning social times today is represented by the consequences of globalization and related aspects, such as «agglutination» of experiences concerning communication through space-time. In the last paragraph the question of rhythm in general and particularly of social rhythms is discussed: the author argues that this concept, distinct from time, deserves much more attention than it has received until now by social scientists interested in the subject.<br>

Abstract: O artigo é uma leitura do debate epistemológico sobre as condições de conhecimento na antropologia. Partindo das críticas que o próprío C. Geertz faz a seus seguidores, a autora se propõe a avaliar o potencial crítico da hermenêutica. Recupera seu questionamento acerca da oposiçâo sujeito/objeto e propõe a busca de uma objetividade negociada interpares e situada historicamente. A partir desse debate questiona-se uma ciência pura e sem implicações práticas e morais. O percurso que faz avaliando vários autores lhe permite concluir que o excesso de relativismo ou de subjetivismo transforma toda possibilidade de ciência em ficção. Para dar conta em sua etnografia dos sistemas simbólicos não lingüísticos, a autora busca um diálogo entre a teoría antropológica e as teorias nativas e afirma que é na experiência vivida em campo que está a fertilidade das perguntas e reformulações de conceitos da antropologia. This article is an attempt to interpret the epistemological debate concerning conditions of knoledge in antropology. Discussing the criticism which C. Geertz has made in regard to the work of his followers, the autor proposes to evaluate the critical potential of hermeneutics. A critique of the subject-object split opens the way for proposing a form of objectivity wich is historically located and negotiated among equals. This debate constitutes a point os departure for questioning the notion of a pure science devoid of moral and practical implications. In the course of discussing a number of authors, the conclusion may well be that excessive relativism and subjectivism transform all possibilities of science into fiction. In order to deal with nonlinguistic symbolic systems in etnography, the author sees the importance of dialogue between anthropological theory and native theory. Fertile grounds for raising questions and reformulating anthropological concepts are found in fieldword experience.<br>

Abstract: This review article discusses the emergence of the subsequent proceedings before the US Military Tribunals from the shadows of the trial of 'Major War Criminals' at the International Military Tribunal as explored in Kevin Jon Heller's The Nuremberg Military Tribunals and the Origins of International Criminal Law. The article applauds Heller's efforts in producing a detailed examination of an understudied aspect of the origins of international criminal law. The essay suggests that given the specific focus of the author on the genealogy of international criminal law, important legal historical questions are left unexamined. It suggests a research agenda that would focus more specifically on the centrality of the Shoah to National Socialism and argues that the current trend in historical scholarship focusing on war crimes trials as a distinct subject of inquiry could provide a fruitful basis for future socio-legal research into the Nazi state and its legal apparatus.<br>

Abstract: Any praxis is inscribed in time. To what extent does man's perception of time leave an inprint on Saussurian 'langue' ? Revisiting a well-beaten track in linguistic studies, we propose to give this farreaching question a partial answer concerning the opposition between French imparfait and passé simple. We first capture the opposition between those two tenses in a passive way, in which man as a subject (subjected to...) bears witness to the flow of time from future to past; we then capture the opposition in an active way, in which man as a project bears witness to the flow of time from past to future. This two-fold representation bears on the opposition between imperfect and simple past. It is shown next that linguistic theories view tenses as markers of localisation in time whereas verb forms also help mark how the time implied by the process is viewed, what orientation is given to it. Our contention is that implied time is represented in a downward fashion (particularisation) with imperfect and in an upward fashion (generalisation) with simple past.<br>

Abstract: S'appuyant sur un corpus de textes adolescents adressés au site Internet www.filsantejeunes.com, notre analyse tente de cerner le problème de l'indicibilité du sensible, puisque la plupart de ces textes se limitent à élaborer un discours sur le corps, ses difficultés à être la source de bien-être, à se conformer aux normes de beauté, et n'abordent pas le phénomène, l'expérience de perception du monde. La théorie des instances proposée par Jean-Claude Coquet permet de rendre compte de cette impossibilité de dire le sensible, laquelle serait due à une mise en tension conflictuelle des deux instances du non-sujet et du sujet. Ce conflit sans issue peut aboutir à des comportements de boulimie et/ou d'anorexie, aux conséquences graves pour la santé, voire la vie du sujet. La psychothérapie, dans ces cas-là, devrait viser une réconciliation des instances. Ces textes adolescents constituant des exemples d'écriture autobiographique, genre discursif très prisé à l'adolescence, permettent aussi de contribuer à l'analyse de la genèse de ce genre littéraire, où s'impose la reprise différée, par le sujet adulte voire vieillissant, d'expériences anciennes de l'instance non-sujet, expériences corporelles de prise directe avec le monde. This analysis, based on a corpus of texts by teenagers posted on www.filsantejeunes. com, tries to take the measure of the issue of the impossibility of expressing in language the experience of sensing the world -since most of these texts are content to limit themselves to elaborating discourses about the body, its difficulties at being a source of happiness, at conforming to norms of beauty, and do not deal with the phenomenon, namely the experience of perceiving the world. The theory of instances, or of the grounding of utterance, elaborated by Jean-Claude Coquet, can explain this impossibility of expressing in language the experience of sensing the world: it is due to a conflict between the two instances, the grounding in the subject or in the no~<br>

Abstract: En explicitant le concept linguistique de prédicat et en étendant sa portée, l'auteur introduit et définit celui de « prédicat somatique », responsable de l'expression du sensible dans le langage. Il en illustre la pertinence et en spécifie le contenu analytique à travers trois exemples. La reprise critique de l'analyse du « sein nu » dans Palomar d'I. Calvino par A. J. Greimas (dans De l'imperfection) permet de dégager les propriétés du « corps percevant ». L'analyse d'un énoncé de la mère de Jamel Debbouze dans Télérama fait ressortir l'expression corporelle d'une vérité « refoulée, proscrite, par le langage », un « ça » vrai, expression d'un non-sujet immanent. Enfin, la relation fondamentale entre « l'acte politique » et « le corps parlant » est dégagée à partir de positions exprimées par Jean-Claude Milner et ici analysées dans la perspective du « prédicat somatique », dont trois variétés se trouvent ainsi dégagées au terme de l'article. Developing and extending the validity of the linguistic concept of predicate, the author introduces and defines the notion of "somatic predicate", responsible for expressing in language the experience of the senses. Three examples both show the notion's pertinence and specify its content. A critical reappraisal of A. J. Greimas' analysis of the « naked breast » in Italo Calvino's Palomar (in De l'imperfection) leads to defining me characteristics of the « perceiving body ». The analysis of an utterance of Jamel Debbouze's mother in Télérama stresses the physical, bodily expression of a truth "repressed, prohibited, by language", a true "id", the expression of an immanent non-subject. Finally, the fundamental relation between the "political act" and the "speaking body" is shown through opinions expressed by Jean-Claude Milner which are here analysed from the perspective of a "somatic predicate", three varieties of which have thus been described and defined by the end of the article.<br>

Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Abstract: Através de urna abordagem metodológica centrada na reflexão dialética, o presente artigo tem como principal objetivo questionar urna suposta essencialidade natural ou cultural da natureza humana associada as experiencias religiosas e ao sagrado. Este tema constitui uma aporia, pois a religiosidade do ser humano pode ser concebida como fenómeno cultural e natural, humano e sobre-humano, social e individual. Além da indagação sobre a naturalidade ou culturalidade da religião no ser humano, algumas perguntas colocadas no artigo, designadamente na problematização, visam acirrar o pensamento critico sobre esta temática em torno da essencialidade da natureza humana, tais como: a religiosidade é um fenómeno humano, natural e atemporal ou é social, cultural e temporal? É um fenómeno racional ou consciente enquanto alimento da esperança? Tendo em conta que a religiosidade está associada a determinados valores, será racional porque os fins das práticas respondem as convicçôes e aos ditos valores e porque o sentido da experiencia religiosa está inscrito ñas formas de linguagem e de conduta, bem como nos valores que as motivam? Through a methodological approach centered on reflection and dialectics, the main purpose of this article is to inquiry a hypothetical natural or cultural essence of human nature, which is associated with religious experiences and the sacred. This theme is an aporia, because the religiosity of the human being can be conceived as a cultural and natural, human and superhuman, social and individual phenomenon. Besides the questioning about natural or cultural religion in human beings, some questions placed in the article, namely in the questioning part, aim to sharpen critical thinking on this subject around the essence of human nature, such as: Is the religiosity a human, natural and timeless phenomenon, or it is social, cultural and temporal? Is it a rational or conscious phenomenon to feed hope? Given that religiosity is associated with certain values, w~<br>

This image is analysed, taking as reference Manet's Déjeuner sur l'herbe as well as Walter Benjamin's essay of 1936 on the subject of the narrator. The main points in this comparative analysis are the role of the narrator both in text and image, oral tradition versus visual space, the concept of the picture and the tradition of story representation. The author proposes the idea that modernity introduced a major change in the art of storytelling and in the narrative function of image.<br>

Abstract: Depuis le Sakuteiki (Notes sur l'arrangement des jardins, XIe siècle) jusqu'aux jardins de daïmyôs de l'époque d'Edo (1603-1867), le jardin japonais est empreint d'une tendance marquée à référer les formes de ses constituants à des sites et à des paysages modèles dénommés « sites de renom » (meisho). Ce système de référence est appelé mitate, ce qui signifie littéralement « instituer par le regard ». Cela se rapporte, d'une part, au principe de la métaphore, et, d'autre part, au dynamisme fondamental des localisations dans l'écoumène, tel que l'illustrent le couple topos/chôra dans le Timée et la distinction que fait Nishida entre logique d'identité du sujet et logique d'identité du prédicat. Fron the Sakuteiki (Notes on the making of gardens, XIth c.) to daimyos gardens of the Edo period (1603-1867), the Japanese gardens display a prominent tendency to refer its material forms to paradigmatic places and landscapes, called « places with a name » (meisho). This system of reference was called mitate, which literaly means « instituting by seeing ». It is here related, on the one hand, to the principle of metaphor, and on the other hand to the fundamental dynamics of place in the ecumene, as illustrated by the couple topos/chôra in the Timaios and by Nishida's dictinstion between a logic of the identity of the subject and a logic of the identity of the predicate (or logic of place).<br>

Abstract: The article presents an analysis of the concept of „subject“ in ethnography from its historical origins through its development over the span of the 20th century. Furthermore, based on her own experience of different cultures, the author conføonts the implicit Western philosophical background in anthropological conceptualisations of the subject and the ethnographic research with alternative philosophical frameworks, specifically the reflexive approach developed by female anthropologists. The main focus of the text lies on a re-conceptualisation of the ethnographic research as an inter-subjective process, and on a new emphasis on the role of the subject in the culture-productive processes of symbolic negotiation.<br>

Abstract: On sait combien l'Allemagne fédérale a construit sa légitimité démocratique sur le traitement de la mémoire de la Shoah. Mais comment la communauté juive présente dans le pays a-t-elle reçu cette mémoire ? Cet article tente de répondre a cette question en s'appuyant notamment sur la presse judéo-allemande et en dressant une chronologie depuis la guerre. Dorothea Bohnekamp montre comment, apres la désillusion des communautes juives apres 1945 face à l'absence d'intérêt manifeste par les autorités à leur endroit, 1952 représente un tournant, quand l'attention portee à la vie juive en Allemagne devient un critère d'évaluation de la democratisation de la RFA. L'après-1989 constitue une nouvelle étape, avec l'arrivée massive de Juifs russophones renouvelant la vie communautaire. Toutefois les debats passionnés sur le Musée juif de Berlin ou sur le Mémorial de l'Holocauste invitent à se demander dans quelle mesure les Juifs vivant en Allemagne ne sont pas en définitive dépossédés de la mémoire de la Shoah au profit des descendants des bourreaux. Centrale au sein de la culturelle mémorielle allemande, la mémoire de la Shoah reste un imperatif politique fort en République fédérale allemande, dont Pidentite democratique s'est construite en opposition absolue au nazisme. Après le déni des crimes nazis dans l'après-guerre, la réactivation du passé depuis les annees 1970 participe d'une représentation politique du judaïsme considérée comme symbole de la culture républicaine du pays. Or, les nombreuses expressions de la culture mémorielle en Allemagne (musées, mémoriaux, etc.) ont souvent été sujet à polémique, dans la mesure où leur utilisation publique reflète aussi la difficulté à imprimer une logique collective à des souvenirs traumatiques irréductiblement individuels. Si les communautés judéo-allemandes renaissent depuis la Réunification, elles ne se sentent pas toujours pleinement représentees par la culture memorielle officielle et restent réfractaires a toute instrumenta~<br>

Author(s): Christoff Daniel<br>
Abstract: La signe comme expression (Husserl) consiste selon F. de Saussure dans le rapport immotivé signifíant-signifíé, sa valeur signifiante étant déterminée par la place du signifiant dans le système réel de la langue tandis que le signifié-concept (de Saussure) est noème, irréel (Husserl). Inerte tant qu'aucun acte d'expression ou de compréhension ne l'anime (ré-anime), il porte, exprime et induit l'intentionnalité de ces actes; il est conscience hors de soi, intentionnalité sans sujet, visée du signifié différenciée par son signifiant (objet d'une science de faits, la linguistique). Aussi les problèmes du «sujet», de l' «origine», de la «suffisance» du signe adéquat, de l'«insuffisance» du signe qui, en son ouverture, exprime au-delà de lui-même, exigent-ils l'élucidation du champ de signification, notamment des figures métonymiques ou métaphoriques qui y apparaissent. According to F. de Saussure a sign or an expression (Husserl) is constituted by the unmotivated relation between the signifier and the signified, the value of the signifier is determined by the position it occupies in the real system of language, while the signified concept (de Saussure) is a noema, i.e. unreal (Husserl). Inactive, as long as there is no act of expression or understanding to (re) activate it, the concept carries the intentionality of these acts, conveys it and leads us to it. It constitutes a consciousness outside of the self, an intentionality without a subject, a target of the signified, as differentiated by the signifier (the object of a science, the linguistics). In this sense the solution to the problems concerning the «subject», the «origin», the «sufficiency» of an adequate sign, the «insufficiency» of a sign, when it signifies things other than itself, requires the clarification of the idea of a field of meaning, especially the meaning of occurring metonymies and metaphors. Das Zeichen als Ausdruck (Husserl) besteht nach F. de Saussure in der unmotivierten Beziehung Bezeichnendes-~<br>

Publisher: Beauchesne<br>
Issue: i40117652<br>
Date: 12 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): THOUARD Denis<br>
Abstract: Si l'on admet que l'herméneutique part de la reconnaissance d'une intention de signifier donnée déposée dans des signes, force est de considérer que l'entreprise kantienne s'y oppose, aussi bien d'un point de vue systématique que d'un point de vue historique. On critiquera à cette occasion la tentative de tirer du kantisme, en particulier de la troisième Critique, un point de départ pour une herméneutique. L'étude de « l'herméneutique morale » de l'écrit sur la religion replacé dans le contexte de la critique biblique de son époque apporte une confirmation des analyses systématiques et souligne les limites du dispositif kantien. Les reproches adressés par les tenants de « l'école mythique » de Göttingen (J. G. Eichhorn, J. G. Rosenmüller, G. L. Bauer) à la Religion dans les limites de la simple raison reviennent à distinguer nettement jugement et interprétation : Kant met en oeuvre un jugement, et non une interprétation. If one admits that the starting point of hermeneutics is a recognition of an intention to signify facts left in signs, then one must recognize that the project of Kant is opposed to this starting point, both from a systematic and historical point of view. The temptation to take from the works of Kant, especially the Third Critique, a starting point for hermeneutics will be subject to analysis. A study of « moral hermeneutics » that is drawn from the texts of religion (and which is done within the context of the biblical criticism of their period) confirms the analysis et underlines the limits of the Kantian plan of action. The criticisms of the « l'école mythique » of Göttingen (J. G. Eichhorn, J. G. Rosenmüller, G. L. Bauer) aimed at Religion within the limits of simple reason aid to clearly distinguish between judgement and interpretation. Kant implements a judgment and not an interpretation.<br>

Abstract: L'épistémologie d'Émile Meyerson vise à expliquer le réalisme spontané des physiciens en termes anthropologiques. À cette fin, le philosophe met à contribution les ressources des sciences humaines naissantes. Cependant, nous montrons qu'une telle philosophie des sciences y gagnerait à considérer d'autres aspects de l'expérience psychologique et sociale. Eugène Minkowski Arnaud Dandieu et Jacques Lacan — qui se réclament tous des travaux de Meyerson — nous permettent de percevoir une dimension insoupçonnée du principe épistémo logique d'identité, car l'identification des objets, décrite avec tant de précision par Meyerson, est toujours compliquée par l'identification du sujet de la science avec d'autres sujets au sein d'une culture donnée. Emile Meyerson's epistemology aims at explaining the spontaneous physicists' realism in anthropological terms. Consequently, the philosopher uses the resources of the newly born human sciences. Yet, we argue that such a philosophy of sciences would gain at considering other aspects of social and psychological experience. Eugène Minkowski, Arnaud Dandieu et Jacques Lacan — all indebted with Meyerson's work — enable us to perceive an unseen dimension of the epistemological principle of identity : for the identification of objects, so precisely described by Meyerson, is always complicated by the identification of the subject of science with other subjects inside a peculiar culture.<br>

La subjectivité est pensée à partir des restes de l'analyse structurale comme un témoignage de sociétés en voie de recomposition. This article presents a reading of the major texts of Claude Lévi-Strauss, from Tristes Tropiques to Mythologies through The savage mind, linking the theme of the dissolution of the subject with the horizon of an ecological catastrophe that orients its development.

Abstract: This paper explores the content given to the term rhetoric and some of the history of its changes. It begins with the sophistic emphasis on persuasion as a means of coming to terms with the phenomenal world around us, through to a modern conception of rhetoric as a deconstructive and critical tool in analysing the power-play of meaning that constitutes texts. This paper tries to reflect on some of these changes, arguing that understanding the term implies that one must also examine the surplus of meaning that informs it. While the word rhetoric is highly ambiguous, this paper tries to demonstrate that such ambiguity need not be viewed as a trial and a hindrance in the search for a correct definition as a precursor for effective discussion on the subject. Instead it argues that an investigation into rhetoric's surplus of meaning is perhaps what constitutes effective discussion in the first place, and that further, such surplus of meaning is one that can be characterised as far more unified than commonly assumed which enables one do more with the term rhetoric than previously thought of, or allowed.

Abstract: After demonstrating that scripture's truth has always to be negotiated in terms of changing contexts, and after demonstrating that this is precisely what the church has already done with regard to remarriage, this essay argues that the church's teaching on marriage as an event is an increasingly irrelevant Victorian construct, not the originary will of God; and is maintained only by disregard – disregard of the hermeneutical nature of scripture's teachings on marriage, disregard of the process–understanding of marriage which has always dominated Africa and which is increasingly dominating global culture as a whole, and disregard of the church's teachings, even by active and committed members of the church. The essay argues that the hermeneutical nature of the Bible's teaching on this subject, as well as the church's own approach to remarriage, gives the church the responsibility to frame a Christian process-understanding of marriage which will better enable people to build stable, lifelong unions.<br>

Abstract: The use of metaphor, transposed from small to large units of speech is analogical to the structuralist transfer of the laws of language organisation from units of levels below the sentence to units of an order above or equal to the sentence. The metaphor can be defined as a word in counterdetermining context. The unconventional contextual use of the metaphoric term creates a tension which can be explained in terms of the interaction view of metaphor. The metaphor functions as a contextual filter which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the principal subject by implying statements about it that normally apply to the subsidiary subject. The contextualisation of a text can be defined as a text in counter-determining context. The tension between text and contemporary context or discourse is reminiscent of the tension between vehicle and frame in the metaphor. The contextualisation functions as contextual filter of the text which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the context or discourse by implying statements about it that normally apply to the text in its conventional or original context or discourse. As an activity, the metaphor, as well as the contextualisation has socio-political significance since it is determined by the discourse of the reader or contextualiser.<br>

Abstract: The present methodological debate about the need for a particular theological perspective when researching on the subject of contemporary church history raises central issues about the question of the validity of theology as a subject for scientific investigations. On the one hand, we should seek to avoid any dualtrack approach which would question the whole notion claimed by theologians to be advancing the cause of truth in a scientific manner. On the other hand, theology is a "thorn in the flesh" for the world of scholarship, since it seeks to guarantee openness as a central maxim in scholarly research, and to oppose any reductionist tendency which would pervert the secular methods of scholarly work by advancing the monopolistic claim of a systematic, ideological atheism. The right of theologians to propose their own special approach to theological questions should not be based on abstract principle, but is better defended-drawing on the researches of Itopper, Ricoeur and Marrou-as being in accordance with man's sinful nature and pragmatically meaningful. Drawing a distinction between the discovery of knowledge and assessment of its meaning can lead to a positive evaluation of experiences and their various connections. Any examination of experience, from a theological or ecclesiastical point of view, should not therefore be dismissed as illegitimate. Rather, it can add a valuable dimension in producing new horizons and perspectives. Of course, any such theological endeavour will still be subject to the rigorous disciplines of interdisciplinary discourse. Church history, as well as contemporary church history, is therefore in some ways competing with other historical disciplines. They are all attempting to make sense out of the welter of events by means of a theoretical ordering of experience. As such they provide a desirable, but by no means an exclusive, method of guiding men and women in their on-going search for insights into the nature of the world, man and Go~<br>

Issue: i40128002<br>

Author(s): Daniels John<br>
Abstract: Desire is examined here with a view to informing a theological response to capitalism. The notion of mimetic desire offered by René Girard is used as a starting point, Girard's ideas being brought into critical engagement with, first, other intersubjective accounts, namely those offered by Alexandre Kojève and by psychoanalysis in its Freudian and Lacanian variants; and then the account of desire as productive becoming offered by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, in which the link to capitalism is explicit. It is suggested that both mimetic desire and its productive counterpart can be understood as asserting the priority of desire itself over both subject and object. The possibilities for framing a coherent theological account of desire which is both mimetic and productive are then assessed with reference to Bernard of Clairvaux, Aquinas and Augustine, noting that accepting a metaphysics of participation makes plausible a productive desire which is nonetheless coded as a mimesis of the divine precedent. Such a conclusion brings into relief the inevitable difficulty of reconciling Christian and capitalist economies of desire.<br>

Abstract: Tamburlaine's insistence on making his audience see his sovereign power is a means by which he can organize and control alterity by fixing himself in specular relation to his objects. As the palpable reflections of his identity, Tamburlaine's sights of power produce effects of dramatic literalization by which he can maintain his unified and stable position as sole emperor: the play orders its field of vision by constructing an imaginary subject in fixed relation to its objects. The play, to the extent that it posits stable links between a subject and its images, and between signifiers and signifieds generally, creates a delusional space in which absolute sovereignty becomes possible. The effects of sovereignty, however, continue to define not only the theatrical space of the play, but the space of interpretation as well: critics have tried to account for the contest between aspiration and limitation in Tamburlaine by invoking concepts of theme, genre, character, and author in order to make sense of and therefore stabilize the play's conflicting gestures. Like Tamburlaine, the critic constructs an imaginary space by creating objects in relation to which he can confirm his own unity and power. Tamburlaine thus becomes a figure for the claims of sovereignty that mark all acts of interpretation.<br>

Abstract: L'article analyse les difficultés de constitution d'un champ de recherches autonome autour de la ville en France tout en repérant les fructueuses pistes ouvertes par les recherches récentes pour cerner la spécificité de l'urbain. Trois d'entre elles sont approfondies: l'entrée par l'espace, l'attention à la diversité des acteurs, la valorisation du changement urbain. Ces trois interrogations sont déclinées sur des terrains urbains variés et des époques différentes, montrant que les convergences de la recherche en histoire urbaine passent par un intérêt primordial pour l'expérimentation et le dialogue avec d'autres disciplines. This paper analyzes the difficulties of conducting independent research on the subject of the city in France, while exploring fruitful areas of study opened by recent scholarship that defines the urban specificity. Three of these areas are dealt with in depth: the introduction of space as an analytical tool, attention to diverse forces, and the development of urban changes. These three areas draw upon varied urban fields of study at different times, thus showing how urban history research converges on key subjects for experimentation and dialogue with other disciplines.<br>

Author(s): Werbner Pnina<br>
Abstract: This paper contrasts intersectionality, the negative definition of identities, and multiple identities, the situational valorisation of positive identities, to argue for a generational shift in the performance of everyday multiculturalism in Britain. In everyday encounters, actors work to sustain the definition of the situation (Goffman) and with it a surface of civility and mutual respect which are nevertheless morally compelling. Everyday relationships flow smoothly and naturally, in an unreflexive, taken-for-granted way, to constitute shared positive identities (Schutz). Such surface civility may, however, be disrupted by communicative breakdowns whenever participants do not share implicit systems of relevancy. Deconstructive analyses that probe beneath the surface of the everyday can also reveal the existence of negative identities, subject to discrimination and stigmatisation. This paper contrasts the experience of first-generation Commonwealth immigrants to Britain with that of successive generations, who unreflexively displayed a shared British identity during the London 2012 Olympics.<br>

Author(s): PAYEN Pascal<br>
Abstract: A l'intérieur du corpus des Vies parallèles de Plutarque, la Vie de Sertorius offretrois singularités : elle est la seule qui se déroule presque en totalité en Occident ; elle appartient au seul couple - Sertorius-Eumène — où le Romain est placé en premier ; le récit ne couvre pas la durée d'une vie, mais isole dix années (83/2 à 73 av. J.-C). Comment rendre compte ensemble de ces trois données situées sur des plans différents ? Les Vies parallèles délimitent un espace qui, à la fin du Ier siècle et au début du IIe, correspond au monde dominé par Rome, devenue garante et protectrice d'une histoire commune. Or autant l'Orient a reçu l'empreinte dts Grecs et des Romains, autant l'Occident est resté à l'écart. Ainsi formulera-t-on l'hypothèse que le sujet principal de cette Vie, tout autant que le personnage même de Sertorius, est l'Espagne, ou plus exactement l'extrême Occident, qui fait écho à l'extrême Orient, aussi bien à l'intérieur du récit (avec l'épisode de la troisième guerre de Mithridate) qu'au sein de l'ensemble des Vies. L'objet de cette étude est donc d'étudier en quoi une source grecque, postérieure de deux siècles aux événements qu'elle rapporte, témoigne de la place et de la fonction de l'extrême Occident dans la Méditerranée gréco-romaine, et, en cela, de mettre au jour quelques-unes des contraintes que pose, en tant que source, la Vie de Sertorius pour l'étude de l'Hispanie de la fin de la République. Within the corpus of Plutarch's Parallel Lives, the Life of Sertorius presents three peculiarities: it is the only one to take place almost entirely in the West; it belongs to the only couple -Sertorius-Eumenes- in which the Roman is given precedence; the narrative does not cover a whole lifetime but isolates ten years (83/2 to 73 BC). How then take together and account for those three facts situated at different levels ? The Parallel Lives delimits a space which, by the end of the 1st century and the beginning of the second, corresponds to a world unde~<br>

Abstract: Selon un débat ouvert dès le Ve siècle avant notre ère et cristallisé par les réflexions d'Aristote dans la Poétique, l'enquête historique serait tenue de rapporter ce qui a lieu ou a eu lieu, dans le temps sans limite et indéfini des hommes, accumulant des faits particuliers. Le projet des historiens serait-il de s'épuiser à dresser ainsi un infini et impossible "inventaire du monde" ? Dans le contexte des cités, la prose historique et le périple géographique correspondent à de nouvelles formes d'enquête et proposent des mises en ordre du savoir inédites. Leurs auteurs s'interrogent sur leurs capacités démonstratives et sur les moyens de parvenir à une "vue d'ensemble" (Polybe) des "événements qui surviennent du fait des hommes" (Hérodote), que l'objet d'étude porte sur une très courte période, comme chez Thucydide ou concerne l'ensemble du "monde habité", dans la Géographie de Strabon. Cette étude analyse, notamment à partir des termes άνθρωποι et οικουμένη, comment ces auteurs répondent à un des défis de la narration historique et de la description géographique qui consiste à inscrire la généralisation dans le cadre du particulier. According to the debate opened up as early as the Vth century before our era and condensed by Aristotle's reflections in the Poetics, historical enquiry would be bound to account for what does or did take place in men's limitless and indefinite time, thus piling up particular facts. Would the historians' goal be to exhaust themselves in thus drawing up an endless and impossible "inventory of the world" ? In the context of the cities, historical prose and geographic circumnavigation correspond to new forms of enquiry and propound unheard of ways of setting knowledge into order. Their authors inquire into their demonstrative abilities and the means to obtain "a general view" (Polybius) "of the events that happen through men's agency" (Herodotus), whether the subject under study bears on a very short period, as with Thucydides, or concern~<br>

Issue: i40153127<br>

Author(s): Falque Emmanuel<br>
Abstract: Au lieu de soi marque un Haut Lieu du soi. Dans cette perspective, la hauteur du sujet s'acquiert par la verticalité (transcendance), et non pas uniquement par l'horizontalité (immanence). Interrogeant l'ambition d'une approche de saint Augustin du point de vue de saint Augustin lui-même, on montrera d'abord le mérite d'un tel renouvellement dans le cadre de la philosophie comme telle : la question de l'homme, le poids du soi, et le statut de l'èros. Une noble « disputatio théologique et phénoménologique » cependant naîtra dans la confrontation avec d'autres ouvrages (en particulier Dieu, la chair et l'autre. D'Irénée à Duns Scot [PUF, « Épiméthée » , 2008]) : doit-on nécessairement « dépasser » la métaphysique dans un tiers ordre, ou ne convient-il pas plutôt de la « transformer de l'intérieur » dans le geste que semble avoir accompli le Docteur d'Hippone lui-même ? Il en va ici du statut de la philosophie dans son rapport ci la métaphysique et à la théologie, mais aussi de la possibilité d'une « nouvelle pratique phénoménologique de la philosophie médiévale », pour aujourd'hui comme pour demain. In Place of the Self marks what we might call a « high point of the self ». From this exalted perspective the measure of the subject is taken in its verticality (transcendence) and not simply its horizontality (immanence). Jean-Luc Marion approaches St. Augustine from the point of view of St. Augustine himself, and in this article I show first the merit of such an approach within a philosophical framework, its relevance to topics such as the question of man, the burden of the self and the status of eros. A significant « theological and phenomenological disputatio » does, however, arise when In Place of the Self is put up against other works (in particular against God, the Flesh and the Other : from Irenaeus to Duns Scotus [PUF, « Épiméthée » , 2008]). Do we have to « overcome » metaphysics by moving to another order of analysis ? Is it not better to work from the inside, i~<br>

Abstract: Psychology has uncritically adopted the individual person as its object of study without examining the concept and role of personhood within contemporary society and Western culture more generally. We examine three perspectives that challenge this familiar and unexamined object of our disciplinary inquiry: (1 ) Critical Theory's concept of the bourgeois individual as psychology's subject of ideology; (2) Poststructuralism's challenge to the concept of personhood as an integrated and self-present center of consciousness and action; (3) System Theory's alternative epistemology in which relations rather than entities have primacy. Each perspective introduces a concept of personhood that significantly differs from our present understanding of psychology's subject and that lays the foundation for a new subject of psychological inquiry: a multicentered, multidimensional subject.<br>

Author(s): Medina Rafael Alarcón<br>
Abstract: Using postwar El Salvador as a case study, I argue against the dominant paradigm that situates the repressive role of the state as both the central object of memorialization and the main subject of history. Instead, I focus on the ways in which the memory of insurgent collective action is constructed among young members of the popular classes in postwar El Salvador. Drawing on extensive ethnographic research in the communities of northern Morazán, I understand memory as the suspended time of praxis. Media—such as Internet, Facebook, and TV play a key role in this process, impinging on the ways youth relate with the revolutionary past of their relatives making sense of their present living conditions. I argue that memory must be understood as a particular form of praxis, one that is embedded in historic concrete forms of class constitution in which the role of media has become a constitutive element in the labors of memory, particularly among young people.<br>

Abstract: Can a historical event, such as Partition, be understood as an action that "resulted" from complex, wide forces of history or also as an event continually brought into being by the play of subject memories? A relationship of complementarity exists between the problems internal to history and the demands and desires of memory, so much so that together they form integral parts of a single operation, the historiographical operation. Yet memory sometimes appears the obverse of history making. Human action, as this article remonstrates, sometimes overcomes the bounds of passivity imposed by memory and this is also what determines history.<br>

Abstract: What makes the figure of the passenger distinctive as both a subject and an object of mobility and transportation systems? What distinguishes the passenger from other mobile subjectivities, from nomad, flaneur to consumer? How is the passenger represented, practiced and performed? How has the passenger and their experiences been conceived, imagined, manipulated, regulated and engineered? And what kind of human-technology assemblages do passengers enact? Through four short perspectives, this paper seeks to 'profile' the passenger as a distinctive historical and conceptual figure that can help to add greater precision to the analysis of our mobile ways of life. The passenger is explored as an object of speculative theoretical debate, a figure entangled in a host of identities, practices, performances and contexts, and an important way to illuminate key conceptual problematics, from representation to embodiment.<br>

Abstract: Issu des recherches d'une quinzaine d'exégètes, cet ouvrage, de style universitaire, est destiné à présenter à un large public un panorama des recherches johanniques contemporaines. Très diversifié quant aux thèmes abordés, il introduira lectrices et lecteurs aux questions irrésolues que pose l'histoire des communautés johanniques et de leur production littéraire. De nombreux auteurs s'interrogent sur la signification des relectures et des retouches successives. Ainsi, l'ouvrage rejoint l'aspect le plus énigmatique du corpus johannique (évangile et épîtres). Les écrits johanniques ont été dès l'origine et demeurent au centre de conflits d'interprétations; de ces conflits, comme des hypothèses les plus diverses, le livre a le mérite de rendre compte. Ainsi, il se montre digne de figurer parmi les ouvrages de référence sur ce sujet. This collection, the work of fifteen exegetes and edited by Kaestli, Poffet and Zumstein, presents a panorama of contemporary Johannine research for the benefit of the larger public. Touching upon many themes, it introduces the reader to the unresolved questions concerning the Johannine communities and their literature. Several authors question the significance of rereadings and successive alterations, the most enigmatic aspect of the Johannine corpus (gospel and epistles). The collection has the merit of presenting the diverse hypothesis and conflicts of interpretation to which Johannine writings have always been exposed, and should figure amongst the works of reference on the subject.<br>

Author(s): Müller Denis<br>
Abstract: L'éthique est aujourd'hui plus que jamais à la mode. Une clarification de son statut s'impose. A partir des travaux récents de Ricœur, et notamment de sa distinction entre visée éthique et norme morale, l'auteur s'interroge sur l'articulation de la morale commune et de l'éthique théologique. La thématique de la subjectivité et de l'altérité sert de fil conducteur; l'éthique de Foucault est mise à l'épreuve de ce modèle, ce qui permet ensuite une reprise théologique de la dialectique du soi et de l'autre (au double sens du visage d'autrui et de la transcendance de Dieu). Since at present ethics is a popular subject, its status must be clarified. Taking as a starting point the recent works of Ricœur, notably his distinction between ethical aims and moral norms, the author considers the articulation of common moral and theological ethics. The themes of subjectivity and alterity serve as leads. The ethics of Foucault are tested by this model, which permits us to take up again theologically the dialectic between the self and the other (in the twofold meaning of the face of the other and the transcendance of God).<br>

Abstract: Après une période de recherches homilétiques marquées par le paradigme de la crise, l'actuelle synergie de travaux dynamiques sur la prédication laisse supposer que l'on aborde le temps de la construction d'un nouveau modèle. l'article s'inscrit dans ce mouvement et propose d'envisager la prédication comme conversation et comme reconnaissance: conversation initiatique d'abord, puis herméneutique, en particulier par un travail d'intertextualité et de partage des voix. La dernière partie dégage la notion de reconnaissance, élément fondamental, pour ne pas dire «sacramentel», de la réception homilétique. Enfin, pour provoquer le dialogue entre texte biblique et réflexion homilétique, l'argumentation s'appuie sur la trame du récit des pèlerins d'Emmaiis (Lc 24,13-33), récit-métaphore d'un processus homilétique renouvelé. After a period of homiletic research marked by the paradigm of crisis, todays dynamic synergy on the subject of preaching suggests the construction of a new model. Along this line, Graesslé's article envisages preaching as conversation and as acknowledgment : first comes initiatory conversation, than hermeneutics, particulary by the effort to relate texts and separate voices. The last part draws out the fundamental, if not «sacramental», element of acknowledgment in homiletic reception. The web of the story about the disciples on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24,13-33), a metaphor for a renewed process of homiletics, is taken to provoke dialogue between the biblical text and homiletic reflection.<br>

Abstract: Certains travaux récents de Paul Ricœur montrent un déplacement d'accent : au lieu d'une interrogation sur la fragilité humaine comme dans la Philosophie de la volonté, Ricœur se préoccupe davantage aujourd'hui de la vie, de la natalité, du désir d'accomplissement. Cette dette aristotélicienne trahit-elle l'inspiration que le philosophe avait trouvée dans la tradition biblique ? Même si certains thèmes s'articulent de manière inédite, cet article souligne que la thèse reste inchangée : c'est bien le sujet qu'il faut parvenir à saisir, à la fois dans sa capacité et dans sa fragilité. La référence à Aristote invite alors à jeter un nouveau pont entre la philosophie et la théologie. Certain recent works of Paul Ricoeur show a transition: in the place of human frailty, as in the philosophy of will, Ricœur is more and more occupied today by life, birth, and the desire of accomplishment. Does this Aristotelian debt betray an inspiration that the philosopher had found in Biblical tradition? Even if certain themes are articulated in a new way, the article shows that the same thesis remains: it is still the subject which one must grasp, both in its capacity as in its frailty. So the reference to Aristotle is an invitation to see a new bridge between philosophy and theology.<br>

Abstract: L'herméneutique du soi proposée par Paul Ricoeur dans les années quatre vingt-dix fait une large place au récit autobiographique. Elle place ainsi au cœur de la constitution de l'identité personnelle la capacité défaire retour sur soi en termes narratifs. Abordée sous l'angle non seulement de la permanence d'un noyau substantiel – la mêmeté – mais également de celle impliquée dans l'acte de tenir parole – l'ipséité – l'identité est ici conçue comme étant narrative. Seul un sujet capable de se raconter serait ainsi capable du maintien de soi dans la parole donnée. Or, confrontée à l'hypothèse de l'inconscient, cette conception narrative de l'identité fait problème: que ce soit au niveau anthropologique et métapsychologique d'une part, ou au niveau de la méthode et de la clinique psychanalytique d'autre part, le récit autobiographique ne saurait rendre compte de la dimension inconsciente de l'expérience. Elle ne peut en ce sens constituer un concept directeur dans le champ théorico-clinique ouvert par Freud. The hermeneutics of the self proposed by Paul Ricoeur in the 1990's gives a large place to autobiographical narrative. At the heart of what constitutes personal identity, then, is the capacity to reflect on oneself in narrative terms. Seen not only from the angle of the permanence of a substantial core – selfsameness – but also from that implied in the act of discourse – ipseity – identity is conceived of as being narrative. Only a subject capable of telling about itself can maintain the self in what is told. However, when confronted with the hypothesis of the subconscious, this narrative conception of identity is problematic: whether at an anthropological or a meta-psychological level on the one hand, or on the level of method and of clinical psychoanalysis on the other, autobiographical narrative cannot render an account of the unconscious dimension of experience. It cannot in this sense be a directive concept in the clinical theory field opened by Freud.<br>

Author(s): Bühler Pierre<br>
Abstract: Comme son sous-titre l'indique, cet article a pour but de développer un contrepoint au livre de Pierre Gisel qui fait l'objet du débat présenté dans ce numéro. En dialogue critique avec cet ouvrage, il tente de formuler une autre manière de concevoir la théologie aujourd'hui. Après avoir explicité les conditions et la base d'accord de ce dialogue, il reprend successivement la question de la définition de la théologie, le problème des rapports entre théologie et sciences des religions et les difficultés liées à la relecture des héritages, pour se terminer par une évaluation globale du projet de Pierre Gisel. As indicated by its sub-title, this article develops an objection to the book of Pierre Gisel, subject of the debate in the present edition. In critical dialogue, it tries to formulate a different way of conceiving theology today. After exposing the conditions and basis for agreement in this debate, it takes up in succession the question of the definition of theology, the problem of the relationships between theology and the science of religions and the difficulties linked to the re-reading of traditions, finishing with a global evaluation of the project of Pierre Gisel.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Chalamet Christophe<br>
Abstract: Dans cette leçon inaugurale, l'auteur se penche sur l'Évangile, compris au sens large de «promesse», comme objet et comme source de subversion. Deux textes bibliques illustrent chacun de ces deux aspects : le livre de Job et la parabole matthéenne des ouvriers de la onzième heure (Mt 20, 1-16). Une troisième et dernière partie porte sur la relation entre révélation et mystère. Le style oral a été en partie conservé. In this inaugural lecture, delivered on September 24, 2012 at the Faculty of Theology of the University of Geneva, the author develops the theme of the Gospel — understood broadly as «promise» — as both the object and subject of subversion. Two biblical texts are taken as illustrations of these two aspects: the book of Job and Matthew's parable of the vineyard workers of the eleventh hour (Mt 20:1-16). A third and final part focuses on the relation between revelation and mystery. The original style of the lecture has been partly maintained.<br>

Abstract: Alors qu'il défend une extension du libéralisme politique au champ de la morale, Ruwen Ogien plaide pour la liberté. Mais l'assimilation de la liberté au consentement appauvrit le sens de la liberté, tout comme la supposée transparence du sujet à lui-même. En ce sens, le libéralisme politique comme structure formelle tourne à vide, s'il ne peut compter sur une mise en débat de perspectives plus substantielles de la liberté, des visions du monde, des éthiques et des convictions. In defending an extention of political liberalism to the field of morals, Ruwen Ogien makes a plea for freedom. But the assimilation of liberty to consent impoverishes the meaning of liberty, as does the supposed transparence of the subject to oneself. In this way, political liberalism as a formal structure runs in neutral, if it cannot depend on a debate concerning more substantial perspectives of liberty, of world visions, of ethics and convictions.<br>

Author(s): Abel Olivier<br>
Abstract: L'auteur se propose de passer l'éthique de Ricœur au crible du rasoir d'Ogien, afin d'examiner si la pluralité des points de vue éthiques auxquels Ricœur ne cesse d'emprunter ne viserait pas à rendre compte des limites de toute éthique. Les points de convergence possibles entre les deux auteurs n'occultent nullement ceux de leur divergence : pour Ricœur, si le sujet moral n'est jamais fixe, ce n'est pas au prix d'une morale éclectique, mais parce que la sagesse n'est jamais accessible hors d'une faiblesse constitutive du sujet, sans cesse exposé aux effets pervers de ses propres choix. Le pluralisme éthique s'en trouve ainsi légitimé. The author goes over the ethical theory of Ricoeur with the fine-tooth comb of Ogien's minimalist approach, showing where they agree and where they diverge. Ricoeur's anthropology leads to the vision of a vulnerable subject, always exposed to the perverse effects of his own moral choices. Moral pluralism finds here its deepest justification.<br>

Abstract: La sociobiologie, née au cours des années 1970 dans le cadre des théories darwiniennes, a été déclarée persona non grata en France pour des raisons essentiellement idéologiques. Elle a pourtant suscité outre-Atlantique de fructueux débats entre diverses disciplines ; la théologie comprise. Celle-ci ne peut rester indifférente aux propos des scientifiques sur la place occupée par le sentiment religieux dans l'évolution humaine ou encore par les comportements de survie et d'altruisme que l'espèce humaine partage avec le reste du vivant. Elle est ainsi invitée à poursuivre sa propre découverte de la personne humaine, comme sujet éthique et créature divine. Sociobiology, born during the 1970's in the context of Darwinism, was declared persona non grata in France for reasons basically ideological. It has however given rise to fruitful discussion in the United States between various disciplins including Theology. This latter cannot go on ignoring scientists' declarations on the place of religious sense in human evolution, or that of survival behaviour and altruism that the human species shares with the rest of the living world. Thus is Theology called to pursue its own discovery of the human person as ethical subject and divine creature.<br>

Abstract: On donne des exemples de difficultés rencontrées par la théologie classique quand elle se réapproprie certaines catégories d'ordre philosophique. Après avoir étendu la notion de category-mistake à la logique du questionnement, on illustre par une étude de cas certains glissements, dérives, accaparements qui posent des « problèmes catégoriaux ». Une approche interrogative et textologique permet de les analyser selon un partenariat entre théologie fondamentale et une certaine philosophie (critique) de la religion. Les prémisses de cette approche qui inaugure un nouveau type de théologien et de philosophe non retranché, sans ancillarité ni sous-traitance, ont été exposées dans un article antérieur sur « la pensée expressément religieuse » (chère à Balthasar) et sa catégorisation spécifique. On prépare ici un travail ultérieur consacré aux conditions de légitimité de la reprise problématique d'un ordre à l'autre. Examples are given of the difficulties that arise when classical theology apropriates certain categories of a philosophical order. After taking the notion of category-mistake over into the logic of the questioning the study of certain cases illustrates how certain slips, spoliations, or a certain going astray, lead to « categorial problems. » An interrogative and textological approach allows their analysis via a partnership between fundamental theology and a certain (critical) philosophy of Religion. The premises of this approach which heralds a new type of unentrenched theologian and philosopher, free from subordination or belittlement, were the subject of a previous exposé on « expressly religious thought » (dear to Balthasar) and its specific categorisation. This article prepares a further work on the conditions of legitimate transfer of problematic from one order to another.<br>

Abstract: Dans l'Essai sur le mal, Jean Nabert, poursuivant une démarche déjà engagée dans les Éléments pour une éthique, affronte la question de la possibilité d'une justification de l'existence humaine, L'A. propose une analyse des grandes étapes de cet essai Dans le ch. 1, il décrit les diverses figures d'un mal excédant le champ défini par les normes de la moralité, et recherche les conditions de possibilité d'une telle expérience. Dans les ch. 2 à 4, il poursuit l'analyse de l'expérience d'un mal intérieur au vouloir propre et que dissimule la réduction de celui-ci à la transgression des normes d'un sujet autonome, et il examine la compréhension de soi du sujet de l'expérience impliquée dans cette dimension du mal. Dans le dernier chapitre, il pose la question des limites de ce que permet d'espérer une « approche de la justification » par un moi tel qu'il s'est d'abord compris par réflexion sur ces données fondamentales de son expérience; au sommet de cette approche, il aborde la question de la possibilité du pardon. Pursuing along the same lines as in his Éléments pour une éthique, Jean Nabert, in his Essai sur le mal, tackles the question of the possibility of justifying human existence. The author proposes to analyze the major stages in this essay. In chapter 1, he describes diverse representations of evil that exceed the boundaries as defined by the norms of morality, and researches the conditions in which such experiences are possible. In chapters 2 to 4, he continues the analysis of evil intrinsic to will itself, which is obscured by the reduction of this evil to the transgression of an autonomous subject's limits, and examines the subject's comprehension of self when implicated in this dimension of evil. In the last chapter, the question is asked of the limitations of that which an « approach to justification » may permit to be hoped for by a self such as first understood upon reflexion of the fundamental data of his experience; at the apex of this approach, he ad~<br>

Abstract: Le témoin n'est ni un spectateur, ni un propriétaire, ni un conservateur, ni un producteur, ni un juge, mais il est celui qui accueille ce qui se donne à lui et se reçoit de cette épreuve d'une altérité irréductible. La force des analyses de Kierkegaard est de montrer que l'élucidation de l'essence du témoignage, qui conduit à la substitution du témoin au je, ne peut être séparée d'une elucidation de l'essence de la vérité. La vérité n'étant pas ce que je produis, mais ce qui me touche et m'éclaire, le témoignage se donne comme une communication directe-indirecte qui consiste à dire la vérité tout en l'existant Exister c'est témoigner en faisant de sa vie une tâche dans la passion essentielle de la vérité. En cela seul le témoignage chrétien révèle véritablement l'essence du témoignage puisque seul il donne vraiment à voir le saut du témoignage, qui conduit à ne pas se contenter de persister dans l'être pour s'ouvrir à la possibilité de devenir tout autre en s'abandonnant à la vérité et en acceptant de souffrir pour elle dans le monde. Dans cette philosophie du témoignage, le témoin devient alors le vrai nom de la personne contre l'abstraction du sujet-substance. A witness is neither a spectator, a proprietor, a preservator, a producer nor a judge, he is the one that receives what is given to him and who, from this test of irreducible alterity, receives himself. The strength of Kierkegaard's analyses is in showing that the elucidation of the essence of witnessing, which leads to the witness being substituted to the "I-myself", is inseparable from the elucidation of the essence of truth. Truth being not what I make but what marks and enlightens me, witnessing is given to be a direct-indirect communication which consists of saying the truth while being it. To be is to give witness by making one's life a task in the essential passion of truth. For this, Christian witness alone truly reveals the essence of witnessing for it alone truly allows one to see the leap of witn~<br>

Abstract: La philosophie herméneutique contemporaine comporte, dans sa démarche fondamentale, une rencontre avec la pensée fondatrice de Descartes que l'on peut nommer son « moment cartésien ». Celle thèse est vérifiée successivement à propos de la « phénoménologie matérielle » de Michel Henry, directement liée à une interprétation du cogito cartésien développée dans la Généalogie de la psychanalyse ; puis en dégageant les motifs herméneutiques impliqués dans la critique du cogito développée par Heidegger; enfin en analysant, dans la phénoménologie herméneutique de Paul Ricœur, la signification du « cogito blessé » , par rapport au conflit des interprétations et dans les perspectives de l'identité narrative pour une nouvelle conception du sujet. In making its fundamental approach, contemporary interpretative philosophy inevitably encounters the basic thinking of Descartes, resulting in what may be called a « Cartesian touch ». Successive examples of this are to be found in (1) Michel Henry's "physical-object phenomenology", which is directly linked with one interpretation of the Cartesian cogito developed in The Genealogy of Psycho-analysis; then in (2) Heidegger's critique of the cogito, if one isolates the interpretative aims which are implied therein; and finally in (3) Paul Ricœur's interpretative phenomenology, if one analyses the meaning of the "wounded cogito", bearing in mind the conflict of interpretation and the possibility that the identical data could give rise to new conclusions on the subject.<br>

Abstract: This paper challenges the common assumption that the attention which modern literary theory pays to the textual aspects of literature is achieved at the expense of humanistic and moral concerns. It starts by outlining how modern literary theory differs epistemologically from the traditional critical approaches to literature. Traditional critical theory was developed in the defense of poetry against Plato's accusations, real or imagined, and this informed both its critical practice and its concept of man. It established its epistemology on an aesthetic, moral, social, philosophical or scientific basis in a manner that encumbered literature with the concepts of man inherent in them. In contrast, modern literary theory started from a different premise: instead of seeking to justify literature and its moral relevance, it strove to identify its literariness and the dynamics of its structure by using the disciplines of semiotics and linguistics. It posited the text as an autonomous entity and a complete structure aware of its existence in a society of texts with which it conducts a profoundly intertextual dialogue. As an autonomous structure, the literary work is independent of other social or philosophical constructs and thus capable of conducting a meaningful dialogue with them. The paper elaborates the various conceptual frameworks of Russian formalism, intertextuality, structuralism and deconstruction in order to examine their implicit assumptions about man. It shows how the autonomous and dialogical nature of the literary work in its Bakhtinian sense are relevant to the concept of man inherent in modern literary theory. In its elaboration of this concept, the paper shows how it was developed in conflict with the hierarchical nature of traditional, ethical and philosophical values. It illustrates also the relevance of autonomy, self-regulation, free-play and fair representation inherent in many concepts of modern literary theory to the question of human rights. The qu~<br>

Publisher: American Oriental Society<br>
Issue: i225333<br>
Date: 12 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Feenberg Sheldon<br>
Abstract: The long-held view concerning the absence of a historical understanding in traditional India merits reconsideration on the basis of recent scholarship on the notion of history as such, the rhetorical foundations of historiography, the nature of narrativity, the character of historiography in classical antiquity, and the actual historical documents that are available from premodern India. Yet the absence of a historical-referential dimension of Sanskrit discourse remains a serious problem, one that Mīmāṃsā views on the referential sphere of the Veda may help us to understand. Mīmāṃsā makes the authority of the Veda dependent on its timelessness, and thus must empty the Veda of its historical referentiality. Since learned discourse (śāstra) in general is subject to a process of "vedicization," it adopts the Veda's putative ahistoricality; and the same set of concerns comes to inform the understanding of the genre itihāsa ("history") and the interpretation of itihāsa texts. History, consequently, seems not so much to be unknown in Sanskritic India as to be denied.<br>

Abstract: Deconstruction has become a theme in various strands of geographical research. It has not, however, been the subject of much explicit commentary. This paper elaborates on some basic themes concerning the relationship between deconstruction and conceptualizations of context, with particular reference to issues of textual interpretation. The double displacement of textuality characteristic of deconstruction is discussed, followed by a consideration of the themes of 'writing' and 'iterability' as distinctive figures for an alternative spatialization of concepts of context. It is argued that deconstruction informs a questioning of the normative assumptions underwriting the value and empirical identity of context.<br>

Author(s): Zeman Milton<br>
Abstract: Peirce's general theory of signs, or semiotic, as he called it, yields a theory of the self that sees it both as the object and the subject of semiotic systems. From this viewpoint, the locus, unity, and continuity of the self will be found in the systems of signs that constitute the dialogues between utterers and interpreters of the signs. Personal identity, in this theory, is also a social and cultural identity and is not confined to the individual organism. Peirce's anti-Cartesianism, which denies intuitive and introspective knowledge of the self, derived that knowledge from the fallible inferences we all make from the observations of external facts, including the signs of the self. This laid the foundation for a semiotic psychology as well as for a semiotic anthropology<br>

Abstract: Recent narrative analysis in medical anthropology provides keys to both the personal meaning of illness and the historical, cultural, and institutional shaping of that experience. Yet Western psychiatric thinking and practice continue to view schizophrenic discourse as closed to interpretation. Caught in this "closed text," the self would seem obliterated. But using narratives of schizophrenia and homelessness, this essay proposes a different understanding of schizophrenic alterity. The openness of the text-as-experience is re-created collectively, from outside the subject's narration: the subject's "self" is construction through the added perspectives of his or her interlocutors in the role of storymakers.<br>

Abstract: The anthropological taboo against "going native" is examined in the context of the ethnographer's own dreams during fieldwork among Sufi saints in Pakistan. The essay demonstrates that accounts of these dreams shaped social relations in the field and argues that relativist neutrality is a cover for a refusal to believe that is impossible to hide. This refusal constitutes an implicit insistence that the relationship between ethnographer and subject be shaped by the parameters of a hegemonic Western discourse of rationality.<br>

Abstract: Summary: On the Relations between the Sociology and the Semiology of Music. The aim of this article is to inquire what relations are possible between the semiology and the sociology of music. The first section attempts a definition of semiology: it may be understood as the science of signs, as the use of linguistic models in the description of non-linguistic fields, or as a programme of research specific to the humanities and the social sciences which distinguishes between the aspects of production, reception and the immanence of the meaning in question. The second section, through a critical analysis of a text by Barthes, explores the question of whether semiology can be understood as the science of musical ideologies. It demonstrates that semiology has no specific methodology with which to meet these problems. The third section investigates the possibility of using semiology to assist in reconciling musical and social structures. After briefly recalling several positions on this subject, we suggest that the 'neutral level' of description, presented above as one of the elements of semiological analysis, can serve as a necessary preliminary to the harmonising of musical with social structures.<br>

Abstract: There is a case, however, for seeing research as necessarily being involved in its first stage in ‘strangemaking’. It is only by making the commonplace first of all ‘strange’ that one can attain the critical distance required for research to proceed. Ethnomethodology makes this its primary mode of practice. Garfinkel, its originator, analysed in detail the methods used by people in everyday life to account for (make sense of) their activities for themselves and for others. He thus saw ethnomethodology as the study of commonsense knowledge of social structures so as to make sociological reasoning analysable. Ethnomethodology was the subject of fierce debate within sociology departments. Some of its insights have been taken into mainstream sociological theory, particularly through the work of Anthony Giddens.<br>

Abstract: This study presents an interpretation of the configuration of the poetic subject in the books of poems El Primer Libro (1985) and Albricia (1988) by Soledad Fariña (1943), which understand a self in a continuous process of gestation and birth. This process serves the purpose of recomposing a disarticulated subjectivity lost in the framework of the political and cultural conditions imposed by the military dictatorship that ruled Chile in the 1970s and 1980s. By using a metaphor of a journey and searching for a new language, the subject attempts to access a primitive stage andfind its maternal self in order to confront the dominant power, by codifying and configuring herself through an otherness in a feminine body-text. However, this process of maturation and discovery is intervened and left incomplete by the impulse of modernity, thereby creating a deformed, dissociated and off-centered self, which aims at growing opposed to logos. This conflict turns the upcoming of the new self into a painful event, like giving birth, that stems from the subject's wounded and fractured body, intending to re-establish de selffrom its fragments, traces and memories.<br>

Abstract: It is not new for poets to renovate the language of poetry by appropriating or sending up enervated, devalued language as a way to critique discourses of power. It may even be one of the oldest methods of literary innovation, considering the Roman appropriation of Greek literature. But some contemporary, experimental poets explicitly link mass production of capitalist consumer products and the logic of the copy
         
               to the production of art in a Benjaminian vein. De la Torre refers to the age of mechanical reproduction in an epigraph to “Photos While U Wait,” which she borrows from Jacques Barzun's introduction to Gustave Flaubert's110
            Dictionary of Accepted Ideas: “The cliché, as its name indicates, is the metal plate that reproduces the same image mechanically without end.”
               Poems written under constraint and composed of recombined, appropriated text at times thematize the activity of appropriation itself as endemic to capitalism. The supermarket is a popular trope for the destruction of authenticity, disenfranchisement, and advertising's interpellation of the subject. A discursive tone dotted with imperatives mark these poems, as they echo the language of consumerism. African American poet Harryette Mullen's111
            S*PeRM**K*T, included in herRecyclopedia, is structured according to the logic of supermarket aisles (“sort of like your shopping list”), and the missing letters in its title spell outu are, as in, “you are what you eat,” as Mullen explains in an author's note. “I was thinking about domestication, about the role of women, women as consumers, women having supposed power as consumers but also being disempowered in other ways…. You can't necessarily buy who you really want to be. You have to buy the available images,” she writes in an accompanying statement.
               Mullen, like Hayes, also connects her poetics to that of a woman poet predecessor. Her books112

Abstract: Early in chapter 6 we notice the difference, since it is the first time that Nick is not present in the very opening of a chapter. All previous chapters have opened with an emphasis on Nick as a subject; it has always been certain that he is the narrator. Chapter 1 starts with “In
         myyounger” (1; emphasis added); in chapter 3, “There was music frommyneighbor's house” (39; emphasis added). It takes ten lines in chapter 4 until Fitzgerald gets to Nick as the subject: “OnceIwrote down” (61; emphasis added) but in chapter 5 Nick returns to his early prominent position with “WhenIcame home” (81; emphasis added). I have deliberately avoided mentioning chapter 2 since it is an exception. It begins with an introductory description of the ash heap before Nick's presence is revealed after one page with “thatIfirst met” (24; emphasis added). It is not strange, in this case, that Fitzgerald delays Nick's arrival, because, as noted above, chapter 2 is a contrast to the otherwise flowing first half of the novel. As in chapter 2, in the second part ofGatsby, the relative absence of Nick creates uneasiness; the reader has been used to having their cicerone by their side.<br>

Abstract: In
         Survival in Auschwitz, Levi recounts how the inmates of the camps used the word “Muselmann” to designate those so debilitated by hunger and sickness that they resembled the living dead more than human beings.
               Giorgio Agamben describes them as the body “of the overcomatose person and the neomort attached to life-support systems today” (156). The existence of nearly every so-called Muselmann ended in the gas chamber. For Agamben, even though those who were eventually led to the gas chambers were the perfect witnesses of the evils of the Holocaust, they cannot bear witness because they took their experience to the grave. Nevertheless, Agamben argues that a life that had become “bare, unassignable and unwitnessable” is not necessarily condemned to silence (156–57). However, the only way it can speak is through the survivor, through the witness, whose authority “consists in his capacity to speak solely in the name of an incapacity to speak—that is, in his or her being a subject” (158). In light of Agamben's explanation, we understand that Primo Levi, who barely survived extermination, speaks not just for himself but also on behalf of all who did not survive. Testimony consists of any action taken by the survivor of violence to ensure that the Muselmann is not forgotten. Agamben argues that “it is because there is testimony only where there is an impossibility of speaking, because there is a witness only where there has been desubjectification, that the2
            Muselmannis the complete witness and that the survivor and theMuselmanncannot be split apart” (158).<br>

Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Joining hyperbolic ethics with psychoanalysis, then, we might begin to forge ethics and politics in a necessary but tense relation, as the place where we find ourselves: this is our plight as social creatures living together with others. Navigating between Kant's too-easy unification of ethics and politics through universal moral law based on duty, on the one hand, and Levinas's radical separation of the two based on the singularity of infinite ethical repsonsiblity, on the other, let's say that social subjectivity is the thin membrane stretched between infinite ethical responsibility and finite political action. And its depth is the thickness of the flesh in embodied relations with others. Subjectivity is response to others and the environment that binds us to them, on the one hand; and agency is response to social historical situations, or subject positions, that binds us to the language and culture into which we are born—for better or worse—on the other (see Oliver
      2001,2004). Subjective agency is forged through this pledge or bond between politics and ethics made possible, even necessary, by our sociality; we are social embodied animals with fears and desires beyond our control, fears and desires that make love possible but also make hatred and cruelty realities that we cannot ignore. Our social subjectivity is that thin membrane and that thick embodied relationship with those around us, whether they are animal, vegetable, or mineral, human, beast, or machine—or more to the point here, whether they are friend or enemy, loved or hated, welcoming or threatening.<br>

Abstract: Yet we saw in the passage quoted above a qualification (“to the extent”) to establishing equivalence between the mental substance and “I.” The chief reason is Brentano's critique of Descartes's view that the mind (
            qua res cogitans) is always thinking. But for Brentano deep dreamless sleep means that the self/I becomes absent, and so we must not simply equate the psychic substance (traditionally called “soul”) with the self-aware I or the subject. In this respect, Brentano would not follow Bolzano, for whom it would be inappropriate to say, “I have a soul,” because for Bolzano “soul” means the first-person referent of “I,” whichhasits acts, body, brain, and so on.
                  Yet Brentano's claim that there is self-awareness by the I-substance rounds out his own view of self-awareness as a “knowing [7
               Bekenntnis] which relates itself to that which has the knowing.” And such aKenntnis“is an accident and each which has the knowledge is a substance.”
                  Yet there is no necessary connection between the substance of “I” or “self” and the accident of self-awareness. We will return to this.8<br>

Abstract: This statement expresses a postmodern perspective more effectively than such concepts as deconstruction, death of God, poststructuralism, or genealogical thought. By virtue of is vagueness it articulates the absence of a defining subject, mastering terms, or a foundation for thought. It privileges varieties of approach and subject matter that destabilize each other and avoids a definitive framework that would guide the organization. Instead it offers SPEP as an open space for incompatible as well as compatible types of knowledge, approach, and philosophical sensibility. It affirms an indeterminate ambiguity in all words that people might otherwise interpret as centralizing and directive in an exclusive way. I believe that it reflects a kind of democratic pluralism rather more than the philosophical traditions could tolerate that came from Europe and played defining roles in SPEP's early years. I am quite sure that some of the organization's early leaders would consider the mission statement no less nihilistic than they found Nietzsche, Sartre, Derrida, Foucault, and all other philosophers identified as postmodern in 1980.<br>

Abstract: I think that what Meillassoux calls “correlationism” is a red herring and, since this is his root complaint, the new realism is the fruit of a poisoned tree. Even in the case of Husserl—there are statements in Husserl that have left us all wondering—the best scholarship today has made it plain that Husserl is not serving up metaphysical idealism but, rather, a theory of what sorts of acts are necessary on the part of the subject in order that objects may appear to the subject.
            
                  Objects do not drop from the sky—and that goes for scientific objects.28
               
                  But the history of phenomenology after Husserl, especially nervous about pure transcendental phenomenology, mounted a sustained insistence on the reality of our being-in-the-world, to adopt the formulation of a young sometime Catholic Aristotelian realist named Heidegger, to which Merleau-Ponty added later on that being-in-the-world is a radically incarnational phenomenon. Levinas made an argument for the radical alterity—read irreducible “reality”—of the other person. Interestingly enough the new realists will sometimes cite Levinas's “reversal” of intentionality and his plea for radical “exteriority” as a residual trace of a quickly evaporating realism among the phenomenologists.29
               
                  When faced with the charge that deconstruction has locked us all within the prison house of language, Derrida replied, a bit nonplussed, that everything he has to say concerns the “other” of language and hence represents a discourse on the real.30

Abstract: The first of these four sections, entitled “Radicalizing Phenomenology,” consists of three articles, each of which pushes phenomenology beyond itself into exciting new directions. Frédéric Seyler's “Fichte in 1804: A Radical Phenomenology of Life?” compares two thinkers who stand at the ends of the chronological spectrum of the phenomenological movement—Fichte and Michel Henry—but who nevertheless share the common aim of offering a phenomenology of life. Seyler argues that this aim leads them to confront an unsurpassable limit, inasmuch as a phenomenology of life attempts to grasp something that is strictly invisible or ineffable: the absolute as life that lies beyond or underneath the subject/object split. Crina Gschwandtner's article, “Revealing the Invisible: Henry and Marion on Aesthetic Experience,” also discusses Henry and considers him in relation to Jean-Luc Marion, with a focus not on the religious implications of their work but, rather, on their aesthetics. Concentrating on the relationship between the visible and invisible and on the way that each thinker privileges the phenomenon of art, Gschwandtner uncovers parallels between and also critically interrogates Henry's and Marion's theories of art and the artist. Finally, in “Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's
      Phenomenology ‘Wide Open,’” Scott Davidson stages a critical engagement between Dominique Janicaud and Paul Ricoeur, arguing both that Janicaud's attempt to distance himself from hermeneutic phenomenology is unsuccessful and that the true significance of his minimal phenomenology has yet to be fully appreciated. Davidson further argues that reflecting on the relationship between minimal and hermeneutic phenomenology reveals important new possibilities for phenomenological reflection today.<br>

Abstract: A good model for envisioning how a hermeneutic phenomenology would engage Deleuze can be developed by drawing from resources established elsewhere in Ricoeur's thought. What I have in mind, specifically, is his reading of Freud in the book
         Freud and Philosophy.
               There Ricoeur reads Freud's work as “a mixed or even ambiguous discourse, which at times states conflicts of force subject to an energetics, at times relations of meaning subject to a hermeneutics.”22
            
               Freud's energetics, on the one hand, offers a naturalistic account of desire in which it is understood in terms of a cathexis—the placement and displacement of energy. And yet, psychoanalysis continually points back to the work of interpretation in which the psychoanalyst is dealing with conscious representations. The coexistence of these two discourses gives rise to an aporia, which Ricoeur formulates in the following way: “What is the status of representation or ideas in relation to the notions of instinct, aim of instinct and affect? How can an interpretation of meaning through meaning be integrated with an economics of cathexis, withdrawal of cathexis, anticathexis?”23
            
               To solve this aporia, Ricoeur goes on to show that these two discourses in Freud's work are not actually opposed. Instead, as he puts it, “the energetics implies a hermeneutics and the hermeneutics discloses an energetics.”24

Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Abstract: According to Ricoeur, this activity of appropriation occurs in a phenomenological, prepublic realm. To link this realm with the public world, I turn briefly to the vocabulary of constitutive rhetoric. In “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the
         Peuple Québécois,” Maurice Charland explains how certain public texts, in addressing individuals as a group before that group actually exists in the extratextual world, can constitute a collective based on identity and oriented toward action. Charland uses the work of Kenneth Burke in order to shift the focus of rhetorical scholars away from “persuasion” and toward “identification” (1987, 133). Charland argues that public texts constitute subjects that didn't previously exist. In this sense, such texts do notpersuadealready existing individuals; they invite individuals to think of themselves in a manner thatentailscertain actions (1987, 134). This conceptualization extends Ricoeur's insights about appropriation and refiguration into the public world of action. Within this formulation, readers or listeners not only imagine themselves in new ways.
               They14
            actas the world of the text invites them to do and in so doing close the gap between mimesis3and mimesis1, between reading and acting. This is the space that needs to be crossed in order to give the straight line between mimesis1and mimesis3its arc and so enable it to form a spiral. A child reading Patterson's book, for instance, might simply dismiss it as a stuffy story about a famous person long dead. Or, the reader may actively engage the narrator's subtle closing exhortation to “make Dr. King's dream his own” (96). Because of “Dr. King's dream,” the reader may speak up when she hears someone employ racial slurs or stereotypes or intervene when a classmate is unjustly punished or bullied. The reader thus acts her way into Dr. King's proposed world and becomes the kind of agent whose actions may in turn inspire others. Her actions may be so ~<br>

Abstract: During periods when Shaw was debilitated by illness, injury, and outright prostration, GBS reconceives convalescence and medical procedures as occasions of revelation and rejuvenation. In another
      Saturday Reviewpiece, written in May 1898, the playwright describes being subject to a practice he execrated, vivisection to remedy his infected foot, but, through it, he finally achieves an “[understanding of] the British drama and the British actor.”
            The sedative so splits his character that, when he awakens, only his “sentimental side” initially returns, without his “morality,” “common sense,” or “incorrigible Protestant respectability”: “For the first time in my life, I tasted the bliss of having no morals to restrain me from lying, and no sense of reality to restrain me from romancing…. I acted and lied in the most touchingly sympathetic fashion…. Artistically, I was an immense success: morally, I simply had no existence.”10
         
            Shaw describes a zombie state, bereft of “the chill of a moral or intellectual impulse,” in which his “consciousness [became] absolutely fictitious,”11
         
            and equates it to the anesthetic rather than aesthetic effect of actors, managers, and playwrights in British theater. Inveighing against theatrical bathos as a dangerous blend of vapid conformity and blinding romanticism, it is, for Shaw, the responsibility of the critic to rouse patients etherized on a table and endeavor to cultivate a dialectic theater poised for social reform.12<br>

Publisher: U of Wisconsin P<br>
Issue: style.34.issue-1<br>
Date: September 1, 1983<br>
Author(s): Peters Joan Douglas<br>
Abstract: It has been over ten years since anything significant has been published on D. H. Lawrence's critical prose, and nothing of note has ever been written on the subject of the short essays—“The Novel,” “Surgery for the novel—Or a Bomb,” “Morality and the Novel,” and “Why the novel Matters”—containing his theory of the novel. The rhetorical style Lawrence adopts is so informal, so comical, and often so bizarre that the impulse of critics, when they do refer to these essays, is to ignore the rhetoric and somehow extract a system of logocentric doctrine, a doctrine that does not bear scrutiny. To appreciate Lawrence's genre theory, one cannot ignore the style in which it is written but must instead focus on the dynamics of discourse comprising the rhetorical text. Grounding my reading in Bakhtin's
         carnival, I argue that Lawrence celebrates the novel in terms of its “joyful relativity” (Bakhtin's term), a theory that articulates itself performatively in different ways through its own deconstruction. Read deconstructively, Lawrence's genre theory offers an important contribution to modernist concepts of language, an area from which Lawrence has traditionally been entirely excluded.<br>

Author(s): Kubíček Tomáš<br>
Abstract: This present study revisits the role of the subject in the light of mimesis theory and the urgency of the questions it raises in the theory of fictional worlds, mainly following the model that Lubomír Doležel has “canonized,” after many years' reflection, in his essential book,
         Heterocosmica(1998). The study measures the shift within this theory that has occurred under the influence of the subject, sketches the complex of problems that it raises, and shows how the subject itself, conversely, demands redefinition in the light of the theory of fictional worlds. Because this area is very wide, the study is limited to that part of it defined by the pairing of subject and mimesis as literary categories. And it indicates that it is precisely the theory of fictional worlds that can prove how ambiguous the simple dichotomy of subject and object is.<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: At the 1934 Congress of Soviet Writers, Karl Radek famously condemned Joyce's anally retentive bourgeois tendencies by comparing
         Ulysseswith “the component parts of a heap of dung.”
               It is certainly difficult to see bourgeois-suburban Joyce-Bloom as the epitome of the Modernist-Utopian tradition advanced by Jameson.71
            Ulyssesis a novel of immense and endless structuration, but one that resists structure itself, which resists the closure and determinism of epic or stereotypically Utopian mythologization. Joyce's work would most obviously take place in the comic-ironic—rather than the mythic—stages of Northrop Frye's generic cycle. As Jameson himself suggests, “The incomparable greatness of [Ulysses] comes from itsincompleteuse of myth: Joyce lets us see that the ‘myth’ is nothing but an organizational device, and his subject is not some fictive unity of experience which the myth is supposed to guarantee, but rather that fragmentation of life in the modern world.”
               So much, then, for artificial or organic unities: so much, then, for a Joycean Utopia.72<br>
