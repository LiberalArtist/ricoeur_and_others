  Book Title: Interstices of the Sublime: Theology and Psychoanalytic Theory-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Interstices of the Sublime represents a powerful theological engagement with psychoanalytic theory in Freud, Lacan, Kristeva and Zizek, as well as major expressions of contemporary Continental philosophy, including Deleuze, Derrida, Marion, and Badiou. Through creative and constructive psycho-theological readings of topics such as sublimation, schizophrenia, God, and creation ex nihilo, this book contributes to a new form of radical theological thinking that is deeply involved in the world. Here the idea of the Kantian sublime is read into Freud and Lacan, and compared with sublimation. The sublime refers to a conflict of the Kantian faculties of reason and imagination, and involves the attempt to represent what is intrinsically unrepresentable. Sublimation, by contrast, involves the expression and partial satisfaction of primal desires in culturally acceptable terms. The sublime is negatively expressed in sublimation, because it is both the sourceof sublimation as well as that which resists being sublimated. That is, the Freudian sublime is related to the process of sublimation, but it also distorts or disrupts sublimation, and invokes what Lacan calls the Real. The effects of the sublime are not just psychoanalytic but, importantly, theological, because the sublime is the main form that Godtakes in the modern world. A radical postmodern theology attends to the workings of the sublime in our thinking and living, and provides resources to understand the complexity of reality. This book is one of the first sustained theological readings of Lacan in English.<br>

  Abstract: The problem of thinking is a problem of sublimation. To have language, meaning, and thereby religion, science, culture, and art, there must be sublimation in a broad sense. This book has traced some of the intricacies of sublimation through psychoanalytic theory as it impresses upon theology. Sublimation means that meaning is not direct and unmediated but consists of a detour. At the same time, my readings of theology, continental philosophy, and psychoanalytic theory suggest that sublimation is not an elevation above a material reality. In chapter 1, I appealed to Deleuze to question the two-level model of reality that sublimation<br>

  Abstract: If we interpret deconstruction as a form of translation as transference, we have moved into the territory of psychoanalysis. Indeed, if poetic majesty acts to unseat sovereign majesty through the cut that carries with it rebirth, as in the story of Little Red Riding Hood, then psychoanalysis may be the discourse best equipped for articulating the dynamics of this wound that is also a source of life. In other words, psychoanalysis may provide the tools with which to analyze the thorny relationship between violence and life, particularly through the concepts of death drive and sublimation.

  Belonging to Poetry: A Reparative Reading from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1sq5vd6">Love and its Critics</a><br>
  Abstract: The true recovery of the troubadour tradition comes with Shakespeare, the poet and playwright who “towers like a mountain peak above the surrounding foothills, but is one substance and structure with them”.¹ Most truly “of the English strain”, Shakespeare’s sonnets are a reversing, even a mocking of the Petrarchan mode and the Neoplatonic sublimation of passion into worship that sometimes marks the poetry of Sidney. Rather than treating the individual as a means to an end, the lowest rung on the ladder of love, Shakespeare’s sonnets reverse this emphasis, valuing the individual as an end in itself, not a means<br>

Abstract: Here, the implied moral “tension” may be compared, by way of illustration, to Sigmund Freud’s rather narrower interpretive hermeneutical “tension” between the active ego and the passivity of the id and the superego. Just as psychological health arises from a productive “working through” of conflicts and repressions at the dynamic intersection of consciousness and the unconscious (in such ongoing practices as dream interpretation, psychoanalytic catharsis, and superego sublimation), so also in moral life may intersubjective and historical tensions move the self toward previously unformed and even cathartic meaning in relation to others. Social, relational, historical, and cultural “tension”—a term that comes from the Latin
         tensioor “stretching”—is a condition for the possibility of moral identity and meaning in the first place. The human moral “desire to be” is realized through an original, unavoidable, restless, and indeed apparently infinite innovation and working through of new social relations.<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: Modesty, sublimation, effacement of the self: such are the demands the historical profession has long made of its members. While historians have not shied away from self‐revelation—be it in autobiographies or, since the 1980s, in increasingly prevalent essays, interviews, and lectures—history still entertains an uneasy relationship with literary expressions of the self. Jeremy D. Popkin has accordingly left his usual hunting grounds (the press in modern France) to take a closer look at the historian’s autobiography. His learned and passionate
      History, Historians, and Autobiographyanalyzes the genre’s formal and sociological characteristics. Responding to the historians and literary scholars who, in his view, have unfairly castigated or neglected such autobiographies, it also redeems the genre as a distinctive gateway into the riches of the past and human experience. While the shifts between registers are sometimes dizzying, Popkin’s fine analysis and deep empathy yield an illuminating and singularly humane book.<br>

Article Title: Dickens and the Narratography of Closure<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 589491<br>
2008<br>
Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: Yet the nagging fact remains, lodged right at the generic crux of ethics and epistemology. For there is no denying that the withheld truth would have had a decisive ethical charge, removing the unearned guilt of years, releasing the unloved son to a different autobiographic consciousness altogether. The promissory morality of soul mates as helpmates in the novel's last paragraph—they are returned to a society that has previously contributed to their exclusion, to perform what service they now can—is of course stationed to outbid all epistemological regret. Yet to the supposed selflessness of this social ethic, the self-knowledge of the hero has been entirely sacrificed. What might have done him good is subsumed to his doing good. A logic like this does have its own communal morality, of course, but only if articulated. Instead, we get, unadmitted, a sublimation of the sexual into the social subject. In this way the closural immanence of form within the compromises of Dickens's story is neither providential nor evidentiary but merely and remorselessly conventional. I say merely, because conjugal love has been unfleshed into duty by an ideology of the so-called work ethic; remorselessly, because the pace of closure excludes all talking back from within the plot; but not seamlessly, because the false notes remain, jangling, reverberant. They remain, that is, for the reader to read—and this as a certain lingering discord that outlasts plot itself. In what we've stumbled over in the novel's final paragraph the discrepancy between knowledge and desire takes the form of a verbal deviance writ small, a mere glitch or two at the level of agreement, a predication no longer justified in the linguistic sense nor in the ethical and the epistemological senses, given that it implies a not only vaguely morbid but a downright deceptive variant of the marital two-made-one. Dickens, that master vernacular syntactician of nineteenth-century prose, regularly flawless in the virtual subp~<br>

Article Title:  La nuit inaugurale de Kitāb al-Imtāʿ wa-l-muʾānasa d'Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī: une leçon magistrale d'adab <br>
Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i25162277<br>

Author(s): Natij Salah<br>
Abstract: En s'appuyant sur un commentaire du texte de la première nuit du Kitāb al-Imtāʿ wa-l-muʾānasa d'Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī, cet article se propose de montrer la place primordiale qu'occupe la parole conversante (al-muḥādaṯa) dans la pensée arabe classique. La conversation, ḥadīṯ, constitue bien dans la culture arabe à la fois un paradigme épistémique dominant et un cadre généralisé d'expériences esthético-éthiques: la parole conversante fonctionne à la fois comme facteur de construction des contextes d'interaction au sein desquels se tissent les réseaux de sociabilité et d'échanges intellectuels fécondants (muqābasa), comme action cathartique qui libère l'âme et purifie l'esprit, comme facteur de sublimation et d'émancipation de la personne (ʿitq). Ainsi, l'analyse de toutes ces formes de manifestation de la parole conversante dans la champ de l'adab nous a permis d'aboutir à deux conclusions complémentaires: premièrement, selon la conception de la culture propre à la vision anthropologique inhérente au système de l'adab, la culture ne se transmet pas héréditairement, mais par fréquentation, interaction et contact entre personnes contemporaines. Deuxièmement, l'adīb véritable, tel que nous en avons un exemple vivant dans la figure d'al-Tawḥīdī, est celui qui se montre capable de créer et prendre en charge les occasions de sociabilité et d'échanges permettant aux individus d'une même époque de s'insérer dans le tissu de la contemporanéité concrète et de s'influencer et se cultiver les uns les autres. /// Based on a commentary of the first night in Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī's Kitāb al-Imtāʿ wa-l-muʾānasa, the purpose of this article is to show the essential place held by conversing speech (al-muḥādaṯa) in classical Arabic thought. In Arabic culture, conversation (ḥadīṯ) represents indeed both a dominant and epistemic paradigm and a generalized ethical-aesthetic frame of experiences: i. e. conversing speech works at the same time as a building factor of interacting contexts in ~<br>

Abstract: Beckett's "Three Dialogues with Georges Duthuit" poses two distinct difficulties for the reader: the revelation of artistic process or creative energy and the resistance to representation with its implication of objectification. The first may be defined in terms of a three-stage operation resulting in a depiction of sublimation or creative force. Without recourse to psychohistory, one may explore the second in terms of the paradoxical obsession with evocative memory evident throughout Beckett's work. Of this, a disturbance in object representation, understood in the psychoanalytic sense, may be the source.<br>
