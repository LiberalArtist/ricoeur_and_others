  Abstract: Of all the lessons I have learned from Kenneth Burke, none is more valuable than what he shows and tells about irony. For Burke, irony is not simply a strategy that allows us to say one thing when we mean something else. Instead, irony becomes a point of coalescence between strategy and substance—a way of talking and thinking that simultaneously constructs, engages, and alters our encounters in the social world. Among other things, Burkean irony suggests a way for us to teach rhetoric rhetorically, and that is the issue I want to explore in this paper.<br>

  Book Title: Reason to Believe-Cultural Agency in Latin American Evangelicalism<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Smilde David<br>
  Abstract: Evangelical Protestantism has arguably become the fastest-growing religion in South America, if not the world. For converts, it emphasizes self-discipline and provides a network of communal support, which together have helped many overcome substance abuse, avoid crime and violence, and resolve relationship problems. But can people simply decide to believe in a religion because of the benefits it reportedly delivers? Based on extensive fieldwork among Pentecostal men in Caracas, Venezuela, this rich urban ethnography seeks an explanation for the explosion of Evangelical Protestantism, unraveling the cultural and personal dynamics of Evangelical conversion to show how and why these men make the choice to convert, and how they come to have faith in a new system of beliefs and practices.<br>

  Abstract: The complex of substance abuse, gambling, crime, and violence described in the previous chapter constitutes the most common reason the men I studied gave for conversion to Evangelicalism. Leaving the analysis there would amount to a serious distortion. Often the problems leading to conversion are simply acute versions of the issues of personal development and social connection that most people experience at some point in their lives. The men I discuss in this chapter reported enduring periods of dis-ease that they found difficult to shake. In Evangelicalism they found a package of meanings and practices that helped them to both<br>

  Author(s) Peters Ted<br>
  Abstract: The holism so precious to the postmodern mind is by no means intended to eliminate particularity and individuality. Holistic postmodernity seeks a dynamic whole, a cooperative whole, a synthetic whole. The dynamism of the whole contributes to the vitality of the parts just as the parts constitute the substance of the whole. Instead of union, we think of communion. I have argued that the universality and comprehensiveness of the kingdom of God lend some theological support for employing such holistic and communal categories.<br>

  Abstract: From the days of the Milesian cosmologists to the present, philosophers have tried to pass beyond an investigation of things in being to a systematic knowledge of being itself.¹ Such attempted knowledge of being, which, due to a somewhat arbitrary decision of Andronicus of Rhodes soon came to be called “metaphysics,” has hitherto appeared as “materialism (everything is matter and mechanical process), spiritualism (everything is spirit), hylozoism (the cosmos is a living spiritual substance), and so on.

  Book Title: Missing Link-The Evolution of Metaphor and the Metaphor of Evolution<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): DONALDSON JEFFERY<br>
  Abstract: We look for missing links in the sciences and humanities, but the essential missing link - metaphor - is always in front of us. In Missing Link, Jeffery Donaldson unites literary criticism and evolutionary and cognitive science to show how metaphor has been with us since the beginning of time as a seed in the nature of things. With examples from centuries of poets, critics, philosophers, and scientists, he details how metaphor is a chemistry, an exchange of energies forming and dissolving, and an openness in the spaces between things. He considers the ways in which DNA learns how to liken things that have been, how mutation makes errors and then tries them on, and how evolution is hypothesis - nature's way of "thinking more." The mind is a matrix of relations: neural synapses cascade into ever-changing pathways and patterns. Metaphor is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. It is the unbroken thread between matter and spirit. Whether offering analysis of a turn of phrase or chemical reaction, Missing Link presents a vision of literature that is also a vision of the cosmos, and vice versa. It enters the debate between evolution and religion, and challenges scientists, literary theorists, and religious advocates to rethink the relations between their disciplines.<br>

Motifs of household garbage, environmental pollution and technological junk are everywhere in his fiction and visual art – the substance of his work is frequently constructed from broken things, forgotten concepts, obsolete inventions and the many ‘time-expired’, disposable items that we routinely ditch. In his ‘Canada House’ exhibition (2003; 2004–5), for example, a number of sculptures incorporate salvaged odds and ends – discarded tin cans, plastic bottles, food packaging, shreds of clothing, broken buoys and the assorted, shop-worn treasures of the tenacious beachcomber – all of which are redeployed<br>

  Abstract: The purpose of this chapter is to work out two related claims regarding how to think about the fallen self, i.e., the self in sin. First, following on the relational ontology we sketched in the previous chapter, we need to think about sin relationally rather than in terms of substance and accidents. Second, in order to understand sin, we need recourse to figurative discourse. Taking Ricoeur as a point of departure, in the first section we will see why reflection on sin and evil requires a hermeneutics of figurative discourse. Sin and evil cannot be explained, but must be described.<br>

However, the substance of his own unfinished meditation, together with Geertz’s subsequent response, possesses a critical importance that far transcends the particular circumstances of their origin.⁶ By setting the discussion of literary as<br>

  Book Title: Fredrik Barth-An Intellectual Biography<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Garsten Christina<br>
  Abstract: Fredrik Barth is one of the towering figures of twentieth-century anthropology. This intellectual history traces the development of Barth’s ideas and explores the substance of his contributions. In an accessible style, Thomas Eriksen’s biographical study reveals the magic of ethnography to professional anthropologists and non-practitioners alike. Exploring his six decade career, it follows Barth from early ecological studies in Pakistan, to political studies in Iran, to groundbreaking fieldwork in Norway, New Guinea, Bali and Bhutan. Eriksen argues that Barth's voracious appetite for fieldwork holds the key to understanding his remarkable intellectual development and the insights it produced. The book raises many of the same questions that emerge from Barth's own work - of unity and diversity, of culture and relativism, of art and science. Thomas Eriksen is himself a major contributor to the study of anthropology, as well as a distinguished educator, and is therefore ideally placed to introduce the life and work of Fredrik Barth. This will surely be the definitive book on its subject for many years to come.<br>

Le cinéma a toujours été un moyen d’accès du public à la matière littéraire, pourtant on ne saurait dire que le cinéma reste dans le domaine de<br>

  Author(s) WERPEHOWSKI WILLIAM<br>
  Abstract: Love is often extolled as the source, substance, standard, and goal of Christian ethics. Yet a perception that love has seldom been its subject is also prevalent. Anders Nygren began
                  Agape and Erosby juxtaposing love’s centrality and neglect within contemporary Christian ethics, and love’s prominence in Christian moral and theological reflection since he made these claims in 1930 is one indication of his study’s significance.¹ It is hardly the volume’s only opposition. Indeed, although Nygren categorized his inquiry into love as “motif-research” and thus disclaimed any evaluative intent, his assurance that “Agape and Eros are contrasted with one another<br>

  Book Title: Textual Silence-Unreadability and the Holocaust<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): LANG JESSICA<br>
  Abstract: There are thousands of books that represent the Holocaust, but can, and should, the act of reading these works convey the events of genocide to those who did not experience it? In
      Textual Silence, literary scholar Jessica Lang asserts that language itself is a barrier between the author and the reader in Holocaust texts-and that this barrier is not a lack of substance, but a defining characteristic of the genre.Holocaust texts, which encompass works as diverse as memoirs, novels, poems, and diaries, are traditionally characterized by silences the authors place throughout the text, both deliberately and unconsciously. While a reader may have the desire and will to comprehend the Holocaust, the presence of "textual silence" is a force that removes the experience of genocide from the reader's analysis and imaginative recourse. Lang defines silences as omissions that take many forms, including the use of italics and quotation marks, ellipses and blank pages in poetry, and the presence of unreliable narrators in fiction. While this limits the reader's ability to read in any conventional sense, these silences are not flaws. They are instead a critical presence that forces readers to acknowledge how words and meaning can diverge in the face of events as unimaginable as those of the Holocaust.<br>

It embraces the corporeal in itself as its substance. It does not experience the multiple parts of the external body as divisions of the soul. Rather (like Aristotle’s sensus communis), it gathers them up into one experience. “[T]he ‘real’ outness of parts in the body has no truth for the sentient soul.”² The feeling soul in the body is “one simple, omnipresent unity.”³<br>

  Book Title: The Hermes Complex-Philosophical Reflections on Translation<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Folkart Barbara<br>
  Abstract: When Hermes handed over to Apollo his finest invention, the lyre, in exchange for promotion to the status of messenger of the gods, he relinquished the creativity that gave life to his words.The trade-off proved frustrating: Hermes chafed under the obligation to deliver the ideas and words of others and resorted to all manner of ruses in order to assert his presence in the messages he transmitted. His theorizing descendants, too, allow their pretentions to creatorship to interfere with the actual business of reinventing originals in another language.Just as the Hermes of old delighted in leading the traveller astray, so his descendants lead their acolytes, through thickets of jargon, into labyrinths of eloquence without substance.Charles Le Blanc possesses the philosophical tools to dismantle this empty eloquence: he exposes the inconsistencies, internal contradictions, misreadings, and misunderstandings rife in so much of the current academic discourse en translation, and traces the failings of this discourse back to its roots in the anguish of having traded authentic creativity for mere status.<br>

  Abstract: In

Evanescence is found in the ‘in-between’. The evanescent moment is defined as the event of ‘the philosophical realisation of the art of politics’ (Rancière 1995: 19). As these three trajectories of art, politics and philosophy coalesce to transform themselves as in-between discourse, they emancipate the evanescent moment from being an ideational or mythic impossible utopia, opening out the possibility of a realizable utopia.

  Abstract: Walter Ralegh’s ‘Farewell to False Love’ is a poem of eighteen lines and around twenty metaphors describing the nature of false love. False love is an ‘oracle of lies’, ‘A way of error, a temple full of treason’, ‘a nest of deep deceit’, ‘A fortress’, ‘A siren song’, ‘A ranging cloud that runs before the wind, / A substance like the shadow of the sun’. The metaphorical elaboration of the nature of false love is, by the end of the poem, reduced to comparisons that are themselves only approximate (like) to ephemeral and insubstantial things (shadows).

  Abstract: Transnational democracy is an idea whose time has come, but it does not, as yet, have much substance. It is a thing of the future more than the present, but its future is far from assured. Such democracy as we presently enjoy it is mostly national, rather than transnational, and representative, rather than participatory. It is largely monopolised by elected ‘representatives’, rather than politically active citizens and almost entirely circumscribed by the territoriality of national state borders. The social communities, relations and processes beyond and across state borders that would constitute transnational democracy largely elude democracy’s remit. ‘Globalisation’ and<br>

  Abstract: Waxing lyrical on the figure of the rainbow, bringing us back from the brink of an abstracting adulthood to a childhood in which color manifests as substance, Walter Benjamin posits something on the order of a prismatic materialism in these lines. Color morphs and moves. Insector angel-like, it “flits from one form to the next,” rendering each lively if not alive. This undifferentiated relation to color as substance radicalizes perception. It ties color to the objects that play host to it such that the visual becomes tactile. Color becomes transitive or transactional. Color happens. It happens to you, through you.<br>

In so doing, he quoted the title of a book by Ernst Cassirer (to which he has referred on many other occasions, as well). The latter’sSubstance and Function(2003 [1910]) addresses precisely this transition from substance, which may be “heard” or “seen”(vernehmbare Substanz), to function, which admits comparison (or, alternatively, represents functional equivalence).

Abstract: Hurd favors the retributivist principle over the rule of law. Using an argument sure to provoke debate, Hurd concludes that consequentialism’s theory of the right cannot countenance blamed right doing. In contrast, deontology lacks an analogous entailment. Yet Hurd doesn’t explore why the substance of deontology favors retributivism over the rule of law. Her answer might be that this isn’t needed, since moral combat is unacceptably paradoxical. But the deontologist who favors the rule of law doesn’t see it that way, and simply asserting it doesn’t help. Though the arguments may not be conclusive, her book is admirably systematic, rigorous, clear, informed, and reasonable.<br>

Abstract: The foregoing description of interreligious encounter makes sense if we regard the notions that define religious identity as formal regulative principles that admit a degree of variation in the experiential “substance” of religious understanding. This conception of religious doctrines as regulative principles allows us finally to distinguish with precision the normative theological judgments that are suspended in the act of interreligious understanding from the hermeneutically productive presuppositions that are not. We can regard the former as formal criteria of religious identity and the latter as the modes of experience and understanding to be judged by—and modified in accordance with—such criteria.
         34These remarks support George Lindbeck’s understanding of a religion as a comprehensive interpretive framework that shapes the way its adherents understand and experience reality.35This conception of religion thus provides a helpful model for understanding the dynamics of interreligious encounter. The encounter with another religious tradition exposes religious experience and understanding to alternative structuring schemata, thereby occasioning creative rearrangements of the ways in which reality is known and experienced. The restructured patterns of experience and understanding nevertheless can, given the flexibility of a given religious structure vis‐à‐vis the experiential materials to be structured, be reassimilated to the original interpretive scheme.<br>

Abstract: Agaffino Solaro,
            Sindone evangelica, 138–39. In the third part of theSumma(q. 54, art. 3, 338), broaching the central problem of “The Quality of the Resurrecting Christ,” Thomas had contended that all the blood oozed out of Christ’s body, since it pertained to his human nature and had resurrected with his body. Therefore, Thomas adds, the blood coming out of the relics present in some churches does not derive from Christ’s open side, but rather from images of Christ thanks to some miraculous act (miraculose). Solaro disagrees both with Thomas, who had not seen the shroud, and with Francisco Suarez, who inCommentaria ac disputationes in tertiam partem D. Thomae(inOpera Omnia[Paris: Vivès, 1860], vol. 19, pt. 2, q. 54, art. 4, 826) had contended that the drops of blood present in relics are “accidents of color” and not substance of Christ’s blood.<br>

Abstract: The self‐evidence that marks the world as “our world” also forms the perspective in which we encounter “the other” in the person of representatives of another civilization, culture, and religion whose meaning, substance, and contours are foreign to us. Also the other, the “alien” other, and the “strange” other: we view them and face them in terms of the cognitive, affective, and attitudinal schemes that we, from our own experiential field, apply to other people and things. They differ from us in convictions, opinions, emotions, habits, rituals, practices, clothing, gestures, hairstyles, odor, and color.<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Not surprisingly, given its overt presence in the JST account of the garden, the nature of evil and its consequences is a large theme in Smith’s account of the world’s first family. Particular care is taken to reiterate Lucifer’s motives to implement his own plan at the expense of God’s. The reader is told that Lucifer, now the cast‐down Satan, “sought also to beguile Eve, for he knew not the mind of God; wherefore he sought to destroy the world.”
         57Here, to Lucifer’s grandiosity and rebellion is added the additional problem of ignorance, that is, he knows not “the mind of God.” Thus, in the JST version of the garden, as at the council, Satan is displaying not only malice but also a fundamental misunderstanding of the way life works, when he prompts the serpent to argue, consistent with the KJV: “Ye shall not die … ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”58With the council narrative as background, the JST reader sees Satan’s approach has not changed and neither has the substance of his offer: death masquerading as power. Evil is rebellion against God’s plan and the embracing of its opposite: the voluntary or free adoption of an antiorder that seeks to destroy human freedom in order to obtain power as an end in itself. It is Lucifer, not the fallen Eve or Adam, who conveys the definition of sin and defines it in terms of rebellion as a lust for power obtained at the expense of agency and, thus, life itself. Stated as an abstract principle, it is obvious that this characterization of Satan and his goal are not original to the JST. As Ecclesiastes tells us, there is nothing new under the sun; particularly the religious sun. I do not dispute him. My point here is the manner in which this principle is historicized or realized for the reader by its conveyance through narrative and, more especially, the authorized biblical plot rather than a separate narrative.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: Similar illustrations of immanent dispossession abounded during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. While Fénelon's censure in 1699 appeared to neutralize the threat posed by mysticism, Christian apologists turned from this victory to confront attacks on human agency stemming from Spinozist and materialist circles. A key battle in this polemic was fought over the status of free will as a property of the thinking subject, whether human or divine. Spinoza aimed to demonstrate that God acts
         asnature, notonnature, and out of sheer necessity. Created beings operated under a similar compulsion. The distinction between subject and object, famously associated with Descartes, was thereby dissolved. To cite theEthics(1677): “When we say that the human mind perceives this or that thing, we say nothing else than that God possesses this or that idea.”46In other words, the subject's thoughts are not its own, unique to itself, but are the manifestation of God thinking in the world and through the mind. It followed from this premise that “there is no absolute or free will,” a conclusion that undermined the possibility of transcendence for any being.47Spinoza therefore understood the highest form of wisdom, which he called the “intellectual love of God,” to be the recognition of the determined character of our existence. We are, he asserted, “part of the whole of nature, whose order we follow.”48In consequence, true liberty “is to be and to remain chained by the bonds of [God's] love.”49And this love, Spinoza claimed, was not directed toward the individual human person. It was, on the contrary, “part of the infinite love with which God loves Himself.”50For Spinoza, then, intellectual love is radically self-referential—not to the human subject, but to divine substance. The beatified self exists merely as an effect of God/Nature's immanent presence and totalizing force. At the same time, Spinoza extended dispossession beyond what Fénelon's Christian beliefs would permit~<br>

Abstract: When, for instance, Faustus attempts to make his eternal end immediately by signing the diabolical contract that he believes will ensure that he remains forever an embodied spirit “in form and substance” (2.1.72), and when he discovers to his utter horror that despite his signing of the contract, his body remains a disobedient vehicle for the invisible hand that writes “
      Homo fuge” (2.1.76) on his arm, Mephistopheles manages to distract Faustus from his dramatic crisis simply by going to “fetch him somewhat to delight his mind” (2.1.82). The devil exits stage left, then:
            
      
               
            Enter[s] [again] with devils, giving crowns and rich apparel to Faustus; they dance, and then depart.F
            austus. Speak Mephistopheles, what means this show?M
            ephistopheles. Nothing Faustus, but to delight thy mind withal,And to show thee what magic can perform.
            (s.d., 2.1.83–85)<br>

Abstract: The substance of Ricoeur’s analysis is also problematic, specifically its attempt to incorporate “defilement” together with “sin” and “guilt” into a single linear scheme of changing conceptions of evil. Most recent studies endorse a more descriptive approach. See e.g., T. Frymer-Kensky, “Pollution, Purification and Purgation in Biblical Israel,” in
         The Word of the Lord Shall Go Forth: Essays in Honor of David Noel Freedman in Celebration of his Sixtieth Birthday, ed. C. L. Meyers and M. O’Connor (Winona Lake, IN, 1983), 399–414; D. P. Wright, “Clean and Unclean,”ABDVI, 729–41; ibid., “The Spectrum of Priestly Impurity,” inPriesthood and Cult in Ancient Israel, ed. G. A. Anderson and S. M. Olyan, JSOTSup 125 (Sheffield, 1991), 150–81; S. M. Olyan,Rites and Rank: Hierarchy in Biblical Representations of Cult(Princeton, 2000), 38–62.<br>

Abstract: Yet the “Tallensi recognize the existence of evil. They experience and give vent to envy, greed, hate, and malice” (
         1987:212). As it turns out, for Tallensi, the locus of evil, and certainly of misfortune, is Destiny. It is “thought of as a component of a person’s personhood” that is effective from birth, but unlike the Azande hereditary witchcraft substance it is “chosen” by a person prenatally (149). Evil predestiny accounts for a condition or conduct counter to customary norms and is “apt to be adduced where there is a difficult or impossible moral dilemma to be resolved” (153), precisely where other African societies might invoke matrilineal witchcraft (Ashanti), ancestral ghosts (Ndembu), lineage sorcery (Zulu), or spirit attack (Hausa). The Tallensi thus serve as a prime example of the limitations of a study of witchcraft as an approach to evil, precisely by showing not its absence but how it reappears in a different cultural pattern that is equally critical to understanding morality.<br>

Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Bonhoeffer’s critique of religion and morality and Badiou’s approach to Greek and Jewish discourses share an underlying negative, anti-idolatrous intuition that allows Bonhoeffer to preserve the holistic and gratuitous character of faith concurring with life and that enables Badiou to speak of the content of the “resurrection truth-event” as the exclusive source of the declaration’s force. Bonhoeffer focuses on acting on the word of Jesus by the participation in Jesus’s being for others, whereas Badiou stresses the importance of declaring the event by the subjective persistence of fidelity that constitutes truth’s substance. But in both cases, faith seen as the only accurate response to Jesus’s call to discipleship (Bonhoeffer)/the event interrupting the old order (Badiou) presupposes some sort of ontological “empty space” or “void” that makes faith as such possible and results in a new type of language that breaks up with traditional religious discourses.<br>

Abstract: The Ionian cosmogonies of the sixth century b.c.e. explained how an ordered world evolved out of an undifferentiated initial state of “things.” In the fifth century, science became more particularly an inquiry into the ultimate constitution of material substance: the uniform and permanent “nature of things.” The notion of substance derives from tactile sensation. The belief in substantial things outside us reverts to the original detachment of self from the object. With Heraclitus of Ephesus, philosophy focused on knowing the thing, not on that which is known. Thought controls the phenomena as it constitutes the thinker. The problem of understanding nature was taken to a new level. The Milesian school of philosophers had moved it to the realm of the intellect in that they claimed the universe to be an intelligible whole. The manifold was to be understood as deriving from a sustaining principle or first cause, but was to be perceived in the phenomena.<br>

Abstract: Le dépassement phénoménologique du substantialisme métaphysique devrait permettre aujourd'hui d'envisager une refondation de la notion de personne, laquelle s'était quelque peu immobilisée depuis Boèce. Sur ce nouvel horizon, le retour à la fondation première, celle d'Augustin, s'impose. Celui-ci est le premier en effet, pour l'essentiel dans son traité de la Trinité, à avoir clairement pensé la personne (divine) comme relation et non comme substance. La réduction augustinienne de la personne (humaine) à l'ego ou à « l'homme intérieur » ouvre la possibilité d' « analogies subjectives » avec la Trinité: pensée, amour, connaissance; mémoire, intelligence, volonté. Cependant, la spéculation augustinienne trouve sa limite en échouant à penser une personne de chair — et, qui plus est, une telle personne comme « en relation ». Ce qui était relation en Dieu reste, en l'homme, substance pensante, seule face à son Dieu. Phenomenology has overcome the old substance of metaphysics and then should permit us today to refound the idea of the person which was in a way, since Boethius, brought to a standstill. Therefore we must to go back to St. Augustine who was actually the first, in his De Trinitate, to conceive, the (divine) person as a relation and not as a substance. The (human) person so confined to the ego or to the « inner man » allows some possible « subjective analogies » with the Trinity: thought, love, knowledge, memory, intelligence and will. However the Augustinian theory fails to conceive first the person in her own flesh and blood — a bodily person — and secondly such a person as being « in relation »: man is a thinking substance, alone facing her God.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: What is the direction of South African theological ethics as that country moves out of the apartheid era into a new democratic future? Following its struggle against apartheid, how will theology respond to the new challenge of making clear its distinctive stance in a democratic, multi-faith society with a secular constitution? A danger, similar to that previously discussed in the United States, exists in South Africa as theology evolves from a mode of resistance to that of compliance and accommodation, especially under the guise of "nation-building." The essay plots a trajectory by means of a consideration of four works representing nonracial liberationist theology which emerged at key points in the past fifteen years—the Kairos Document (1985), and works by Albert Nolan (1988), Charles Villla-Vicencio (1992), and James Cochrane (1999). For all their contextual sensitivity and strength, these works appear to offer little of a distinctively theological nature, and little of Christian substance to church and society. The way lies open for the development of an African Christian ethics.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h~<br>

« La force de ce vocabulaire de la capacité, du pouvoir, de la puissance, a été reconnue par
Aristote comme horexis, par Spinoza comme conatus - j'aime me référer à Spinoza non seule-
ment parce qu'il définit à titre primordial toute substance finie par son effort pour exister et per-
sévérer dans l'être, mais parce que dans le Traité politique il place le concept de potentia dans
le prolongement direct de son ontologie du conatus pour l'opposer à la potestas de Hobbes et de
Machiavel. »<br>

Author(s): Worms Frédéric<br>
Abstract: Ibid., p. 367, souligné dans le texte. Il faudrait commenter ici au plus près cette section
intermédiaire capitale de l'étude conclusive : « Vers quelle ontologie? ». Ajoutons ici seule-
ment deux remarques brèves. 1. La phrase que nous citons est précédée par celle-ci : « Bien-
venu serait le penseur qui saurait porter la réappropriation "spinoziste" de Yénergeia aristotéli-
cienne à un niveau comparable à celui qu'ont dès maintenant atteint les réappropriations "hei-
deggeriennes" de l'ontologie aristotéliciennes. » Or, à cette étonnante question, une réponse
possible serait celle-ci : ce penseur, c'est Bergson; cette reprise de l'ontologie de l'agir, contre
celle de la substance, de l'énergie contre celle de l'être, du conatus, c'est la durée. 2. Comment
comprendre que Ricœur rattache apparemment le versant de l'agir ou du conatus à une « prove-
nance » dite « juive », et l'autre versant à la « grecque »? Il y a là une énigme, qui mériterait
réflexion. Bergson, pour le citer à nouveau dans cette note, renvoie plutôt à une opposition entre
modernes et anciens, entre la Vie et l'Idée. Mais on ne peut ici que poser un jalon, sur un che-
min qu'on ne pouvait pas ne pas relever, mais qu'il faudra suivre une autre fois.<br>

Publisher: University of Notre Dame English Department<br>
Issue: i24395981<br>
Date: 10 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Knight Christopher J.<br>
Abstract: In this essay, I argue that Penelope Fitzgerald's The Gate of Angels attempts to work out the difficulties that any intelligent, religiously inclined person must come to terms with in the twentieth, now twentieth-first, century. Fitzgerald sought not to shelter her religious belief behind a cloister wall, thinking like her uncle the Reverend Wilfred Knox, "that no cloister walls can be high enough to exclude the cares of the world." Among these cares is the desire to give a faithful report of the world to each other, to know this world as it exists in truth, and not to misrepresent it. Early twentieth-century investigations into the makeup of the physical world as well as the theoretical and intellectual advances possible with quantum physics were very much part of this desire; and in The Gate of Angels, set in and around Cambridge University's pre-war physics laboratories, Fitzgerald offers a beautiful rendering of the excitement engendered by these investigations. At the same time, Fitzgerald offers a picture, true to her own experience, wherein things that in the popular mind are often conceived of as opposite and irreconcilable—for instance, chance and necessity—are found to stand in a relation of sympathy, casting over The Gate of Angels "that sympathetic glow which," Henry James wrote, "forms half the substance of our genial impressions."<br>

Abstract: Dès ses premières réflexions portant sur le volontaire et l'involontaire, Ricœur aborde frontalement l'énigme du mal. Si celle-ci croise la tradition biblique et la philosophie, elle ne conduit pas la pensée à souscrire à une théodicée mais à élaborer une pensée de l'agir. Pour Ricœur, l'être est acte plutôt que substance car il engage à l'action pour répliquer au mal.<br>

Abstract: Exemple particulièrement parlant, lors d'une discussion à Chatila entamée
sur les groupes de zaffé, plusieurs personnes avaient fini par être réunies à
chercher ainsi un ou deux représentants de « Nujum filastin », chaque
intermédiaire s'agrégeant à notre procession (« une manifestation » dit l'un
d'entre eux). Nous finîmes par être une petite dizaine à nous retrouver dans un
appartement et la conversation, m'échappant totalement, s'orienta vers la
stigmatisation urbaine. Un ami de Nahr al-Bareed soutenait que, vu du Nord,
Chatila apparaissait comme un espace marginal rempli de drogues et d'armes,
ce à quoi un habitant du camp répondit en substance : « ça c'est rien, même à
Ghazza ils parlent de nous ». L'immeuble Ghazza, ancien hôpital de l'OLP
reconverti en appartements, abrite des familles palestiniennes relogées durant
la guerre et est situé dans le voisinage direct de Chatila, avenue Sabra.
Finalement, probablement pris de pitié pour l'anthropologue un peu coi, un des
interlocuteurs finit par demander de laisser là cette conversation pour
s'intéresser à la zaffa et à la debké.<br>

Abstract: In this context, Dooyeweerd's reading of Stoker seems misleading. When Stoker suggests
that his concept of substance gives a better expression to "the autonomous being and value of
the cosmos with respect to God" {die eien zijn en die eienwaarde van die kosmos teenover God),
Dooyeweerd fears that the radical biblical view of the dependence of all creation upon God is
somehow being threatened (NC, III, 71). But this overlooks precisely the point Stoker is
affirming: namely, the real difference instituted between the Creator and His creation by the
very act of creating. Accordingly, creation is not self-sufficient; but it is not nothing; it is
something. (Cf. Zigterman, op.cit., pp. 129,132,136.)<br>

Abstract: Especially in connection with this 'before and after death' questions can be raised. Does
the soul emerge from the process of dying unchanged? I suggested that, considering the no-
longer-in-sin after death, this is unlikely. There is continuity and discontinuity. The question is
whether the discontinuity is so great that it threatens the identity of the soul as non-material
substance. Cooper would not go this far, because he seems to identify personal identity with the
existence of the soul. Such identification is questionable however, not only because in this way
the personal character of corporeality becomes a problem (the personification of the body is
then secondary since it is achieved only in the joining of the corporeal and the spiritual), it is
also questionable because human personhood ultimately is and remains a secret — a mysteiy
that permits no identification with whatever substance.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342994<br>
Date: 10 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Mink John H.<br>
Abstract: Ankersmit's articulation of a postmodern theory of history takes seriously both the strengths of traditional historicism and the right of historians to decide what makes sense for disciplinary practice. That makes him an exemplary interlocutor. Ankersmit proposes a theory of historical "representation" which radicalizes the narrative approach to historiography along the lines of poststructuralist textualism. Against this postmodernism but invoking some of his own arguments, I defend the traditional historicist position. I formulate criticisms of the theory of reference entailed in his notion of "narrative substance," of his master analogy of historiography with modern painting, and finally of his characterization of historical hermeneutics. In each case I find him guilty of the hyperbole which he himself cautions against. While it is true that historical narratives cannot be taken to be transparent, in taking them to be opaque Ankersmit puts himself in an untenable position. Finally, Ankersmit seeks to buttress his theoretical case by an interpretation of the new cultural historical texts of authors like Davis and Ginzburg. While this is a concreteness heartily to be welcomed in philosophers of history, I cannot find his construction of this new school's work plausible.<br>

Abstract: This paper deals with the manner of negotiating the relation to its colonial past of France in the Maghreb, concentrating on a key episode in the national historical account, the battle held to have taken place at Poitiers in 732. The creation, near Châtellerault, of a memorial site for that battle, and the annual commemoration which takes place there, constitute the substance of this paper, unfolding in three phases: firstly, an archeology of the genesis of the “Site of 732” situated in the context of the years from 1960 to 1970; secondly, an analysis of the contents of the site as seen through the typology of the discourses constructing the museum project; finally, clearly setting out the social issues involved in memorialisation, through observation and using the survey carried out on visitors to the site.<br>

Abstract: La stèle du Bronzo est gravée d'un oiseau "levé", en plein vol, la tête tournée vers l'extérieurs, superposé à un filon de quartz blanc; une crosse, également traitée en champlevé, lui barre le passage. En première lecture, une identification plausible du genre volatile semblait prévaloir et le colombidé emportait notre adhésion. Mais une analyse plus posée et un effort de déconstruction graphique du motif permettront cette fois de reprendre et d'affiner la reconnaissance, en décrivant les différents filtres autorisant tel ou tel rejet de catégorie ou d'espèce, pour ne conserver en dernier ressort que les meilleurs prétendants à la seule confrontation possible, celle qui oppose les corvidés aux colombidés. La représentation du Bronzo est en définitive équivalente en substance et en structure aux scènes figurées sur les stèles voisines dans lesquelles un phallus s'oppose qu tranchant d'une lame de hache (Mané Rutual), tandis qu'un cachalot affronte la coalition des animaux et des outils de l'homme (Table des Marchand). A "flushed" bird is engraved on the Bronzo stela, in full flight, its head turned to the exterior, superposed over a white quartz vein; a crook, equally treated in cut-away engraving, bars its passage. At a first reading, a plausible identification of the bird seemed to prevail and the Columbidae met with our approval. However, more deliberate analysis and an effort at the graphic deconstruction of the motif allows the identification to be reconsidered and improved, by describing the various filters authorising the rejection of such or such a category, finally preserving the best claimants to the only possible confrontation, opposing Corvidae to Columbidae. The Bronzo representation is equivalent in substance and in structure to the scenes on the neighbouring stelae where a phallus is opposed to the sharp edge of an axe blade (Mané Rutual), while a sperm-whale confronts the coalition of animals and human tools (Table des Marchand). However Bronzo is a ~<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i371427<br>
Date: 1 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): McKendrick Karen L.<br>
Abstract: The critical reception of Asher B. Durand's 1855 painting In the Woods sets out some of the preeminent concerns and terms of debate for the genre, and for art in general in the years preceding the Civil War. The painting divided critical opinion. Employing common aesthetic criteria, the opposing writers all took up the question of whether a landscape painting should dwell on factual details. The commentary, however, expressed aesthetic opinions in a vocabulary of labour, materialism, and commodities. Consequently, I consider the relationship between the form of the painting and the partisanship of its reception, how we might read the uneasy and indirect, yet evident rhetorical movement between aesthetic terms and economic ones, and what the implications were for the definition of landscape painting. Arguing that In the Woods offered the material substance of the world as a value by itself, and a mode of viewing that installed significance on the surface, I suggest that the debate was over the larger role of art. Would representation be defined by materialism? Should art, with its lofty status as a transcendent value, sanction by adopting, the mode of vision utilised by the commodity?<br>

Abstract: Mise radicalement en question par l'accusation de l'épître aux Corinthiens : „La sagesse du monde est folie devant Dieu.” (I Cor. 3,19), la raison humaine doit chercher une méthode, qui lui permettra de parvenir à une conscience de soi, capable d'assumer cette accusation. Cette méthode ne peut être que la réflexion, à laquelle les protagonistes de la phénoménologie, aussi bien que ceux de l'analyse reflexive, font appel. Thévenaz entamera une étude approfondie et critique de ces deux méthodes pour en garder ce qui lui semble valable. Ce faisant il parviendra à une position intermédiaire. Husserl, en épistémologue, ignorant toute conscience de soi, même implicite, reconnaît l'inténtionnalité comme structure unique de la raison humaine. Aussi, pour découvrir et expliciter le sujet concret et intentionnellement lié au monde, il ne lui reste que la solution de projeter cette liaison dans le champ transcendantal, qui se déploie sous les yeux d'un spectateur impartial. Ainsi surgit une nouvelle facticité qui reste nécessairement irréfléchie. Thévenaz accepte volontiers les avantages de cette méthode. Non seulement elle permet de dépasser l'opposition idéalisme-réalisme, mais en plus elle échappe au formalisme kantien, en nous livrant le concret comme tel, le vécu, l'être comme rencontre. Cependant, en insistant exclusivement sur l'intentionnalité, elle met en question cette même intentionnalité. Le sujet concret, doublure du moi transcendantal et intentionnel, redevient ce qu'il était avant la réduction, un oeil sans intériorité braqué sur un nouveau spectacle, le champ transcendantal. Le sujet concret n'y apporte aucun apport constitutif. Le concret s'échappe à nouveau et la naïveté de la „natürliche Einstellung” n'est pas vaincue, mais consacrée. Sartre, quoiqu'il admette une conscience (de) soi, résultant d'un acte de néantisation radicale, se heurte à la même difficulté. Le sujet concret échappe à la réflexion à cause du dédoublement inéluctable inhérent à cette réfle~<br>

Abstract: 1. La problématique née en philosophie par le structuralisme, se cristallise dans une confrontation de la linguistique et de la philosophie du langage. Toutes les sciences humaines modernes s'inscrivent en effet dans le programme d'une sémiologie, science globale de la signification des signes et construite sur le modèle de la sémantique, discipline traitant la signification du signe linguistique. C'est à propos du récit, et en particulier du récit littéraire, que nous opposons l'analyse structurale, mouvement destructif qui réduit la plénitude du sens, à l'herméneutique, „interprétation comme récollection du sens” (P. Ricoeur). La critique littéraire connaissait déjà l'étude immanente du récit littéraire. C'est à l'intérieur de la critique immanente qu'il faut opposer un courant où l'œuvre est considérée comme sujet (p.e. G. Poulet) à la tendance formalisante (nous pensons particulièrement à L. Spitzer et au New Criticism). Mais ce n'est que l'analyse structurale qui pousse au bout cette objectivation puisque elle n'est pas seulement classificatoire mais aussi réductioniste. 2. Nous supposons l'homologie totale de la littérature et du langage : le récit est un discours linguistique. La possibilité d'une étude structurale du récit dépend donc de la possibilité de la sémantique. On connaît les difficultés que cette science linguistique de la signification rencontre dans l'élaboration de sa méthode : ni l'analyse distributionnelle (Z. Harris), ni l'analyse sémique (A. Greimas) ne se déroulent complètement à l'intérieur de la linguistique. Ce n'est que la grammaire generative de N. Chomsky, cette syntaxe créatrice qui décrit les structures qui rendent possible toute signification sémantique, qui fait entrevoir une solution au problème. Cette étude de l'activité dynamique du langage ou des conditions de possibilité de la signification affirme la primauté de la syntaxe sur la sémantique. Le récit, comme chaque discours, est, quant à sa structure, analogique et homologiqu~<br>

Author(s): Wiley Douglas<br>
Abstract: This article argues for a synthesis of George Herbert Mead's conception of the temporal and intersubjective nature of the self with Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory of narrative identity. Combining the insights of Ricoeur's philosophical analysis with Mead's social-psychological orientation provides a subtle, sophisticated, and potent explanation of self-identity. A narrative conception of identity implies that subjectivity is neither a philosophical illusion nor an impermeable substance. Rather, a narrative identity provides a subjective sense of self-continuity as it symbolically integrates the events of lived experience in the plot of the story a person tells about his or her life. The utility of this conception of identity is illustrated through a rereading of Erving Goffman's study of the experience of mental patients. This example underlines the social sources of the self-concept and the role of power and politics in the construction of narrative identities.<br>

L'accord de Rousseau avec la critique moderne des idées innées et son désaccord avec le monisme matérialiste dans la psychologie empirique ne rendent pas seulement compte de la manière (ou méthode) par laquelle Rousseau perçoit la politique, mais aussi du remplacement de l'idée classique de la raison pratique par les principes formels d'égalité et de liberté comme principes du jugement politique. La reconnaissance par Rousseau des limites du formalisme, comme étant le motif d'une pratique individuelle, explique son emploi d'artifices à la fois rhétoriques et poétiques, servant à donner une substance dynamique aux « formes » que son enseignement préconise. Sa vision politique devient ainsi une synthèse ingénieuse du formalisme mathématique et de l'aisthesis poétique. Rousseau's epistemological conceptions affect his perceptions and discourse on politics. Rousseau's agreement with the modern criticism of inate ideas and his disagreement with materialist monism in empirical psychology do not only account for the manner (or method) in which Rousseau perceives of politics, but also the replacement of the classical idea of practical reason by formal principles of equality and liberty as principles of political judgement. Rousseau's recognition of the limits of formalism as the grounds for individual practice explains his use of both rhetorical and poetic devices which give dynamic substance to the " forms " envisaged by his teaching. His political vision thus becomes an ingenious synthesis of mathematical formalism and poetical aisthesis.<br>

Abstract: A rebours de l'illusion rétrospective qui tend à ancrer le totalitarisme comme abolition de la démocratie dans le phénomène révolutionnaire lui-même, l'œuvre de Rosa Luxemburg se caractérise par l'exigence jamais abandonnée d'articuler révolution et démocratie. La révolution (dont la théorie apparaît dans Grève de masses, parti et syndicat) est chez elle la redécouverte par les masses de l'action politique : c'est ainsi qu'à partir de certaines catégories de pensée arendtienne on peut interpréter la notion de spontanéité, laquelle est auto-organisation et non violence. De plus, Rosa Luxemburg ne cessera de considérer comme essentielle la question de la forme de régime politique appropriée au pouvoir du peuple (d'où ses critiques adressées à la Révolution russe), s'inscrivant en faux contre la notion de « démocratie bourgeoise ». Refusant toute conception de l'action politique comme fabrication, commandement ou stratégie militaire, il y a chez elle une théorie de l'organisation politique d'inspiration machiavélienne, dont l'action est vue comme une intervention dans le présent et la contingence. Cette contingence reste toutefois inscrite dans le cadre fixé par Marx qui fait du conflit de classe la substance de l'action politique. Contrary to the retrospective illusion which tends to locate totalitarianism as abolition of democracy in the revolutionary phenomenon itself, Rosa Luxemburg's work is characterized by the ever present requirement to join revolution and democracy. Revolution (the theory of which appears in Mass strikes, parties and unions) is the masses' rediscovery of political action; one can thus, using certain categories of Arendt's thought, interpret the concept of spontaneity as self organization rather than violence. Moreover, Rosa Luxemburg never ceased considering as essential the issue of the form of political regime appropriate for popular power (which explains her criticism of the Russian revolution), and was opposed to the concept of "bourgeois ~<br>

Author(s): Breton Stanislas<br>
Abstract: Le silence des théologiens sur ce qui, jadis, fit partie de leur discipline suscite une question: pourquoi les anges se sont-ils tus? Comment pourraient-ils à nouveau parler? L'article tente de répondre à la question en rappelant d'abord ce que pourrait suggérer au mathématicien l'antique doctrine des « substances séparées ». Mais, et surtout, au-delà de la « substance », au-delà même des « missions » que la Bible lui assigne, l'ange semble bénéficier d'une dimension « poétique ». L'auteur tente une élucidation de cette fonction poétique, en liaison avec ce qu'il appelle la fonction « Méta ». The silence of theologians on what was formerly a part of their scholarly discipline raises a question: why have the angels become silent? How could they speak once again? This article intends to answer the question by first recalling what the ancient doctrine of "separated substances" would suggest to a mathematician. But more importantly, beyond "substance" and even beyond the "messenger" role that the Bible gives them, angels seem to be endowed with a "poetic" dimension. The author attempts to elucidate this poetic function in connexion with what he calls the "meta" function.<br>

Abstract: Le témoin n'est ni un spectateur, ni un propriétaire, ni un conservateur, ni un producteur, ni un juge, mais il est celui qui accueille ce qui se donne à lui et se reçoit de cette épreuve d'une altérité irréductible. La force des analyses de Kierkegaard est de montrer que l'élucidation de l'essence du témoignage, qui conduit à la substitution du témoin au je, ne peut être séparée d'une elucidation de l'essence de la vérité. La vérité n'étant pas ce que je produis, mais ce qui me touche et m'éclaire, le témoignage se donne comme une communication directe-indirecte qui consiste à dire la vérité tout en l'existant Exister c'est témoigner en faisant de sa vie une tâche dans la passion essentielle de la vérité. En cela seul le témoignage chrétien révèle véritablement l'essence du témoignage puisque seul il donne vraiment à voir le saut du témoignage, qui conduit à ne pas se contenter de persister dans l'être pour s'ouvrir à la possibilité de devenir tout autre en s'abandonnant à la vérité et en acceptant de souffrir pour elle dans le monde. Dans cette philosophie du témoignage, le témoin devient alors le vrai nom de la personne contre l'abstraction du sujet-substance. A witness is neither a spectator, a proprietor, a preservator, a producer nor a judge, he is the one that receives what is given to him and who, from this test of irreducible alterity, receives himself. The strength of Kierkegaard's analyses is in showing that the elucidation of the essence of witnessing, which leads to the witness being substituted to the "I-myself", is inseparable from the elucidation of the essence of truth. Truth being not what I make but what marks and enlightens me, witnessing is given to be a direct-indirect communication which consists of saying the truth while being it. To be is to give witness by making one's life a task in the essential passion of truth. For this, Christian witness alone truly reveals the essence of witnessing for it alone truly allows one to see the leap of witn~<br>

Date: 11 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Thompson Paul<br>
Abstract: In any field of experience anthropologists are confronted by spates of signs, many of which they fail to perceive. By way of an analysis of the mundane activities associated with riding a Songhay bush taxi in the Republic of Niger, this article probes the reflexive process through which anthropologist and ethnographic other learn to interpret the signs that comprise the discourse of social action. Having been confronted repeatedly with the signs of the other's universe, anthropologists may not only gain a new awareness of the sociocultural systems they seek to uncover but may also realize the limitations of their knowledge. Through what Dilthey called the hermeneutic, anthropologists will be more able to proceed profoundly and accurately toward an understanding of those signs that give substance and order to the complexities of social universes.

Abstract: Is the most important function of education to provide students with basic skills and useful knowledge in order to eventually become employable? In many parts of the world knowledge league tables and policy documents inform us this is the case. As the question of what should form the educational content seems to be answered, teachers can concentrate on how they should teach, and researchers can concentrate on what method is the most effective. In the current rhetoric, however, many vital pedagogical issues have been placed in the background and the aesthetic subjects are downgraded. These tendencies worried Frede V. Nielsen who stated that didactic studies and philosophical inquiries yet again are needed to explore and give substance to the content dimension. Nielsen's writings on didactics form the basis for this essay, where we highlight which perspectives and dilemmas could be placed on a critical, philosophical didactic study agenda. The starting point is the field of tension between the what and the why of education.<br>

Issue: jafrireli.1.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 2013<br>
Abstract: The two points being made here, the impact of dispersed (diaspora) African cultures on the meaning of continental Africa, and the manner in which the study and meaning of their existence provide the basis for a radical critique of a Eurocentric universal world history, provide the substance for Joseph E. Harris's edited work on the African diaspora. To date it remains the most substantial volume on the topic. First published in 1982, a second edition was published in 1993. It begins with an introductory essay by Elliot P. Skinner and ends with a concluding essay by St. Clair Drake. Intervening essays deal with the United States, Mesoamerica, Europe, South America, and topics covering religion, return of Africans to the continent, and Africans in Islam, and in Asia. The volume makes clear that any limitation of the African diaspora to the Middle Passage, as important as it is, does not exhaust the nature and meanings involved in the African diaspora.

Abstract: Brentano himself perhaps takes a tiny step in this direction when he says of the I-substance (as the individuating independent part of consciousness) that it does not have length, breadth, or depth; nor is it round or square, nor does it have color and other sensory qualities.
         
                  And further, given that it is without any such bodily differentiation, he says that there is a consideration that serves as a positive substitute: in inner perception the I-substance appears to us “not merely as substance but also in contrast to that which is corporeal, as a spiritual [24
               geistige] substance.” In other words it is presented “as a zero-dimensional substance which, although it is unextended, is a thing for itself without any connectedness to its surroundings. It thus does not appear as a mere boundary like a point in a continuum of points.”

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: For example, Saint Anselm of Canterbury posits in
         Proslogion, and more extensively inLiber apologeticus contra Gaunilonem, that “God is that than which nothing greater can be conceived.” One might suggest that he is here engaging in a hyperbolic mode of thought in his argument of unlimited development for the ontological proof of God's existence. Other than for his satisfaction theory of atonement offered inCur deus homo, Anselm is most known for this proof. Responding, in many ways, to nominalists such as Roscellin, abbot of Compiegne, who argued that universals are only words and have no actual existence, Anselm sought to prove God's existence through reason alone. For Anselm, God is a “universal substance,” which exists in both intellect and reality, and is the rule against which all is measured. In his argument he pushes toward this ultimate term, which he takes to dizzying heights through his use ofamplificatio. Employingincrementumby asserting what has no superior at all (Quintilian 8.4.7), Anselm presents his argument of intense degree—“that than which nothing greater can be conceived.” Although it is doubtful his explicit intent is to approach his discussion of God from a hyperbolic standpoint, in order to address the exigence of such an extraordinary subject matter he argues in the most effective way possible—through the practice of excess. Drawing the mind to the extreme limit, as Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca say, Anselm stretches the limits of reason through the hyperbolic within an argument of unlimited development in order to express what is inconceivable.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: Although Shaw may be many admirable things, he is not a university-trained philosopher of hermeneutics and phenomenology. Ricoeur is. Yet when it comes to contemplating matters of faith and hope, little of consequence, if anything, separates the two, in terms of both substance and method. To begin with, the first presupposition Shaw employs to orient himself to existence is the same as Ricoeur's: the unsullied innocence of creation. Every infant, according to Shaw, is an “experiment … a fresh attempt to produce the just man made perfect: that is, to make humanity divine.”
         
               Each child, Shaw says, possesses a “divine spark,” a “vital impulse” that impels it “towards perfection.”38
            
               In all children, then, latent divinity lies dormant, awaiting cultivation by the guardians of civilization. In other words, the good toward which the budding vanguards of the future instinctively aspire is not wholly outside them. It also lives within them: it is encoded on the helical strands of their DNA.39
            
               For Shaw, the deific imprint of all that is virtuous and consecrated in the world inheres uncorrupted in the human genome.40<br>
