  Unpublished Freud Correspondence from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cc2kmd">Freud's Moses</a><br>
  Author(s) Yerushalmi Yosef Hayim<br>
  Abstract: “Prelude” rather than “introduction,” for in all essential respects the work must introduce itself along the way; “listener” rather than “reader,” for the text that follows remains exactly as it was delivered orally. Except that my lectures have become chapters I have altered nothing, in the hope that some echo of the spoken word will somehow survive the transition onto the printed page. Tempted though I was to dispense with any further apparatus, my scholarly superego (as well as my own frequent frustration in trying to trace the sources of others) has induced me to add<br>

  FOURTEEN  Back Matter<br>
  On the Writing of the Manifesto of the 121 from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1f89tnz">Citizen Subject</a><br>
  Author(s) Macey David<br>
  Abstract: What is a citizen subject? A hyphenated subject, equal parts political citizen and subjected individual conscience? A freestanding agent capable of being federated with others? The ratifier of moral law, the self-punisher who dies by a thousand cuts at the hands of his or her own superego? The lead in a play about the psychic life of power in the era of weak states? The plebian legislator posed against the citizen king? A figure of possessive individualism reversed (which is to say, a self-dispossessed collectivist)? Or the

 from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nq3bb">On Evil</a><br>
  Abstract: Fifteen years ago, two ten-year-old boys tortured and killed a toddler in the north of England. There was an outcry of public horror, though why the public found this particular murder especially shocking is not entirely clear. Children, after all, are only semi-socialised creatures who can be expected to behave pretty savagely from time to time. If Freud is to be credited, they have a weaker superego or moral sense than their elders. In this sense, it is surprising that such grisly events do not occur more often. Perhaps children murder each other all the time and are simply keeping<br>

  CHRONOLOGY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/brun16642">The Habermas Handbook</a><br>
  Author(s) NEVES MARCELO<br>
  Abstract: Behaviorism understands cognitive learning as a cumulative process of forming associations based on the perception of contingencies, and normative learning as a process of adopting desired modes of behavior in response to punishment and reward (that is, as a process of conditioning). From a psychoanalytic perspective, development is a matter of constructing mental patterns on the basis of the relationships experienced in early childhood. Norms are observed because the child wishes to avoid pangs of conscience (i.e., the revenge of the superego, which internalizes the fear of castration); alternatively, this occurs because the structure of biological needs has undergone change<br>

  A New Humanism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7560/717985">Why the Humanities Matter</a><br>
  Abstract: In the last chapter, I discussed briefly how, one way or another, a Cartesian and/or Kantian approach to the self and world leads to idealist and/or relativist epistemological dead-ends. In this chapter, I explore more generally how speculative and idealist formulations of language, knowledge, and the self inform much of the theory circulating in humanities departments today that seeks to identify positions of resistance and reclamation within the straightjacket of a so-called late capitalism. To do so, I discuss Sigmund Freud’s metapyschological formulations—

Journal Title: Current Anthropology<br>
Article Title: Freud Meets Lévi‐Strauss in Melanesia<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ca.2004.45.issue-1<br>
Date: 02 2004<br>
Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Doctrine and method, theory and interpretation are not necessarily coordinate. Were such coordination possible, a metacritical stance would be required. By accepting uncritically the presuppositions that lie behind psychoanalytic metapsychology, Juillerat abrogates, in my view, ethnological responsibility, that is, the responsibility to measure in a receptive manner the presuppositions of ones hermeneutic against those of the culture one is studying. Though his attention to ethnographic detail leads Juillerat to refine psychoanalytic doctrine, it confirms the epistemological and hermeneutic assumptions of that doctrine (e.g., notions of the unconscious, id, ego, and superego, drives, repression, and, indeed, psychic space). Yafar myth and ritual as he presents them become allegories of that doctrineallegories, I would argue, of allegories. There would appear to be no escape, were it not for the Yafar voices that sound through Juillerats psychoanalytically predetermined presentations. (He offers us almost no contextualized verbatim texts in these essays, though he does in his monographs.) They remind us that, as LviStrauss demonstrated, myths are readily translated one into another, particularly when they are decontextualized. What is of ethnographic, indeed, psychoanalytic import is howand perhaps whytranslation is arrested and a particular myth (e.g., the Oedipal tale) becomes so authoritative that it has the power of promiscuous reduction. Though fascinated by the range of Yafar cultural expression, Juillerat fails to consider the implications of Yafars refusal to reduce their corpus of mythology and ritual to a single mytha singular ritual.<br>

Abstract: Here, the implied moral “tension” may be compared, by way of illustration, to Sigmund Freud’s rather narrower interpretive hermeneutical “tension” between the active ego and the passivity of the id and the superego. Just as psychological health arises from a productive “working through” of conflicts and repressions at the dynamic intersection of consciousness and the unconscious (in such ongoing practices as dream interpretation, psychoanalytic catharsis, and superego sublimation), so also in moral life may intersubjective and historical tensions move the self toward previously unformed and even cathartic meaning in relation to others. Social, relational, historical, and cultural “tension”—a term that comes from the Latin
         tensioor “stretching”—is a condition for the possibility of moral identity and meaning in the first place. The human moral “desire to be” is realized through an original, unavoidable, restless, and indeed apparently infinite innovation and working through of new social relations.<br>

Article Title: Against Wholeness: The Ego's Complicity in Religion<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263718<br>
Date: 12 1, 1958<br>
Author(s): Vergote Volney P.<br>
Abstract: Many students of religion suggest that wholeness or the attainment of an integrated self is an especially valuable goal whose attainment marks a moment of religious insight. Theoreticians like Jung, Allport, and Maslow strongly support this belief. Freud does not. To reconcile the two camps one must either drop Freud altogether or confine his critique of religion to an attack upon neurotic religion, or more exactly, religion based upon superego functioning. One could then claim that healthy religion is a function of the ego, e.g., the ego's tendency towards integrated functioning and the attainment of 'wholeness'. I argue that this ploy, which is itself a function of an egosyntonic desire for wholeness, is altogether wrong. It misrepresents Freud's ego psychology and it therefore misrepresents his critique of the ego's role in religion as well. First, his theoretical, as opposed to his literary, critique of religion is also a critique of certain characteristics of the ego. Second, these characteristics, especially the ego-syntonic drive towards feelings of wholeness, are functions of the ego's obedience to repetition compulsion. Third, the later texts on religion cannot be understood apart from their roots in Freud's earliest theory of ego functioning, especially the physicalist program he developed in his "Project" of 1895. The ego creates and takes part in religious dramas which present an illusory world of wholeness and completion of self. But as the seat of reality testing it must pierce the veils as quickly and as repeatedly as it weaves them.<br>

Abstract: Santner argues that a crucial distinction between Rosenzwieg and Levinas is that the latter fails
only has one concept of interpellatioin and, as a result, his "characterizations of the ethical summons
with regard to the other often sound like descriptions of a punishing superego" (2001: 65, n 32).<br>
