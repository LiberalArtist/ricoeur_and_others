  Book Title: The Political Style of Conspiracy-Chase, Summer, and Lincoln<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Pfau Michael William<br>
  Abstract: The turbulent history of the United States has provided a fertile ground for conspiracies, both real and imagined. From the American Revolution to the present day, conspiracy discourse-linguistic and symbolic practices and artifacts revolving around themes, claims, or accusations of conspiracy-has been a staple of political rhetoric. Some conspiracy theories never catch on with the public, while others achieve widespread popularity. Whether successful or not, the means by which particular conspiracy theories spread is a rhetorical process, a process in which persuasive language, symbolism, and arguments act upon individual minds within concrete historical and political settings.Conspiracy rhetoric was a driving force in the evolution of antebellum political culture, contributing to the rise and fall of the great parties in the nineteenth century. One conspiracy theory in particular-the "slave power" conspiracy-was instrumental in facilitating the growth of the young Republican Party's membership and ideology.
      The Political Style of Conspiracyanalyzes the concept and reality of the "slave power" in the rhetorical discourse of the mid-nineteenth-century, in particular the speeches and writing of politicians Salmon P. Chase, Charles Sumner, and Abraham Lincoln. By examining their mainstream texts, Pfau reveals that, in addition to the "paranoid style" of conspiracy rhetoric that inhabits the margins of political life, Lincoln, Chase, and Sumner also engaged in a distinctive form of conspiracy rhetoric that is often found at the center of mainstream American society and politics.<br>

  Abstract: Conspiracy, the secret cooperation for the achievement of some base design, has been a frequently recurring topic of political discussions since ancient times. But it has been the turbulent history of the United States that has provided the most fertile ground for conspiracy discourse. From the time of the Revolution to the present day, conspiracy discourse—that is, linguistic and symbolic practices and artifacts revolving around themes, claims, or accusations of conspiracy—has pervaded diverse forums and genres of American political discourse. For many critics and commentators, the ubiquity of conspiracy theories in American history and the increasing appeal of<br>

  CHAPTER 3  The Path of Demystification from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1ws7x0t">Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes</a><br>
  Abstract: Girard’s reflections have led us to recognize sacred violence as the foundation of Western culture. Sacred violence, in turn, has its roots in mimetic conflicts: the rivals are brothers who are both brought closer and divided by something they both desire. I have also argued that mimetic rivalry is the engine that drives all intellectual symbolism. Thus, the “figure” that represents that symbolism better than any other is that of enemy brothers, who are brothers precisely because they are enemies (or made alike by their reciprocal violent rivalry) and enemies precisely because they are brothers (or rivals inasmuch as each<br>

  Author(s) Aune James Arnt<br>
  Abstract: It is very difficult for an academic audience at the end of the twentieth century to imagine a time when the college preaching circuit was a way for theologians to influence large numbers of students and make a good income, or a time when listening to preaching was at least an occasional experience even for secular intellectuals. Religion remains an important legitimating device for the Republican Party and for what remains of the civil rights movement among African Americans, but religious symbols and themes—the sin of national pride, the tension between the

  Book Title: Shared Land/Conflicting Identity-Trajectories of Israeli & Palestinian Symbol Use<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frank David A.<br>
  Abstract: Shared Land/Conflicting Identity: Trajectories of Israeli and Palestinian Symbol Useargues that rhetoric, ideology, and myth have played key roles in influencing the development of the 100-year conflict between first the Zionist settlers and the current Israeli people and the Palestinian residents in what is now Israel. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is usually treated as an issue of land and water. While these elements are the core of the conflict, they are heavily influenced by the symbols used by both peoples to describe, understand, and persuade each other. The authors argue that symbolic practices deeply influenced the Oslo Accords, and that the breakthrough in the peace process that led to Oslo could not have occurred without a breakthrough in communication styles.Rowland and Frank develop four crucial ideas on social development: the roles of rhetoric, ideology, and myth; the influence of symbolic factors; specific symbolic factors that played a key role in peace negotiations; and the identification and value of criteria for evaluating symbolic practices in any society.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: Two of the most important developments of the twentieth century have been the return of large numbers of Jews to Israel (and the creation of the state of Israel following that return), along with the rise of a Palestinian people. In this book, we illuminate these events through an analysis of the trajectories of Palestinian and Israeli symbol use over roughly the last century. Our thesis is that symbolic practices—speeches, essays, poetry, and other public communication—have played a crucial role in shaping each society and the conflict between them.<br>

  1  The Symbolic Roots of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: The handshake between Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister of Israel, and Yasir Arafat, chair of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), on the White House lawn on 13 September 1993 symbolized to some the dawning of a new age in the Middle East. With that handshake, suddenly it seemed that the Palestinian and Israeli people, who had hated and fought each other for generations, might be able to achieve peace.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: Most symbol systems are created like a seabed through a process of sedimentation. The new symbol system simply develops over time from the old one. Thus, the symbolic system of American conservatism in the 1990s clearly has evolved from an earlier conservative perspective. In other cases, however, a new symbol system may be created in response to a strong exigency, a perceived crisis. In that circumstance, the failure of the existing system to solve the crisis leads to the development of a new (often revolutionary) system of rhetoric/ideology/myth.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>

  6  The Essential Palestinian from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: In chapter 4, we described the movement of the Palestinian people from a symbol system based to varying degrees on Arab, Islamic, and nationalist impulses toward a Palestinian Arab identity and movement rooted in myth. By 1937, the Palestinians had developed a symbol system that was based on ideological and mythic foundations that collapsed the scene (Palestine) and the agent (the Palestinian Arabs) into a consubstantiation. In this chapter, we examine the trajectory of Palestinian symbol use from the 1940s to 1960s.<br>

  7  From Camp David to Lebanon from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: The slightly more than five-year period from Menachem Begin’s election as prime minister of Israel in 1977 through the war in Lebanon represents one of the most crucial periods in symbolic development in the history of Israel. This period was dominated by conflicting aspects of the Revisionist symbol system. On the one hand, Begin led Israel first to the Camp David Accords and then to a peace treaty with Egypt. In the development of the peace process, Begin’s rhetoric reflected the underlying myth of Holocaust and Redemption, including a strong commitment to maintaining Israeli control over Eretz Israel, but also<br>

  8  From the Occupation to Intifada from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: The 1967 war and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip produced a second al Nekba for the Palestinian people, compounding the tragedy of 1948. From 1967 until the 1993 Oslo Accords, Palestinian Arabs were either outside of historic Palestine in the Diaspora, in Israel proper as second-class citizens, or under occupation. During this period, the trajectory of the Palestinian symbol system, which had hardened into an irredentist mold that demonized Zionism and vested Palestinian Arab nationalism with essentialist qualities, slowly changed. In this chapter, we will survey the changes in Palestinian ideology, myth, and rhetoric as<br>

  9  Symbolic Stagnation and Ideological Calcification in Israel from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: The roughly fifteen-year period from Begin’s resignation as prime minister to the election of Benjamin Netanyahu can best be understood as a period of symbolic stagnation. The symbolic equation that had been established in the late 1970s and early 1980s remained firmly in place. Labor’s perspective, especially as enunciated by Shimon Peres, reduced itself to ungrounded pragmatism, what might be called a “Let’s Make a Deal” approach, in which there was no firm ideological principle to guide action. The absence of a grounded perspective on security created a symbolic weakness that became especially obvious in the aftermath of terrorist incidents.<br>

  11  Palestinian Myth and the Reality of Oslo from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: The Oslo Accords could not have occurred without a transformed Palestinian symbol system. Palestinians involved in the Oslo talks recounted that the terms used in describing the Palestinians and the contested land were in dispute at Oslo. However, the Israelis came to accept the phrase “Palestinian people” and the words “West Bank” and “Gaza” rather than “Judea” and “Samaria” to describe a common reality. In turn, the Palestinians recognized the state of Israel. Indeed, demonstrating the importance of the symbol, the wording of the Oslo Accords and references to people and land were at the center of the negotiations.¹ The<br>

  12  From Symbolic Stasis to the End of Revisionism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: The 1996 Israeli election reflected the stasis that characterized Israeli politics for the fifteen years following the war in Lebanon. Labor and Likud existed in a kind of symbolic balance. The pragmatic Labor approach gave the party the advantage on “peace,” while Likud’s ideology and myth gave it the advantage on “security” and commitment to Eretz Israel. In this period, the stasis was broken only once, by the election of Yitzhak Rabin, whose personal credibility and gruff style reassured many Israelis that they could have both peace and security. After the death of Rabin, Shimon Peres was unable to marshal<br>

  13  Symbol Use and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapters, we have described how the hundred years of conflict between first Zionism and then Israel and the Palestinians has been shaped by the interaction of the symbolic trajectories of Labor and Revisionist Zionism and of the Palestinian people in relation to the events in the world. We now turn to a discussion of their shared symbolic trajectory and an evaluation of their symbolic evolution. At the end of the chapter, we draw implications from the symbolic practices found in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict for Western liberal democratic societies in general and the United States in particular.<br>

  CHAPTER 5  Violence in Mexican Music: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7ztb3t">Nosotros</a><br>
  Abstract: La mancornadorais a theme in Mexican music that depicts a heavy existential experience between men and women. The songs are filled with graphic and painful metaphors. The outcome is often tragic and violent, and often involves the killing of women. The termmancornarrepresents power and control, and the animal horn is its symbol. It is a difficult subject to broach, but its presence in a number of songs and in social life suggests certain commonalities that are worth exploring. It is important to locate these themes within a broader frame, which includes ideas from Norman Denzin, Ernest Becker,<br>

  Author(s) FINNEGAN RUTH<br>
  Abstract: ʺOf very great interest and importance is the possibility of transferring the whole system of speech symbolism into other terms than those that are involved in the typical process … a transfer, direct or indirect, from the typical symbolism of language as spoken and heard…. The ease with which speech symbolism can be transferred from one sense to another, from technique to technique, itself indicates that the mere sounds of speech are not the essential fact of language, which lies rather in the classification, in the formal patterning, and in the relating of conceptsʺ (Sapir 1921: 19–21).<br>

  Author(s) TURNER VICTOR<br>
  Abstract: Victor Turner has been a major and highly influential anthropologist since the late 1950s. His contributions to symbolic anthropology and to a unified theory of performance include concepts of liminality andcommunitas,social drama, reflexivity, and symbolic process, applicable to a wide range of human cultures but developed from particular situations such as that of the Ndembu of eastern Africa. In the present article, he reviews the proceedings of ʺthe first international symposium on ethnopoeticsʺ as gathered by Michel Benamou and Jerome Rothenberg in a special issue ofAlcheringa(Benamou 1976).

  Book Title: Alef, Mem, Tau-Kabbalistic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfson Elliot R.<br>
  Abstract: This highly original, provocative, and poetic work explores the nexus of time, truth, and death in the symbolic world of medieval kabbalah. Demonstrating that the historical and theoretical relationship between kabbalah and western philosophy is far more intimate and extensive than any previous scholar has ever suggested, Elliot R. Wolfson draws an extraordinary range of thinkers such as Frederic Jameson, Martin Heidegger, Franz Rosenzweig, William Blake, Julia Kristeva, Friedrich Schelling, and a host of kabbalistic figures into deep conversation with one another.
      Alef, Mem, Taualso discusses Islamic mysticism and Buddhist thought in relation to the Jewish esoteric tradition as it opens the possibility of a temporal triumph of temporality and the conquering of time through time. The framework for Wolfson's examination is the rabbinic teaching that the wordemet,"truth," comprises the first, middle, and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet,alef, mem,andtau,which serve, in turn, as semiotic signposts for the three tenses of time-past, present, and future. By heeding the letters ofemetwe discern the truth of time manifestly concealed in the time of truth, the beginning that cannot begin if it is to be the beginning, the middle that re/marks the place of origin and destiny, and the end that is the figuration of the impossible disclosing the impossibility of figuration, the finitude of death that facilitates the possibility of rebirth. The time of death does not mark the death of time, but time immortal, the moment of truth that bestows on the truth of the moment an endless beginning of a beginningless end, the truth of death encountered incessantly in retracing steps of time yet to be taken-between, before, beyond.<br>

  CONCLUSION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn5mn">Alef, Mem, Tau</a><br>
  Abstract: The precise turn of thought charted in this book opens the possibility of a temporal triumph of temporality, the conquering of time through time.¹ In an effort to pave the way to this possibility, I have explored the nexus of time, truth, and death as it emerges hermeneutically from the symbolic world of medieval kabbalah. I have not adhered to the familiar methodology adopted by scholars of Jewish mysticism, focusing on a particular historical period or individual personality; I have organized my thoughts instead around the letters

  Author(s) ARMOUR PETER<br>
  Abstract: To the modern reader this canto might seem at first to be of a somewhat remote and antiquarian interest with, at best, a certain formal and old-fashioned poetic beauty. Coming immediately after the richly textured account of humankind’s lost paradise on earth and of the beautiful lady who explains it to Dante, Canto XXIX introduces a series of symbols from which the reader is required to deduce a corresponding series of “other meanings.” It would appear, therefore, to belong to that outmoded form, the allegory, and indeed virtually all commentators agree that it is an allegorical presentation of the history<br>

  Abstract: Canto XXX is commonly regarded as the structural and emotional center of the

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn9nx">Postcolonial Disorders</a><br>
  Author(s) Hyde Sandra Teresa<br>
  Abstract: When this policeman downplays AIDS, he is not ignoring the emergence of the epidemic; rather, he reflects a recurrent discourse around HIV/AIDS that emphasizes policing and surveillance of China’s border regions.¹ Borders here provide a liminal space where many transactions occur and where the spread of HIV in Sipsongpanna, an autonomous minority prefecture bordering Laos and Burma, symbolizes what Arjun Appadurai (1996) characterizes as late-twentieth-century cross-border migrations. These mass migrations of peoples, goods, services, and now viruses color a moving transnational canvas.

  Abstract: The question of whether people can decide to believe not only affects our understanding of Evangelicalism and empowerment in Latin America; it runs through the center of contemporary sociological research on culture and religion. In the past twenty-five years approaches that portray people as strategic actors who consciously choose their meanings have reinvigorated the sociology of culture and religion after the decline of the modernization and secularization theories of the 1950s and 1960s. However, these approaches are increasingly being criticized as reductionist, incoherent, or incomplete by scholars who recommend a return to emphases on religion and culture as autonomous symbolic<br>

  Book Title: After the Massacre-Commemoration and Consolation in Ha My and My Lai<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Faust Drew<br>
  Abstract: Though a generation has passed since the massacre of civilians at My Lai, the legacy of this tragedy continues to reverberate throughout Vietnam and the rest of the world. This engrossing study considers how Vietnamese villagers in My Lai and Ha My-a village where South Korean troops committed an equally appalling, though less well-known, massacre of unarmed civilians-assimilate the catastrophe of these mass deaths into their everyday ritual life. Based on a detailed study of local history and moral practices,
      After the Massacrefocuses on the particular context of domestic life in which the Vietnamese villagers interact with their ancestors on one hand and the ghosts of tragic death on the other. Heonik Kwon explains what intimate ritual actions can tell us about the history of mass violence and the global bipolar politics that caused it. He highlights the aesthetics of Vietnamese commemorative rituals and the morality of their practical actions to liberate the spirits from their grievous history of death. The author brings these important practices into a critical dialogue with dominant sociological theories of death and symbolic transformation.<br>

  Abstract: Heroes, ancestors, and ghosts coexist in the village environment. While revolutionary politics and traditional religious heritage separate them, the three social classes in afterlife associate in popular ritual practices. Although they constitute a hierarchy, the hierarchy that structures their relative values varies at different sites of memory. Their status changes between the state war memorial and the community temple, and the war heroes who occupy the symbolic center in the former are relegated to the margins, outside the village ancestors, in the latter. The position of ghosts also shifts in this movement of memories. The memory of tragic death is<br>

  Book Title: Tales of the Neighborhood-Jewish Narrative Dialogues in Late Antiquity<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Hasan-Rokem Galit<br>
  Abstract: In this lively and intellectually engaging book, Galit Hasan-Rokem shows that religion is shaped not only in the halls of theological disputation and institutions of divine study, but also in ordinary events of everyday life. Common aspects of human relations offer a major source for the symbols of religious texts and rituals of late antique Judaism as well as its partner in narrative dialogues, early Christianity, Hasan-Rokem argues. Focusing on the "neighborhood" of the Galilee that is the birthplace of many major religious and cultural developments, this book brings to life the riddles, parables, and folktales passed down in Rabbinic stories from the first half of the first millennium of the Common Era.<br>

  4  Toward a Phenomenology of Evil from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt7zw0w8">Women and Evil</a><br>
  Abstract: so far we have seen that evil became associated early with disobeying father and his representatives. The roots of that association stretch back into antiquity when early human beings felt contaminated by preexisting evil. Ricoeur began his study of the symbolism of evil with an analysis of defilement. Already two things have happened that must now set aside. First, evil is firmly associated with sin, guilt, impurity, and fault; there has been a move beyond pure terror to ethical terror. Second, thought already focuses on the symbol rather than the experience. “By beginning with a symbolism already there,” Ricoeur observes,<br>

  Abstract: The time is the late Middle Ages. The texts that follow illustrate the kinds of historical constraint that impose themselves on the characterization and valuation of our two rhetorical figures.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130jd70">Poetry Of Discovery</a><br>
  Abstract: The work of Francisco Brines exemplifies some of the main features of Spanish poetry in the 1960s. Meditative and philosophical, often centered on the themes of time and death and on the reactions that these evoke, Brines’s poetry is also marked by the very careful and artistic use of seemingly ordinary language.

  2  Explicating the Christian Symbols from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wwwrr">God--The World's Future</a><br>
  Abstract: Christian theology—especially systematic theology—is the explication of, and reflection on, the basic symbols found in scripture, appropriating them to the current context within which the theologian is working. Theology is the church thinking about what it believes. In itself, theology is not the content of what the church believes. Rather it is reflection on the content of that belief. One puts faith in God, and this faith comes to expression in the way life is lived and in what is believed. The content of belief is found in the symbols that accompany faith. Theology is a form of<br>

  Abstract: To think of the world as a creation implies belief in a creator who is the “maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.” This raises the question: How does God make heaven and earth and everything else? Although no easy answer can be given, explicating the symbols relating to the gospel provides a response. Just as the experience of the gospel with the Son of God led to the understanding of God as Father, so also the experience of new creation in the gospel will have an impact on our understanding of newness regarding the<br>

  Abstract: Soteriology is a continuation of the discussion begun in Christology. It presupposes what I have already said about becoming human, unbecoming evil, and the person of Christ. It then proceeds to focus discussion on the atoning work of Christ, the concept of justification, and the outcome of human destiny in the kingdom of God. Generally, soteriology concerns itself more with the means of accomplishing salvation than with the nature or content of salvation itself. The content of salvation will be addressed here, of course, but it will extend to the

  Abstract: In the previous chapter on soteriology, we noted how the doctrine of justification is the result of theological reflection on the significance of the symbol of Christ as the lamb of God. The innocence of the scapegoated lamb of God is transferred to us. Our own deeds of justice, our own good works, our own holiness, do not make us just in the sight of God. Our justice is rather an alien justice, one that comes to us from without but one that becomes our own through an act of God’s grace. Our justification is a gift.<br>

  Abstract: Theology is an ongoing task with which Christians are never finished because something new is always placed on its agenda. Although it is the thinking discipline whereby faith seeks to understand itself, it is also a part of the church’s ministry. Its peculiar ministry is to provide intellectual leadership. The present work in systematic theology has sought to explicate the significance of the gospel so that what Christians say is intelligible within the context of modern and emerging postmodern consciousness. Thus, a methodological foundation was laid, scriptural symbols explicated, doctrinal content clarified, and hypothetical reconstruction begun. In turning now to<br>

  Book Title: Language, Eros, Being: Kabbalistic Hermeneutics and Poetic Imagination-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WOLFSON ELLIOT R.<br>
  Abstract: This long-awaited, magisterial study-an unparalleled blend of philosophy, poetry, and philology-draws on theories of sexuality, phenomenology, comparative religion, philological writings on Kabbalah, Russian formalism, Wittgenstein, Rosenzweig, William Blake, and the very physics of the time-space continuum to establish what will surely be a highwater mark in work on Kabbalah. Not only a study of texts, Language, Eros, Being is perhaps the fullest confrontation of the body in Jewish studies, if not in religious studies as a whole.Elliot R. Wolfson explores the complex gender symbolism that permeates Kabbalistic literature. Focusing on the nexus of asceticism and eroticism, he seeks to define the role of symbolic and poetically charged language in the erotically configured visionary imagination of the medieval Kabbalists. He demonstrates that the traditional Kabbalistic view of gender was a monolithic and androcentric one, in which the feminine was conceived as being derived from the masculine. He does not shrink from the negative implications of this doctrine, but seeks to make an honest acknowledgment of it as the first step toward the redemption of an ancient wisdom.Comparisons with other mystical traditions-including those in Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam-are a remarkable feature throughout the book. They will make it important well beyond Jewish studies, indeed, a must for historians of comparative religion, in particular of comparative mysticism.Praise for Elliot R.

  Abstract: As I intimated in the preceding chapter, the project of reshaping the feminine in contemporary liturgical discourse—and thereby destabilizing the male-centered symbolic that has dominated Judaism—can proceed without relying on philological and historical research, but the re/envisioning is proportionately impoverished to the degree that it neglects or obfuscates the tradition it purports to reflect.

Any attempt to separate the sexual and mystical threads in the tapestry of Jewish esotericism will prove to be futile.¹ From the kabbalists’ vantage point, ecstatic experience—
                     ek-stasis, standing out, which conveys metaphorically leaping to the ground in taking flight, turning inward by projecting outward²—facilitates knowing the secrecy of secrecy, the doubling of secret as secret, the eros of mystery wrapped in the exposé of the mystery of eros.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I suggest that conventional ethics, which is oriented toward the good, is challenged by psychoanalytic theory. Lacan’s work allows us to distinguish between desire for the Other, which is limited to symbolic language, and desire for the Thing, which lies beyond the symbolic in the Real. Primarily by reading Lacan’s discussion of the Thing in
                  The Ethics of Psychoanalysis, I relate the idea of the Thing to the idea of God, which later becomes the focus of chapter 8, where I contrast Lacan with Jean-Luc Marion’s understanding of God as Good rather than as Being. The desire<br>

From his conception of the mirror stage expressed in his addresses to the International Congress of Psychoanalysis to his early seminars in the 1950s, Lacan’s early work focuses on the differentiation of the imaginary and the symbolic.

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, each of her chapters focuses on a different but related issue and cultural sector. Foci include the basic conditions of linguistic meaning in the early modern period, instantiated by Shakespeare's plays and related to modern theories of metaphor; the role of metaphor in the words of eucharistic institution under Archbishop Cranmer; the play of metaphor and metonymy in the writings of Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin and in John Donne's Devotions; the manipulation of these two tropes in the politics of the controversy over ecclesiastical vestments and in its treatment by John Foxe; the abuse of figuration in the house of Edmund Spenser's Busirane, where catachresis, an extreme form of metaphor, is the trope du jour; the conception of metaphor in the Roman rhetorics and their legacy in the sixteenth century; and the concept of exchange in the economic writing of Gerrard de Malynes, merchant and metaphorist in the reigns of Elizabeth and James. What emerges at the end of this book is a heightened critical sense of the dynamic of metaphor in cultural history.<br>

  Book Title: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER THOMAS M.<br>
  Abstract: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence explores themes in classical American philosophy, primarily that of John Dewey, but also in the thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson, George Santayana, and Native American traditions. The primary claim is that human beings exist with a need for the experience of meaning and value, a "Human Eros." Our various cultures are symbolic environments or "spiritual ecologies" within which the Human Eros can thrive. This is how we inhabit the earth. Encircling and sustaining our cultural existence is nature. Western philosophy has not generally provided adequate conceptual models for thinking ecologically. Thus the idea of "eco-ontology" undertakes to explore ways in which this might be done beginning with the primacy of Nature over Being, but also including the recognition of possibility and potentiality as inherent aspects of existence. I argue for the centrality of Dewey for an effective ecological philosophy. Both "pragmatism" and "naturalism" need to be contextualized within an emergentist, relational, non-reductive view of nature and an aesthetic, imaginative, non-reductive view of intelligence.<br>

  Book Title: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan-Modernity, Loss, and the Doing of History<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Karlin Jason G.<br>
  Abstract: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan is a historical analysis of the discourses of nostalgia in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japan. Through an analysis of the experience of rapid social change in Japan’s modernization, it argues that fads (ryūkō) and the desires they express are central to understanding Japanese modernity, conceptions of gender, and discourses of nationalism. In doing so, the author uncovers the myth of eternal return that lurks below the surface of Japanese history as an expression of the desire to find meaning amid the chaos and alienation of modern times. The Meiji period (1868–1912) was one of rapid change that hastened the process of forgetting: The state’s aggressive program of modernization required the repression of history and memory. However, repression merely produced new forms of desire seeking a return to the past, with the result that competing or alternative conceptions of the nation haunted the history of modern Japan. Rooted in the belief that the nation was a natural and organic entity that predated the rational, modern state, such conceptions often were responses to modernity that envisioned the nation in opposition to the modern state. What these visions of the nation shared was the ironic desire to overcome the modern condition by seeking the timeless past. While the condition of their repression was often linked to the modernizing policies of the Meiji state, the means for imagining the nation in opposition to the state required the construction of new symbols that claimed the authority of history and appealed to a rearticulated tradition. Through the idiom of gender and nation, new reified representations of continuity, timelessness, and history were fashioned to compensate for the unmooring of inherited practices from the shared locales of everyday life. This book examines the intellectual, social, and cultural factors that contributed to the rapid spread of Western tastes and styles, along with the backlash against Westernization that was expressed as a longing for the past. By focusing on the expressions of these desires in popular culture and media texts, it reveals how the conflation of mother, countryside, everyday life, and history structured representations to naturalize ideologies of gender and nationalism.<br>

  9  On the Origin and Significance of Paleolithic Cave Art from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14bt5v1">The Roots Of Thinking</a><br>
  Abstract: Like the practice of stone tool-making that long preceded it, paleolithic cave drawing originated in a particular kind of tactile–kinesthetic activity, and one similarly giving rise to the creation of spatial forms. With cave drawing, however, the spatial forms entailed concepts tied to pictorial rather than sculptural space. In traditional discussions of cave art where functional or semantic interpretations dominate, little if any attention is given to these concepts. Instead, theories are advanced—and disputed—concerning the representation of animals and the practice of hunting-magic; figural representations in general are analyzed in the context of fertility rites, sexual symbolism,<br>

  Author(s) O’Toole Fintan<br>
  Abstract: Marion Square is the main public space of the city of Charleston, South Carolina. Within it, a tall, four-sided iron screen contains a sixteen-foot-long bronzed sculpture of an abandoned tallith, a Jewish prayer shawl. Jews also use the tallith as a burial shroud, with one of its four fringes removed as a symbol of death and mourning. The sculpture, erected in 1999, is a subtle and moving memorial to the Holocaust and to survivors of the concentration camps who came to live in the city.<br>

  Abstract: In the second century ce, Tertullian asked the question, “What indeed has Athens to do with Jerusalem?”¹ It is a question that has continued to echo through the learned books and journals, the lecture halls and classrooms of theological institutions in the ensuing centuries. What is the relationship, if any, between philosophical reason, captured by the symbol of Athens, the home of Greek philosophy, and Christian faith, captured in the symbol of Jerusalem? Whatever one might think of the question and its theoretical answers, historically there has been a strong tendency for philosophical questions and issues to arise within the<br>

  Book Title: Puzzling the Parables of Jesus-Methods and Interpretations<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Ruben<br>
  Abstract: Modern scholarship on the parables has long been preoccupied with asking what Jesus himself said and what he intended to accomplish with his parables. Ruben Zimmermann moves beyond that agenda to explore the dynamics of parabolic speech in all its rich complexity. Introductory chapters address the history of research and distinguish historical from literary and reader-oriented approaches, then set out a postmodern hermeneutic that analyzes narrative elements and context, maps the sociohistorical background, explores stock metaphors and symbols, and opens up contemporary horizons of interpretation. Subsequent chapters then focus on one parable from early Christian sources (Q, Mark, Matthew, Luke, John, and the Gospel of Thomas) to explore how parables function in each literary context. Over all reigns the principle that the meaning or theological “message" of a parable cannot be extracted from the parabolic form; thus the parables continue to invite hearers' and readers' involvement to the present day.<br>

  Abstract: Geoffrey Hill’s poems have often presented us with a series of scenes, livid tableaux, ‘spectacles’: the Jews in Europe, the Battle of Towton, the endurances of some poets, Boethius in his cell, the nailer’s darg, real and fancied martyrdoms like those of his Sebastians.

  Abstract: In

  Abstract: According to Marcus Borg, Jesus’s entry into Jerusalem was a counterdemonstration, as Pilate’s troops were also entering the city from the opposite direction to reinforce the garrison on the Temple Mount during Passover. Jesus’s entry, modeled on Zech 9:9–10, symbolized the peaceful kingdom of God. Peaceful, yes, but with active resistance through public criticism and symbolic acts. For, to our surprise, Jesus has recourse to violence in the temple! His pacifism must thus be qualified: it is “bifocal.” Toward the Roman occupation, its aspect is of nonresistance, but toward the temple personnel and the perversion of their mission, it<br>

  Abstract: Given the dominance of the realist tradition in Egyptian literature, it is no surprise that Cairo, whether it is the historic city or the modern metropolis, should be the main metaphor for much of the literary production during the twentieth century. Urban space, for the writers of the city, has been a major architect of its social, economic, and political fabric. At one level, the city of Cairo emerges as an actor with real agency that embodies and structures social power, as well as political, economic, and symbolic processes.

  Author(s) GHILES-MEILHAC SAMUEL<br>
  Abstract: Anti-Semitic persecutions targeting French and foreign Jews in France from 1940 to 1944 had deep consequences when it came to Jewish political organization. This chapter focuses on one of the most striking of these consequences: the creation in the winter of 1943–44 of the Conseil représentatif des israélites de France (Representative Council of French Israelites, CRIF). This organization symbolized unification of the different cultural and political Jewish groups that were active illegally under German occupation. The chapter therefore presents the events leading to this revolution and focuses on the political life of this new organization in postwar France.<br>

  Author(s) DORON DANIELLA<br>
  Abstract: In the wake of World War II, politicians and parents alike proclaimed that they had just endured “a war against children.” In the war’s aftermath, the consequences of Nazi violence, Allied air bombings, and family separations were most commonly presented in terms of the suffering endured by Europe’s youngest citizens.¹ While this concern for children was genuine and eminently reasonable, it also served a political agenda.

Everyday life behind bars has numerous ways of communicating that most basic of the prison’s messages to its prisoners: you are not to be trusted. All forms of interaction in the institution will be structured by prison officers’ professional focus on the worst case, and their multiple efforts to keep it from becoming reality. The result is that day in and day out prisoners are reminded of the fact that being a prisoner is being a member of a group of immoral people<br>

The relationship perhaps has more the character of a stormy courtship ending in separation rather than a well-established marriage.

They were attracted first of all by its irresistibly fascinating title: “Crime and Punishment.” The reference to Dostoyevsky’s masterpiece is explicit. In the minds of the show’s curators, crime is synonymous with murder: its paintings, photographs, illustrations, and other forms of documentation all display, in various modes, the crime of murder—that is, the individual offense.

  Abstract: I do not begin from the premise that religion, as a set of beliefs, thoughts, or symbols, is an independently individuated entity of its own. By this I mean that religion is individuated as a phenomenon through human behavior and thought. This is intended to imply that the study of religions must think about religions as arising through, or possibly existing in, human behaviors. In this sense, religion does not exist independently of a human subject with causal or agentive powers in the world.

By offering a distinctive and in many ways innovative reading of this teaching of the Apostles’ Creed, Balthasar sought to challenge an age of overly reductive scientistic rationality, underscoring in Catholic theology the permanently valid interplay of literary symbolism, metaphysics, dramatic beauty, and Trinitarian mystery.

  Abstract: Over the past two decades, specialists on the Gospel of John have customarily focused on the translation, composition-history, and exegesis of this masterpiece.

Women and men appear as agents or victims of evil acts or forces, whether as intentionally negligent mothers (Parkin 1985c) or witches (van Beek 1994), but there has been little systematic effort to analyze what evil acts, beings or forces may tell us about gender relations, or, conversely, how a gender analysis may complicate our understandings of evil.

How this is defined or set out is usually bound up with the conceptualization of community itself. For example, if community is defined in terms of boundaries – social, symbolic, political – then we would be likely to view the question in terms of who is or is not included in a particular, identifiable or claimed grouping. In this volume, however, I have suggested that it is conceptually more productive to view community in terms of mobilization and attendant issues of coordination<br>

  Book Title: Cities of Affluence and Anger-A Literary Geography of Modern Englishness<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): KALLINEY PETER J.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a compact literary history of the twentieth century in England, Cities of Affluence and Anger studies the problematic terms of national identity during England's transition from an imperial power to its integration in the global cultural marketplace. While the countryside had been the dominant symbol of Englishness throughout the previous century, modern literature began to turn more and more to the city to redraw the boundaries of a contemporary cultural polity. The urban class system, paradoxically, still functioned as a marker of wealth, status, and hierarchy throughout this long period of self-examination, but it also became a way to project a common culture and mitigate other forms of difference. Local class politics were transformed in such a way that enabled the English to reframe a highly provisional national unity in the context of imperial disintegration, postcolonial immigration, and, later, globalization.Kalliney plots the decline of the country-house novel through an analysis of Forster's Howards End and Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, each ruthless in its sabotage of the trope of bucolic harmony. The traditionally pastoral focus of English fiction gives way to a high-modernist urban narrative, exemplified by Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, and, later, to realists such as Osborne and Sillitoe, through whose work Kalliney explores postwar urban expansion and the cultural politics of the welfare state. Offering fresh new readings of Lessing's The Golden Notebook and Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, the author considers the postwar appropriation of domesticity, the emergence of postcolonial literature, and the renovation of travel narratives in the context of globalization. Kalliney suggests that it is largely one city--London--through which national identity has been reframed. How and why this transition came about is a process that Cities of Affluence and Anger depicts with exceptional insight and originality.<br>

  1  ANTHROPOLOGY AND COMMUNITY: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt18mvnx3">The Trouble with Community</a><br>
  Abstract: Like their counterparts in sister disciplines, many anthropologists have noted the ‘slipperiness’ of the notion of community, arguing that it is too vague, too variable in its applications and definitions to be of much utility as an analytical tool (Bauman, 1996: 14; Cohen, 2002: 165).

  Author(s) McCoy Beth A.<br>
  Abstract: Serving already as archive to the archive of the Atlantic slave trade, the city of New Orleans took on further archival depth when the levees failed after Hurricane Katrina. Throughout the flooded city appeared painted symbols: the cruciform US&R (urban search and rescue) signs devised by FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Administration enfolded after 9/11 into the Department of Homeland Security. Used by FEMA task forces, the Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and other private and public entities involved in search and rescue, the US&R signs were to function both as symptom of and vector for<br>

  Abstract: In
                  The Field of Cultural Production, Pierre Bourdieu argued that, in the symbolic network of modernity, “losers win”.¹ A novelist like Flaubert, who did not enjoy much commercial success, is far more esteemed than a more commercially successful writer, not just in spite of Flaubert making less money butbecausehe made less money. The ratio between financial and imaginative success was inverse. One can see this in the counterculture as late as the 1960s, when the American bohemian writer Seymour Krim could say, “if you are a proud, searching ‘failure’ in this society, and we can take ironic comfort<br>

  PRAGMATIC OR PRAGMATIST / PRAGMATICIST PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19rm9gf">The Varieties of Transcendence: Pragmatism and the Theory of Religion</a><br>
  Author(s) Deuser Hermann<br>
  Abstract: As a theory of action, classical pragmatism—founded by the scientifically trained philosophers Charles S. Peirce and William James in New England—is also always a philosophy of religion. Human experience is not (as in the German tradition) divided according to practical experience, on the one hand, and scientific empiricism, on the other. Instead, it is precisely the interplay of belief in relation to action that explains our everyday behavior as much as the scientific method and religious experience. While different conceptions of god have inevitably resulted from the latter over time, the images, narratives, and symbols are nonetheless comparable.<br>

  Abstract: Despite the seemingly uncanny pithiness of Al Jolson’s famous lines, “Wait a minute! Wait a minute! You ain’t heard nothin’ yet”, in 1927, speech was not new to the cinema. In fact, speech had played a substantial role in silent films for nearly two decades. Dialogue intertitles and character-written inserts allowed cinematic representations to extend beyond the pictorial exterior and into the linguistic consciousness of characters. Silent film dialogue, however, brought more than a symbolic image of individual consciousness to the cinema.

  Abstract: Cities, and capital cities in particular, are clearly the central focus for national memory. At the centre of such memory is the manner in which the city space is captured in the shorthand of symbol or mental representation. For example, the city of Paris is most easily represented by certain of the monuments that define its central space, or possibly by less monumental buildings that nonetheless capture the flavour and atmosphere of a particular quarter or

  Author(s) Kapferer Bruce<br>
  Abstract: The cosmologies implicated in sorcery practice are human-centric. Within them, human beings are at the heart of processes that are integral in the formation of their psychical, social and political universes. Sorcery fetishises human agency, often one which it magically enhances, as the key mediating factor affecting the course or direction of human life-chances. The fabulous character of so much sorcery practice, its transgressive and unbounded dimensions, a rich symbolism that appears to press towards and beyond the limits of the human imagination, is surely connected to the overpowering and totalising impetus that sorcery recognises in human agency and capacities.<br>

  Author(s) ROSS THOMAS<br>
  Abstract: To understand the power of the theme of white innocence, one must begin with the cultural conception of innocence. To be innocent is important everywhere in our culture. The argument for the white person’s innocence in matters of race connects with the cultural ideas of innocence and defilement. The very contrast between the colors, white and black, is often a symbol for the contrast between innocence and defilement. Thus, the theme of white innocence in the legal rhetoric of race draws its power from more than the obvious advantage of pushing away responsibility. It takes power from the cultural, religious,<br>

  Book Title: Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western Esotericism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kripal Jeffrey J.<br>
  Abstract: From rumors about gnostic orgies in antiquity to the explicit erotic symbolism of alchemical texts, from the subtly coded eroticism of medieval kabbalah to the sexual magic practiced by contemporary occultists and countercultural translations of Asian Tantra, the history of Western esotericism is rich in references to the domains of eros and sexuality. This volume, which brings together an impressive array of top-level specialists, is the first to analyze the eroticism of the esoteric without sensationalism or cheap generalizations, but on the basis of expert scholarship and attention to textual and historical detail. While there are few domains where the imagination may so easily run wild, the various contributions seek to distinguish fact from fiction-only to find that historical realities are sometimes even stranger than the fantasies. In doing so, they reveal the outlines of a largely unknown history spanning more than twenty centuries.<br>

  Book Title: The Idea of Wilderness-From Prehistory to the Age of Ecology<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): OELSCHLAEGER MAX<br>
  Abstract: Oelschlaeger begins by examining the culture of prehistoric hunter-gatherers, whose totems symbolized the idea of organic unity between humankind and wild nature, and idea that the author believes is essential to any attempt to define human potential. He next traces how the transformation of these hunter-gatherers into farmers led to a new awareness of distinctions between humankind and nature, and how Hellenism and Judeo-Christianity later introduced the unprecedented concept that nature was valueless until humanized. Oelschlaeger discusses the concept of wilderness in relation to the rise of classical science and modernism, and shows that opposition to "modernism" arose almost immediately from scientific, literary, and philosophical communities. He provides new and, in some cases, revisionist studies of the seminal American figures Thoreau, Muir, and Leopold, and he gives fresh readings of America's two prodigious wilderness poets Robinson Jeffers and Gary Snyder. He concludes with a searching look at the relationship of evolutionary thought to our postmodern effort to reconceptualize ourselves as civilized beings who remain, in some ways, natural animals.<br>

It presupposes that as moderns we aim at a second naiveté in and through critical reflection. It also presupposes that the concepts of immediacy and of the sacred (“the immediacy of the symbol”) are identical and that it is the aim of restorative criticism to disclose that identity.

The idea emerges from the restorative justice movement and the repair required in the aftermath of genocide in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Bosnia, Cambodia, Liberia, and Uganda.

In ongoing parish work, pastors typically need to refer to the theological template.

  Abstract: The theology of Louis-Marie Chauvet is a sustained example of how Heidegger can be made productive in the theology of sacramental presence, and also theology in general. Chauvet moves his theological statements completely outside of the realm of metaphysics understood as a privileged discursive conceptualism; such statements may only be made via a phenomenology and hermeneutics of the ritual dynamic proper to Christian liturgy. In this symbolic mode, as we will see, theological statements, no longer mediated by traditional metaphysics, will be weighted more towards history than ontology, and therefore more towards absence than presence.

  Abstract: The occlusion of the mother’s smile is the death of sacramental presence. The mother’s smile is the kiss of Being, the sign or symbol of all that is gratuitous, all that is gift, and therefore all that is non-calculative, nonmechanical, and non-violent. Its erasure therefore erodes the sacramental foundation of grace. A sacramental “sign,” it is also a phenomenological and metaphysical sign, a “real,” existent form from which breaks forth the splendor of the depths of Being. It signifies the permanence of the truth, goodness, and beauty of the created order. As form, it also refers to infinity, for “it<br>

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of the Divine Suffering, Volume 2. Evil and Divine Suffering<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the second volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, vol. 2, Evil and Divine Suffering. The larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, then to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. This second volume of studies proceeds on the basis of the presuppositions of this symbol, those implicit attestations that provide the conditions of possibility for divine suffering-that which constitutes divine vulnerability with respect to creation-as identified and examined in the first volume of this project: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life-the imago Dei as love. The second volume then investigates the first two divine wounds or modes of divine suffering to which the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally attest: (1) divine grief, suffering because of betrayal by the beloved human or human sin; and (2) divine self-sacrifice, suffering for the beloved human in its bondage to sin or misery, to establish the possibility of redemption and reconciliation. Each divine wound, thus, constitutes a response to a creaturely occasion. The suffering in each divine wound also occurs in two stages: a passive stage and an active stage. In divine grief, God suffers because of human sin, betrayal of the divine lover by the beloved human: divine sorrow as the passive stage of divine grief; and divine anguish as the active stage of divine grief. In divine self-sacrifice, God suffers in response to the misery or bondage of the beloved human's infidelity: divine travail (focused on the divine incarnation in Jesus of Nazareth) as the active stage of divine self-sacrifice; and divine agony (focused on divine suffering in the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth) as the passive stage of divine self-sacrifice.<br>

  Abstract: This moment in the symbol, like all three of this symbol’s principal moments, develops through the interaction of the two presuppositions that I have already analyzed in volume one of this project.² I repeat the most general features of those two presuppositions.

  Introduction to Division One: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf8fn">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: God’s creation of humans in the divine image established the conditions of possibility for the occasion of the first divine wound. I have shown previously that the Christian symbol of divine suffering construes human being or life in the image of God as love. Furthermore, as being-inact (
                  ens actu), theimago Deiactualizes itself asimitatio Dei. The human never loses or annihilates theimago Dei, but certainly can distort and pervert itself as such.¹ Thus, humans always actualize their being or life as love in an imitation of God either authentically or inauthentically. As Augustine said to God in<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf8fn">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: Human life as
                  cupiditas, human sin as the occasion for the first divine wound or divine grief, exhibits several formal characteristics. By no means do I pretend, with my identification of these formal characteristics, exhaustively to analyze this occasion for divine suffering. I only examine here the broad contours of the factors that structure the beloved human’s infidelity, those structural characteristics of human sin that figure most prominently as features of the occasion for the first divine wound. Most generally, according to the Christian symbol of divine suffering, the creaturely occasion for the first divine wound exhibits six formal characteristics:<br>

  Abstract: Human sin, the false or inauthentic actualization of human life as love, human life as
                  cupiditas, or the beloved human’s betrayal or rejection of the divine lover, occasions the first divine wound, according to the Christian symbol of divine suffering. Of course, although prominent theologies from the European reformations of the sixteenth century tended to found themselves on theologies of the cross, even those theologies refused to attribute any actual form of suffering to the divine nature: this refusal, of course, extended to divine grief as well.¹ Nonetheless, by radical and intentional contrast, Christian testimonies to divine suffering consistently, and<br>

  3  Divine Sorrow: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf8fn">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter identifies and examines the formal characteristics that structure divine sorrow.¹ Several questions immediately arise concerning the interaction among the characteristics of this symbol’s two presuppositions² with reference to the characteristics of human sin in division one of the present volume of studies. (1) What is the relationship between divine vulnerability and this passive stage of divine grief? (2) To which operation or role of the Christian God does the symbol of divine sorrow refer?

  4  Divine Sorrow: from:

  Abstract: Throughout my previous analysis of the formal characteristics of divine sorrow, various aspects of divine
                  caritashave repeatedly surfaced. In this chapter, then, I will draw together the major strands of those dimensions in divinecaritasthat have emerged in divine sorrow. The three dimensions (philial, agapic, and erotic) of divine love, as expressed in the passive stage of divine grief, constitute the material characteristics of divine sorrow. While all three dimensions of divinecaritasoperate in divine sorrow, the erotic dimension predominates in this mode of divine suffering. Moreover, for this symbol, God actualizes each material characteristic of divine<br>

  Introduction to Division Three: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf8fn">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: According to the Christian symbol of divine suffering, God grieves
                  not only passively, not only with sorrow over radical human distortion of the relationship between divine creator and creatures, not only about both creaturely self-willed refusal of authentic alterity and God’s un-desired loss of genuine divine enrichment. Due to this selfwilled human abandonment of both God and the human’s own genuine actualization, God also grievesactively, a stage of divine grief to which numerous Christian attestations to divine suffering witness.¹ Following numerous testimonies to divine suffering, I have designated the active of divine grief as divine anguish, the anguish of<br>

  Abstract: I will inquire into the formal characteristics of the second stage in divine grief through questions that resemble those questions with which I have already examined the first, more passive, stage of this symbol. Again, these questions will also reappear in the following studies of this symbol. (1) What is the relationship between divine vulnerability and the active stage of divine grief? (2) To which divine role or operation does the symbol of divine anguish primarily refer? (3) Toward which subjects does divine anguish direct itself or which subjects concern God in divine anguish?

  Introduction to Division Four: from:

  Abstract: In Christian attestations to
                  divine self-sacrifice, the predicament of the beloved human occasions this second mode of divine suffering as well. Strictly considered, however, both the beloved human’s infidelity (human sin) and the misery of the beloved human’s infidelity (the consequences of human sin) comprise the occasion for divine selfsacrifice. Neither sin nor its consequences ever appear isolated from one another, cannot even occur apart from one another. For this reason, previously, I examined as one formal characteristic of human sin the indissoluble bond between sin and its consequences. Nevertheless, the Christian symbol of divine suffering distinguishes these two aspects<br>

  Introduction to Division Five: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf8fn">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: The misery of the beloved human’s infidelity occasions the second divine wound, according to the Christian symbol of divine suffering. Christian testimonies to this moment in divine suffering overwhelmingly describe this wound of God as divine self-sacrifice for the sake of human reconciliation with God or for the healing of relationships between the divine creator and self-estranged creatures.<br>

  Abstract: In my study of the first stage of divine self-sacrifice, or divine travail, I commence with an analysis of the formal characteristics in this moment of divine suffering as I have done previously. Those questions with which I formerly isolated and examined the principal formal characteristics of the first divine wound function similarly here with respect to divine travail. (1) What is the relationship between divine vulnerability and activity in the first stage of divine self-sacrifice? (2) To which divine role or operation does the symbol of divine travail refer?

  Introduction to Division Six: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf8fn">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: According to the Christian symbol of divine suffering, the misery of human infidelity occasions a second or passive stage in divine self-sacrifice as well, a mode of divine suffering that I have called the agony of God.¹ Although God’s self-relinquishment in order to make possible reconciliation with the unfaithful human also established the conditions of possibility for this second stage in divine self-sacrifice, God neither intended nor planned the divine agony. Divine travail, of course, increased divine risk or vulnerability with respect to unfaithful humans in all of their misery. Thus, while God voluntarily endured the agony of divine sacrifice,<br>

  Abstract: I initiate this analysis of divine agony, as I have in each interpretation of the previous stages in divine suffering, with an exposition of the formal character of divine agony. Furthermore, once again, I submit the same four principal questions to this stage in the Christian symbol of divine suffering, the answers to which yield the formal character or structure of divine agony. (1) What is the relationship between divine vulnerability and this more passive stage of divine self-sacrifice? (2) To which operation or role in the divine life does the symbol of divine agony refer? (3) Toward which subjects<br>

  Abstract: While I have concluded my exposition of Christian attestations to divine agony, perhaps the most negative though perhaps not the most perplexing moment in the Christian symbol of divine suffering, I acknowledge that I have left many areas unexplored and other areas more under-developed than I would prefer. Specifically, I would have preferred to develop more extensively my exposition of the features of God’s active resistance in the second divine wound, features that already provide the basis for diverse communities of genuine solidarity with those who suffer oppression, suppression, repression, abuse, marginalization, and victimization. Nevertheless, the Christian symbol of divine<br>

  Book Title: Religion and Violence-A Dialectical Engagement through the Insights of Bernard Lonergan<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Arcamone Dominic<br>
  Abstract: The aim of Religion and Violence is to engage dialectically key symbols of religiously motivated violence through the insights of Bernard Lonergan. Sociologists and psychologists argue the link between religion and violence. Religion is viewed more as part of the problem and not part of the solution to violence. Bernard Lonergan’s insights have helped the author arrive at a number of conclusions regarding the link between religion and violence. He argues that there is a difference between distorted religion and genuine religion, between authenticity and inauthenticity of the subject. Distorted religion has the capacity to shape traditions in ways that justify violence, while genuine religion heals persons, helps them make different moral decisions when confronted with situations of conflict, and aims to explore new ways of understanding themselves as shaping history toward progress. Further, Religion and Violence, while arguing from within the Catholic Christian tradition, nevertheless seeks to provide a number of categories that will speak to people from other cultural traditions. Since many of the examples of religious violence cited by commentators come out of the Islamic tradition, the author has evidenced and explored more authentic aspects of the Islamic tradition that would help provide a solution to violence.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbhn">Religion and Violence</a><br>
  Abstract: The insights presented by Girard, Taylor, Jones, and Juergensmeyer have provided us with enough evidence to support the proposition that some forms of religious expression both motivate and justify the violent actions of religious agents. However, the survey of these authors’ works also leads me to assert that it is not enough simply to demonstrate empirically that people are motivated to commit violent acts by religious images, symbols, and doctrines. It is also important to dialectically engage religious images, symbols, and doctrines so as to judge whether they are conducive to authentic living, whether they are authentic understandings of a<br>

  5  A Dialectical Engagement with Cosmic War: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbhn">Religion and Violence</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter, I argued the importance of a dialectical engagement with the idea of
                  cosmoswithin the symbol of cosmic war. We saw that the designation ofcosmicwar that linked violence, divine will, and warfare within a cosmologically oriented mindset was imprecise, especially when dealing with religious groups who demonstrate that their cultures have achieved, if only partially, an anthropological breakthrough. A better, more nuanced understanding of the religious agent’s horizon would be to categorize it in terms of a grace–sin dialectic but that carries the danger of cosmic dualism, and consequently a lack of appreciation<br>

  7  A Dialectical Engagement with Martyrdom from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbhn">Religion and Violence</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter I engage dialectically with the idea of martyrdom, the second of Juergensmeyer’s symbols for understanding the link between violence and religion. I critique his claim that religious martyrdom and self-sacrifice are simply ritualized rites of destruction that in the eyes of religious agents leave the impression of a religious heroism that transforms history. Since martyrs are also called heroes, I hypothesize that true heroism is marked by a particular kind of courage, hope, and an ethic of risk. I assume that true heroism is a necessary, though not a sufficient, condition for true religious martyrdom, and I<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbhn">Religion and Violence</a><br>
  Abstract: The third symbol presented by Juergensmeyer and others for understanding the link between violence and religion is the phenomenon of demonization. In this chapter, I will argue that without a heuristic account of evil, people will be unable to discern why demonization continues the cycle of violence. We will see that social exclusion and humiliation provide for the emergence and survival of demonizing processes, while acts of dehumanization escalate those processes to the point where those demonized are robbed of their subjectivity. Emerging out of situations where there is an imbalance of power, I will demonstrate the role of

  9  A Dialectical Engagement with Warrior Empowerment from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbhn">Religion and Violence</a><br>
  Abstract: Juergensmeyer’s fourth symbol for understanding the link between violence and religion is warrior empowerment, which joins two interrelated aspects: the practice and code of the warrior, and the empowering of the warrior. Although Juergensmeyer’s title chapter uses the term “warrior” to structure his analysis, he does not use the term in the body of his writings, preferring to refer to “fighters” and “soldiers.”¹ However, there is evidence that the term “warrior” has been used in communities, for example, the

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbhn">Religion and Violence</a><br>
  Abstract: My aim in this book has been to explore the link between religion and violence, which I have done through four key symbols employed by commentators and academics convinced that religion often promotes violence. These symbols were: cosmic war, martyrdom, demonization, and warrior empowerment. I engaged dialectically with each of these symbols, using the insights of Bernard Lonergan, and through that engagement, I addressed a number of questions: What are the truthful and mistaken assertions made by authors through the lenses of these symbols around the link between religion and violence? Are there better categories to understand religiously motivated violence?<br>

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Volume 1. Divine Vulnerability and Creation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the first volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Divine Vulnerability and Creation. This study first develops an approach to interpreting the contested claims about the suffering of God. Thus, the larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. Through this approach, this volume of studies into the Christian symbol of divine suffering then investigates the two major presuppositions that the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally hold: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life - the imago Dei as love. When fully elaborated, these presuppositions reveal the conditions of possibility for divine suffering and divine vulnerability with respect to creation.<br>

  Abstract: The ultimate gloom, vulgarity, grim severity, horror, even apparent conceptual paradoxes, in Christian testimonies to divine suffering repel many people in their initial encounters with various forms of this Christian symbol.¹ Such revulsion for language that attributes suffering to God, however, may surprise contemporary Christians who easily attribute all sorts of emotions and experiences to God and may lead such Christians to criticize classical Christian theism itself, when they discover how the vast majority of official teachings and dogmas of orthodox Christianity (Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, and many of the major Protestant denominations that emerged from the reformations of the<br>

In one sense, this chapter initiates that interaction, since it provides a hypothetical overview of the symbol’s structure. In another sense, however, this chapter retains its orienting character, in that it does not yet

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbxv">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter constitutes the first stage in my analyses of the first presupposition of the Christian symbol of divine suffering. I repeat my formulation of this presupposition:
                  The God whose life is love limits the divine self in God’s creative activity; or, as the creator who is love, God limits the divine self as God creates. This first stage of my analysis works on the basis of an abstraction of divine life or being from divine activity, in order to clarify the characteristic ways in which this symbol envisions the actualization of divine love in divine creative activity.

  Abstract: I now shift from considering God’s being and activity, as methodologically abstracted from one another, to discussing divine love’s actualization in God’s creative activity.1 Previously, I have surveyed characteristics and dimensions of God’s being as love through attestations to divine activity in the history of Jesus the Nazarene. The present chapter examines the character of God’s creative activity, as determined by the divine being, in order to disclose the meaning of the first presupposition for the Christian symbol of divine suffering as well as to illumine the basis upon which to analyze this symbol’s second presupposition. Thus, I proceed in<br>

  Abstract: My analysis of this symbol’s first presupposition disclosed the implicit character of the second presupposition in the first presupposition. As a consequence, that disclosure requires an analysis of the second and implied presupposition, in order to comprehend as satisfactorily as possible even the first presupposition. Having begun with an analysis of this second presupposition would have required the same procedure in reverse. The elegant and fertile dialectical network between this symbol’s first and second presuppositions, as a result, begins to appear in all of its complexity through the present exposition. Although herein I continue to

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbxv">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter develops the first half of an exposition of the second major presupposition of the Christian symbol of divine suffering. As I have mentioned already, most specifically, this presupposition takes the following form:
                  God has created human life or being, through the actualization of the divine being as love in God’s self-limiting creative activity, in the image of God with the being or life of love. Working on the basis of the abstraction of being or life from its actualization, this chapter will identify and analyze the formal and material structures of the human as the image of God,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbxv">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: As stated in chapter 2, every religious symbol expresses, either explicitly or implicitly, a threefold referentiality: (1) reference to some notion of ultimate reality, the sacred, or God; (2) reference to a concept of the human; and (3) reference to a specific vision of the world. The Christian symbol of divine suffering naturally exhibits that threefold referentiality in both the explicit symbol and its twofold presupposition. Thus, in these two primary presuppositions, the human and God do not relate to one another in some sort of vacuum. The human (Ο άνθρωπος) and God (Ο θεός) relate to one another in<br>

  Abstract: Depuis la parution, en 1984, de l’imposant ouvrage dirigé par Pierre Nora, l’importance des lieux de mémoire dans la construction des identités collectives n’est plus à prouver. En effet, Nora montre bien que les lieux de mémoire s’avèrent essentiels, puisqu’ils permettent de cristalliser l’héritage collectif d’une communauté. Fortement symboliques, ils « servent de repères historiques à la collectivité, ils condensent l’image qu’elle a de son histoire en faisant intervenir autant l’émotionnel que le rationnel » (Poumet, 2005).

  Abstract: De quelle manière se transforment les Amériques à travers les discours publicitaires, les textes de vulgarisation économique et la littérature ? Que deviennent les cultures des Amériques dans le contexte de la nouvelle économie mondialisée ? Ces interrogations sont liées à la transformation des identités enracinées dans un territoire, en images de soi plurielles. Ces dernières rejoignent le développement des réseaux de communication multipliant les déplacements géographiques et symboliques et démocratisant des savoirs de plus en plus complexes. Dans cette dynamique analysée à partir de René Girard, de Homi Babhabha et de Néstor García Canclini, on analyse donc les stratégies pour devenir un producteur de significations plus efficace. Cette visée mène d'une part à la reconnaissance de l'autre et, d'autre part, à tenter de déterminer ce qui, en lui, n'est pas acceptable.<br>

  Abstract: Que soulignent tous ces jeux allant des déplacements géo-symboliques à la productivité sémantique et aux surprises du paradoxe ? D’abord que le discours postmoderne/postcolonial lié à la nouvelle économie rejoint ce que Karl Popper appelait « an abstract society² ». Par là, il entendait une société qui ne reposait plus sur un caractère organique, sur des relations contiguës, mais sur des relations choisies en dehors des accidents de la naissance, en dehors du fait de vivre dans telle famille ou sur tel ou tel territoire. Ces relations « abstraites » d'échange et de coopération fondent l’individualisme démocratique qui nous demande<br>

  Book Title: Myth, Symbol, and Colonial Encounter-British and Mi'kmaq in Acadia, 1700-1867<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): REID JENNIFER<br>
  Abstract: From the time of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, people of British origin have shared the area of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, traditionally called Acadia, with Eastern Canada's Algonkian-speaking peoples, the Mi'kmaq. This historical analysis of colonial Acadia from the perspective of symbolic and mythic existence will be useful to those interested in Canadian history, native Canadian history, religion in Canada, and history of religion.<br>

  Abstract: Within both British and Mi’kmaq communities, the need for a sense of rootedness and continuity of place fuelled religious imaginations, giving rise to religious symbols that confronted the necessities of place while accounting for particular experiences. The lives that revolved around these were encrusted with myths that articulated specific instances of the unity provided by the symbols. In this sense, the religious imagination of all Acadia’s people struggled with the problem of identity and origins in a new world. Yet the problem was resolved in a critically divergent manner by each community so that, overwhelmingly, two distinct visions of human<br>

  Abstract: Introduction If theology is, as Lonergan described it, a mediation “between a cultural matrix and the significance and role of a religion in that matrix”¹ then there are two major questions that arise in considering Berry’s contribution to Christian theology: (1) The methodological question: How is Berry’s “new story” situated in terms of mediating between Christianity and culture? In Lonergan’s terms, this is to ask whether methodologically the “new story” belongs to

  Abstract: Monsters loom large in the cultural imaginary. From folktales to splatter movies, from the Bible to computer games, from birth to death, monsters such as devils, werewolves, dragons, ghosts, cyborgs, zombies, and vampires inundate our imagination. Monsters, which can be understood as symbols of human vulnerability, can, however, also help us to imagine triumphing over danger. As Stephen T. Asma points out, they are “beneficial foes” that are “imaginative foils for thinking about our own responses to menace” (2009, online).<br>

  Abstract: The contemporary philosopher of culture Louis Dupré argues that the passing of the Baroque lost for the West its last great harmony between nature and grace. The Baroque achieved this harmony through a dynamic understanding of the human person in its intrinsic relation to its transcendent source. In this understanding, human creativity is appreciated not only because it follows its own rules and standards but precisely because, in the complexity of these rules and standards, it symbolizes the divine.¹ Baroque culture is thus essentially representational.² In the plastic arts, for instance, Roman and Bavarian churches are filled with forms and<br>

  Abstract: We have seen that

Building on the letter as the intrinsic symbol of the spirit, it understands divine revelation as a system of continuous symbols that join together Christ, his words and works, the apostolic tradition of the church, and the written scriptures and their interpretation. Whenever a synthesis is grounded in symbolism, its aesthetic dimension cannot help but be invoked. Heidegger reminds us, for instance, that symbolism constitutes the essence of art.¹ In the creative fashioning of an artifact, truth itself is preserved as beauty. Accordingly, if the Son is the Father’s image,<br>

Physical violence manifests itself in the enslavement and killing of Africans and in the dispossession of their continent; in the fights between masters and slaves, between colonized and colonizers, and among colonizers themselves; in abolitionist struggles; and in several postcolonial revolutionary wars (Corzani 15).

  “June Walked over It like Water and Came Home”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1djmc5d">Transatlantic Voices</a><br>
  Author(s) SHACKLETON MARK<br>
  Abstract: The opening section of
                  Love Medicine(1984, rev. 1993) closes with the death of June Kashpaw, “a long-legged Chippewa woman,” on the eve of Easter Sunday: “The snow fell deeper that Easter than it had in forty years, but June walked over it like water and came home” (1, 7). Such overt Christian symbolism has prompted the Native American poet and critic Elizabeth Cook-Lynn (Crow Creek Sioux) to criticize Erdrich for her supposed adulteration of aboriginal writing and “the myths and metaphors of sovereign nationalism” with “Christian-oriented” prose (84, 85).

  Abstract: Because cultures express ideas using more than just written words, textoriented historians can have great difficulty in understanding and communicating the “meaning” of some of the most basic components of experiences past. Past experiences are often measured in difficult-to-articulate symbols rather than words, and Lakoff and Johnson argue that humans tend to rely more upon such symbols when a particular idea cannot be clearly defined by experience in any direct fashion. They write that “we tend to structure the less concrete and inherently vaguer concepts (like those for the emotions) in terms of more concrete concepts, which are more clearly<br>

Not only are these processes similar, they are symbiotic, since a personality “shapes itself, both internally and externally, by means of images, many of which have<br>

  Book Title: Firewalking and Religious Healing-The Anastenaria of Greece and the American Firewalking Movement<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Danforth Loring M.<br>
  Abstract: "If the Saint calls you, if you have an open road, then you don't feel the fire as if it were your enemy," says one of the participants in the Anastenaria. This compelling work evokes and contrasts two forms of firewalking and religious healing: first, the Anastenaria, a northern Greek ritual in which people who are possessed by Saint Constantine dance dramatically over red-hot coals, and, second, American firewalking, one of the more spectacular activities of New Age psychology. Loring Danforth not only analyzes these rituals in light of the most recent work in medical and symbolic anthropology but also describes in detail the lives of individual firewalkers, involving the reader personally in their experiences: he views ritual therapy as a process of transformation and empowerment through which people are metaphorically moved from a state of illness to a state of health. Danforth shows that the Anastenaria and the songs accompanying it allow people to express and resolve conflict-laden family relationships that may lead to certain kinds of illnesses. He also demonstrates how women use the ritual to gain a sense of power and control over their lives without actually challenging the ideology of male dominance that pervades Greek culture. Comparing the Anastenaria with American firewalking, Danforth includes a gripping account of his own participation in a firewalk in rural Maine. Finally he examines the place of anthropology in a postmodern world in which the boundaries between cultures are becoming increasingly blurred.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dxg8pg">Firewalking and Religious Healing</a><br>
  Abstract: The Anastenaria is concerned with healing in the broadest sense. It is both a religious ritual and a form of psychotherapy. Any attempt to understand the Anastenaria as a system of religious healing must therefore integrate approaches from medical anthropology with those from the anthropological study of religion. It must bring together the concerns of transcultural psychiatry and those of symbolic anthropology. Such a synthesis, which constitutes an interpretive or hermeneutic approach to the study of ritual therapy, provides the theoretical framework for this study of the Anastenaria.<br>

  Abstract: The Anastenaria not only plays an important part in the personal lives of individual Anastenarides, it also plays a central role in the collective life of the village of Ayia Eleni and the community of Kostilides as a whole. The Anastenaria has been a powerful symbol for the shared identity of the Kostilides ever since their arrival as refugees in Greek Macedonia. It epitomizes all that it means to be a Kostilis in a society that is experiencing the homogenizing effects of mass media, a national educational system, and rapid modernization and urbanization. In addition, the festival of Saints Constantine<br>

  Book Title: Indebted-Capitalism and Religion in the Writings of S. Y. Agnon<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Sagiv Yonatan<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book to examine the oeuvre of Shmuel Yosef Agnon, 1966 Nobel laureate in literature, through a reading that combines perspectives from economic theory, semiotics, psychoanalysis, narrative theory, and Jewish and religious studies. Sagiv outlines the vital role economy plays in the construction of religion, subjectivity, language, and thought in Agnon's work, and, accordingly, explores his literary use of images of debt, money, and economy to examine how these themes illuminate other focal points in the canonical author's work, excavating the economic infrastructure of discourses that are commonly considered to reside beyond the economic sphere.Sagiv's analysis of Agnon's work, renowned for its paradoxical articulation of the impact of modernity on traditional Jewish society, exposes an overarching distrust regarding the sustainability of any economic structure. The concrete and symbolic economies surveyed in this project are prone to cyclical crises. Under what Sagiv terms Agnon's "law of permanent debt," the stability and profitability of economies are always temporary. Agnon's literary economy, transgressing traditional closures, together with his profound irony, make it impossible to determine if these economic crises are indeed the product of the break with tradition or, alternatively, if this theodicy is but a fantasy, marking permanent debt as the inherent economic infrastructure of human existence.<br>

  Abstract: Money was the rising star at the turn of the nineteenth century in Europe. Heralded by many contemporary economists as the symbol of economic rationality and the facilitator of a stable social order, money was considered one of the greatest institutional advances of humankind.¹ Yet in spite of such warm praises, money also gained a rather dubious reputation. Rumor had it that money was indeed something unimportant, at times even suspicious, a neutral “veil” that only obscures the “real” economic basis of society, namely, the good old practice of barter, the direct exchange of good and services.²<br>

                  e.g.Colemanet al.1996; Tatton-Brown 1997; Knapp 2008); a Chalcolithic figurine was even deemed an apposite image for the one euro coin. Although for modern audiences, figurines have become convenient symbols, embodying and displaying Cyprus’s past identities, researchers are well aware that these complex objects encompass far more than simply passive reflections of past realities. Prehistoric figurines were symbolically-charged objects with clear, active roles in shaping the socio-political landscape<br>

  Author(s) Georgiou Giorgos<br>
  Abstract: This paper focuses on the fact that picrolite, an indigenous stone that was extensively used during the Chalcolithic period (4000/3900–2500/2400 BC) for the manufacture of small figurines and other symbolic artefacts, was used in the Early and Middle Cypriot periods (2400–1700 BC) for the production of pendants in new forms. Although the relatively limited number and contextual information available for Bronze Age objects leaves little opportunity to consider in detail how they were perceived by their makers and wearers, they can nevertheless be used to give insights into their significance and the way in which they embodied identity<br>

  Author(s) Kouka Ourania<br>
  Abstract: Following the aforementioned definition, which corresponds also to theoretical approaches of embodiment and its perception (Merleau-Ponty 1964, 159–90; Lesure 2005), it is argued that the built environment demonstrates from prehistoric times an anthropogenic system of closed and open spaces for hosting every-day life, economic, social and symbolic activities. It represents, therefore, an agent through which the needs, abilities and habits of humans are embodied, but also the field for economic and social interaction. Moreover, built environment — domestic, funeral, and sacred — displays the existential ground of culture that allows the identification of its cognitive creator and owner.<br>

  Abstract: Assia Djebar: Out of Algeriais a book about expatriation, and the constant, necessary revisiting that follows. Algeria remains a focus, an object of desire throughout Djebar’s corpus, but it is also a point of departure, and excludes the writer more often than it grounds or defines her. Her only locus of identification or belonging, Algeria is at the same time figured as broken, war-torn, unfamiliar and irrevocably lost. A potential symbol of difference in contradistinction to colonial influence, Djebar’s Algeria is also diverse, divided and ultimately destroyed. Driven by the urge to recover her country’s history, Djebar repeatedly returns<br>

  Author(s) Cardina Miguel<br>
  Abstract: If the slogan ‘make love, not war’ became a constantly evoked symbol of the kind of protest generated in the ‘long sixties’ (Jameson 1984; Marwick 1998, 16–20), the fact is that the attitudes and discourses that originated in this period have not always corresponded to this pacifist image, at times understood retrospectively as parodic, individualistic and carefree. In different times and places, at a gradually more intense pace, the new youth culture introduced profound changes in the fields of customs, taste and morality, and set in motion modes of daring and resistance which often evolved towards open confrontation with<br>

It looks in particular at the connection between education and values and unconventional political participation. As education has been a major characteristic of the active sixties generation, educational level and educational expansion will be theorised to analyse social mechanisms behind the sixties movement and its development.

  Author(s) Feleppa Robert<br>
  Abstract: Anthropologists have become increasingly involved as participants on development teams, but their great potential to promote sustainable development is hindered by vestiges of one of cultural anthropology’s founding myths. It is the notion of cultures construed as self-contained symbol systems, conceptually opaque to all but true insiders, with an implied notion of correct translation, which makes it an ‘all or nothing’ matter. This notion is also linked to long-standing concerns in the field with moral relativism, value neutrality and colonialism. As a result, within the community of anthropologists working in development, two somewhat opposed positions have arisen: one holds that<br>

  Author(s) Fowler Bridget<br>
  Abstract: Luc Boltanski, whose work is reaching a crescendo, has made an enduring contribution to sociology. His distinction lies chiefly in his inventive crossing of the approach to domination in the Marxist and Weberian traditions with the interest in moral and symbolic representations of the Durkheimian tradition. Yet, it also bears all the fascination of his early alliance with his master, Bourdieu, and his subsequent public break from him. In particular, we see the mature Boltanski wrestling productively with a fruitful conceptual framework for understanding the contemporary mode of production, and the reappearance within it of mass precariousness in relation to<br>

  Abstract: The 1980s witnessed a remarkable change in the social sciences, a significant renewal of sociological theory. In France it was an occasion to discover and appreciate, albeit with significant delay, the contribution of Anglo-Saxon sociological currents which had earlier been dismissed or underestimated, such as symbolic interactionism, ethno-methodology, and phenomenological sociology. Through the 1960s and 1970s, French sociology was limited mainly to four major currents, which Alain Touraine proposed to call ‘the four corners of sociology’, represented by Raymond Boudon, Pierre Bourdieu, Michel Crozier, and Alain Touraine himself. The debates in the social sciences during this period significantly turned around<br>

  Abstract: Ezekiel 16, the problematic narrative of Jerusalem as YHWH’s adopted daughter and faithless wife, has been richly illuminated for contemporary readers by way of postcolonial theory and postmodern literary approaches to metaphor and gender.¹ These interpretations have helped modern readers move from initial feelings of revulsion and shock at this tale of YHWH’s violent punishment of daughter/wife Jerusalem to a more complex assessment of its symbolic treatment of the city’s destruction. To be sure, nothing can dispel the tale’s unsettling violence; nevertheless, it has become possible to appreciate how the narrative’s use of metaphor and gender allowed its ancient readers<br>

  Abstract: Culturally, associatively, and naturally, light brings with it reference to darkness, as day to night and life to death. The symbolic valences of night and light, together with their phonic likeness, occupied Milton throughout his writing, but especially after his blindness, as his blind protagonist eloquently testifies in

  Abstract: Ireland, with its reputation as the “Land of Song,” is the only country in the world to have a musical instrument as its national symbol. It is thus not surprising that music is so intimately involved in the collective remembering of events in Irish history. When in the eighteenth century a decline in the numbers of Irish speakers occurred, the Irish language could no longer serve to transmit cultural memory as it once had; during this period, music became central to national expression.

The subject of poems and travelogues, postcards and photographs, it has been monumentalized in such commemorations as the Hunger Memorial in New York City, used as a signature for Irish pubs in the United States and elsewhere, and kitsched up in the creation of countless souvenirs.

  Abstract: Mainstream public memory is traditionally understood as an intentional recollection of quantifiable facts of the historical past that then constitute collective identity. Because of its suppressed nature, queer memory is flimsier: while mainstream public memory is solidly supported institutionally by politics and history, queer memory is more symbolic, derived from what is implied by exclusion rather than inclusion. By uncovering previously hidden gay and lesbian experiences, queer historians have initiated a type of cultural rebellion, juxtaposing queer memory with hetero-normative histories. The production of this alternative history has evoked a renewed engagement with memory because more traditional methodological approaches to<br>

  Abstract: The archetypalist position is a very familiar one in literary studies, where it has sanctioned a long history of interpretation as the art of translating symbols into universal archetypes. From this we learn, according to Jung, that the creative process “consists in the unconscious activation of an archetypal image, and in elaborating and shaping this image into the finished work. By giving it shape, the artist translates it into the language of the present, and so makes it possible for us to find our way back to the deepest springs of life.”³ Jung is clearly the most influential figure in<br>

While the Holocaust was to remain marginal to thinking about the war at least until the 1960s, the meaning of mass violence and atrocity was immediately debated by political thinkers across the continent. After all, from the late 1930s to the late 1940s more people had been ‘killed by their fellow human beings than ever before in the history of humankind’.¹<br>

  Abstract: Artistically the Enlightenment may not compare favorably with the Renaissance or Baroque periods, but the aesthetic criticism of the eighteenth century surpassed that of the two earlier periods and provided most of the categories used in the two centuries that followed. One of its major achievements was to raise the idea of beauty to the level of truth. It accomplished this in three stages: at the beginning the imitation theory prevailed, next the expressive theory, and at the end the symbolic theory made a tentative entrance. Each of these movements made a definitive contribution to the modern conception of art<br>

  Abstract: Animal and human gestures are used for action but also as signposts, symbols, and to indicate intention. They are neither simple nor complex. They are simplex because, in a very global and immediate way, they enable the brain to grasp a reality, an emotion, a thought, or a complex social relationship. Gesture is a fundamental mark of culture and art, which are always simplex expressions. Gesture is essential to them. Drawing, painting, music, mime, acting, sculpture, and dance are always expressed in gestures. For this reason, we must not be content with a physiology (or a philosophy) of action. We<br>

  Abstract: Two main processes informed most of the speculative hermeneutical corpora in the postbiblical forms of Judaism. The first is the expansion of the relevance of the content of the canonical texts to increasingly more cosmological, theosophical, intellectual, and psychological realms than those ancient texts themselves claimed to engage. This expansion is often related to processes of arcanization, secretive understandings of the canonical texts understood as pointing to these realms in allusive ways: anagrammatic, numerical, allegorical, or symbolic.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npn1r">Absorbing Perfections</a><br>
  Abstract: The suppression of some conceptual elements and forms of discourse already found in ancient Jewish circles is characteristic of the rather homogeneous type of rabbinic discourse. Though allowing divergences of opinion and, one may even claim, encouraging, preserving, and studying them for generations, the ancient rabbis nevertheless controlled the nature of the topics on which divergences are allowed. No allegorical or symbolic interpretations of the Bible, abundant as they were in Alexandrian Judaism (especially Philo), were given access to the exegetical methods characteristic of rabbinic literature. Alchemy, astrology, philosophy, and physical sciences remained at the margin of rabbinic discourse. A<br>

  Abstract: The biblical and the rabbinic literatures are devoid of substantial symbolic propensities, if by symbolism we understand a way of reflecting the divine attributes or worlds by means of a sustained exegesis of the sacred scriptures. The emergence of forms of Kabbalah that display a vigorous symbolic mode of interpretation, and the composition of a book that is informed by a symbolic code and becomes canonical, are therefore sharp departures from the royal road of expression and interpretation dominant, previously, in those forms of religious literature.¹ Interestingly, even after the ascent of this figurative mode in some Kabbalistic writings, symbolic<br>

  Abstract: As we have just seen, some modern scholars assumed the ubiquity of the symbolic mode of expression in Kabbalah as a whole, even portraying it as completely different from allegorical types of expression, which they regarded as representative of Jewish philosophical literature. Indeed, interpretive allegory, or allegorization, is one of the outstanding spiritual imports into the exegetical arsenal of Jewish hermeneutics. Despite Philo of Alexandria’s great contributions to the emergence and development of allegorical exegesis in early Christianity and, to a lesser extent, to allegory in Western medieval exegesis, his exegetical approach to the Bible was completely rejected in the<br>

Whereas psychoanalytic theory relies on a horizon of truthfulness, psychoanalytic praxis revolves around an alert attention to the probable fictiveness of the analysand’s truth (intentional statements, recovered memories) and the probable truthfulness of his or her fictions (performative acting-out, symbolic transferences). As a comment in the discussion section puts it: “the manifest, apparent story or truth sometimes is only a communication about a hidden more interesting truth”; or as John Forrester more dramatically claims, in psychoanalysis “a ‘no’ may mean ‘yes’, and a ‘yes’ almost certainly<br>

  Abstract: A common assumption concerning childhood play in societies with well-entrenched gender roles and conservative religious values is that imaginative play is discouraged and that play simply replicates anticipated “real-life roles” (Carlson, Taylor, and Levin 538; Taylor and Carlson 257). However, scholars of cross-cultural research on childhood, and particularly on childhood play, argue that children’s play is more independent of pragmatic expectations and adult supervision than often assumed (Aguilar 29-30, 37; Edwards 335-7; Rabain-Jamin, Maynard, and Greenfield 204-5; Watson-Gegeo 148; McMahon and Sutton-Smith 297-8), since children’s symbolic behaviour is not necessarily compliant, but at times even subversive, defying cultural expectations (Ackerley<br>

Der vorliegende Band widmet sich der Lebenssymbolik jener Kernphase des Symbolismus – also den "Neomythen“ von Apoll, Dionysos und Sophia ebenso wie den Diskursen des Erhabenen, der Apokalyptik und der "Lebens-Kunst“ als Gesamtkunstwerk der Dichterexistenz des Mythopoeten. Im Mittelpunkt steht das lyrische wie essayistische Werk von Andrej Belyj, Aleksandr Blok, Vjaceslav Ivanov, Maksimilian Vološin und anderer Vertreter der zweiten Symbolistengeneration um 1900. Wie in den bisherigen Bänden wird eine systematische Präsentation der mytho- und metapoetischen Hauptmotive der Epoche angeboten und darüber hinaus eine Zusammenschau der theoretischen Schriften ihrer Protagonisten. Gegenläufig zur Konstruktion der religionskünstlerischen Symbolik wird deren allmähliche Dekonstruktion erkennbar – ein Prozess der Symbolauflösung, der auch radikale Auswirkungen auf die Konstruktion des Lebensmythos dieser Künstlergeneration hatte. Letztlich wird schrittweise erkennbar, wie das ursprünglich optimistische, positive Konzept eines Neomythologismus in dessen grotesk-karnevaleske Ironisierung umkippt. Das Modell einer revolutionären Religionskunst scheitert, die Dichtung der russischen Symbolisten jener Jahre trägt den Sieg davon. Wie die beiden vorherigen Bände versteht sich auch Band 3 als Katalog und Wegweiser zugleich, der alle wesentlichen lyrischen Primärtexte erfasst und über einen ausführlichen deutschen wie russischen Index zugänglich macht.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1vw0qr1">Der russische Symbolismus</a><br>
  Abstract: Die Polarisierung des Apollinischen und Dionysischen kündigte sich schon in der deutschen Romantik (im romantischen Neomythologismus F. Schlegels, Novalis und v.a. dann in der "Mythologie" Schellings)¹ an, wobei das Apollinische mit dem "Klassischen" mit Rationalismus, Aufklärung, Humanismus identifiziert wurde, wogegen das Dionysische dem Archaisch-Mythischen, Naturhaft-Organischen, Kollektiv-Unbewußten und "Volkshaften" – im Geiste der Romantik – gleichgesetzt wurde. Diese pro-dionysische Einstellung² findet sich dann wieder in Nietzsches Gegenüberstellung von Apoll und Dionysos (in seiner "Geburt der Tragödie"),³ deren Einfluss auf die russische Moderne (insbesondere aber auf die symbolistische Mythopoetik und Religionsphilosophie) nur als total bezeichnet werden kann.<br>

  Book Title: Holocaust Monuments and National Memory-France and Germany since 1989<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Carrier Peter<br>
  Abstract: Since 1989, two sites of memory with respect to the deportation and persecution of Jews in France and Germany during the Second World War have received intense public attention: the Vélo d'Hiver (Winter Velodrome) in Paris and the Monument for the Murdered Jews of Europe or Holocaust Monument in Berlin. Why is this so? Both monuments, the author argues, are unique in the history of memorial projects. Although they are genuine "sites of memory", neither monument celebrates history, but rather serve as platforms for the deliberation, negotiation and promotion of social consensus over the memorial status of war crimes in France and Germany. The debates over these monuments indicate that it is the communication among members of the public via the mass media, rather than qualities inherent in the sites themselves, which transformed these sites into symbols beyond traditional conceptions of heritage and patriotism.<br>

  Abstract: The impact of monuments and related rituals upon collective memories of the Second World War is a source of recurrent political debate in all former Allied and Axis countries. The spate of fiftieth anniversary commemorations of this event served not only to reappraise national histories in light of the end of the balance of power sustained during the Cold War, but also to symbolically compensate the dwindling number of living witnesses and victims of the war period. In both cases, public representations acquired considerable political authority as means of sustaining social memories of this period. But do representations ensure that<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1x76f8h">Holocaust Monuments and National Memory</a><br>
  Abstract: In his famous essay on ‘Monuments’ of 1927, the writer Robert Musil claims that there is nothing more invisible to the human eye than a monument. ‘The remarkable thing about monuments is that one does not notice them. There is nothing in the world so invisible as a monument.’¹ The suggestion that precisely those images, figures and events that people strive to represent in public should go unheeded provokes numerous questions about the relation of individuals and groups to symbols and their impact as focal points of political communication. If familiarity with everyday objects indeed erodes the curiosity of passers-by,<br>

Following the renaming of streets and the removal or modification of monuments in the eastern sector of the city from 1989, and parallel to negotiations over the possible reconstruction of the Hohenzollern Palace, the debate over the planned Holocaust Monument exemplified the problematical cultural and symbolic transformation of this city prior to and following<br>

  Abstract: The proliferation of monuments and commemorations and the social and political values invested in them since the 1970s are symptomatic of societies that have been actively seeking a symbolic reinforcement of collective memories. Public symbols are neither a cause nor a consequence of the present international preoccupation with memory, however, but the very language with which these societies transmit and negotiate their pasts. What are the historical and political origins and the social consequences of this phenomenon? And how do contemporary societies legitimate their existence on the basis of memory and historical representations? The rise of memory cultures, which is<br>

Both projects are highly informative, thorough in their treatment of historical facts, and theoretically innovative. The notions that collective symbols are today ‘patrimonial’ instead of partisan foci of collective memory, that we are subjects of ‘archival’ memory, that ‘present time’ is a historiographical category in which societies forge a cohesive self-understanding on the basis of shared symbols of the past, and that the mass media<br>

  Abstract: The question of the one and the many, of unity and diversity, has been posed since the beginning of political thought in the West. The American Founders were well aware of the vexations attendant upon the creation of a new political body. They worked with, and against, a stock of metaphors that had previously served as the symbolic vehicles of political incorporation. As men of the Enlightenment, they rejected the images of the body politic that had dominated medieval and early modern political thinking.

  Book Title: The Imaginary Revolution-Parisian Students and Workers in 1968<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Seidman Michael<br>
  Abstract: The events of 1968 have been seen as a decisive turning point in the Western world. The author takes a critical look at "May 1968" and questions whether the events were in fact as "revolutionary" as French and foreign commentators have indicated. He concludes the student movement changed little that had not already been challenged and altered in the late fifties and early sixties. The workers' strikes led to fewer working hours and higher wages, but these reforms reflected the secular demands of the French labor movement. "May 1968" was remarkable not because of the actual transformations it wrought but rather by virtue of the revolutionary power that much of the media and most scholars have attributed to it and which turned it into a symbol of a youthful, renewed, and freer society in France and beyond.<br>

Each side of these contrasting dimensions is supported by important research findings and consistent theory. This in itself may illustrate the actual multiplicity of the processes of dreaming.

  Abstract: Even earlier in the twentieth century, the public agenda seemed lost or abandoned. In an atmosphere of crisis, civic institutions could only repeat empty symbolic reassurances. The symbols were in fact empty, because there appeared to be no learned experience except failure for them to rest on. Resignation, cynicism, and hopelessness had become the order of the day. In the midst of this material and symbolic dispossession it seems almost fanciful to imagine a creative ethical option for speech. Around the world oratory flourished; but it was hardly the sort to revive hopes for participatory democracy. Imagine now a public<br>

  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>

  Abstract: While only rarely reflecting explicitly on liturgy, French philosopher Paul Ricoeur (1913-2005) gave sustained attention to several themes pertinent to the interpretation of worship, including metaphor, narrative, subjectivity, and memory. Inspired by his well-known aphorism, "The symbol gives rise to thought," Liturgical Theology after Schmemann offers an original exploration of the symbolic world of the Byzantine Rite , culminating in a Ricoeurian analysis of its Theophany "Great Blessing of Water." .<br>

                  Oneself as AnotherandThe Course of Recognition. The focus here will be on the nature of human capability itself, as fulfilled within a liturgical context; having reflected in previous chapters on the polyphony of liturgical language and symbolism, we must now consider the kind of self that may respond to such “music.” The subsequent chapters will afford the opportunity to examine the way in which the capable subject experiences the configuration of memory through the work of liturgy.<br>

  Abstract: As has by now become evident, Ricoeur approaches questions of selfhood via the “long route” of symbols, metaphors, and narratives. There is no a priori grasping of truth—although there is an intuitive guess in its regard—but only the arduous path of the imaginative exploration of, and eventual ontological validation of, possible worlds.¹ This dual sense of description of a world of meaning and subscription to it in the form of a corresponding way of life is conveyed by the notion of truth as “attestation.” In the first part of this chapter, therefore, we further probe

It has sought to make a contribution to Orthodox liturgical theology, inspired by the legacy of Schmemann, through whom I first discovered the power of a Weltanschauung grounded in the worship of the Church. While respecting Schmemann, I have sought to go “beyond” him by questioning, at various removes, what it means to “seek in the liturgy the vision implied in its own<br>

Like anyone else on the borders of society, a shaman occupies an ambivalent role: he is powerful and dangerous, necessary but marginal. He may know the ways of nature—and probably does, better than most, because he is closer to it—but as a result he may be seen as farther away, in symbolic terms, from being human.

Or better, groups construct themselves and others against historical frames that produce culture in the present, and that simultaneously reconstruct the events of the past. That is to say: our narratives about the past explain the way we find ourselves circumscribed in the present. History is constructed to explain the present; historical trajectories determine the cultural or symbolic terms of engagement through which group identities are articulated and against which they are defined.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2854m6">Mirages and Mad Beliefs</a><br>
  Abstract: In dramatizing a frozen imagination and a sterilized world, Baudelaire’s rocklike formations crush the life from any belief in the spellbinding or “reenchanting” capabilities of lyric. Subjectivity turned to stone has also been linked (most notably in the wake of Benjamin’s reflections on Baudelaire) to another distinction—that between symbol and allegory in the aesthetics of poetic representation. In Baudelaire the petrified order of things signifies the death of the “symbol,” understood as the quasi-animistic, “living,” and embodying force of analogy and
                  correspondances, and a fall back into the disjunctive, broken sphere of the allegorical, where matter is but the<br>

  Abstract: A new language, referred to for the purposes of this paper as the information systems business language or ISBL, is being born in the world of business. It is an artificial language (Lotman, 1990), designed to eliminate possibilities for misunderstandings in the conduct of standardised business transactions. Its primary source language is English but it incorporates information systems (IS) concepts, definitions, symbols and gestures and is therefore not a subset of English. The language has a sphere of operation restricted to interactions involving at least one autonomous IS, and is still in the very early stages of development. The development<br>

  Abstract: In Chapter 1 I offered a typology of religious representation—unitive, enactive, symbolic, and conceptual—to describe the ways in which religions have understood reality. The concepts of enactive, symbolic, and conceptual representation were adapted from the work of Jerome Bruner on child development. According to Bruner, who is in turn adapting his categories from Piaget, the child first learns about the world by acting on it. It is by holding, throwing, reaching for, that the children come to know the objects that surround them. In early language learning the symbol and the object are fused—the sun and the<br>

  Landscapes of Gendered Violence: from:

  Author(s) Collins Lindsey<br>
  Abstract: At President Obama’s inaugural luncheon, hanging behind the president’s table was Thomas Hill’s
                  View of Yosemite Valley(1885). Hill, a painter in the Hudson River tradition, is perhaps best known for his paintingThe Last Spike(1881), which commemorated the 1869 completion of the transcontinental railroad in Promontory Summit, Utah. Like the railroad’s completion, Yosemite’s preservation, decreed by Abraham Lincoln after the Civil War, was a symbol of national unity. Commenting on the significance of the painting chosen for Obama’s inauguration, Senator Dianne Feinstein noted, “As a country struggled with Civil War, many Americans looked West to the dawn of<br>

  Abstract: Clockers (1995) begins with signs of violence: still shots of brutally shot people, all young, all black, all apparently inner city.¹ On the sound track Marc Dorsey sings a cool jazz “People in Search of a Life” (written by Raymond James). Capitalism is an extremely violent social system, but that violence is mostly symbolic in the bourgeois boardrooms and in the middle-class experience. In the inner city, where poverty is extreme, the violence is literal and very real. It is the dark side of the American way, of the American dream. But it is, essentially, the same system.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt3q4">Aquinas, Feminism, and the Common Good</a><br>
  Abstract: Hermeneutical theology is a distinct approach to theology. Hermeneutics itself is the science of interpretation.¹ Since Christianity is a textually based religion shaped by and oriented around a particular set of symbols, Christian theology needs to reinterpret its significant doctrines, texts,² and symbols for each new generation and within each new culture in which it emerges. Such interpretation is necessary for several reasons: on anthropological grounds, in light of the principle of analogy, because of the nature of foundational documents themselves, and, finally, in light of the hermeneutics of suspicion.³<br>

  Abstract: It would be futile to search the work of Wittgenstein for a thorough discussion or systematic critique of psychoanalysis. Freud’s theory is not the focus of any carefully argued statement, and the materials available to us on this subject are rather contained in conversations reported by Rush Rhees and in what are often brief, allusive remarks scattered throughout Wittgenstein’s published writings and manuscripts. Psychoanalysis most often serves as an illustration in the context of much broader philosophical discussions concerning questions such as the distinction between reasons and causes, “aesthetic” explanation and causal explanation, the nature of symbolism in general, of<br>

  Chapter 12  IMMIGRANTS FROM A DEEPER SOUTH from:

  Abstract: When Mexican artist Diego Rivera traveled to the great metropolis of New York City during the Great Depression, he was both “amazed and appalled” at the shantytowns, breadlines, starvation, and suicides that he found to be endemic to a city that was for non-natives like him the very symbol of the United States. As New York journalist Pete Hamill wrote in his book on Rivera in 1999, the heavy-set, cigar-chomping, “‘big-jowled paisano’” and world-famous muralist proceeded to paint his conflicting views in one of his most compelling works,

  TO UTTER THE HOLY from:

  Author(s) CONNER MARC C.<br>
  Abstract: “The highest and, indeed, the truly serious task of art,” states Nietzsche, is “to save the eye from gazing into the horrors of night and to deliver the subject by the healing balm of illusion from the spasms of the agitations of the will” (
                  Birth118). For Nietzsche, this constitutes the supreme achievement of Attic tragedy, in which the frenzied and annihilating power of Dionysus is contained by and expressed through Apollo’s “healing balm of blissful illusion” (127). Consequently Nietzsche defines “the tragic myth” as the “symbolization of Dionysian wisdom through Apollinian artifices” (131). It would seem that the more<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tvppp">West African Drumming and Dance in North American Universities</a><br>
  Abstract: This book explores the strong presence of West African drumming and dance at North American universities, an ongoing process since 1964 that I describe as a resurrection. To offer a better understanding and appreciation of the reasons for calling West African drumming in the American academy a novelty, presence, and resurrection of a genre, it is crucial to situate this discussion by first evoking the broader a priori historical context that characterized the absence, disruption, and suppression of a symbolic musical tradition. Accordingly, I subsume this chapter under two historical phases: (1) Slavery (1619–1863), and (2) After Slavery until<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bf4m">The Uncertain Sciences</a><br>
  Abstract: Culture is the key concept in much (though not all) of human science. Yet it is more useful to think of humans first as symbolic animals, rather than cultural animals, for symbolic abilities underlie the existence of both cultures and societies. The species, at the same time that its brain physically evolved, adding a cerebral cortex to its limbic core, increasingly replaced immediate, instinctual responses with delayed, thoughtful actions, mediated through symbols. We need not examine in detail the familiar findings of recent research that tell us of the development of symbolic language, with denotative and connotative characteristics, especially as<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bk1z">Reading Abstract Expressionism</a><br>
  Author(s) RUSHING W. JACKSON<br>
  Abstract: In the late 1930s and early 1940s the “myth-makers” of the New York avant-garde, including Adolph Gottlieb, Jackson Pollock, Richard Pousette-Dart, and Mark Rothko, made paintings that referred to atavistic myth, primordial origins, and primitive rituals and symbols, especially those of Native American cultures.¹ Barnett Newman began to work in a similar fashion about 1944 and was influential as a theorist and indefatigable promoter of this new art. The “myth-makers” shared a tendency to depict ritual violence or inherently violent myths as well as an archaism exemplified by biomorphic forms and, often, coarse surfaces.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bm6t">Passage to Modernity</a><br>
  Abstract: The lively cosmological speculations of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries discussed in the previous chapter lacked, for the most part, the method and scientific discipline of such late-medieval thinkers as Buridan, Oresme, and Autrecourt. But they may have influenced the scientific movement in a substantial albeit indirect way. Platonic speculation on the sun as symbol of the mind may seem unrelated to the development of a scientific cosmology. Yet as Hans Blumenberg has shown, it removed the principal philosophical obstacle that barred the way toward the acceptance of a heliocentric system. Indeed, such extra-scientific considerations may have spurred Copernicus to<br>

My sponsor was Jean Wahl, a kindly gentleman who was one of the first, and perhaps the first, to redirect French philosophical attention to Hegel in the late twenties with his lectures on the unhappy consciousness. Wahl was interesting because of a certain amorphousness in his nature. By education and age, he served as a symbol of the Paris of the previous generation. At the same time, he possessed a childlike openness and imaginative predisposition for novelty that hinted at things to come. One could not confuse him<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32btm9">On the Nature of Consciousness</a><br>
  Abstract: There is a widespread agreement among those psychologists who see consciousness as a causal system in its own right that its qualitative features are somehow “emergent” from underlying neural processes. That said, however, all major questions remain. Is consciousness, in the sense of a primary or immediate sentience, only emergent at a particular level of central nervous system complexity, as most investigators certainly would agree for self-referential symbolic processes? If so, is primary awareness regionally localized? Or, with the artificial-intelligence (AI) community, would any computational system of sufficient “cross-reference” also perform the basic functions attributable to consciousness? On both views,<br>

  Abstract: The idea that synesthesias show the inner side of a cross-modal translation capacity at the base of symbolic cognition offers a solution to one of the oldest disagreements in cognitive psychology — the Würzburg controversy over the underlying nature of thought. The debate is still very much with us in the contrast between those who understand thought as a propositional logic (Pylyshyn, 1984) and those who posit its basis in abstract visual-spatial imagery (Shepard, 1978; Lakoff, 1987; Johnson, 1987).<br>

  Abstract: We have been dealing with the cognitive processes that underlie experiences which we have variously termed higher states of consciousness, transpersonal experience, or presentational states. These have been understood as a reconstitution on the level of symbolic cognition of presence-openness as the basic structure of perception in motile sentient creatures. Horizonal openness and the flow gradients of the ambient array are “real,” “existent,” and inherent to the structure of sentience, but would only be realized as such, as felt meaning for its own sake, on the human level. Presence-openness emerges into presentational symbolic cognition through the synesthetic translation of the<br>

  12  Consciousness as Time from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32btm9">On the Nature of Consciousness</a><br>
  Abstract: We have begun to consider consciousness in terms of its “with” — as the socially shared forms of awareness in self-referential symbolic beings. In addition, since symbolic cognition reuses the here-there, whence-whither dimensions of the array, this human “with” extends into the envelope of flow shared by all sentient motile beings. It remains to turn our attention back toward the “in” of consciousness. Human consciousness is inseparable from a being-in-the-world. The life worlds of sentient creatures are also “in” the physical universe as understood by modern physical science. Accordingly, we would expect the being of sentient creatures to be broadly<br>

  Author(s) Bates Matthew W.<br>
  Abstract: The vocabulary and cadences of Scripture—particularly of the LXX—are imprinted deeply on Paul’s mind, and the great stories of Israel continue to serve for him as a fund of symbols and metaphors that condition his perception of the world, of God’s promised deliverance of his people, and of his own identity and calling. His faith, in short, is one whose articulation is inevitably intertextual in character, and Israel’s Scripture is the “determinate subtext that plays a constitutive role” in shaping his literary production.¹<br>

  Abstract: A specific Jewish culture developed as a result of integration into the Islamic countries, and its originality, as well as its proximity to Islamic civilization, found expression in the architecture of the synagogue. When the Europeans arrived, however, they tended to impel the Jews, not without resistance, to build synagogues on stylistic and monumental models borrowed from European architecture. Thus, a strictly internal and hidden place of worship, in keeping with the tradition of an Israelite temple, was transformed into a symbol of emancipation and integration into modern society. It would be insufficient, in studying the synagogues of a territory<br>

In a remarkable analysis Lévi-Strauss demonstrated that sorcerous ideologies were based on sociological fictions reinforced by magical sleight of hand. In the end the power of the sorcerer, he argued, rested not in an intrinsic power, but in the symbolic power of his or her relationship in the cultural continuum of illness and health.¹ Lévi-Strauss’s argument is based on data gleaned not from his own fieldwork in Brazil but<br>

  Abstract: In the following essay, I will trace elements of the metaphysical detective story in the works of Witold Gombrowicz and align them within a psychoanalytic (in particular, Lacanian) framework. For this project, I will draw on the elective affinity between detective fiction and psychoanalysis, which is based—at least partly—on the fact that, like the criminal case, the psychoanalytic case is a knotty problem with death at its center.

The enjoyment of food is used to celebrate the pure physical joy of life and sensuality, reminding us of our immediate corporeal sensations, and affirming the vitality of human life.

  Author(s) HARRIS LEONARD<br>
  Abstract: To “signify” is to modify texts by “riffing, woofing, scoring, getting loud on something or sometone.”¹ Signifying refers to a wide-ranging critical mode of engagement with texts, not merely an exegesis or the search for the content-meaning of texts, including sacred ones. Signifying is also intended to capture the creation of symbols, meanings, and approaches that are unsettling and made by the social categories defined as subalterns, nondominant populations, minorities, populations on the margin of society, subordinated groups, the oppressed, and the exploited. I will refer to all of these social categories in the following as “subalterns” or “nondominant populations.”<br>

Si ce mouvement culturel se caractérise avant tout par l’hétérogénéité, la multiplicité, la remise en question de l’autorité et l’absence de l’unicité et du consensus¹, Babel peut être considéré non seulement comme étant à la source du postmodernisme, mais aussi comme son symbole. Dans un roman incontestablement postmoderne, les liens entre Babel et l’esthétique postmoderne sont mis en scène au moyen de discours sur la problématique de la dualité linguistique, par la construction littéraire d’un Paris fictif et par la structure romanesque.

  Abstract: To state that human movement is the basis of dance is not a revelation. What is surprising is that its detailed study has not more fully permeated all areas of dance research and that a conceptual framework and systematic approach of movement analysis applicable for inclusion in varied research designs is still not widely accepted. Attention to the analysis of dance movement is not new.

  Abstract: For a quarter of a century, Tim Burton has captivated audiences with his offbeat creations. Known for his macabre style and predisposition for the fantastic, Burton consistently delights viewers with his strange settings and peculiar characters. As anyone acquainted with Burton’s corpus is aware, his work is often characterized as macabre because it features death so prominently. Whether blatantly, through the presence of characters that personify death, or merely through a character’s encounter with mortality, Burton consistently reminds audiences of their finitude. Indeed, he reinstates the long-standing artistic tradition of memento mori, the tradition of incorporating explicit symbols of mortality<br>

  Book Title: Symbolic Forms and Cultural Studies-Ernst Cassirer’s Theory of Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KROIS JOHN MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: Cassirer thought of culture anthropologically as the entire complex of human modes of meaning and existence: it encompassed science, technology, language, and social life in addition to art, religion, and philosophy. This conception of culture and Cassirer's theory of symbolism anticipated much of later cultural theory. In this collection of essays, eminent Cassirer scholars examine the many different aspects of his thinking on this subject and demonstrate how pioneering and important it is to cultural studies.<br>

  Abstract: Cassirer’s philosophy, in the end, is a philosophy of culture. He makes this clear in the title of his book
                  An Essay on Man: An Introduction to a Philosophy of Culture, published a year before his death, which he intended to be a summary of his philosophy of symbolic forms. In a review of this work, Brand Blanshard, while expressing admiration for Cassirer’s great learning, regrets its lack of speculative depth.

  Author(s) ORTH ERNST WOLFGANG<br>
  Abstract: In this essay I will not attempt to give an interpretation of Cassirer’s philosophy, that is, of his philosophy of symbolic forms; rather, by starting with problems and results in Cassirer’s work, I want to thematize our presentday concept of culture and show its role in our general orientation in philosophy. My thesis is that the concept of culture is coming more and more to fulfill a metaphysical function and that in this way the philosophy of culture is being transformed—explicitly or implicitly—into a new

  Author(s) DUPRÉ LOUIS<br>
  Abstract: Ernst Cassirer’s philosophy of culture steered philosophical thought in a new direction. In contrast to both the unmediated unity of being in traditional metaphysics and the epistemic unity of the transcendental subject in modern, critical philosophy, his theory of cultural symbols assumes the object of philosophical reflection to be irreducibly pluralist. His approach raises two fundamental questions. First, is the philosophy of symbolic forms a substitute for metaphysics or does it require a metaphysical foundation to remain consistent with its own principles? Second, how can it discuss contingent matters, such as the historical process of culture, without losing its philosophical<br>

  Author(s) LOFTS STEVE<br>
  Abstract: It is often forgotten that Cassirer’s “critique of culture” entails a “critique of the subject” of culture: for culture exists only insofar as an individual subject actively engages with other subjects in its continual construction and reconstruction. For the most part, however, Cassirer speaks about the subject of culture in the most general and abstract of terms: it is the anonymous force of the “energy of
                  Geist” that constitutes the cultural world. The task of the philosophy of symbolic forms, as a “critique of culture,” as a philosophy of Geist, is to establish the structure of the different forms of<br>

  Abstract: In 2001 I defined Israelite religions as “the varied, symbolic expressions of, and appropriate responses to the deities and powers that groups or communities deliberately affirmed as being of unrestricted value to them within their worldview.”¹ In this definition, I expressed my assumption that religion, like culture in general, is formed, formulated, and expressed through organized groups of people. Both are expressed semiotically and mediated through external realities such as spoken and written language, arts, and ritual. Though some elements of both culture and religion are private and subjective, most are public and objective. In the Ancient Near East, as<br>

  Book Title: The Subject in Crisis in Contemporary Chinese Literature-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Cai Rong<br>
  Abstract: Post-Mao China produced two parallel discourses on the human subject in the New Era (1976–1989). One was an autonomous, Enlightenment humanist self aimed at replacing the revolutionary paragon that had dominated under Mao. The other was a more problematic subject suffering from either a symbolic physical deformity or some kind of spiritual paralysis that undermines its apparent normalcy. How do we explain the stubborn presence, in the literature of the 1980s and 1990s, of this crippled agent who fails to realize the humanist autonomy envisioned by post-Mao theorists? What are the anxieties and tensions embedded in this incongruity and what do they reveal? This illuminating and original critical study of the crippled subject in post-Mao literature offers a detailed textual analysis of the work of five well-known contemporary writers: Han Shaogong, Can Xue, Yu Hua, Mo Yan, and Jia Pingwa. The author investigates not only the literary characters within the texts, but also their creators—real subjects in history, Chinese writers whose own agency was being tested and established in the search for a new subjectivity. She argues that, reenacting the Maoist legacy, the literary search failed to provide a viable model for a postrevolutionary China. In addition, the deficiency and inadequacy of the subject cannot always be contained in the Communist past—a history to be transcended in the design of modernity after Mao. The representation of the problematic subject thus punctured post-Mao optimism and foreshadowed the eventual abandonment of the move to rethink subjectivity in the 1990s. By diving beneath the euphoria of the 1980s and the confusion and frustration of the 1990s, these critical readings offer a unique perspective with which to gauge the complexity of China’s quest for modernity and a fuller understanding of the self’s multifaceted experience in the post-Mao era.<br>

  Abstract: In the preceding two chapters, I concentrated on a number of works published by Han Shaogong and Can Xue in the heyday of the New Era, the mid-1980s. The two writers’ visions of the physically and symbolically deformed being are anything but congruent with the optimism of the age that had invested much of its energies and desires in the recovery of the

The aim may be to keep a safe distance from the shore, but the slow film of low cliffs sliding aft is surely evidence enough of an empirically verifiable boundary between water and land.

A history of journeys, encounters, inclinations, and leaps of faith can be shown to survive in maps and plans once their symbolic character is recognized, and it is these supplementary inscriptions that constitute dark writing. Dark writing alludes to the bodies that go missing in the action of representation. But it does not seek to replace them—to represent them.

This novel is a prime example of the correlation between spatial theory and Caribbean postcolonial discourse and draws into sharper focus a number of questions that I have been raising.

  Book Title: Religion after Religion-Gershom Scholem, Mircea Eliade, and Henry Corbin at Eranos<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wasserstrom Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: By the end of World War II, religion appeared to be on the decline throughout the United States and Europe. Recent world events had cast doubt on the relevance of religious belief, and modernizing trends made religious rituals look out of place. It was in this atmosphere that the careers of Scholem, Eliade, and Corbin--the twentieth century's legendary scholars in the respective fields of Judaism, History of Religions, and Islam--converged and ultimately revolutionized how people thought about religion. Between 1949 and 1978, all three lectured to Carl Jung's famous Eranos circle in Ascona, Switzerland, where each in his own way came to identify the symbolism of mystical experience as a central element of his monotheistic tradition. In this, the first book ever to compare the paths taken by these thinkers, Steven Wasserstrom explores how they overturned traditional approaches to studying religion by de-emphasizing law, ritual, and social history and by extolling the role of myth and mysticism. The most controversial aspect of their theory of religion, Wasserstrom argues, is that it minimized the binding character of moral law associated with monotheism.<br>

  Abstract: The book notes that Aristotle and his followers did not discuss the use of poetic symbolism. Rather, a different group of Greek thinkers--the allegorists--were the first to develop the notion. Struck extensively revisits the work of the great allegorists, which has been underappreciated. He links their interest in symbolism to the importance of divination and magic in ancient times, and he demonstrates how important symbolism became when they thought about religion and philosophy. "They see the whole of great poetic language as deeply figurative," he writes, "with the potential always, even in the most mundane details, to be freighted with hidden messages."<br>

  Abstract: When porphyry refers (repeatedly) to Homer’s cave of the nymphs as a σύμβολου of certain hidden meanings, he is using the term in a sense that appears only in the postclassical period in ancient Greece. The early Greek term meant something quite different—so different, in fact, that we will be forced to wonder just how it developed a literary sense at all. These earliest manifestations of the Greek symbol provide insights into the trajectories the notion later follows. Of course, they do not and cannot be asked to provide some authentic glimpse of the “true” or “real” symbol, as<br>

Writers as diverse as Pausanias, Maximus of Tyre, and Dio Chrysostom show that an allegorical understanding of the ancient tales was simply ready at hand during this period,¹ and several contemporary allegorical tracts survive as well. Cornutus, Heraclitus the Allegorist, and Pseudo-Plutarch (the

It expands from being a narrow term for a contract marker, with specialized senses in Pythagoreanism, the mysteries, and divination, to being an important category of literary commentary. As we have seen, the Stoics and their allegorical followers present the first definitive evidence of this shift, though it was likely in place before them.

The secretive tradition that grew up around the Presocratic philosopher’s legend employed his “symbols,” the short epigrammatic sayings attributed to him, as tokens of true identity and as a kind of catechism in a ritualized ascent to knowledge. They also made comparisons between Pythagoras’s symbols and the efficacious speech used in magical practices. But after the third century c.e., the idea that symbols have the power to

  Book Title: Available Light-Anthropological Reflections on Philosophical Topics<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geertz Clifford<br>
  Abstract: Geertz, who once considered a career in philosophy, begins by explaining how he got swept into the revolutionary movement of symbolic anthropology. At that point, his work began to encompass not only the ethnography of groups in Southeast Asia and North Africa, but also the study of how meaning is made in all cultures--or, to use his phrase, to explore the "frames of meaning" in which people everywhere live out their lives. His philosophical orientation helped him to establish the role of anthropology within broader intellectual circles and led him to address the work of such leading thinkers as Charles Taylor, Thomas Kuhn, William James, and Jerome Bruner. In this volume, Geertz comments on their work as he explores questions in political philosophy, psychology, and religion that have intrigued him throughout his career but that now hold particular relevance in light of postmodernist thinking and multiculturalism.

Furthermore, it appeared surrounded by mystery due to its obscure and occult symbolism, partly derived from magical and Hermetical influences, and partly<br>

  Abstract: The concept of the symbol has appeared often in criticism of music. This is a different kind of symbol from that described by Peirce; for the American semiologist, symbol is opposed to icon and index in a trichotomy of signs. But for the aesthetic idealists, the symbol has a transcendent resonance which gives it a master-function in music and makes it a determinant of moral force and aesthetic value. In this kind of symbol, the relation of signifier and signified is asymmetric; what is signified is a radical idealism, an overcoming of the antinomy of thought and object. The imagination<br>

But so many things are happening in the first few lines of

For this reason, Roy Wagner (1985) writes of “symbols that stand for themselves”; Steven Feld (1982), of “autoreferentiality”; and Nancy Munn (1986), borrowing from Peirce (2.244, 248, 254), of “ qualisigns”—that is, of signs that are mere qualitative possibilities in contradistinction to signs that are actualized and/or generalized.

For better or worse, they function as the most familiar symbols of our collective experience. Wartime propaganda promotes this identification between the individual and society: to enlist is to enlist in history, to participate in a global movement of some kind. The pressure to make such identifications often leads noncombatants to an even livelier grasp of the dynamic at work than that of the veterans themselves. As Henry James<br>

  Abstract: Odysseus may be the hero ʺwho has traveled a great deal . . . see[ing] the cities of men and learn[ing] their minds,ʺ¹ but it is the immobility and fidelity of his wife Penelope that frame his voyage. And it is Penelope who, literally and figuratively, reproduces this masculine journey when, in Fénelonʹs

  Abstract: Border talk is everywhere—literal and figural, material and symbolic. The “cartographies of silence” pioneered by feminists like Adrienne Rich in the 1970s have morphed into the spatial practices of third wave feminism as national boundaries and personal borders become ever more permeable in the face of rapidly changing cultural terrains and global landscapes. Borders have a way of insisting on separation at the same time as they acknowledge connection. Like bridges. Bridges signify the possibility of passing over. They also mark the fact of separation and the distance that has to be crossed. Borders between individuals, genders, groups, and<br>

  Abstract: The necessity of narrative—indeed the hunger for it—evident in these epigraphs resonates with the work of narrative theorists such as Robert Caserio and Peter Brooks, both of whom identify narrative as an essential mode of understanding reality. But curiously, their insistence on narrative is out of tune with the views of a number of poststructuralist theorists such as Roland Barthes, Julia Kristeva, and Hélène Cixous as well as those whom they have influenced. These theorists have variously suggested that what they loosely call “poetry,” the “poetic,” or the “lyric” is the avant-garde of modernity’s disruptions of the symbolic<br>

  Abstract: The systematic study of the manifold relations between narrative (especially fictional) and mathematics (including formal logic) is in its infancy. From my point of view as a student of literary fictional narrative, it would be most useful to map out for further work the areas of interrelations between these two kinds of symbolic discourse. Needless to say, the list of areas I discuss is neither exclusive nor exhaustive but rather a tentative staking out of the terrain, to be modified and improved by further work. I should also mention that my command of literature and literary theory is far superior<br>

  Abstract: It is hard to imagine a world without narrative: In our individual lives as well as in the history of humankind, narratives and storytelling are omnipresent. None of the other modes of symbolic communication “feels” as innately human as the synthetic sequencing of causally related events along a time line. In fact, as the French literary theorist and philosopher Paul Ricoeur argued in his seminal three-volume

  Abstract: One can only be struck by the following paradoxical situation: Maistre and Bonald, figureheads of French counter-revolutionary thought,² are certainly the thinkers who had experienced the most anguish and anger in the face of the destruction of the social bond that the French Revolution, according to them, represented, in which they had seen a veritable catastrophe to the symbolic bond, or, to use their own language, an unprecedented crisis in the religious authority of political power - an authority which, according to them, was the condition of the possibility of society itself.

  Abstract: First a word to signpost our journey. The concept of oceanity refers at once to the direction and to the outcome of the symbolic appropriation of the Australian continent; in this sense, oceanity constitutes a reference point diametrically opposed to the European pole, since it is constructed at the latter’s expense. The concept ends up embracing all the attempts to create an authentic national identity, sometimes known as

  Abstract: The opposition between “surfaces” and “depths” is central to the works of T. S. Eliot. In his readings of turn-of-the-century philosophy, psychology, and ethnology, Eliot encountered this opposition in various forms. Bradley’s immediate experience dovetailed with Jung’s substratum of archetypal symbols and Frazer’s substratum of ritual behavior: all expressed the same distinction between the surface forms of everyday life and the hidden depths that ordinarily elude us. This distinction is evident in the early poetry, where Eliot places highly conventional personae in contexts that evoke a deeper reality of which they are unaware. It is also a feature of the<br>

  Abstract: Certain images spring immediately to mind whenever the scientific reaction to Darwinism is mentioned. For many, Thomas Henry Huxley’s response to Bishop Samuel Wilberforce at the Oxford BAAS meeting in 1860 symbolizes the scientists’ refusal to bow to outside pressure. Huxley’s debate with Richard Owen over man’s relationship to the apes illustrates the clash between the radical and conservative responses within science, as do the efforts of Asa Gray and William Barton Rogers to defend Darwinism against the attacks of Louis Agassiz in the United States.

  Abstract: No one in 1623 would have said that Shakespeare’s work marked and embodied some general change in European self-understanding. We often say so now. Portentous and wistful by turns, our talk about Shakespeare habitually sets him between times, last witness for the old, first prophet of the new, a genius of the divided vision and a symbol of our own life on the margins of tradition. Commonplaces can be false, of course, but the proof of this one is repetition, not only iteration of such judgments about Shakespeare’s place in history, but our constant recurrence to his texts, which have<br>

  Abstract: While the plays that follow the tragedies and conclude Shakespeare’s career seem to belong to a different world from the tragedies, the differences do not eradicate some fundamental social continuities. The romances still observe Renaissance social decorum, bestowing the most serious roles on the social elite and depicting them in greater numbers than their inferiors, in defiance of Jacobean social reality. In contrast to the tragedies, redemptive symbols in the late plays are vindicated, and hard won self-knowledge is cherished by cosmic hope.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvgsp">The Tale of the Tribe</a><br>
  Abstract: Paterson, as J. M. Brinnin rightly observes, has “an all-of-a-piece consistency on an intellectual level, but on an emotive level the poem is vastly uneven.”² Accordingly, much of the critical energy devoted to Williams’ poem has centered on an explication—and implicit celebration—of the work’s “intellectual consistency,” combined with a nervous awareness of how difficult it is to reconcile that reassuring surface coherence with its unstable and shifting bases. Yet, I suspect thatPatersonsucceeds only when it abandons its symbolic structure, when, in place of the eponymous hero and his metaphoric landscape, the text directly confronts the “delirium<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvh3g">Symbol and Truth in Blake's Myth</a><br>
  Abstract: Any attempt to understand what Blake’s poems mean must begin by considering how they mean, for he and his modern interpreters assert that his meanings are fundamentally symbolic and are to be understood in a special way. In the twentieth century symbolism has been intensively studied in a wide range of disciplines, including anthropology, depth psychology, linguistics, and philosophy, not to mention literary criticism (usually drawing on one or more of the above). Blake, by contrast, had no such developed body of theory to work with, although he was of course familiar with the speculations of mythographers and iconographers. In<br>

  TWO  The Truth of Symbols from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvh3g">Symbol and Truth in Blake's Myth</a><br>
  Abstract: Even when we have understood that Blake’s theory of perception is grounded in the Divine Body of Jesus, an unresolved antinomy remains. Are symbols arbitrary and inadequate images from the fallen world that will be superseded in Edenic perception, or are they the very basis of experience and the guarantee of truth? Blake’s answer, ultimately, is that symbols become true by being organized into myth, where they take on conceptual form and are available to imaginative interpretation. But before we consider how his myth works, we need to examine closely the basis of its symbols in a theory of perception.<br>

  Abstract: Thus far we have concentrated on the epistemological and psychological basis of Blake’s symbols. We shall now move toward an examination of the myth in which he organized them, and raise more directly the problem of interpretation in its dual form: Blake’s understanding of his symbols’ meaning, and the various kinds of understanding that modern readers bring to them. I propose to begin by considering some representative modern theories of symbolism, taking care at each point to note essential differences from Blake’s theory, but at the same time establishing perspectives that will help to illuminate the peculiar difficulties of his<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvh3g">Symbol and Truth in Blake's Myth</a><br>
  Abstract: As we have seen, the problem of the divine is ubiquitous in Blake. Jesus is the Divine Body who sustains the life of symbols, the savior who restores the lost unity of the Zoas, and (as in Christian theology in general) the force that binds together the otherwise disjoined elements of a dualistic universe. With these contexts established we can now consider the symbolic and philosophical significance of Blake’s God.<br>

Their approach to scriptural exegesis was often similar. The Fathers’ primary concern was not what Scripture said but what they thought it meant, and sometimes, more precisely, not what Scripture meant but what understanding Scripture meant. The subject of the present chapter is what understanding Scripture means; my title is taken from Todorov’s observation that Augustine changed the Western tradition of symbols<br>

  Book Title: Fabricating History-English Writers on the French Revolution<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Friedman Barton R.<br>
  Abstract: Barton Friedman demonstrates the ways in which English men of letters in the nineteenth century attempted to grasp the dynamics of history and to fashion order, however fragile, out of its apparent chaos. The authors he discusses--Blake, Scott, Hazlitt, Carlyle, Dickens, and Hardy--found in the French Revolution an event more compelling as a paradigm of history than their own "Glorious Revolution." To them the French Revolution seemed universally significant--a microcosm, in short. For these writers maintaining the distinction between "history" and "fiction" was less important than making sense of epochal historical events in symbolic terms. Their works on the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars occupy the boundary between history and fiction, and Fabricating History advances the current lively discussion of that boundary.<br>

  Book Title: Between Muslim and Jew-The Problem of Symbiosis under Early Islam<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): WASSERSTROM STEVEN M.<br>
  Abstract: In Part I, "Trajectories," the author explores early Jewish-Muslim interactions, studying such areas as messianism, professions, authority, and class structure and showing how they were reshaped during the first centuries of Islam. Part II, "Constructions," looks at influences of Judaism on the development of the emerging Shi'ite community. This is tied to the wider issue of how early Muslims conceptualized "the Jew." In Part III, "Intimacies," the author tackles the complex "esoteric symbiosis" between Muslim and Jewish theologies. An investigation of the milieu in which Jews and Muslims interacted sheds new light on their shared religious imaginings. Throughout, Wasserstrom expands on the work of social and political historians to include symbolic and conceptual aspects of interreligious symbiosis. This book will interest scholars of Judaism and Islam, as well as those who are attracted by the larger issues exposed by its methodology.<br>

Seventeenth-century writers, notably Andrew Marvell and Milton, appropriated and, more specifically, feminized Eden to represent the defeat of the nation in terms of the desecration of paradise.¹ The feminized garden is the site of political strife and cultural tensions; its openness and unruliness make it especially susceptible to exploitation.² “

  Abstract: IT IS A HISTORICAL FACT, however strange, that architects often associate architectural creation with “divine” venture. From Plato to Vitruvius, and from Philibert de l’Orme to Le Corbusier, there is a recurrent and symbolic set of images that connects the architect’s role and the intervention of a demiurge. Although for most historians these images are understood as common metaphors, they are rarely recognized as partaking in an overall analogical framework of thoughts. Beyond religious beliefs or dogmatic standpoints, it is this peculiar way of thinking about architecture called “analogical” that I will be exploring in this paper. Numerous analogies can<br>

The Native sharing ethic and "dread of losing face" shaped early French North American cultural ideals through their convergence with provincial French aristocratic ideals of libéralité (generosity) and honneur (bravery), both of which evinced settler reverence.

Understandably, feminist theologians have sought to destabilize the gender rigidity of language about God. And yet feminist rearticulations often bring with them the same discursive rules that are criticized in the use of masculine language. When women’s experience becomes the basis of language for God, feminists risk ascribing a fixed symbol upon the divine name. However, in practices of prayer and contemplation the sheer otherness of God draws us to the limits of language, and causes a blurring of all fixed<br>

The symbolist writer Stéphane Mallarmé (1842–1898) offers a good case for testing approaches to the historiography of fame in nineteenth-century France. Mallarmé can be seen as the prototype of a contemporary “I am not there” model of celebrity. A nobody in full view (photographed by Nadar, the subject of portraiture by Edouard Manet, Edvard Munch, and Paul Gauguin), he demonstrated an idiosyncratic form of media savvy that involves making a name for oneself through self-annexation to an international cast of creative, talented, beautiful people—writers, thinkers, artists,<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qcnmr">Stardom in Postwar France</a><br>
  Author(s) Holmes Diana<br>
  Abstract: The aim of this book is to examine the concept and the practice of stardom in the France of the 1950s and 1960s,¹ a period of French history that saw dramatic economic, social and cultural change. Our premise is that the ‘stars’ of a given historical period or moment capture their era for us in a range of ways: that the preoccupations, values, conflicts and contradictions of a particular culture, its ‘climate of feeling’, are vividly expressed through its celebrities. Stardom may be read as a symbolic portal into the nature of a culture, stars as that culture’s ultimate expression.<br>

  Abstract: I begin this essay with two polemical propositions. First, I oppose the strong separation of material and symbolic that appears to be the parochial inheritance of Cartesianism in social anthropology, and regard it as an intellectual proxy for relegating certain groups of people into past time or primitive status—Fabian’s (1983) “allochronism.” However much some of our colleagues seek to avoid the problem by waggling apostrophe-like fingers every time they use the taboo word “primitive,” they do not avoid the problem by ironizing it or by seeming to bury it in a self-deprecating gesture: it is apparently as hard to<br>

An A* student without any reputation for making trouble, the young man was said to be simply on his way home, traveling through his own neighborhood.

  Book Title: Origins and Ends of the Mind-Philosophical Essays on Psychoanalysis<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Brassier Ray<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis claims that the individual human mind is structured by its childhood relationships with its parents. But the theory of attachment, evolutionary psychology and contemporary philosophy of mind have all recently re-introduced new dimensions of innateness into mental development and pathology. If attachment is an instinct, then what is the psychological status of the child's relation to the mother? If the mind is in part a product of evolution, then how far down do the inhibitory mechanisms of the mind go? If the mind of the child is shaped by their encounter with a set of prohibitions, how, in the light of contemporary 'cognitive science' and philosophy of mind, can the child be conceived as 'taking on' a rule? How is the construction of the mind related to the normative ends of cognitive experience? Today, it is Lacanian psychoanalysis which most vigorously defends psychoanalytic theory and practice from the encroachment of the biological and 'cognitive' sciences. But a paradigm shift nevertheless appears to be underway, in which the classical psychoanalytic theories about the Oedipus complex, primary and secondary repression, sexual difference and psychosexuality, the role of symbols,etc, are being dismantled and reintegrated into a new synthesis of biological and psychological theories. In this collection of theoretical essays by philosophers and psychoanalysts, encounters are brought about between Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis on the one hand, and attachment theory, evolutionary psychology and philosophy of mind on the other.<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 2, I discussed how characters with cognitive and linguistic impairments in modernist fiction served as figures of radical alterity—both dys- and disarticulate—in relation to a modernity characterized as a totalizing social-symbolic system. Alternate, less extreme ways of thinking about language and social organization were available (e.g., James’s pluralism, Bahktin’s and Voloshinov’s analyses of language as a dialogic enactment of multiple social tensions), but we can speculate that the rapid, violent, traumatic character of social change—and, indeed, of many of the significant events of the twentieth century—and the extreme claims made by positivist thinkers in<br>

  Abstract: Recent scholarship on Catalan culture has tended to focus on space, urban geography and memory in relation to place. The city of Barcelona has been the obvious case study, not just because of its international projection, but also because of its position as a site of symbolic struggles with regards to Catalan identity (see Epps, 2004; Johnson, 2006; Resina, 2008a). By virtue of its very title, Ventura Pons’s nineteenth feature film,
                  Barcelona (Un mapa)(2007), would therefore seem to be an ideal object for analysis from this kind of perspective. Indeed, the film’s title appears to point to the centrality<br>

Largely inspired by the 1998 French victory, a number of significant exhibitions and productions have since commemorated the footballer as a national hero and in particular as a standard bearer for immigrant and ethnic identities in France.

Given its techno-political context, is it even conceivable that this well-proven instrument of power may represent something other than male, egocentric will or repressive political or economic forces? Could it be that despite its common origin with instrumental and technological forms of representation, it may nonetheless allow for participatory human action and an affirmation of life-towards-death through symbolization as “presencing” through the constructed work, rather than manifest the very denial of man’s capacity to recognize existential meaning in privileged artifacts such as works of art?

  Abstract: THE PHENOMENON of the massive transplantation of Latin American intellectuals to other areas of the world, particularly to more economically developed countries, that began in the 1970s has generated a varied literature dealing with the problems of transculturation, exile, and the symbolic relationships of the individual with these diverse societies. Due to its specific original matrix of an English domaine belatedly converted into an independent nation state, Canada has a porous way of absorbing ethnic groups of diverse genesis without completely destroying them. At the beginning, some of the typical cultural traits of these groups were retained, but with time,<br>

  Abstract: Herder’s expressivist theory of language marks a distinctive break from the designative view of language held by both rationalists and empiricists in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Put simply, according to the designative view, a word is a sign that ‘stands in for’ by serving as a substitute, or kind of proxy, for the object or idea it represents.¹ It is predicated on the long-held belief in the hierarchical dependence of language on the prior existence of thought, a position known in philosophy as ‘internalism.’ Herder rejects the very possibility of non-symbolic thought and instead develops a view of language<br>

A primary task is to try to understand this country on the basis of what it has been able to tell about itself, through such apparently different events as De Gaulle’s visit, the Montreal police strike, the demonstrations against Bill 63, and many others; this task brings together the symbols of the hopes and dilemmas in which Quebec has been attempting to fix its course over the past decade.<br>

We have got a great deal already if we can find in them the motive to fall back on some elemental intuitions and an opening, one that is as large as possible, on the future. If it is true that the October crisis placed us more distinctly than ever before a drama that is blurring the symbolism of a society, we must use it to throw light on our near future, and in this same way.<br>

  Abstract: In her dealings with form, Kathleen Jamie is on her guard against anything that smacks of prepackaged comfort. Forms seem often to be calculatedly under stress, at an angle to anything conventional, as in the fine sonnet ‘The Cupboard’ from
                  The Tree House(44). In this poem, short lines and an emphatic but unpredictable use of rhyme and off-rhyme keep the poem and reader on their toes, following the twists and turns of a poem that feels its way forward. The ‘cupboard’ is less symbol than wryly presented surrogate for symbolic meaning. Jamie adeptly obeys and departs from the organising<br>

They helped her embrace the precariousness of a cultural expanse, symbolised by the city environment, where the philosopher is one with the archetype of the solitary artist lost in the crowd, where thinking and writing are experienced as a pressure coming from the outside: ‘I write what I can: that is, what’s given to me and what seems worth writing, by me’ (‘Singleness’ 259)<br>

  Abstract: In Chapter 14, ‘Photography and Poststructuralism: the Indexical and Iconic Sign System’, Edge reflects on how the pecularity of the photographic sign sytem, and the study of photography generally, have been informed by poststructuralist thought in two important respects: one approach is concerned with the unique structure of the photograph, its indexicality; the other with the discursive effect of specific photographs in different locations – the iconic/symbolic element of the photograph. Drawing on the work of Kristeva, as well as an original case study on very early Victorian photography, Edge offers some fresh and very interesting insights on the indexical<br>

  Author(s) Wilson Christopher R.<br>
  Abstract: This essay examines the relationship between the music and songs of Shakespeare’s plays and early modern music and musical practice. Music for Shakespeare meant performed songs and instrumental cues, and musical terms used as symbolic reference and metaphor. Very little music survives that can be identified with a first or early production but dramatic context and descriptors usually provide sufficient information on the type of music required. In

In the largely symbolic fairy tale Time in a Red Coat, the seafaring adventure story Vinland and the elegiac Beside the Ocean of Time, Brown examines the idea of community as myth, as historical reality and as fiction itself.

  Abstract: When Bruce Chatwin published an account of a journey to a part of the world which had come to symbolise, in the Western cultural imagination, the distance to which ‘one travels no more’, it appeared as both novelty and relic, at once literary newfoundland and lost world regained. As its premise was the mythically resonant, marvellously unlikely quest for a replacement for a scrap of Giant Sloth skin which the traveller had gazed upon in wonder as a child in his grandmother’s cabinet of curiosities, believing it to be a ‘piece of brontosaurus’, and which had been discarded after her<br>

  Abstract: A reading of a Henry James story in an issue on French symbolism may seem an odd juxtaposition.¹ Certain thematic links are, of course, possible: although James wrote very little on authors whom one could count among the French symbolists, he did write a great deal on what has been called “symbolism” in the American literary tradition (a tradition in which his own work takes a place).² But the possibility of such loose linking already points up a certain symptomatic instability in the very term symbolism itself. That is, the term symbolism would want to serve as a convenient label<br>

  Abstract: Leviathan, a sea monster symbolizing evil in the Old Testament and in Christian literature generally,¹ was the figure famously chosen by Thomas Hobbes to symbolize the State. Still under Hobbes’s influence, we might today—perhaps in a fitful, nightmarish sleep—conjure up similar images of law as a frightening, bloodthirsty beast, but with this difference: the modern Leviathan would be as intent on concealing its bloodletting activities, on covering its bloody tracks, as on slaking its deadly thirst.

  Abstract: The symbolic representation of collective identity—an essential communicative element of nationalism—invariably involves the strategic deployment of narratives. An archetypical example in this regard is the creation and transmission of master commemorative narratives. In the nexus of Chinese domestic politics and foreign relations, such historical accounts are central to the internal and external legitimation of the nondemocratic state. By bestowing determined meanings upon the past, which is causally related to the present and future of the Chinese nation-state, this sort of strategic narrative defines the identity role of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in China’s sociopolitical development and projects<br>

  Abstract: Posing questions about justice and inequality in the realm of mental health services opens up two very different lines of analysis. A long tradition of social epidemiology demonstrates the disproportionate burden of mental illness associated with poverty, migration, and membership in stigmatized ethnic and racial groups (Ngui et al. 2013; Kessler et al. 2012; Martins et al. 2012).¹ This approach begins with objective epidemiological data and then launches a normative argument about the psychiatric sequelae of social injustice.

  Book Title: The Minor Intimacies of Race-Asian Publics in North America<br>
  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Daniels Roger<br>
  Abstract: An attempt to put an Asian woman on Canada's $100 bill in 2012 unleashed enormous controversy. The racism and xenophobia that answered this symbolic move toward inclusiveness revealed the nation's trumpeted commitment to multiculturalism as a lie. It also showed how multiple minor publics as well as the dominant public responded to the ongoing issue of race in Canada. In this new study, Christine Kim delves into the ways cultural conversations minimize race's relevance even as violent expressions and structural forms of racism continue to occur. Kim turns to literary texts, artistic works, and media debates to highlight the struggles of minor publics with social intimacy. Her insightful engagement with everyday conversations as well as artistic expressions that invoke the figure of the Asian allows Kim to reveal the affective dimensions of racialized publics. It also extends ongoing critical conversations within Asian Canadian and Asian American studies about Orientalism, diasporic memory, racialized citizenship, and migration and human rights. An original reconsideration of foundational concerns, The Minor Intimacies of Race focuses on the ephemeral and the nuanced to reveal the social hierarchies and power structures inherent in today's North America.<br>

  Abstract: An estimated ten thousand people gathered at the state house grounds in Columbia, South Carolina, on the morning of July 10, 2015. They gathered with anticipation; they gathered despite record heat. At 10:00 a.m. “the flag” would be—swiftly and with little ceremony—lowered and transported to the Confederate Museum located a mile away. Some dozens might have been there supporting the flag; the vast majority, black and white together, were there to witness a historic event, to symbolically turn from a divisive past toward a future whose hallmarks might be justice, social equity, and mutual respect among citizens.

  Abstract: The erection of monuments and memorials—along with the choreographed ceremonies of commemoration centered on them and the orchestration of public participation around them—transforms particular places into ideologically charged sites of collective memory. Monuments and memorials are powerful mnemonic devices through which the custodians of collective memory seek to encode particular histories and geographies into landscapes of power and resistance. They provide rallying points for shared memories and common identities. They are material signifiers of ideas, transmitters of sentiments, and repositories of ideologies that their permanent affixture to public space intends to immortalize.

  Abstract: However we judge the past or the future, our judgment will be haunted, marked by the seal of war in the twentieth century. The memory of war intervenes inescapably in the relations among states, whether bringing them together or driving them apart. It gives rise, year after year, at predetermined dates and in predetermined places, to appeals for forgiveness, symbolic gestures of reconciliation, just as, here and there, it is used to recall unpaid debts and persistent misapprehensions, as well as absolutions that wait enduringly upon unuttered pleas for forgiveness.

His ability to interpret symbolically the language of longitude and latitude enabled him by ‘looking at the survey map’ to select a piece of land. But this limited blankness was still a potential place. It was not possessed at once simply by thinking of it. The subject of hearsay, rumour and doubt, it harboured a multitude of possibilities.

Soon after, some expressed regret for not having done enough for the Emperor.¹ However, many others were elated at the news of the end of war and “hastened to remove the blackout paper from their windows, letting light back into their lives.”² Although peace came at a high price—with territorial, material, symbolic, and emotional losses—it was a welcome change for the Japanese population, which now had the chance to reflect on<br>

  Abstract: Many open questions remain. In these concluding remarks, I want to take up an issue that, although frequently mentioned throughout the text, merits further discussion. The issue is that in addition to cultural and symbolic considerations, it is important to incorporate the analysis of institutions and the issues related to the democratic construction of citizenship. These issues are significant for an academic perspective; they are crucial and central for a book that wants to contribute to civic responsibility and action orientations.<br>

  Abstract: The contributors to Monster Theory consider beasts, demons, freaks and fiends as symbolic expressions of cultural unease that pervade a society and shape its collective behavior. Through a historical sampling of monsters, these essays argue that our fascination for the monstrous testifies to our continued desire to explore difference and prohibition.

  Abstract: Designing architecture is a unique epistemological practice, a unique way of knowing resulting from a complex process of conceptual negotiations. Architects not only solve technical problems and create aesthetic objects but facilitate a process in which visions of a building acquire a particular symbolic or cultural sense. While working on a project, a designer must develop multiple architectural proposals, understand the complexity of issues they manifest, and negotiate them with the parties involved in the project—clients, local authorities, planners, consultants, contractors, bankers, and many others. A designer produces these versions in order to understand what kind of a design<br>

National unification was consummated with the armed conquest of the last Islamic bastion in Iberian lands, the kingdom of Granada, and the expulsion by decree of the Jews. The territorial expansion that would lead to the annexation of the earldoms of Rosellón and Cerdaña (1493), the occupation of the kingdom of Naples (1503), the conquests of Melilla (1497) and Orán (1509), and other<br>

These relations link us to our pasts but also to the classes in which others place us—to ideas about youth and adulthood, men and women, parents and children. Richard Flynn writes that Jarrell “fused his theory of child development with a theory of poetic development” (

  Book Title: Neopoetics-The Evolution of the Literate Imagination<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Collins Christopher<br>
  Abstract: The quest to understand the evolution of the literary mind has become a fertile field of inquiry and speculation for scholars across literary studies and cognitive science. In
      Paleopoetics, Christopher Collins's acclaimed earlier title, he described how language emerged both as a communicative tool and as a means of fashioning other communicative tools-stories, songs, and rituals. InNeopoetics, Collins turns his attention to the cognitive evolution of the writing-ready brain. Further integrating neuroscience into the popular field of cognitive poetics, he adds empirical depth to our study of literary texts and verbal imagination and offers a whole new way to look at reading, writing, and creative expression. Collins beginsNeopoeticswith the early use of visual signs, first as reminders of narrative episodes and then as conventional symbols representing actual speech sounds. Next he examines the implications of written texts for the play of the auditory and visual imagination. To exemplify this long transition from oral to literate artistry, Collins examines a wide array of classical texts-from Homer and Hesiod to Plato and Aristotle and from the lyric innovations of Augustan Rome to the inner dialogues of St. Augustine. In this work of "big history," Collins demonstrates how biological and cultural evolution collaborated to shape both literature and the brain we use to read it.<br>

  Abstract: The ability to transmit symbolic signs through gestures and, later, vocal sounds eventually evolved into fully grammatical language. But as the language-ready brain was millions of years in the making, so it took perhaps as long as 200,000 years for oral cultures in separate locations, e.g., Mesopotamia, the Nile and Indus valleys, northern China, and Mesoamerica, to have the institutions in place to support the production and storage of written records. It then took millennia more before writing expanded from administrative recordkeeping to historiography, philosophy, natural science, and what we now generally mean by “literature.” All the while, writing remained<br>

  Abstract: Claude Lefort’s essay “Permanence of the Theologico-Political?” in answering the question as to why political philosophers in the modern era make recourse to theological language, suggests that democracy makes possible the identifiable sphere of the political as such through the very appearance of an empty place of sovereignty. As Lefort puts it, “The formula ‘power belongs to no one’ can also be translated into the formula ‘power belongs to none of us.’”¹ This itself generates the need for a symbolic register, a vacuum into which the religious enters, not necessarily as the guarantor of power itself but as a marker<br>

  Abstract: Historians correctly warn their political scientist friends against the danger of an overly present-centered reading of the stakes of politics. For example, the issues roiling French politics must be understood within the symbolic framework inaugurated by the rupture begun in 1789. Seemingly unrelated actions, whose motivation seems to depend only on simple self-interest, may acquire a meaning that their authors have not consciously intended. Similarly, German politics is framed by the symbolic context created by both Frederick the Great’s early legal codification of the Allgemeines Landgesetz and by the failure of the 1848 revolution to institute a liberal parliamentary regime<br>

  Abstract: This chapter investigates how the category of “religion” was transferred from the first ethnographic reports of the Sikhs in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, to the cultural, theoretical, and political projects of the Sikh elites in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, giving rise over a period of about fifty years (1870s to the 1920s) to the ontotheological underpinnings of the modern Sikh imaginary. Such a transformation was enabled by the imposition of a dominant symbolic order on the indigenous cultures, followed by the appropriation of this symbolic order by the native elites.

  Book Title: The Awakened Ones-Phenomenology of Visionary Experience<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Obeyesekere Gananath<br>
  Abstract: Throughout his career, Obeyesekere has combined psychoanalysis and anthropology to illuminate the relationship between personal symbolism and religious experience. In this book, he begins with Buddha's visionary trances wherein, over the course of four hours, he witnesses hundreds of thousands of his past births and eons of world evolution, renewal, and disappearance. He then connects this fracturing of empirical and visionary time to the realm of space, considering the experience of a female Christian penitent, who stares devotedly at a tiny crucifix only to see the space around it expand to mirror Christ's suffering. Obeyesekere follows the unconscious motivations underlying rapture, the fantastical consumption of Christ's body and blood, and body mutilation and levitation, bridging medieval Catholicism and the movements of early modern thought as reflected in William Blake's artistic visions and poetic dreams. He develops the term "dream-ego" through a discussion of visionary journeys, Carl Jung's and Sigmund Freud's scientific dreaming, and the cosmic and erotic dream-visions of New Age virtuosos, and he defines the parameters of a visionary mode of knowledge that provides a more elastic understanding of truth. A career-culminating work, this volume translates the epistemology of Hindu and Buddhist thinkers for western audiences while revitalizing western philosophical and scientific inquiry.<br>

This contemporary philosophy is characterized by what we can call its “antispeculative” habitus, a habitus that is entirely structured around a critique of classical metaphysics, generally characterized as a symbol of the hubris of a human thought that desires to subjugate the entirety of what there is under its almighty power.

Volume 1 ofChinese History and Cultureexplores how theDaowas reformulated, expanded, defended, and preserved by Chinese intellectuals up to the seventeenth century, guiding them through history's darkest turns. Essays incorporate the evolving conception of the soul and the afterlife in pre- and post-Buddhist China, the significance of eating practices and social etiquette, the move toward greater individualism, the rise of the Neo-Daoist movement, the spread of Confucian ethics, and the growth of merchant culture and capitalism.

  Abstract: From Ying-shih Yü's perspective, the
      Dao, or the Way, constitutes the inner core of Chinese civilization. His work explores the unique dynamics between Chinese intellectuals' discourse on theDao, or moral principles for a symbolized ideal world order, and their criticism of contemporary reality throughout Chinese history. Volume 2 ofChinese History and Culturecompletes Ying-shih Yü's systematic reconstruction and exploration of Chinese thought over two millennia and its impact on Chinese identity. Essays address the rise of Qing Confucianism, the development of the Dai Zhen and Zhu Xi traditions, and the response of the historian Zhang Xuecheng to the Dai Zhen approach. They take stock of the thematic importance of Cao Xueqin's eighteenth-century masterpieceHonglou meng(Dream of the Red Chamber) and the influence of Sun Yat-sen'sThree Principles of the People, as well as the radicalization of China in the twentieth century and the fundamental upheavals of modernization and revolution. Ying-shih Yü also discusses the decline of elite culture in modern China, the relationships among democracy, human rights, and Confucianism, and changing conceptions of national history. He reflects on the Chinese approach to history in general and the larger political and cultural function of chronological biographies. By situating China's modern encounter with the West in a wider historical frame, this second volume ofChinese History and Cultureclarifies its more curious turns and contemplates the importance of a renewed interest in the traditional Chinese values recognizing common humanity and human dignity.<br>

His fortunes were intimately linked with the fate of his site: his capture or sacrifice, admittedly the probable result of military or economic misfortunes, was the symbolic collapse of what Stephen Houston and others have termed “moral authority.”²<br>

The former was an avantgardist known for light, cool, geometricized structures that explored the limits of modernist tropes of abstraction, technology, and space. The latter created exuberant, allusive, symbolically charged monuments, often rustically hand-carved out of stone, which evoked a distant history rather than projecting the visions of a brave future.

  Abstract: It bears repeating: 
                  Mnemosyne is largely divorced from iconology as practiced by Warburg’s chief successors, who turn rather to his earlier work for their methodological inspiration.¹ Briefly put, iconology aims to explicate the significance of an individual artwork through the interpretation of the symbolic values attached to compositional or iconographic features. To decipher these contingent features, imbricated as they are in a medieval or humanist culture long since past, great erudition is usually demanded. Yet to grasp next the meaning of the work’s symbolic values, interpretation becomes mostly an intuitive act. This is because iconology tends to regard the individual<br>

  Abstract: The Fontenelle text from which I have just quoted implies a distinction, germane to our typology of metaphor histories, which confronts us with a final ‘transitional’ phenomenon, that of 
                  metaphorics and symbolism. Here we must be wary of formulating all too subtle definitions, tailored to the specifications of some system or other, that risk narrowing the basis of fulfilling intuitions in advance. The concept of symbol, richly shaded by its application to everything from aesthetics to formal logic (at the very least!), has already done much to obscure the expressive phenomena it was called on to illuminate.

  Abstract: The birth of the total work of art from the spirit of revolution cannot be separated from the fundamental break in the function, purpose, and meaning of art brought to consciousness by the French Revolution. The will to create a new civil religion that directly challenged the hegemony of the Catholic Church found practical and symbolic expression in the expropriation and secularization of church property. The remodeling of Sainte-Geneviève in Paris into the Pantheon of the heroes of the Revolution went together with confiscation and collection of church treasures destined to form the core of the national patrimony.

  Abstract: In his memorable parable of the downfall of art since the spiritual synthesis of the Gothic cathedral, Adolf Behne captures the sense of loss that haunts modern art (see chapter 7). He charts the spirit’s descent from collective creation to the individual artwork as a progressive materialization that finally imprisons art in the picture frame, apt symbol of the framing of art as aesthetic object and valuable commodity. The frame, with its separating and isolating function, appears as the antithesis of the lost unity of the arts—the recurrent reminder that the commercialization of production and the privatization of reception<br>

  Book Title: Aesthetic Vision and German Romanticism-Writing Images<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Prager Brad<br>
  Abstract: The work of the groundbreaking writers and artists of German Romanticism -- including the writers Tieck, Brentano, and Eichendorff and the artists Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge -- followed from the philosophical arguments of the German Idealists, who placed emphasis on exploring the subjective space of the imagination. The Romantic perspective was a form of engagement with Idealist discourses, especially Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and Fichte's Science of Knowledge. Through an aggressive, speculative reading of Kant, the Romantics abandoned the binary distinction between the palpable outer world and the ungraspable space of the mind's eye and were therefore compelled to develop new terms for understanding the distinction between "internal" and "external." In this light, Brad Prager urges a reassessment of some of Romanticism's major oppositional tropes, contending that binaries such as "self and other," "symbol and allegory," and "light and dark," should be understood as alternatives to Lessing's distinction between interior and exterior worlds. Prager thus crosses the boundaries between philosophy, literature, and art history to explore German Romantic writing about visual experience, examining the interplay of text and image in the formulation of Romantic epistemology. Brad Prager is Associate Professor of German at the University of Missouri, Columbia.<br>

  Abstract: It was Pierre Bourdieu who first showed us that it is unnatural to visit the museum when its symbols seem distant from our personal sense of place. He brought to light issues of exclusion that require museums to close the gap between themselves and a public distanced and disengaged by their position in social space (Bourdieu 1977; 1984; 1989). The influence of Bourdieu’s sociology, albeit updated and adapted, is traceable in the various approaches many museums adopt to overcome cultural barriers in their public perception and community engagement (Merriman 1991; Fyfe 2006; Prior 2005; Barrett 2011).

  Abstract: In this chapter, I concentrate on how the symbolic manifestation of territoriality is used to structure other manifestations. I describe this symbolic manifestation as
                     discursive territoriality, one in which the media become resources “through which power is exercised to produce—or disrupt—systemic regularity.”¹ Discursive territoriality is a dimension of spatial politics, one in which the material and emotional dimensions of space are harnessed in the narratives and discourses of power, which then align particular people firmly, and sometimes also exclusively, to particular territories and privilege their claims to the material benefits of—and emotional attachment to—such spaces.<br>

  Book Title: The Faustian Century-German Literature and Culture in the Age of Luther and Faustus<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Weeks Andrew<br>
  Abstract: The Reformation and Renaissance, though segregated into distinct disciplines today, interacted and clashed intimately in Faust, the great figure that attained European prominence in the anonymous 1587 'Historia von D. Johann Fausten'. The original Faust behind Goethe's great drama embodies a remote culture. In his century, Faust evolved from an obscure cipher to a universal symbol. The age explored here as "the Faustian century" invested the 'Faustbuch' and its theme with a symbolic significance still of exceptional relevance today. The new essays in this volume complement one another, providing insights into the tensions and forces that gave the century its distinct character. Several essays seek Faust's prototypes. Others elaborate the symbolic function of his figure and discern the resonance of his tale in conflicting allegiances. This volume focuses on the intersection of historical accounts and literary imaginings, on shared aspects of the work and its times, on concerns with obedience and transgression, obsessions with the devil and curiosity about magic, and quandaries created by shifting religious and worldly authorities.

  Author(s) Watson Sethina<br>
  Abstract: During the course of one desperate night in March 1190, an estimated 150 Jewish men, women and children committed suicide or were murdered at the royal castle in York, where they had fled for safety. The York massacre horrified contemporaries, Christians and Jews, and is remembered today around the world. It is recalled in Jewish elegies and holds a singular, sad place in the English national story as ʹthe most notorious anti-Jewish atrocityʹ in its history.¹ Most particularly, the memory is tied to place. Cliffordʹs Tower, the mid-thirteenth-century stone keep of the royal castle, has become its most enduring symbol.²<br>

  Abstract: Jews are confined to the periphery in twelfth- and thirteenth-century literature. When they do appear within Christian texts, their actions and behaviour are restricted and circumscribed. Viewed as living symbols of Christʹs suffering on the cross, and as actors within the wider Christian drama, their performance was interpreted through the Churchʹs teachings. Within a literary context, as Stephen Kruger has argued, ʹJews and Judaism can be quite easily rendered ʺvirtual,ʺ reduced to a non-presence, even a non-being that functions to reconfirm a real, present Christianityʹ.¹ In this way, representations of Jews were used to define the nature of Christianity, and<br>

  Abstract: The concept of redundancy employed in this essay is the one used in mathematics and linguistics to designate symbols that do not add information to a sequence. One of the hazards of teaching twentieth-century war literature is the tacit inference of redundancy by readers, namely that the representational conventions as well as the facts and values represented are ‘predictable from … context’.

The exploratory nature of Plato’s writings, as well as their apparent inconsistencies, are well documented.¹ His contradictory attitude, for instance, to poetry’s relationship to the polity has not only dogged disciplinary discourse in terms of a centuries-long quarrel between philosophy and literature, but has also given rise to a provocative paradigm that connects order within the self to the construction of a utopian state. Individual selfhood is symbolically politicised in this process, while the construction<br>

  Abstract: Over the last few decades, the concepts of “gender,” “identity,” and “narrative” have received growing attention in nearly every field of academic study. Gender has become an important analytical tool in many disciplines because of the insight it gives into the cultural orders underlying representations. Theories of subjectivity have illustrated that identity is not something we achieve and possess but something individuals must consistently reestablish in various social contexts and through a number of symbolic practices. One such symbolic practice is narrative. Through a coherent structure, and by drawing on familiar forms, narrative both constitutes and naturalizes concepts at the<br>

  Book Title: Bones of Contention-The living archive of Vasil Levski and the making of Bulgaria's national hero<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Todorova Maria<br>
  Abstract: This book is about documenting and analyzing the living archive around the figure of Vasil Levski (1837–1873), arguably the major and only uncontested hero of the Bulgarian national pantheon. The processes described, although with a chronological depth of almost two centuries, are still very much in the making, and the living archive expands not only in size but constantly adding surprising new forms. The monograph is a historical study, taking as its narrative focus the life, death and posthumous fate of Levski. By exploring the vicissitudes of his heroicization, glorification, appropriations, reinterpretation, commemoration and, finally, canonization, it seeks to engage in several broad theoretical debates, and provide the basis for subsequent regional comparative research. The analysis of Levski's consecutive and simultaneous appropriations by different social platforms, political parties, secular and religious institutions, ideologies, professional groups, and individuals, demonstrates how boundaries within the framework of the nation are negotiated around accepted national symbols.<br>

By the 1990s it had completely collapsed and this is probably the most salient explanation why the redressive machinery did not “fix” the problem. What the BAN debates did demonstrate, however, is that “it is in the redressive phase that both pragmatic techniques and symbolic action reach their fullest expression.”

The assertion that Botev and Levski were pitched against each other already in this period, and that after 1944 the communists had elevated Botev as their exclusive symbol at the expense of Levski who was allegedly largely forgotten, was a later hyperbolic interpolation, dating from the 1970s and especially the<br>

Journal Title: Ethics<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: et.2001.112.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 2001<br>
Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Doctrine and method, theory and interpretation are not necessarily coordinate. Were such coordination possible, a metacritical stance would be required. By accepting uncritically the presuppositions that lie behind psychoanalytic metapsychology, Juillerat abrogates, in my view, ethnological responsibility, that is, the responsibility to measure in a receptive manner the presuppositions of ones hermeneutic against those of the culture one is studying. Though his attention to ethnographic detail leads Juillerat to refine psychoanalytic doctrine, it confirms the epistemological and hermeneutic assumptions of that doctrine (e.g., notions of the unconscious, id, ego, and superego, drives, repression, and, indeed, psychic space). Yafar myth and ritual as he presents them become allegories of that doctrineallegories, I would argue, of allegories. There would appear to be no escape, were it not for the Yafar voices that sound through Juillerats psychoanalytically predetermined presentations. (He offers us almost no contextualized verbatim texts in these essays, though he does in his monographs.) They remind us that, as LviStrauss demonstrated, myths are readily translated one into another, particularly when they are decontextualized. What is of ethnographic, indeed, psychoanalytic import is howand perhaps whytranslation is arrested and a particular myth (e.g., the Oedipal tale) becomes so authoritative that it has the power of promiscuous reduction. Though fascinated by the range of Yafar cultural expression, Juillerat fails to consider the implications of Yafars refusal to reduce their corpus of mythology and ritual to a single mytha singular ritual.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”
            Theological Studies47 (1986): 44–45.<br>

Abstract: Scholars and their students interested in the field would do well to begin with these studies, despite some unevenness in period, place, and theme. Developments in the twentieth century, for example, are not well served, especially as their globalization bursts all traditional boundaries in the discipline, making a historical perspective essential to an understanding of ongoing transformations in literate life everywhere, not just in the West. Similarly, the absence of illustrations undermines the potential value of these books as introductions to the history of reading. Much of the work here depends on the material objects that readers actually had; without images of them, the reader develops less of a sense of the field. Finally, the exclusion of the essays on correspondence from the original collection is deeply regrettable; Chartier’s summary of their implications in the introduction hardly does justice to them, especially to the important study of the 1847 postal survey by Dauphin and two other colleagues. The translations are generally accurate, but the indexes are barely adequate.<br>

By valuing the processes and articulating this with better abstractions more congruent with our action, we not only further our own project; we also sustain a vital engagement with the projects of individuals. We more clearly articulate the library in the life of the user, to use the words of Wiegand [

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question about the extent to which novels can be understood as “evidence” in any sense at all, or whether Kern should be focusing on trial reports rather than their fictionalized representations. This difficulty would be obviated if the focus of the work were an understanding of the impact of developments in scientific theory on narrative form, yet Kern seems reluctant to move fully in this direction. And indeed, if the ideal reader ofA Cultural History of Causalityis in fact a literary critic, he or she may be inclined to probe a number of Kern’s other assumptions as well—he is perhaps a little too inclined to assert that the Victorian novel is artistically “tidy,” that its patterns of closure are always neat and carefully wrought, as an expression of what Thomas Vargish has called “the providential aesthetic” in his study of the same name (Virginia, 1985). Scholars of nineteenth‐century fiction may perhaps feel that Kern’s descriptions of such neat closures sit uncomfortably with their readings ofBleak House(which is as much about the loss and destruction of evidence as it is about its recovery and careful explication) orOur Mutual FriendorDaniel DerondaorThe Brothers Karamazov(each of which problematizes our sense of a character’s relentless movement toward transgression, judgment, and punishment or acquittal). One is left with a sense that Kern occasionally deploys the term “Victorian” in a rather unsophisticated fashion: as Thomas has shown inDetective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science,even the most carefully crafted detective story of the nineteenth century can raise for readers and critics crucial questions about individual and national identity and the power of public surveillance. Yet these criticisms should not undermine a reader’s sense of Kern’s achievement in this book: it is a vast, ambitious attempt to effect a synthesis of scientific thought and literary experimentation, and on the whole it succeeds well.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau. For reading the current essay, my particular thanks to Catherine Desbarats, Eric Jabbari, James Ron, and Michael Wasser, as well as to Tim Rowse, Desley Deacon, Ann Curthoys, and John Docker for helpful suggestions. I am of course solely responsible for the content. The research for this essay was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. 1 Jean Comaroff and John L.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M.

The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86.

This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76. On Tswana views of the firearms frontier, see Robert Moffat to Richard Miles, Lattakoo [Kuruman], December 5, 1827, in Isaac Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman: Being the Journals and Letters of Robert and Mary Moffat, 1820-1828 (London, 1951), 274. Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another. On Cape influence, see also Johannes du Bruyn, "James Read en die Thlaping, 1816-1820," Historia 35 (1990). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 448 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh a series of rather peripheral white missionaries. Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work. Taylor is of course a Christian Hegelian, whose view of the emergence of the modern self is certainly influenced by Hegelian dialectics, in however inexplicit a fashion.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: Franke’s book has considerable merit, but I have a theoretical and a practical concern with his appropriation of negative theology. First, negative theology is never entirely negative, and while Franke recognizes that poetic language is both deconstructive and open, he nevertheless insists that our various theologies—literary or religious—finally have no positive content. Perhaps this is the postmodernism in his negative theology because this is not entirely consistent with the theological tradition. A good counterexample is Pseudo‐Dionysius, whose mystical theology seeks finally to overcome the limitations of both positive and negative speaking. Dionysius insists that God is love in a way that is both negative and positive. On this, Franke should consider the work of Jean‐Luc Marion and especially his response to Jacques Derrida on the subject of negative theology, and this omission is a considerable oversight. Second, many people of various faiths will never accept that their understanding of the transcendent has no positive content, and if this is a precondition for dialogue, then it is unlikely to occur. On this, the practical dimension of Franke’s study needs more development, as well as more traditional examples of poetic and theological openness from contemporary religious life.<br>

Abstract: The Captivity of Innocencesuccessfully concludes an innovative study of primeval myth in J’s Genesis. Its argument about exilic authorship serves as a springboard for a free and erudite exploration of biblical concerns with name, exile, and the paradoxes of divine-human relations. Very few biblical scholars today can compass this range of biblical, literary, and philosophical literature with such finesse. At a time when biblical studies incorporate a wider range of methods than ever, LaCocque, like Roland Barthes (whom he cites), powerfully combines traditional and more contemporary intellectual paradigms. Advanced students and scholars will find inThe Captivity of Innocencea far-reaching and engaging reading of Genesis 11 by a virtuoso of biblical studies.<br>

Abstract: The cultural and social sciences are welcome to examine and critique theology and Christian practice, and theology can profitably learn from these studies, but the studies themselves are not theology. To be theology, even in an interdisciplinary sense, the work must become constructive and speak to the
   religiousthought and practice of specific communities or faith traditions. In any given community, theology can become a displaced language in need of renewal, but theology can also uncover the displaced or implicit religion within the seemingly secular. To do this well, theology must remain in critical tension with the cultural sciences, including literature. The result may well be deconstructive, but such radical critique is necessary for any living tradition.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: Both
      Faith and PhilosophyandEric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmodernsilluminate and challenge the assumptions in Voegelin's philosophy and lead readers in new directions for Voegelinian scholarship. They are indispensable readings for students of political philosophy in their examination of transcendence, philosophy, and politics. By seeing Voegelin as a postmodern thinker and by showing his exchange with Strauss, both of these books provide us with a broader context to understand Voegelin's political philosophy. As part of the University of Missouri Press' new series, bothFaith and PhilosophyandEric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmodernsprovide intellectually provocative and serious-minded secondary works on Eric Voegelin and his ultimate place in political philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Abstract:This essay argues that in 1 Thessalonians, Paul uses eschatological discourse—language about the end of hme—in order to evoke a symbolic world-view in which his readers become God's elect, living at the end of time and awaiting the sudden, imminent retum of Christ from heaven. This self-identification explains their present misfortunes, while at the sam.e time demanding that they fulfill the ethical and moral demands of the Christian faith. More broadly, this essay points to the role that eschatological discourse played within early Christianity in general, suggesting that it formed a central, paradigmatic drama which helped to define ontological and teleological reality for the movement's adherents.<br>

Abstract: Many sociologists have tried in vain to find the “true” meaning of the classic works in the discipline. An interactionist perspective suggests that this search is not a valid one for sociologists, especially symbolic interactionists. Although there can be no “true” meaning, some authors use conventions of writing that make their work more
         orless clear. Using Mead'sMind, Self and Societyas an example, we discuss the dimensions of clarity. We then argue that the sociological classics should be read to (I) simulate new theories and research (pragmatic analysis), (2) determine how sociologists have used that classic to support or refute particular theories or perspectives (rhetorical analysis), and (3) provide information about the sociological concerns of the author and his/her contemporaries (historical analysis).<br>

Abstract: The article starts with a metaphoric and rhetorical use of the dream concept and then deals with collective dreams. Borrowing ideas from Freud, Durkheim, and Levi-Strauss, concepts are developed to describe collective dreams, for example, the American Dream. I demonstrate that binary oppositions, such as Durkheim's “sacred versus profane” distinction, structure collective dreams. Different forms of symbolic operation are described.<br>

Abstract: This article combines a narrative approach on life histories, inspired by Paul Ricoeur, with the symbolic interactionist approaches of George Herbert Mead and Erving Goffman. It focuses on "negotiations" in qualitative interviews with alcoholics, that is, narrative sequences in which the interviewee's line comes into conflict with the line of the interviewer. From a larger study of drinking careers among alcoholics in Copenhagen, two interviews are singled out for a more detailed analysis. The two interviewees did not live up to the (implicit) expectations of the study: the presumptions (a) that persons contacted at institutions for heavily addicted alcoholics do indeed identify themselves as alcoholics and (b) that alcoholics are interested in structuring their life histories according to the development of their drinking problems. By struggling to defend an alternative identity for themselves than the one the interviewer had in readiness for them, the interviewees laid bare the (problematic) therapeutic framework of the study.<br>

Abstract: In this cranky and arrogant chapter I consider several aspects of my use of symbolic interactionist perspectives on my research and thinking. The following are the elements of the chapter: (1) the historical context of my initial encounter with symbolic interactionism (SI); (2) my interpretation of key ideas of SI; (3) its relation to specific research of mine; (4) the relation of other perspectives to my research; and (5) some critiques of SI. I conclude with a truncated discussion of my dissatisfaction with the overtheorizing and overscientizing of sociology. Seeking balance, I end with predictions of a grand and glorious future.<br>

Abstract: Prior research suggests that illness disrupts biographical self because of the resulting difficulty in continuing to draw on the same material and symbolic resources used in self-construction. Recent literature suggests that constructing continuity is possible because of the multifaceted nature of self-construction. One hundred and twenty-two veterans who had been hospitalized after an acute stroke and discharged home were enrolled in the study. In-depth interviews were collected from the veterans at one month post-stroke. Results indicate that some of these individuals construct continuity through their use of personally accessible discursive resources such as expectations for aging and religious beliefs.<br>

Abstract: This paper follows two purposes: the first to unpack some of the artistic cargo of symbols as distinct from the more conventional aspects of them (e. g., their ability to refer to other things or events, and their ability to communicate ideas), and the second to show, by means of contrasts, the actual workings of Interpretation Theory as it could be applied to the analysis of art-making and art-viewing. For the first purpose, the author draws material from philosophy, dramatic writings, linguistic theory, and statements of artists in an analytic search for the often intractable character of the artistic image. For the second purpose, the author demonstrates, through the use of logic and the poetic metaphor, how a particular form of hermeneutic inquiry can be applied to assist an understanding of the assumptions upon which research is often built.<br>

Abstract: Bainbridge and Stark's essay on "The Consciousness Reformation" illustrates conceptual and theoretical ambiguities characteristic of research in the scientific study of religion more generally. This paper traces these ambiguities to the presence of two competing, but poorly differentiated, epistemological traditions. An examination of the assumptions implicit within each of these traditions provides a basis for clarifying the distinction between religious symbolism and religious belief, the concept of meaning, the difference between consistency as an attribute of belief and coherence as an attribute of reality, and the role of interpersonal bonds in maintaining the plausibility of religious symbolism. An emerging third perspective that appears to circumvent some of the limitations of the two major epistemological traditions is also discussed.<br>

Author(s): Thomas Robert<br>
Abstract: This paper attempts to uncover the mytho-symbolic parallels between the social-psychological theories of noted sociologist W. I. Thomas and the vision of moral-religious transformation recorded in John Bunyan's "The Pilgrim's Progress." Thomas' emphasis on the "definition of the situation," precise stages of moral development, and the four wishes are seen to be derived from Bunyan's themes of spiritual instruction along Christian's journey, his progress through various stages of sanctification, and the various spiritual polarities established by Bunyan as structuring principles of his text. Thomas is understood to have distorted Bunyan's vision of ultimate transcendence by equating salvation with adoption of the Protestant ethic and its institutional context of the American political and economic status quo.<br>

Abstract: Psychodynamically, Augustine's conversion responds to and reconstitutes tensions and relational ambivalences generated by his experiences with the "betraying embrace," principally as he has encountered its symbolic representation in his mother Monica's retentive and rejective tears, in one of her controlling dreams, and in his association with and loss of an unnamed friend. Those experiences crucially affect his own betrayals of secular covenants in his passage to conversion -- covenants with language and rhetoric, with order, and with "lower instincts," among others -- and are themselves transformatively replicated in divine and divinely sanctioned alliances scrupulously structured by his emotional requirements to prevent betrayal: in particular, Augustine's "Romantic" relationship with deific embrace perpetuates in an altered mode the discontent that brought him to seek it.<br>

Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which women narrate a move from a 'working-class' position to a position marked (in however fragmentary and complex a way) as 'middle class'. While such a move might be seen in terms of a straightforward escape from a disadvantaged social position, I argue here that what has to be analysed is the pain and the sense of estrangement associated with this class movement. Drawing on the class narratives of a group of seven white British women, the article uses Bourdieu's concepts of symbolic capital and habitus to explore the cultural and symbolic configurations of class. These configurations may be inscribed into the self, so that the self, itself, is class marked. Since working-class selves are frequently marked in pathological terms, this raises particular difficulties for the idea of an 'escape' from such a position. Class in this sense is embedded in people's history and so cannot be so easily 'escaped'. The usual conventions of life-narratives - in which the self remains the same entity from birth to death and later events are a culmination of earlier ones - are also disrupted in this case. But if a working-class position is marked as pathological, so too is taking on the markers of middle-class existence. to do so is not only to risk 'getting it wrong', but it is also to risk the scorn attached to 'pretentiousness'. There is a particular jeopardy here for women, since it is women who have been especially associated with desires for artefacts associated with bourgeois existence. The article argues for a focus for classed desires and class envy, not in pathological terms, but in terms of a coherent response to political and social exclusions.<br>

Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manyness are thoroughly corelative, joined in a dialectical relation of reciprocal implication. This pluralized unity and unified plurality is the ontological matrix of truth's relativity. Symbolic awareness is the interface of contextual meaning and relational being. The density of constitutive relations and the nascence of concrete actuality engender a dissonance between manifest and latent content in the reflection of being in consciousness. The polysemy of symbols captures the polymorphism of being in a way that establishes the need for a constant process of decipherment in which we reformulate our notions in order more fully to penetrate synchronic and diachronic relations that are ontologically definitive. By maintaining the tension between the revealed and the concealed, symbolic awareness insures that knowledge always evolves through ceaseless reinterpretation. For symbolic consciousness, truth, as being itself, forever becomes. The essay concludes with the suggestion that the wedding of a relativistic epistemology and a relational ontology in a symbolics of the religious imagination reopens the possibility of constructive theological reflection in a pluralistic age.<br>

Abstract: The very definition of myth is problematic today; here narrow, partial, "monomythic" definitions are rejected in favor of a complex, inclusive one, the seventeen items of which are then discussed. A mythological corpus consists of a network of myths, which are culturally-important imaginal stories conveying, by means of metaphor and symbol, graphic imagery, and emotional conviction and participation, the primal, foundational accounts of the real, experienced world, and humankind's roles and relative statuses within it. Mythologies may convey the political and moral values of a culture, and provide systems of interpreting individual experience within a universal perspective, which may include the intervention of suprahuman entities, as well as aspects of the natural and cultural orders. Myths may be enacted or reflected in rituals, ceremonies, and dramas, or provide materials for secondary elaborations. Only a polyphasic definition will provide appreciation of their manifold roles within a society.<br>

Abstract: Through the provision of a set of theses for the interpretation and evaluation of theologies of liberation, this paper attempts to mediate the existing conflict between academic theologians and theologians of liberation. It seeks to establish the legitimacy of theological discourse focused on the problem of alienation and liberation if carefully executed according to a clear set of guidelines. The paper begins with the argument that all interpretations of theologies of liberation must begin with an analysis of the theological genre within which these works fall. After insisting that theologies of liberation belong neither to the genre of systematic theology nor that of Christian social ethics, the paper develops the second thesis that theologies of liberation are best understood as members of a genre whose distinctive characteristics and functions are analogous to those intrinsic to secular ideologies. This thesis hinges upon a revisionist understanding of ideology drawn from the works of Clifford Geertz et al. and upon a careful specification of the generic similarities between the two forms of discourse. The second part of the paper moves from the level of interpretation to that of evaluation. It argues that theologies of liberation share with ideologies a tendency to occlude self-critical reflection. It suggests that a conscious recognition that theologies of liberation do not exhaust the possibilities of theological discourse but are relative models which select and interpret Christian symbols and doctrines in the light of the central dynamic of alienation and liberation might provide an antidote to this pathology. It maintains with Rosemary Ruether that there is no absolutely adequate model of alienation and liberation and that various models of alienation and liberation must be "interstructured" in order to overcome the perspectival biases of models which focus upon a single root of oppression. To establish relative degrees of adequacy between various theological models of liberation the paper argues that these models be evaluated a) by the criterion of appropriateness to the charter documents and to the historical development of one's chosen religious tradition, b) by the criterion of adequacy to the human condition in its essential commonality and in its historical diversity, and c) by the criterion of dialectical inclusiveness. The paper concludes by agreeing with theologians of liberation that ultimately no set of criteria validates a theology of liberation. As fundamentally geared to praxis, such a theology must be subject to a process of existential verification.<br>

Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first meaning. This event, really never-ending, is a basic condition of life; it stimulates the spirit in a posture of perpetual emergence.<br>

Abstract: The concept of political culture embraces some of the most basic, perennially fascinating concerns in behavioral political science; because of certain ambiguities in its theoretical formulation, however, there has been a tendency for the term to grow fuzzy with continued use. Its connection with related concepts, such as political psychology, political structure, and political language, has remained unclear, with the result that political culture has been difficult to isolate as an independent variable. Thus it has come to occupy a position on the periphery of politics, and is usually presumed to reinforce the status quo. This paper re-examines previous formulations of the concept and proposes a theoretical synthesis. The analytical framework is derived from semiological theory, a branch of science specifically designed for the analysis of meanings. The central variable is the political symbol. By analyzing the interactions of political symbols within a comprehensive semiological framework, the traditional concerns of political culture can be accommodated in a more precise and systematic way.<br>

Abstract: Working-class people perform class identities. These performances are marked with ironies in which working class symbolizes power and powerlessness. Such performances elide linear meaning-making in favor of poetic paradox and help us understand the contradictions of working-class life. "The New Deal," a chapbook by my great-grandfather, represents an occasion for understanding how one working-class person used language to consider his life's contradictions. The chapbook articulates a unique "working-class poetics" and suggests why rhetoricians ought to locate representations of the paradoxes of working-class life.<br>

Abstract: This article offers an alternative to classical hermeneutics, which focuses on discursive products and grasps meaning as the play of difference between linguistic signs. Pragmatist hermeneutics reconstructs meaning through an indefinite triangulation, which brings symbols, icons, and indices to bear on each other and considers a meaningful occasion as an embodied semiotic process. To illuminate the word-body-action nexus, the discussion identifies three basic types of signifying media: (1) the symbolic-discursive, (2) the somatic-affective, and (3) the behavioral-performative, each one marked by a special relationship between signs and their objects. An argument is made that the tension between various type-signifying media is unavoidable, that the pragmatic-discursive misalignment is an ontological condition, and that bridging the gap between our discursive, affective, and behavioral outputs is at the heart of ethical life.<br>

Abstract: In Sumatra's Angkola Batak culture, rituals celebrating major kinship-related events such as marriage have many layers of social and symbolic meaning; they have political, kinship, musical, mythic, and philosophical dimensions as lengthy, oratory-filled ceremonies that unite wife-giving lineages with wife-receivers. This article examines several ways that the interpretive approach that is discussed in the introduction can help students of Indonesian ritual grasp diverse aspects of Batak marriage rituals such as their hidden symbolic organization and their practical political implications. The article deals with a short sequence of adat dance staged for anthropological research purposes. (Adat, once translated as customary law, roughly means Angkola ceremonial life, kinship norms, and political thought; adat is eminently flexible, redefined by each Batak generation.) The choreography of the dance (wife-receivers dancing with wife-givers), songs, clothing, the political biographies of the participants, and the fact that the event was staged render the ceremony open to both structural and social contextual inquiry.<br>

Abstract: In recent years, sociologists and anthropologists have conducted significant studies of modern life using concepts and perspectives derived from symbolic anthropology. This paper discusses the theoretical and methodological problems entailed, including the distinction between symbolic and nonsymbolic actions. Research on three major areas of behavior is reviewed: (a) studies of institutions, especially politics, law, and social control; (b) studies of ceremonial events, including life-cycle rituals, sports, and festivals; and (c) studies of everyday life, including consumer goods and food, and popular culture. We conclude with a discussion of the methodological issues of location and dimensionality and the different forms of symbolic analysis.<br>

Abstract: Though the process of meaning construction is widely recognized to be a crucial factor in the mobilization, unfolding, and outcomes of social movements, the conditions and mechanisms that allow meaning construction and cultural transformation are often misconceptualized and/or underanalyzed. Following a "tool kit" perspective on culture, dominant social movement theory locates meaning only as it is embodied in concrete social practices. Meaning construction from this perspective is a matter of manipulating static symbols and meaning to achieve goals. I argue instead that meaning is located in the structure of culture, and that the condition and mechanism of meaning construction and transformation are, respectively, the metaphoric nature of symbolic systems, and individual and collective interpretation of those systems in the face of concrete events. This theory is demonstrated by analyzing, through textual analysis, meaning construction during the Irish Land War, 1879-1882, showing how diverse social groups constructed new and emergent symbolic meanings and how transformed collective understandings contributed to specific, yet unpredictable, political action and movement outcomes. The theoretical model and empirical case demonstrates that social movement analysis must examine the metaphoric logic of symbolic systems and the interpretive process by which people construct meaning in order to fully explain the role of culture in social movements, the agency of movement participants, and the contingency of the course and outcomes of social movements.<br>

Abstract: By studying Durkheim through a Schopenhauerian lens, the one-sidedly cognitivist and functionalist reception of his social theory can be balanced. Durkheim explicitly rejected such monistic interpretations. His dialectical approach was always aimed at an essentially dualistic perception of man and society, wherein the lower pole, the individual, is central. In Durkheim's symbol theory, this position leads to two kinds of symbols: those that are bound to the human body, here called "this and that" symbols, and those people can choose freely, here called "this for that" symbols. This twofold symbol theory can already be found in medieval philosophy (e.g. Dante Alighieri) as well as in the work of Paul Ricoeur. For Durkheim the human person is the symbol par excellence. By implication the rituals in which the person is (re)constructed, that is the rites of passage, should be central. The interpretation here opens up new perspectives for a more psychological interpretation of Durkheim's sociology.<br>

Abstract: There exist around the notion of the public three different yet overlapping dichotomies posed on different levels of analysis: public (sphere) versus private (sphere), public versus mass, and publicness versus privacy/secrecy. Habermas's book ([1962]1989) incorporates all the three sets of dichotomy without resolving the contradictory meanings and bridging the gaps among them. As a result, his conception of the public sphere becomes paradoxical in terms, and it undertheorizes the cultural property of publicness. This article proposes an alternative conception of the public that may encompass the structural, institutional, and cultural levels of theorization in a more precise and coherent way. It is argued that the public is an imagined category about citizen membership that is attached to both institutions of state and civil society. In political practices, a symbolic "public" is institutionalized through an open communicative space where it is called upon, constructed, and contested as the central source of cultural references. In this connection, a notion of public credibility is introduced as an attempt to bring forth a richer and more dynamic conception about the role of culture in democratic struggles than that of critical rationality by Habermas.<br>

Abstract: The work of literary structuralists, particularly Roland Barthes, provides sharper insights into ethnomethodology than symbolic interactionism, labeling theory, or phenomenology. Further, it suggests that the metaphor of text may be fruitful for analysts of everyday life. Greater theoretical benefits derive from that metaphor, however, if one applies it using the ideas of literary theorists outside the structuralist tradition.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mankind: The discovery of the unreality of man's existence apart from God, is the discovery at the same time of the fact that God is the ultimate ground of the unity of mankind. According to Jaspers the fact of life are to conform to the principle of that wider order of reality disclosed to us in the experience of communication in which the reality of each person's likeness to the image of God finds its practical application. The development of communication depends on the principle of correlation of Existenz and Transcendenz which is the property of no finite existential self, but manifests itself alike in all. Though we may be confronted with the question "Is it God or the devil who governs the world?", it remains equally true that even "failure is no argument against the truth that is rooted in transcendence". 3) Ultimate Dignity of Man: Jaspers' unequivocal emphasis on freedom, stating that "Freedom and God are inseparable" serves to assure this ideal its place in human society. Thus man's exercise of freedom knits him up into the transcendental design. The claim that certain facts and experiences yield a basis for the recognition of the ultimate dignity of man is justified precisely by this evidence that through God, as inseparable from freedom, we discern the ultimate significance of both man and humanity.<br>

Abstract: Archaeological examinations of symbolic meaning often have been hampered by the Saussurean concept of signs as coded messages of preexisting meanings. The arbitrary and imprecise manner by which meaning is represented in material culture according to Saussure tends to stymie archaeological investigations of symbolism. As an alternative, archaeologists recently have drawn on Peirce's semiotic to investigate how materiality is bound to the creation of meanings through the process of signification. This study examines how the symbolism expressed in pottery of the Middle Woodland period south-eastern United States, Swift Creek Complicated Stamped and Weeden Island effigy vessels, might be better explained as icons and indexes that were enlisted to have particular social effects. Examining the semiotic potentials of these objects helps explain their apparent uses and the significance of alternative representations of the same subjects. En repetidas ocasiones los estudios arqueológicos sobre el significado de símbolos han sido obstaculizados por el concepto Saussureano que define los signos como mensajes codificados con un significado preexistente. De acuerdo con Saussure, la manera arbitraria e imprecisa por la cual cierto significado se encuentra representado en la cultura material tiende a bloquear las investigaciones arqueológicas que estudian objetos simbólicos. Como alternativa los arqueólogos han comenzado a basarse en la semiótica de Peirce, con el fin de investigar de qué manera la materialidad está ligada a la creación de significados a través del proceso de creación de signos o significación. En este estudio se examinaron piezas de alfarería del sur oriente de los Estados Unidos, provenientes del periodo medio Woodland, de los complejos estampados Swift Creek y esfinges representadas en vasijas Weeden Island. El objetivo es demostrar que los símbolos expresados en dichas piezas podrían ser interpretados como iconos e índices que fueron establecidos para efectos sociales particulares. Por medio de la investigación del potencial semiótico de estos especímenes es posible explicar sus presuntos usos, así como la significación de representaciones alternativas de los mismos objetos.<br>

Abstract: History is not neutral. It is rendered ideological by the very act of being conveyed in a narrative form, for language is both the purveyor of meaning and the principle locus of ideology. This paper explores the idea of history as discourse, and its deployment in the cultural-symbolic construction of the Singapore nation. To this end, I have chosen to analyse a key moment for Singapore history, the years 1963-65, when Singapore was first merged with the nation of Malaysia, and then separated from it. The way that these events are described in official histories is used by the government of Singapore to justify its policy of multiracialism, which also serves as a legitimating device confirming the state in its political and ideological hegemony. I have examined the events through analysis of local newspapers, The Straits Times and Berita Harían, to see in what ways their reporting may have helped to mould popular understandings of what was happening.<br>

Abstract: The city is a key location of the modern social world, a home of rootlessness and transient everyday encounters between individuals. This essay explores the idea of 'the sanctuary' as a way in which people look for anchorage, and create and re-create images of a society, to cope with and negotiate life in the city. It mainly draws on Durkheim's work on ritual, symbolism and the sacred, together with his account of individual and collective representations. But it also discusses these concerns though other writers, notably Freud and Ricœur, and it draws on Kant's theory of art to introduce how Durkheim sees ritual —especially sacred drama — as at once a symbolism and an aesthetics, complete with the energies of a free creative 'surplus'. Even if in the end 'the sanctuary' is unequal to the marketplace, it is a necessary refuge of the transformative social imagination and a realm, not of everyday economics, but of civitas.<br>

Abstract: The current methods in psychoanalytic studies of God images and representations have focused almost exclusively on individual, internal processes. This article examines how psychological anthropologists go about formulating symbolic representations of deity in their research, in comparison with the object relations method of God-representations. Drawing on Melford Spiro's integrative proposal for interpreting the mental and collective representations in religious symbol systems, this paper proposes that there is a need for a comprehensive model of the representational process in the Eastern world in order to suit its cultural traditions. The author uses both theoretical and historical materials as well as personal narrative throughout its entirety to balance the two in a mutual and coherent flow of understanding. Noting the culturally patterned interactions with culturally postulated God-symbols, the object relations method of God-representations will be utilized to probe how God is both created and found on a collective (cultural) level as well as individual level.<br>

Abstract: In this study we relate four different measures: the theodicy models proposed by van der Ven, the coping strategies proposed by Pargament, a measure of positive or negative self-image and the post critical belief scales we ourselves have developed. We analysed the data of 251 Dutch-speaking Belgians. In the analysis we focus on the relation of the different measures with the post critical belief scales. Different types of believers are using different theodicy models, somewhat different coping strategies and we observe some differences in self-image, where believers have a more positive self-image than non-believers. We could suggest that there is a specific theodicy model used by symbolic believers and another theodicy model used by more literal believers. The former could be interpreted as more developed and perhaps more religiously mature.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines the significance of the concept of culture for organizational analysis. The intersection of culture theory and organization theory is evident in five current research themes: comparative management, corporate culture, organizational cognition, organizational symbolism, and unconscious processes and organization. Researchers pursue these themes for different purposes and their work is based on different assumptions about the nature of culture and organization. The task of evaluating the power and limitations of the concept of culture must be conducted within this assumptive context. This review demonstrates that the concept of culture takes organization analysis in several different and promising directions.<br>

Abstract: Religious echoes are resonant with race and gender in Beloved, raising questions best posed in a psychoanalytic register. Freud's sceptical questioning of religion is important for a consideration of the gendered, raced, and specifically religious subjectivities explored in the novel, as is Lacan's paradigm of entry into the symbolic order. Reading the religious in Beloved in light of both Freud and Lacan, and reading the poetically evocative Word in all three, I locate within the novel a profound ambivalence, an awareness of the limitations of language under the Name of the Father and the necessity—even potential good—of imagining within its system.<br>

Abstract: In the world of Korean shamanism, there is a particular god, called taegam, which is allegedly famous for its love of money and its abundance of greed for material wealth. During the shamanic ritual of chaesu-kut, the rites for good fortune and luck, this god is popularly worshipped as the Deity of Wealth and is typically symbolized by money placed all over its face and spirit costumes. Nonetheless, as money has the two sides of heads and tails, taegam also has two very different faces—so-taegam and taegam. This article explores the ambiguity of the two taegam gods, focusing on the symbolic action of money-offerings and how its meaning is taken from the perspective of the ritual actors, in the hope of shedding light on the place of Korea's traditional popular religion of shamanism in today's transformed urban landscape. By discussing the semantics of "money is the filial child" (a remark made by so-taegam) and "money is the enemy" (as remarked by taegam), statements I often heard during my fieldwork in Seoul, I suggest that the ambivalent symbolic nature of taegam should be seen as an indispensible vehicle for understanding ritual life, as well as everyday life, of urban Korean people since it is closely related to both normative orientations and the contradictory aspects of the material culture of contemporary urbanites inhabiting the borderless, globalized, and fluctuating modern capitalist market. This conclusion is reached partly with reference to existing sociological theories of money and anthropological inquiries into the ambivalent aspects of taegam.<br>

Abstract: In this article alternative history is regarded not as a postmodern genre of Since Fiction but as a universal mode of thinking and storytelling. Its research is especially effective in discussions of historical-mythical pseudo-chronicles of lost civilizations, such as Agnon's Ir u-mloa, his Holocaust opus magnum. The article is devoted to the story from this volume "In Search of a Rabbi, or The Spirit of the Ruler" (Ha-mekhapsim lahem rav, o be-ruakh ha-moshel). The method lays open the author's complex historical and historiographic conceptions hidden in plots and characters, as well as in symbols of historical alternativeness such as "Crusher of Grits" (Kotesh grisin).<br>

Abstract: Pozzi, Scrittrici mistiche italiane, p. 462: "Nel 1629 cessarono le visioni e le estasi. La fama di
quelle meraviglie, uscita dalla clausura, aveva perô provocato il fenomeno, comune a molte altre
estatiche, di un grande traffico spirituale intomo alla suora: le scrissero senza tregua religiosi e
prelati,... ma le scrissero soprattutto dame dell'alta aristocrazia, dai vicini ducati di Mantova e
. Savoia alle lontane plaghe di Spagna, Boemia, Baviera. Roma intervenne allora col solito rigore;
senza emettere condanne, le proibl ogni corrispondenza con Testerno. Cos! calô su di lei un
silenzio non piu rotto da fatti straordinari né da rumori del secolo, fino alla morte, avvenuta il 12
febbraio 1671".<br>

Journal Title: Discourse Studies<br>
Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Scott-Baumann Alison<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Abstract: Daß die Verstiegenheiten und Mißbräuche, welche die Scholiasten der Spätantike seit
der Kaiserzeit mit der Etymologie getrieben haben, aller ernsten Grundlagen entbehrten
und reine Fabrikation ebenso mittelmäßiger wie phantasievoller Wichtigtuer darstellten,
die sich „Philologen" und „Grammatiker" nannten und noch bis in die byzantinische Epoche
hinein fortwirkten, ist allgemein bekannt (s. zum Beispiel die vielfachen Entlarvungen dieses
durch die Jahrhunderte mitgeschleppten Ballastes von Pseudogelehrsamkeit bei W. G. Ruther-
ford, A Chapter in the History of Annotation, Being Scholia Aristophanica, Bd. III, London
1905, S. 392 etc). Daß die ebenso irrationalen und vielleicht noch geschmackloseren ety-
mologischen Spekulationen, die man im 20. Jahrhundert auf die Wortgruppe έρμηνεία, έρμη-
νεύειν, ερμηνευτικός anwendete und immer noch anwendet, im gängigen akademischen Lehr-
betrieb heute ernst genommen werden und sich professoraler Autorität erfreuen, ist nicht
nur ein bildungsgeschichtliches curiosum, sondern ein Zeugnis irrationaler Aushöhlung der
„geisteswissenschaftlichen" Fakultäten. Als Beispiel seien nur erwähnt Karl Kerényi, Her-
meneia und Hermeneutike, Ursprung und Sinn der Hermeneutik in ders., Griechische Grundbegriffe,
Fragen und Antworten aus der heutigen Situation, Zürich 1964, 42-52, und F. K. Mayr, Der
Gott Hermes und die Hermeneutik in Tijdschrift voor Filosofie, 30, 1968, 525-635. Wie der Autor
des zuletzt genannten Artikels selbst, auf Heideggers Formulierung zurückgreifend, sagt,
ist das „Spiel des Denkens verbindlicher als die Strenge der Wissenschaft"... Wohin eine
im Banne Heideggers stehende „Begriffsgeschichte" führt, kann man bei der Lektüre dieses
Schwalls besser „verstehen"... Wie wenig Tragweite die immer wieder angeführte (Techné)
hermeneutike in der Epinomis 975 c hat, sagt der Text selbst: bei der Kunst Orakel zu inter-

Abstract: While identity researchers are utilizing a variety of methods, the potential advantages of combinations of qualitative and quantitative methods remain largely unexploited. This article discusses the interplay of methods, theoretical content and meta-theoretical assumptions in identity research and calls for the use of mixed methods. The article applies a symbolic interactionist perspective and discusses what aspects of identification different methodological approaches provide insight into. It is discussed how different methodologies imply different assumptions about identity, particularly regarding the stability of identities, the constitution of identities and the conception of meaning. The influential quantitative Burke–Tully approach is brought into focus and compared to different qualitative approaches, particularly narrative interviews. A quantitative self-report measure neglects the narrative, performative and embodied quality of identification. However, the quantitative approach of Burke and Tully enables the systematic, standardized comparison of individuals making it possible to examine patterns of identification in large populations. Since different methods enable the study of different aspects of identity, while remaining blind to other aspects, mixed methods may contribute to more complete insights into identity processes. Importantly, mixed methods may be used to examine patterns available to the outside observer and the lifeworld of the individual actor and thus to both explain and understand.<br>

Abstract: In Colombia, society has come to be organized in terms of a division between those with and those without links to narcotrafficking. This moral boundary recently experienced a symbolic disturbance with the entrance on the country's cultural scene of Andrés López López, a former Colombian drug trafficker, and his El cartel de los sapos (2008). An examination of the discursive and political strategies employed in this book, in which drug trafficking is referred to through the metaphor "bacteria," allows us to understand the construction of a narrator who calls attention to the hypocrisy of the government and society regarding the reincorporation of narcotraffickers into civilian life while provoking a national debate on the difference between history and fiction. En Colombia, la sociedad ha llegado a organizarse en términos de una división entre aquellos que tienen y no vínculos con el narcotráfico. Este límite moral experimentó un reciente disturbio simbólico con la entrada de Andrés López López, un ex-narcotraficante colombiano, y su libro El cartel de los sapos (2008) en la escena cultural del país. Un análisis de las estrategias discursivas y políticas empleadas en este libro, en el que el tráfico de drogas se define a través de la metáfora de la "bacteria," nos permite entender la construcción de un narrador que devela la hipocresía gubernamental y social con respecto a la reincorporación de los narcotraficantes en la vida civil al mismo tiempo que provoca un debate nacional sobre la diferencia entre historia y ficción.<br>

Abstract: Evoquant l'habitude, Ricœur constate qu'elle donne une histoire au
caractère : « une histoire dans laquelle la sédimentation tend à recouvrir et, à la
limite, à abolir l'innovation qui l'a précédée [...]. C'est cette sédimentation qui
confère au caractère la sorte de permanence dans le temps que j'interprète ici
comme recouvrement de Y ipse par l'idem ». In Soi-même comme un autre,
Paris, Seuil, 1990, p. 146.

partiellement investi dans un rôle. On glisse ici du caractère à l'appartenance

autour de symboles rigides en faveur de moments de mise en avant d'une
identité personnelle répondant à un besoin d'individualisation.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, I examine the influence of the Gospel of John on Joyce's aesthetic. My basic claim is that the gospel aided Joyce in charting a middle course between materialism (body without spirit) and spiritualism (spirit without body). After examining the temptations of flying too high (symbolism, mysticism, gnosticism) and flying too low (historicism, realism, materialism), I show how Joyce made use of the Johannine strategies of epiphany and realized eschatology to achieve a synthesis between these extremes. The essay is much indebted to two students of John—Rudolph Bultmann and Franz Mussner—who examined John's peculiar synthesis of fact and allegory. In addition, the scholar Jacques Aubert was indispensable for his analysis of a similar trajectory in Joyce's aesthetic.<br>

Abstract: Paul Klee's art found broad impact upon philosophers of varying commitments, including Hans-Georg Gadamer. Moreover, Klee himself was not only one of the most important artists of aesthetic modernism but one of its leading theoreticians, and much in his work, as in Gadamer's, originated in post-Kantian literary theory's explications of symbol and allegory. Indeed at one point in Truth and Method, Gadamer associates his project for a general "theory of hermeneutic experience" not only with Goethe's metaphysical account of the symbolic but equally with a "rehabilitation" of allegory. In this paper, I examine this position and Gadamer's own use of it in his analysis of Klee's work, contrasting it with that of Walter Benjamin's account of allegory, equally indebted to Goethe and this archive. Finally, I contrast the resulting interpretations of Klee, discussing the implications that evolve for understanding both Gadamer and Benjamin—but equally for understanding Klee's work and, provisionally, the work of art, thus construed, for philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Ces réserves sont ponctuelles, en voici quelques exemples. Comme tout binôme, et il n'est pas
le seul dans le livre, le terme de contre-mémoire risque de produire l'impression d'opposition
mécanique ce qui n'est sûrement pas l'intention de l'auteure. Sur un autre registre, malgré tout
mon respect pour l'héritage intellectuel de Pierre Bourdieu, je ne suis pas convaincu par les efforts
de Christine Chivallon d'appliquer son appareil conceptuel à l'analyse du travail de la mémoire.
Puisque son érudition est très impressionnante, l'absence des travaux de Nathan Wachtel surprend
d'autant plus. L'Invention du quotidien de Michel de Certeau est citée, mais je n'ai trouvé aucune
mention de son concept opératoire de « propre », à mon avis très pertinent pour la démarche de
l'auteure. J'estime également que le concept de « lieu de mémoire » de Pierre Nora est trop rapidement
jugé inopérant pour sa recherche.<br>

Abstract: La destruction symbolique du corps (similaire à la promotion de la latinisation,
latinx.ua 拉丁イヒ）chez Lu Xun est différente des représentations dualisantes de la
Nouvelle littérature des années 1920, opposant à l'âme souffrante le corps déprécié,
qui expriment ainsi directement leurs frustrations. Pourtant, Lu Xun n'est pas un
« contempteur du corps », même si ceiui-ci tend à servir surtout « l'esprit » (voir Gao
2007 :181). Il vise le Kôrper, non le Leib, insistant avec Nietzsche sur le processus
de vie (leben) et le rejet du désir de mort, mais rejetant l'esthétique du corps et du
surhomme. Lu Xun combat le corps comme expression figée et obstacle à la vie, pour
contrer la souffrance de cette impossibilité à régénérer la voix. Cependant, le corps
littéraire, par sa destruction symbolique et sa mise à distance comme signe, laisse
soupçonner une ultime aliénation du corps. Car, si le corps individuel comme « lieu
ou scène de la manifestation [d'un] trouble » est « premier signifiant mis en œuvre par
le langage » (StarobinsKi 1981:273), comment comprendre qu il soit tu ？ C'est peut-
être la dernière souffrance, celle du corps muet, obligé de demeurer un signe statique
interdit de parole individuelle, au nom de la dénonciation du silence collectif et du
refus de l'épanchement.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses human resources management (HRM) systems and practices in a large multinational management consultancy firm. The firm invests considerable resources in HRM, and is frequently praised by employees for its accomplishments in hiring, developing, and promotion. However, this general faith in HRM does not align particularly well with employees' experiences and perceptions of the specific HRM practices in the firm. The paper critically interprets the meaning and the functions of the HRM system and the beliefs supporting it. The paper suggests a reinterpretation of HRM systems and practices based on a cultural-symbolic perspective. It introduces the concepts of excess ceremonialism, identity projects, and aspirational control to highlight and interpret the significance of organizational symbolism in accounting for the role of HRM systems and practices, and the various effects of HRM systems and practices on employee identity and compliance.<br>

Abstract: We respond in language to catastrophic, or traumatic, shocks to symbolic systems, for which the fall of the Tower of Babel can be seen as a mythic model. One response is an exploration of new uncertainties; another is a fearful rigidity that seeks to return to an imagined Adamic wholeness of language; another is an effort to transcend language altogether. This essay examines two contemporary responses to a perceived "fall" of language-several case studies of Oliver Sacks's and two novels by Don DeLillo-and places them in the context of the twentieth-century "linguistic turn" in the humanities and social sciences and what I call a "counterlinguistic turn" that is contemporaneous with the linguistic turn and represents developments of some of its key assumptions.<br>

Abstract: Much archaeological scholarship on consumption has approached its subject matter as the means to an end—e.g., as a way of studying socioeconomic status—rather than as a proper object of study in its own right. The "consumer choice" school, and, more recently, advocates of consumer behavior studies, have supported approaches that emphasize quantitative methods, at the same time downplaying the "qualitative" or symbolic aspects of consumption. A considerable body of literature on the symbolic aspects of consumption exists both in historical archaeology and other fields. The intention of this essay is to draw together this recent literature on consumption and combine it into a single approach that emphasizes shopping as the meaningful action at the very heart of consumption. With the emphasis on agency, this approach presents shopping as that crucial moment of transformation where identity, intention, and symbol combine in the decision to purchase, to own, an object.<br>

Abstract: On peut noter que Jean-Francois Billeter etablit une distinction generale entre les
deux systemes de pensee, grecque et chinoise, qui recoupe, dans ses grandes lignes, celle
exposee par Jullien: "On peut apercevoir [...], me semble-t-il, une difference fondamen-
tale entre la pensee grecque et la tradition intellectuelle qui en est issue d'une part, et
l'ensemble (ou presque) de la pensee chinoise de l'autre. Notre tradition intellectuelle a
eu tendance a privilegier la conscience thetique et la conscience reflechie, qui font toutes
deux abstraction du mouvement, du changement, des transformations dans lesquels nous
sommes continuellement pris dans les faits. [...] La philosophie a par consequent eu dans
notre civilisation une vocation "theorique," contemplative. La pensee chinoise me parait
avoir ete, dans l'ensemble, beaucoup plus fidele aux donnees de lexperience commune, au
rapport spontane que nous entretenons avec nous-memes et avec les choses dans le cours
de nos activites. Elle a donne la priorite aux formes que notre vie consciente prend lorsque
nous nous mouvons, que nous agissons, etc., et a celles que la realite a pour nous dans ces
moments-la" ("Comment lire Wang Fuzhi?" 111-12).<br>

Abstract: According to recent analyses, we are said to be witnessing in the West a « naturalisation » of filiation. The present article challenges this hypothesis, based on anthropological and historical analyses of old “parallel” kinships and the new forms of family configurations. It recalls the longstanding reference to nature in the representations and uses of kinship and the existence of a metaphorical and symbolic world characterised both in the past and today by the plurality of meanings given to kinship relations.<br>

Abstract: Dans cette perspective, toute pratique de lecture
peut être décrite comme un mouvement en trois temps :
«avant lire »/«lire »/«après lire». Des «intérêts
à la lecture » qui trouvent leur origine dans la situation
du lecteur - « avant lire » - incitent à un « faire » - « lire » -
qui porte à conséquences, immédiates ou différées
- «après lire» - et qui consolident en retour les «intérêts
à la lecture ». L'accent mis classiquement sur la seconde
phase (« lire ») - qui est aussi la plus difficilement
accessible à l'enquête - est alors déplacé sur les deux autres.<br>

Abstract: Ricordo, a titolo di esempio, solo alcuni degli scrittori e degli studiosi che non
hanno avuto, per così dire, accesso alla rassegna (pur se implicitamente e continuamente
vivissimi all'attenzione di chi scrive) per l'impossibilità oggettiva di esibire lo sconfinato
universo delle presenze bibliche nella letteratura compresa tra il Duecento e il primo Ot-
tocento: il Dante delle opere 'minori', soprattutto della Vita Nuova (V. Branca, G. Gor-
ni), la predicazione medievale e moderna (C. Delcorno, R. Rusconi, L. Bolzoni, J. Berlioz,
etc.), le laude (G. Varanini, R. Bettarini, F. Mancini etc.), la sacra rappresentazione (M.
Martelli, N. Newbigin, F. Doglio, G. Ponte, F. Pezzarossa), il Boccaccio delle Rime e
delle Epistole (V. Branca, G. Auzzas) e di alcune parti del Decameron (P. Cherchi), la
produzione 'sacra' tassiana (Rime Sacre, Mondo Creato), l'Aretino (Larivaille) e il Folengo
(M. Chiesa, S. Gatti) nei panni di scrittori cristiani, l'Arcadia edificante, per riprendere
un titolo preciso del Di Biase, certa tragedia sacra settecentesca come quella di Martello
(I. Magnani, P. Trivero) e, soprattutto, l'Alfieri biblico del Saul e dell'Abele (A. Di Bene-
detto, E. Raimondi), lo Jacopo Ortis (M. A. Terzoli) e l'Ipercalisse del Foscolo (B. Rosada,
A. Forlini), il linguaggio poetico religioso del Porta (G. Pozzi) e del Belli, il Tommaseo
(M. Guglielminetti), il Pascoli (A. Traina, G. Goffis), D'Annunzio e molti altri ancora:
spesso, tra l'altro, privi di una vera e propria bibliografia «scritturale» a largo spettro,
se non di studi singoli, difficilmente annoverabili nell'ambito ristretto di una precisazione
doverosa, ma non esaustiva. Va detto anche che, sebbene la rassegna si chiuda con il
1995, qua e là è stato segnalato qualche libro del 1996, a cui si vuole ora aggiungere,
senza l'ambizione di averne citato tutti i volumi relativi all'oggetto delle precedenti pagi-
ne, A. Stauble, Le sirene eterne. Studi sull'eredità classica e biblica nella letteratura italia-
na, Ravenna, Longo, 1996; e E. Esposito, R. Manica, N. Longo, R. Scrivano, Memo-

Abstract: A number of investigators are agreed that the popular medical systems of tribal, peasant, and allied peoples are "effective." Most of the literature closely examining that effectiveness focuses on the ethnopharmacological dimensions of the healing systems and generally ignores psychosocial factors. Recent developments in psychophysiology may offer insights into these neglected areas. The specific idea to be examined here is that successful "general medical treatment," or "symbolic healing," by either the shaman or physician, is based in part on a psychosocial mobilization of the patient's biochemical response system. Moreover, it is argued that to account fully for these processes we must reconceptualize the character of the human organism; a unitary alternative to standard Western Cartesian dualism (mind vs. body) is proposed, based on a model derived from recent research in neuroendocrinology. This model can be the basis for a nonreductionist theory of medical effectiveness needed to account for a series of observations (derived from both anthropological and medical contexts) which seem to transcend the explanatory powers of the traditional reductionist biomedical model.<br>

Abstract: Two traditions have been vying for supremacy in the area of cultural analysis. The first sees culture as encompassing the totality of socially learned human phenomena; the second restricts the term to shared mental-primarily cognitive-properties. David Schneider has achieved a dominant positon in the latter school. In this paper I examine critically Schneider's approach to culture, with special attention to the problems raised by his perspective with respect to intracultural consistency and contradiction. While agreeing that the ethnographer must attempt to shun prior assumptions as to the nature of symbolic and conceptual domains recognized by the people under study, that it is incumbent on the anthropologist to comprehend reality from the natives' point of view before attempting to formulate laws or generalizations, that the symbolic systems and their associated meanings plays an essential part in making sense of any human action system, I shall argue that cultures do not exhibit the degree of integration, consistency, and articulation assumed by Schneider, that in his attempt to render culture wholly integrated and consisten he strips the concept of its analytic utility, that social action and symbolic systems are empirically and epistemologically more closely intertwined than he would lead us to believe, and that the very debate over what culture "really" is constitutes an exercise in reification.<br>

Abstract: Using the hermeneutical theory of Paul Ricoeur, it is possible to discern symbolic dimensions in cultural anthropology. Symbols, here, are dominant images in anthropologists' texts, creatively posited by inquirers, that, most importantly, possess a surplus of meaning. A symbol's fullest surplus of meaning is a prereflexive and comprehensive "understanding" (Verstehen) that may encompass a scholar's attempts at "explanation" (Erklaren). Examples of this symbolic dimension are the "understandings" that lie implicit in two elaborate anthropological systems: Levi-Strauss's structuralism and Harris's cultural materialism. Amid their commitments to anthropological "science" and "explanation," the works of each disclose a distinctive Verstehen. For Levi-Strauss, this "understanding" is nurtured by his image "world of reciprocity." For Harris, it is carried by the image "nature." This "understanding" has two major functions. On the level of the intellectual coherence of their texts, it gives unity to their intercultural interpretations of other societies and to their intracultural interpretations of their own traditions. On a moral level, it includes modes of being-in-the-world that Levi-Strauss and Harris prefer and ocasionally press upon their readers. Discernment of symbolic dimensions of "understanding" in anthropologists' texts may be an initial step toward reflection on the matrices out of which diverse explanations are presented in anthropological literature.<br>

Abstract: By focusing on hermeneutics and dialogue, this article clarifies the distinctive contribution that pastoral and psychotherapeutic interventions have to make in the healing process. It is shown how the hermeneutical process discloses the meaning of events through the interpretation of texts that arise spontaneously in the lives of individuals and groups. Texts may range from individual fantasies and dreams to sacred histories recorded in scriptures. When the meaning of life events is explored in dialogue through symbolic texts, we term that process "dialogical hermeneutics." Effective dialogical hermeneutics requires the use of three techniques: (1) presence in the caring relationship, (2) dialogue toward meaning, and (3) offering alternative interpretation.<br>

Abstract: In his theory of communication Schutz exhibits a significant tension between two fundamental perspectives, phenomenology and pragmatism, and in the long run he fails to reconcile the contradictory implications these perspectives have with regard to his model of interaction. The main problem seems to be the notion of sense-constitution. Schutz develops two distinguishable accounts of constitution: an egological one and a model based on the phenomenon of direct interaction of empirical subjects. Two key concepts are related to these different modes of constitution: the model of appresentation with regard to language, symbols and signs, and the model of synchronisation as triangulation of streams of consciousness and outward action sequences. They are analyzed as significant for two different methods and two different theories of communication. I propose some reasons for Schutz's insistence on a phenomenological account of the ego and the constitution of sense, and offer a brief sketch of an alternative strategy that is implicit in Schutz's theory.<br>

Abstract: In this article, I look at the ways in which contested memories, imagined communities, and social ressentiment are embraced and filtered by Slovenian and Italian youth as postmemory and transformed into symbolic weapons that exclude, make demands, or simply provoke. Drawing on fieldwork conducted in the Italo—Slovenian border area of Trieste, I analyze two settings in which these symbols are used: a soccer match between Slovenia and Italy played in the summer of 2002 at which a mysterious banner provoked diplomatic tensions and the everyday graffiti war waged on the walls of the city of Trieste.<br>

Abstract: How can an interpretive theory gain legitimacy in two cultural markets as different as France and the United States? This study examines the intellectual, cultural, institutional, and social conditions of legitimation of Jacques Derrida's work in the two countries and develops hypotheses about the process of legitimation of interpretive theories. The legitimation of Derrida's work resulted from a fit between it and highly structured cultural and institutional systems. In France, Derrida capitalized on the structure of the intellectual market by targeting his work to a large cultural public rather than to a shrinking group of academic philosophers. His work appealed to the intellectual public as a status symbol and as a novel and sophisticated way to deal with late 1960s politics. In the United States, Derrida and a group of prestigious literary critics reframed his theory and disseminated it in university departments of literature. His work was imported concurrently with the work of other French scholars with whom he shared a market. Derrida's support is more concentrated and stronger in one discipline than the support for other French intellectuals. In America, professional institutions and journals played a central role in the diffusion of his work, while cultural media were more central in France.<br>

Abstract: Recent advances in animal studies have documented the widespread use of learned, symbolic communication in the animal kingdom. Meanwhile, Mechling (1989) has argued that folklore, as shared learned traditions, also exists in non-human animals. Considering that many scholars believe humans are unique in our ability to tell stories, this schism between human and animal, the story and other folklore, has a great deal to tell us about the outlines and origins of humanity. This article seeks to integrate arguments from linguistics, archaeology, primatology, folklore, and cognitive science from evolutionary perspectives.<br>

Abstract: Central Australian Aboriginal `increase ritual' has often been seen exclusively as an attempt to control environmental forces. Following Durkheim's early arguments against this view, and expanding them to encompass a psychoanalytic perspective, it is argued that the direct effect of so-called `increase ritual' is psychological, but that this effect has consequences for the maintenance of resources in a hunter-gatherer society. `Increase ritual', as Durkheim suggested, is structured as a form of sacrifice. It is also, as Freud suggested, linked to the death of the father. It is argued here that these symbolic themes relate practically to the control which mature men exercise over the reproduction of the social and natural orders.<br>

Abstract: Most symbols are polytropic as well as polysemic in that their multiple meanings in various contexts functions as different types ot trope. This article pursues the complex nature of polytropes through a formulation of synecdoche as an interstitial trope between metaphor and metonymy, and demonstrates how the two conceptual principles of analogy and contiguity, that define metaphor and metonymy respectively, are interdependent and interpenetrated, rather than of basically different natures as presented in the biaxial image of structural linguistics. The analogic thought expressed in methaphor involves movement and temporality, just as does the discursive thought of metonymy. The interpenetration of the two modes of thought is demostrated through an analysis of the process of objectification of what, throughout history, has been a dominant symbol of self in Japanese culture: the monkey. As a polysemic and polytropic symbol, the monkey takes on different meanings, and functions as different tropic types, sequentially or simultaneously, as actors use and/or interpret the symbol in varying historical and social contexts.<br>

Abstract: The appearance of diverse strands of post-processual archaeology resonates with the transformation of university structures, beginning in the 1970s, and gives voice to concerns that have been variously labelled post-structuralist, deconstructionist or critical theory. This article examines the resonance of the post-processual archaeologies with wider social and intellectual currents in the context of the ongoing confrontation with processual archaeology, attempts at a critical engagement with structuralism and symbolic anthropology, and rapprochement with history. It considers the implications of these perspectives.<br>

Abstract: Before World War II the intellectual climate of American sociology was congenial to the growth of a sociology of knowledge akin to Mannheim's. Yet in the postwar period American sociologists committed themselves to ahistorical theory, positivist methodology, and team research; their "scientistic" sociology did not permit the historicism, relativism, and holism necessary to Mannheimian analysis. Currently, however, convergent trends in a number of disciplines--not only sociology but also philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, and the histories of ideas, science, and art--favor a revival of the Mannheimian program. Analysts of culture now seek to integrate the sociological goals of "explanation" and "understanding"--the formulation of quasi-laws of behavior, based on identification of the social structural elements of culture production, and the interpretation of the subjective meaning of culture, based on recovery of actors' intentions. Their research program requires investigation of the peculiar sociohistorical circumstances that condition actors' perceptions, necessitating attention to the cognitive content of culture. This article surveys both the theoretical justifications for such a research program and recent exemplifications of it, focusing on anlyses of what Mannheim termed "objective culture"--such symbolic vehicles for conceptions as religion, the arts, science, and political thought that acquire independent existence, becoming subject to diverse interpretations.<br>

Abstract: Of the many surviving Romanesque cartularies, very few are illuminated. After reviewing general considerations of the oral, textual, and visual elements at play in these works, this paper then focuses on the Vierzon Cartulary, particularly on the processes of its charters' transcription to codex. Specifically, this paper argues the performative role of the scribe and illuminator, who, by their transformation of the mise-en-page, appropriation of papal notarial authority, and translation of sealing practice, participated in a new diplomatic ceremony of conveyance. This paper advances a reconsideration of text-image relations to account for ritual performance, both actual and symbolic.<br>

Abstract: In his book, Art and agency, Alfred Gell presents a theory of art based neither on aesthetics nor on visual communication. Art is defined by the distinctive function it performs in advancing social relationships through 'the abduction of agency'. Art objects are indexes of the artist's or model's agency. This article examines Gell's use of agency, particularly in relation to the ritual art that is central to his argument. Focusing on Gell's employment of Peirce's term 'index' (out of his triad of index, icon, and symbol), I note that Peirce's approach deflects attention from signification towards the link between art works and the things to which they refer. I consider what Peirce meant by abduction, and conclude that while Gell makes a good case for the agency of art objects he does not explain the distinctive ways in which art objects extend their maker's or user's agency. Gell lacked the time to make detailed revisions before publication and I acknowledge that, given more time, he might have revised some parts of the book. / Dans son livre Art and Agency, Alfred Gell présente une théorie de l'art qui ne se base ni sur l'esthétique, ni sur la communication visuelle. Il définit l'art par sa fonction distinctive dans l'établissement de relations sociales, par «l'abduction de l'intentionnalité (agency)». Les objets d'art sont des index de l'intentionnalité de l'artiste ou du modèle. Le présent article analyse l'utilisation par Gell de l'intentionnalité, notamment dans le cadre de l'art rituel qui constitue un axe central de son raisonnement. En se concentrant sur l'usage par Gell du terme «index» de Peirce (dans la trichotomie index, icône, symbole), l'auteur note que l'approche de Peirce prête moins d'attention à la signification qu'au lien entre les œuvres d'art et les objets auxquels elles font référence. Il examine ce que Peirce entendait par «abduction» et en conclut que si Gell s'en tire bien sur l'intentionnalité des objets d'art, il n'explique pas de quelle manière distinctive ceux-ci prolongent l'intentionnalité de leur créateur ou de leur utilisateur. Gell n'a pas eu le temps d'apporter des révisions détaillées à son ouvrage avant publication, et l'auteur estime que s'il avait eu davantage de temps, il en aurait peut-être remanié certaines parties.<br>

Abstract: The recent turbulent events in the Middle East indicate the importance and the challenges of uniting citizens in each of these countries in some commonly known story of who they are and from whence they have come. A consciously constructed sense of collective history is one especially fertile ground from which stories of national identity can be drawn. This article interprets a set of symbols displayed in a political drama in one particular Turkish small town. Following Ricoeur's analyses of ideology, it shows how sentiments of national identity are created and maintained in seemingly small ways. The symbols and processes which affirm identity, however, concomitantly disguise and distort other expressions of the historic situation. Although distortions may be the result of benign processes of signification, they may also be manipulated to favor the needs and desires of persons and groups which seek to maintain power and influence.<br>

Abstract: The literary epic Lāčplēsis, written in the nineteenth century, was a conscious attempt to create a cultural frame of reference for the emerging Latvian nation. In this article, which examines how poet Andrejs Pumpurs imagined his community, Kruks compares the Latvian epic hero with his Estonian counterpart, Kalevipoeg, who was invented at the same time under similar conditions of domination by Russians and Baltic Germans. Kruks's narrative analysis demonstrates the different frameworks through which social bonds are constructed for the heroes. Kalevipoeg is a pragmatic actor with an explicitly formulated duty; he errs, but he recognizes his personal responsibility. The Latvian hero Lāčplēsis, on the other hand, is not given a clearly formulated duty; he is simply a hero by destiny and definition. As a resource of symbols that feed contemporary discourses, the epic impedes the construction of a modern national identity capable of engendering a civic society through active pragmatic participation. For past generations, Lāčplēsis explained unjust foreign domination. Kruks argues that contemporary Latvian society now seeks a new frame of cultural reference that will permit the construction of a future-oriented national identity.<br>

Author(s): Cahill Lisa Sowle<br>
Abstract: Roman Catholic social ethics traditionally has affirmed moral objectivity, universal moral goods, and progressive social reform - premises that guide just war theory. In recent decades these guiding values have been challenged by contemporary critical philosophies, confessional or communitarian religious ethics, and the fact of cultural pluralism. I A the middle of this century, thinkers like John Courtney Murray gave Catholic ethics a more historical turn, while retaining an essentially realist and meliorist approach to morality and politics. Now this confidence and optimism are questioned anew by ethnopolitical violence, the ambiguities of humanitar- ian intervention, and uncertain attempts at reconciliation and restoration. Such developments show that the central quandary of Christian and po- litical ethics is not the achievement of agreement on basic human goods; it is the expansion of the circle of solidarity in which basic goods are shared in practice. I will suggest that Christian symbols can help evoke the sense of human solidarity that is necessary to sustain peace, and that transformative efforts toward peace in violence-torn societies can be successful.<br>

Abstract: One way into the question of the relation of ethics and liturgy is to focus on a critical issue facing liturgy today: its impoverishment and inability to nurture Christian faith and life. Three aspects of this problem are: injustice within the worshipping community, disagreement regarding forms of Christian service to the world, and the breakdown of symbols. Ethics must move beyond the articulation of formal principles and assertions regarding the importance of liturgy for the moral agent if it is to fulfill its task vis-à-vis these problems.<br>

Abstract: By focusing on children involved in the ritual practices in Ambonwari village, East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea, this essay compares two types of ritual: that of healing and that of male initiation. Like other life crisis rituals both deal with two dimensions of the Ambonwari life-world, that is with the living and the dead and, in a broader sense, with people and spirits. Though both are based upon the same cosmology there are fundamental differences between them. First, healers in healing ceremonies treat uninitiated children as 'non-beings'. From the perspective of Ambonwari 'selves' or 'beings', children belong to this domain. They exist as extensions of their parents or carers, from whom they cannot be separated conceptually. Second, by examining the Ambonwari concepts of negation I show that healers do not approach the domain of cosmological non-existence: they are not concerned with the cosmogony of the Ambonwari life-world. The male initiation rituals do just the opposite, however. It is only in the male initiation ritual, seen as a cosmogonic event, that young boys are cut off from their parents and 'thrown' abruptly into a state of becoming. Unlike the healing rites, these rituals treat young boys as both Ambonwari beginnings and Ambonwari beings. I argue that Ambonwari initiation rituals are not concerned with symbolic death followed by rebirth, but with states of being. Initiation means that death becomes possible for a child. The initiated boy will now be able to die as an Ambonwari being.<br>

Abstract: Accounts of intergroup conflict are symbolic constructions that are meaningful to informants in communicational contexts. Their use in comparative methodologies usually overlooks their meaningfulness to subjects in favor of some other level of reality, e. g., ecological, which is presumed to be more basic. The author argues that the social and cultural contextualizing of such data is logically prior to other analytical approaches and he illustrates his interpretive method by examining a "traditional," Eskimo (Takamiut) account of an Eskimo victory over Naskapi Indians as emergent from a particular socio-cultural context.<br>

Abstract: This paper departs from and problematizes the almost exclusive focus in criticism of Ngugi's early works on Christianity and the effects of the colonial intrusion. Following Ngugi's exhortation to resume the broken dialogue with the gods of his people, Ngugi's early novels are read in relation to precolonial East African discourses and practices of prophecy, Gikuyu religion, and Gikuyu nationalist strategies that drew on different and opposing prophetic traditions, and, in a broader sense, discourses of religion in Africa. By locating his early work within the nexus of these discourses, a far more nuanced view of Ngugi's relation to religious and nationalist discourses emerges. This paper also attempts to uncover a symbolic geometry in Ngugi's novels determined by Gikuyu religious and cultural concepts. A focus on The River Between reveals certain authorial deployments of historical inaccuracies and dislocations in the interests of a schematization of the conflicts in the novel.<br>

Abstract: This article constitutes an exploration of Mahmud Darwish's poem, "The Hoopoe," as part of a study on the relationship of myths to culture, in general, and to literature and poetry, in particular. It starts from the hoopoe as a mythical symbol pulling the text in two directions. First, a direction that relates the poem, through time, to the realms of the universe, dream, and poetry, using the language of insinuations and allusions; second, a fictional direction that makes of the the poem-through evocation of previous quest journeys, including texts by Al-Jahiz, Avicenna, Al-Suhrawardi, Al-Hallaj, Aristophanes, and Farid Al-Din Attar-a quest into the depths of the individual and the collective self. Memory, history, and language, culminate in the discovery of the mother-land. Thus, Darwish's poem may be classified as poetry, prose, drama, and epic. It is, in fact, a mixture of all these genres, as well as a literary myth narrating the story of the search for a sacred time-the time of beginnings, and of childhood. /تمثل المقالة حفراﹰ استبطانياﹰ في قصيدة "الهدهد" لمحمود درويش - ضمن بحث في علاقة الأساطير بالثقافة عامة وبالأدب والشعر خاصة - انطلاقاﹰ من الهدهد كرمز أسطوري يتجاذب النص في اتجاهين اثنين: أ- اتجاه جدولي، يصل القصيدة - عبر الزمن - بعالم الكون وعالم المنام وعالم الشعر في لغة اللمح والإشارة٠ ب- اتجاه أفقي قصصي، يجعل من القصيدة - عبر رحلات نموذجية سابقة ومن خلال نصوص حاضرة غائبة للجاحظ، وابن سينا، والسهروردي، والحلاج، وأرسطوفان، وفريد الدين العطار، وغيرهم - رحلة في أعماق الذات الفردية، وفي أعماق الذات الجماعية ذاكرة وتاريخاﹰ٠ تجمع قصيدة درويش بين "الشعر" و"النثر" والمسرحية والملحمة، كما أنها أسطورة أدبية تقص علينا قصة بحث عن زمن مقدس هو زمن البدايات والطفولة٠‬<br>

Abstract: The author suggests that all research is narrative. Resituating all research as narrative, as opposed to characterizing narrative as one particular form of inquiry, provides a critical space for rethinking research beyond current dualisms and bifurcations that create boundaries that limit the capacity for dialogue across diverse epistemologies. The contemporary bifurcation of research as either quantitative or qualitative, or as scientific or nonscientific, has resulted in a master narrative of research which assumes incommensurability across paradigms. The author weaves 3 questions through this research: (a) What is lost when narrative and science are constructed as opposing and incommensurable modes of inquiry? (b) How might scholars reconceptualize inquiry outside a binary framework that privileges science? and (c) In what ways can resituating all narrative as inquiry open spaces for dialogue across multiple epistemologies that is the heart of democratic inquiry? The author concludes by suggesting that narrative is not a method, but rather a process of meaning making that encompasses 3 major spheres of inquiry: the scientific (physical), the symbolic (human experience) and the sacred (metaphysical).<br>

Abstract: En este texto, el autor intenta esclarecer determinados aspectos del imaginario en relación con el Estado, la política, pero también en relación con la violencia y el mal, en un contexto en el que la dialéctica de la identidad y de la alteridad sigue siendo una de las estructuras del imaginario. El imaginario, más allá del ámbito exclusivo de las representaciones, actúa sobre el mundo y sobre la evolución de la historia. Pero el mundo también actúa sobre el imaginario y son los períodos de crisis los que amplían sus manifestaciones, destinadas a "a servir de pantalla contra los temores". En este sentido, la violencia, frente a la cual cabe adoptar actitudes diferentes, se convierte en un elemento simbólico para interpretar nuestras fuerzas. ¿Hasta qué punto estamos presenciando un nuevo modo de funcionamiento de los imaginarios políticos y religiosos? Para responder a esta pregunta, el autor habla de esperanza intercultural "en un mundo donde las voluntades de poder de lo trágico interfieren en los impulsos de lo comunicacional". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles? To answer this question, the author discusses intercultural hope "in a world in which the will of the power of the tragic interferes with communicational impulses."<br>

Abstract: L'auteur tente dans ce texte d'éclaircir certains aspects de l'imaginaire en relation avec l'Etat, la politique, mais aussi avec la violence et le mal, dans un contexte où la dialectique de l'identité et de l'altérité reste l'une des structures de l'imaginaire. L'imaginaire, débordant le champ exclusif des représentations, agit sur le monde et sur le mouvement de l'histoire. Mais le monde agit aussi sur l'imaginaire et ce sont les périodes de crise qui amplifient ses manifestations, appelées à "faire écran contre les peurs". C'est dans ce sens que la violence, face à laquelle différentes attitudes sont possibles, devient un élément symbolique pour interpréter nos forces. Jusqu'à quel point est-on en train d'assister à un nouveau mode de fonctionnement des imaginaires politiques et religieux ? Pour répondre à cette question l'auteur parle d'espérance interculturelle "dans un monde où les volontés de puissance du tragique brouillent les élans du communicationnel". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles?

Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Abstract: Le défi du groupe Luciole consiste à montrer l'intérêt heuristique d'une observation de la matérialité des formes symboliques. La campagne présidentielle 1988 par voie d'affiches, a servi de corpus. Nous avons ainsi décrit ces affiches comme des matériaux mixtes, complexes et hétérogènes : description des opérations cognitives, symboliques, interactives et intertextuelles qui permettent la construction et la co-construction des significations matérialisées dans l'affiche. Les résultats obtenus sont cumulables avec deux conceptualisations différentes : servir d'étalon pour mesurer la « réalité sociale » (l'émission et/ou la réception) ; ou attribuer au « sens » la valeur de condition de possibilité de la réalité sociale. The challenge take up by the LUCIOLE group is to demonstrate the heuristic interest of the observation of the materiality of symbolic forms. The posters of the French presidential election campaign of 1988 provided us with our study corpus. We have described these posters as mixed materials of a complex and heterogeneous nature. We describe the cognitive, symbolic, interactive and inter textual operations which allow for the construction and co-construction of the significations materialised in the posters. The results obtained may be added to those of two different conceptualisations. They may serve as benchmarks to measure « social reality » (its emission and/or reception) or, alternatively, give the « sense » of the poster a value as a condition for a possible social reality.<br>

Abstract: Le Quilt possède une double dimension, singulière et militante : chaque panneau, chaque nom énoncé lors du déploiement signifie l'unicité de chaque disparu ; mais l'assemblage des patchworks, leur abandon à l'association qui va les recueillir, les assembler et les utiliser pour porter à l'attention du monde entier l'énormité de la catastrophe renvoie à la dimension sociale inhérente au décès de chaque individu mort du sida. Le développement fulgurant du rite du patchwork aux États-Unis s'explique par ce double enjeu et par la réappropriation de symboles fondateurs de l'imaginaire américain. En se réappropriant un symbole commun, le Quilt légitime et réintègre la communauté gay porteuse du projet dans cette société qui l'a niée. The Quilt has from the outset both a singular and militant dimension : each panel, each name mentioned during the unfolding means the uniqueness of each dead ; but the assembled patchworks, their donation to the association which will conserve, assemble and use them to draw worldwide attention to this dreadful disaster refer to the social dimension inherent to each individual having died of AIDS. The extremely rapid development of the patchwork rite in the United States can be explained by these two functions and within the reappropriation of founding symbols of the Americans'world of imagination. By reappropriating a common symbol the Quilt legitimates and reintegrates the gay community, bearer of the project, into a society from which it was rejected. Von Anfang an hat der Quilt eine eigenartige und zugleich militante Dimension. Jeder Teil des Patchworks, jeder Name, der während der Entfaltung ausgesprochen wird, besagt die Eigenartigkeit jedes Gestorbenen. Doch verweisen das Zusammenfügen der Patchworkwerke und ihre Überlassung dem Verein, der sie bewahren, zusammenfügen und verwenden wird, um die Aufmerksamkeit der ganzen Welt auf diese schreckliche Katastrophe zu lenken, auf die dem Tode jedes AIDSkranken inhärente soziale Dimension. Das äusserst schnelle Fortschreiten des Patchworksritus in den Vereinigten Staaten lässt sich durch diese zwei Aufgaben and durch die Wiederaneignung von Grundsymbolen der amerikanischen Einbildungswelt erklären. Durch die Wiederaneignung eines gemeinen Symbols legitimiert und reintegriert der Quilt die homosexuelle Gemeinschaft, die das Projekt trägt, in eine Gesellschaft, die sie zurückgeworfen hat.<br>

Abstract: En étudiant les récits de vie des paysans roumains du Banat et d'Olténie déportés dans les années cinquante dans la plaine de Bǎrǎgan, nous avons essayé de mettre en évidence de quelle façon le récit de vie peut être un révélateur d'une réalité ethno-historique et anthropologique. Nous avons souligné le problème d'ordre méthodologique qu'une telle étude pose au chercheur. Dans un premier temps, nous avons discuté le statut discursif du récit de vie comme discours de témoignage, et les conséquences qui en dérivent pour son analyse comme texte narratif et argumentatif qui développe une rhétorique spécifique. Une description du contexte historique auquel font référence les textes, ainsi que des circonstances dans lesquelles l'enquête orale a été menée, nous a semblé nécessaire pour dégager l'importance du thème de l'identité et de la différence dans les récits de nos interlocuteurs. En analysant ce thème, nous avons tenu compte des constellations idéologiques et symboliques qui dominent ces développements dans le texte des critères que les paysans utilisent pour se différencier de l'Autre sous ses différents visages. L'analyse de ces facteurs suggère des pistes intéressantes pour déceler certaines mentalités et pratiques culturelles, surtout celles liées au foyer et à la famille et aux pratiques culinaires. Studiind povesteǎ vieţii a 70 de ţǎrani deporţati între anii 1951-1956 în Bǎrǎgan am pus în evidenţǎ problemele de ordin metodologic şi teoretic cu care se confruntǎ cercetǎorul dornic sǎ reconstituie o realitate istoricǎ, etnograficǎ şi antropologicǎ pornind de la mǎrturiile celor ce povestesc evenimentul deportǎrii. Purtînd mǎrcile subiecti viaţii naratorului şi a unei ideologii personale aceste texte sunt în acelaşţi timp naraţiuni şi o formǎ de a depune mǎrturie. Ele dezvoltǎ deci o retoricǎ specialǎ prin care faptul trǎit se transformǎ în fapt povestit şi se comunicǎ unui interlocutor. Analia acestei retorici necesitǎ cunoaşterea discursurilor prin care evenimentul ne parvine, a condiţiilor în care s-a desfǎşurat ancheta, compararea povestirilor între ele pentru a constata apropierile diferenþele şi mai ales diferitele tipuri de focalizǎri. Acestea din urmǎ ne permit sa sesizǎm ce e mai important pentru cel ce povesteşte şi de ce. Pentru a ilustra aceasta problematicǎ ne-am oprit la tema identitǎţii şi alţeritǎţii, încercînd sǎ urmǎrim constelatiile idéologice şi culturale sub semnul cǎrora stau expansiunile ei in texte, criteriile prin care Celǎlalt este identificat şi prezentat. Through the study of the life stories told by the Romanian peasants of Banat and Oltenie, who were deported during the 1950s to the plain of Baragan, this article attempts to show how such biographical accounts can serve to reveal an ethno-historical and anthropological reality.We begin by underlining the methodological problems that such studies pose for the researcher. We discuss the discursive status of these accounts as a discourse intended to bear witness and the implications of this status for an analysis as a narrative and argumentative text, generating its own specific rhetoric. Along with an account of how this oral enquiry was carried out, it also seemed necessary to give a description of the historical context to which these accounts refer, in order to draw attention to the theme of identity and difference in the accounts given. The analysis of this theme required that due attention be paid do the ideological and symbolic constellations that surround it, in the criteria that the peasants use to differentiate the Other, in his or her multifarious guises. The examination of these factors offers several interesting lines of enquiry on cultural practices and mentalities, and on those in particular which relate to the household, the family and culinary habits. Indem wir die Lebensgeschichten der rumänischen Bauern aus Banat und Oltenie studierten, die in den fünfziger Jahren in die Ebene von Baragan vertrieben wurden, versuchten wir, herauszustellen, wie die Lebensgeschichte eine volksgeschichtliche und anthropologische Wirklichkeit ans Licht stellen kann. Wir haben das methodologische Problem betont, die sich für den Forscher aus derartigen Studie ergibt. Zuerst haben wir den erzählerischen Status der Lebenserzählung als Zeugnisrede erörtert, sowohl als auch die Folgen, die sich daraus ergeben, wenn sie als erzählender und argumentierender Text analysiert werden soll, der eine spezifische Rhetorik entwickelt. Eine Schilderung des historischen Zusammenhangs, worauf sich die Texte beziehen, und der Umstände, unter denen die mündliche Befragung sich abspielte, kam uns als notwendig vor, um die Bedeutung des Themas der Identität und des Unterschieds in den Erzählungen unserer Gesprächspartner hervorzuheben. In der Analyse dieses Themas nahmen wir die ideologischen und symbolischen Konstellationen in Kauf, die in den Textstellen vorherrschend sind, wo die Kriterien dargelegt werden, die die Bauern benutzen, um sich von dem Anderen unter seinen verschiedenen Gesichten zu unterscheiden. Die Analyse dieser Faktoren legt uns interessante Forschungswege nahe, die es erlauben, manche Denkweisen und kulturelle Verhaltensweisen herauszuheben, und zwar insbesondere diejenigen, die mit dem Heim -, Familienleben und Kochsitten verbunden sind.<br>

Abstract: La sociabilité méridionale offre l'occasion d'un débat pluri-transdisciplinaire dont l'auteur, à la suite des historiens et des ethnologues, a tenté d'établir une typologie. Il s'agira d'approfondir la dimension politique dont certains cercles de villages font preuve, tant par leur action au sein d'une démocratie participative que par un ensemble de pratiques recourant à la notion de légitimité. Parmi ces mécanismes de contre-pouvoir, le patrimoine politique dont le cercle est le symbole recouvre la notion d'un imaginaire qui trouve à la fois ses sources dans l'histoire locale et dans la mémoire nationale. The southern sociability offers the opportunity of a pluri-transdisciplinary debate of which the author, following historians and ethnologists, tried to establish a typology. The purpose here is to better define the political dimension of some village circles revealed both through their action within a participative democracy and a set of practices appealing to the notion of legitimacy. Among these counterpower mechanisms the political heritage symbolised by the circle covers the notion of imagination rooted both in the local history and the national memory. Die südfranzösische Geselligkeit bietet die Gelegenheit einer inter- und transdisziplinären Debatte. Der Autor hat versucht, deren Typologie zu erstellen, dabei Historikern und Ethnologen folgend. Es handelt sich hier darum, die politische Dimension näher zu bestimmen, die einige Dorfkreise durch ihre Tätigkeit innerhalb einer partizipativen Demokratie sowie durch eine Gesamtheit von Praktiken aufzeigen, die den Begriff der Legitimität in Anspruch nehmen. Unter diesen Gegenkraftsmechanismen umfasst das durch den Kreis symbolisierte politische Erbe den Begriff der Vorstellungswelt, die in der lokalen Geschichte und dem nationalen Gedächtnis gewurzelt ist.<br>

Abstract: Au Brésil, le récit officiel concernant la mémoire de l'esclavage différe nettement de la vision des leaders du mouvement noir contemporain, notamment à propos de la situation et des conditions de vie des Afro-Brésiliens à Rio de Janeiro. Ce mouvement demande à l'État et à la société brésilienne de reconnaître les conditions misérables dans lesquelles les esclaves ont été laissés après l'abolition de l'esclavage, mais aussi la contribution des esclaves à la construction de la société, de l'économie et de la culture brésiliennes et enfin le racisme dont les Afro-Brésiliens sont encore l'objet. Aujourd'hui, des décisions juridiques tendent à favoriser une égalité effective, permettant ainsi l'émergence d'une image positive de la culture afro-brésilienne. This article discusses the difference between the official account on the memory of slavery in Brazil and how contemporary black movement's leaders, notably in Rio de Janeiro, see the Afro-Brazilians' situation and living conditions. This movement, which seeks to reveal in public space the memory of slavery and its consequences, claims Brazilian State and society to recognize not only the miserable conditions under which former slaves were left after the abolition of slavery, but the contribution of the slaves to the construction of Brazilian society, economy and culture and also that Afro-Brazilians are still the object of racism. If in today's Brazil, the public debate on reparations comprises a legal aspect of rectification, by creating measures aiming to provide effective equality, this discussion also takes the form of symbolic fight, in which one of the objectives is to build a positive image of the Afro-Brazilian culture. In Brasilien weicht die offizielle Berichterstattung über die Wahrnehmung der Sklaverei vor allem in Bezug auf die Situation und Lebensbedingungen der Afro-Brasilianer in Rio de Janeiro stark ab von der Sichtweise der Führer der zeitgenössischen « Schwarzen-Bewegung ». Die Bürgerbewegung fordert von der brasilianischen Regierung und Gesellschaft die Anerkennung der schlechten Lebensbedingungen unter denen die Menschen seit der Abschaffung der Sklaverei leben. Sie verlangen ebenso die Einbeziehung der ehemaligen Sklaven in den gesellschaftlichen, wirtschaftlichen und kulturellen Prozess sowie die Anerkennung des Rassismus, dem Afro-Brasilianer noch immer zum Opfer fallen. Die derzeitige Rechtsprechung scheint eine tatsächliche Gleichheit zu fördern und trägt so zur Entwicklung eines zunehmend positiven Bildes der afro-brasilianischen Kultur bei.<br>

Abstract: Rappelant la spécificité occidentale des valeurs historiques et commémoratives liées au temps « décimal » tel l'an 2000, l'article s'interroge sur des échéances temporelles dont la portée se trouve massivement amplifiée par le tourisme, les médias, les sites Internet, et une attente millénariste qui les transforme en reflet des fautes de l'Occident et des technologies. Des auteurs tels que Ricœur, De Martino, Marramao mettent en avant le temps vécu et reconnaissent que les cultures interagissent avec le temps pour produire des valeurs symboliques qui reflètent leurs propres choix. Aujourd'hui cependant il semble nécessaire de reconnaître la fracture du temps de l'historicisme et de l'humanisme de De Martino, et d'accepter des modalités plurielles et hétérogènes de la pensée, de l'expérience temporelle. The article recalls the Western specificity of historical and commemorative values related to « decimal » time, such as the year 2000. It questions about deadlines the consequences of which are massively amplified by tourism, medias, Internet sites and millenarist waiting and turned into a reflection of Western faults and technologies. Authors such as Ricœur, De Martino, Marramao are interested in the time lived and admit that cultures use time to produce symbolic values reflecting their own choices. But today it seems necessary to acknowledge time fracture in De Martino's historicism and humanism and to accept plural and heterogenous modalities of thought and temporal experience. Der Artikel erinnert an die mit der Dezimalzeit, wie dem Jahr 2000, verbundene westliche Spezifizität der geschichtlichen und Gedenkwerte, und fragt sich über Terminen deren Tragweite massenweise durch den Tourismus, die Medien, das Internet und das Warten auf das Millenium verstärkt wird, die sie in die Spiegelung der westlichen Fehler und Technologien verwandeln. Autore wie Ricœur, De Martino, Marramao interessieren sich fur die gelebte Zeit und erkennen an, dass die Kulturen die Zeit gebrauchen, um symbolische Werte zu produzieren, die ihre eigene Wahlen widerspiegeln. Doch scheint es heute notwendig, den sozialen Zeitbruch von De Martino's Historizismus und Humanismus anzuerkennen und die pluralen und heterogenen Modalitäten des Denkens und der zeitlichen Erfahrung anzunehmen.<br>

Abstract: This article argues for a synthesis of George Herbert Mead's conception of the temporal and intersubjective nature of the self with Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory of narrative identity. Combining the insights of Ricoeur's philosophical analysis with Mead's social-psychological orientation provides a subtle, sophisticated, and potent explanation of self-identity. A narrative conception of identity implies that subjectivity is neither a philosophical illusion nor an impermeable substance. Rather, a narrative identity provides a subjective sense of self-continuity as it symbolically integrates the events of lived experience in the plot of the story a person tells about his or her life. The utility of this conception of identity is illustrated through a rereading of Erving Goffman's study of the experience of mental patients. This example underlines the social sources of the self-concept and the role of power and politics in the construction of narrative identities.<br>

Abstract: As the twentieth century comes to an end, and with it a millennium, there has been much heated reflection on the passing age and the period of transition. Among the many characteristic phenomena of modern times, globalization has attracted particularly much attention. The process of European integration may be traced back to ancient times (vide Roman imperialism or Carolingian universalism). Recently, however, globalization has expanded and it has accelerated considerably. The author of this paper focuses on the current, paradoxical coexistence of global tendencies toward integration on the one hand and very clearly manifested, diversifying (or even separatists) national and nationalist tendencies on the other hand. The author analyzes these homogenizing tendencies at the level of media pop culture on the one hand and the increasing, even acute, awareness of diversity, including the diversity of national cultures, on the other hand. She does so within the framework of the symbolic culture concept. Contemporarily, tendencies toward globalization are suspended between the Scylla of uniformizatdon and the Charybdis of diversity. Sociology is particularly qualified to study these phenomena, at both local and universal levels.<br>

Abstract: Even though the European Union has become an "ever closer union" in economic and political terms, the problem of the emotional deficit of the EU identity calls for solutions. Metaphor offers an untypical yet interesting mechanism of overcoming the alien aura of the EU. Taking into consideration the cognitive value of metaphors, Antony Judge, the EU expert, designed the dynamic system of metaphors to articulate the new European identity. At the same time, in the candidate countries the alternative discourses of European identity emerge. Polish press makes use of the emotional potential of metaphors. With the help of metaphors Polish pubic discourse grounds the claim of the rightful and necessary belonging of Poland to the European Union thus engaging in symbolic politics. Moreover, through metaphoric images the relations between Europe and the "Self" are critically or ironically assessed. In an ambiguous period of accession negotiations these metaphors empowered Polish public to create their own conceptions of what the European identity is.<br>

Abstract: This paper seeks to outline and evaluate Pierre Bourdieu's work as it has appeared most recently in feminist studies and the field of gender and education. In particular, it suggests ways in which Bourdieu's theoretical insights could be seen to more effectively contribute to cutting edge debates in both social theory and feminist thought regarding concepts such as agency, identity and domination. It also argues that a more creative and empirical engagement with the recent work of Bourdieu, alongside an interdisciplinary reading of more recent cultural and social theories of power, would be a fruitful way forward in advancing a feminist sociology of education. In the present historical moment and against the tide of postmodern and post-structuralist feminist accounts, Bourdieu is often read as a determinist who has little to offer contemporary feminist debates or who argues that masculine domination is too tightly woven to social practices of a given field. In short, this paper argues that such a view is not only a misreading of Bourdieu's work on fundamental theoretical grounds, but fails to acknowledge the ways in which his more recent work on masculinity addresses both the cultural and social conditions underlying contemporary forms of symbolic domination. In short, the paper argues that Bourdieu's theory offers an analytical breadth and range beyond the scope of anything that a normative, liberal account of masculine domination could provide. Yet, in drawing from such diversity, Bourdieu's oeuvre is able to resist incomprehensibility. It stands as a highly focused, realistic and generative attempt (McNay, 1999; McLeod, 2004) to chart the problems of subordination, differentiation and hierarchy, and to expose the possibilities, as well as the limits, of gendered self-hood.<br>

Abstract: This article examines social memories in France over the last 10 years. There has been a significant amount of 'memory work' during this period, concerning various aspects of French history, including the World Wars, but predominantly postcolonial issues: the Algerian War, the legacy of slavery, memories of Empire and memories of Immigration in particular. The 'devoir de mémoire' (duty to remember) and 'work of memory' (Paul Ricœur) have taken on greater, and controversial, proportions. While President Jacques Chirac was for some the 'président du devoir de mémoire' (President who championed the duty to remember), President Nicolas Sarkozy seems intent on ending what he sees as the trend towards 'repentance'. After a discussion of the wider memory culture in France, this article focuses on collective and social memories of the Franco-Algerian War (1954-62) Through an analysis of various 'vectors of memory' (Henry Rousso) it argues that the recent upsurge in 'memory work' in France is very much anchored in the present postcolonial social context in France. That memory work is however largely symbolic and in some ways unsatisfactory. It shows that much of the recent work of memory has been only belatedly and partially undertaken by the State, and with civil society in some ways yet to follow.<br>

Abstract: This study argues that the exponential growth of divinatory texts variously attributed to ᶜAlī and Jaᶜfar al-Ṣādiq included at the end of Qur'ans produced during the Ṣafavid period provides further evidence for the widespread interest in divination during the tenth/sixteenth and eleventh/seventeenth centuries in Iran. Treatises on 'divination by the Qur'an' (fāl-i Qur'ān) indicate that it was considered permissible to seek guidance by means of holy scripture at this time. On a more symbolic level, fāl-i Qur'āns can be understood as a kind of restoration of the 'defective' ᶜUthmānic codex by re-Shïᶜifying it-if not by reinserting supposedly dropped verses on the ahi al-bayt, then at the very least by adding terminal divinations attributed to the figureheads of Shīᶜī Islam. This particular practice therefore follows general 'Shīᶜification' trends found in a number of cultural and artistic practices of the Ṣafavid period, which also are potentially discernible within the domain of Qur'an production. هذه الدراسة تذهب إلى أن النمو الهائل من النصوص التي تتنبأ بالمستقبل والمنسوبة بأشكال مختلفة لعلي وجعفر الصادق والملحقة بنهاية المصاحف التي أنتجت ﺧﻼﻝ الفترة الصفوية تقدم مزيداﹰ من اﻷدلة على اﻻهتمام واسع النطاق بالعراﻓﺔ في ايران ﺧﻼﻝ القرون / العاشر والحادي عشر السادس عشر / السابع عشر . وتشير المصنفات في الفأل بالقرآن إلى أنه ﺧﻼﻝ تلك الحقبة كان التماس التوجيه من الكتاب المقدس يعتبر أمرا جائزاﹰ. على مستوى أكثر رمزية، فإن فأل القرآن يمكن أن يفهم على أنه معالجة للمصحف العثماني بإعادة " تشييعه " وهذا وإن لم يكن من ﺧﻼﻝ إعادة آيات تتعلق بآل البيت يدعى أنها مسقطة من اﻷصل، فعلى اﻷقل من ﺧﻼﻝ زيادة تنبؤات في آخر المصحف بعد النص القرآني منسوبة لرموز الشيعة. لهذا فإن هذا العمل يتبع توجهات " تشييع " وجدت في عدد من الممارسات الثقافية والفنية في العصر الصفوي يمكن أيضاﹰ ﻣﻼحظتها في إطار إنتاج المصاحف .<br>

Abstract: O artigo é uma leitura do debate epistemológico sobre as condições de conhecimento na antropologia. Partindo das críticas que o próprío C. Geertz faz a seus seguidores, a autora se propõe a avaliar o potencial crítico da hermenêutica. Recupera seu questionamento acerca da oposiçâo sujeito/objeto e propõe a busca de uma objetividade negociada interpares e situada historicamente. A partir desse debate questiona-se uma ciência pura e sem implicações práticas e morais. O percurso que faz avaliando vários autores lhe permite concluir que o excesso de relativismo ou de subjetivismo transforma toda possibilidade de ciência em ficção. Para dar conta em sua etnografia dos sistemas simbólicos não lingüísticos, a autora busca um diálogo entre a teoría antropológica e as teorias nativas e afirma que é na experiência vivida em campo que está a fertilidade das perguntas e reformulações de conceitos da antropologia. This article is an attempt to interpret the epistemological debate concerning conditions of knoledge in antropology. Discussing the criticism which C. Geertz has made in regard to the work of his followers, the autor proposes to evaluate the critical potential of hermeneutics. A critique of the subject-object split opens the way for proposing a form of objectivity wich is historically located and negotiated among equals. This debate constitutes a point os departure for questioning the notion of a pure science devoid of moral and practical implications. In the course of discussing a number of authors, the conclusion may well be that excessive relativism and subjectivism transform all possibilities of science into fiction. In order to deal with nonlinguistic symbolic systems in etnography, the author sees the importance of dialogue between anthropological theory and native theory. Fertile grounds for raising questions and reformulating anthropological concepts are found in fieldword experience.<br>

Abstract: O artigo procura discutir a contribuição da perspectiva antropológica para a análise de conflitos, contrastando a ênfase da Antropologia na pesquisa empírica com a orientação predominantemente doutrinária que caracteriza o Direito. Dialogando com textos de repercussão significativa na Antropologia do Direito, o artigo realça a importância da dimensão simbólica dos direitos, caracterizada como aspecto central do universo empírico investigado, e sem a qual demandas por direitos, acordos e decisões judiciais não podem ser adequadamente compreendidos. The article makes a brief assessment of the contribution of Anthropology's perspective to the analysis of conflicts, contrasting Anthropology's emphasis in empirical research with the doctrinarian approach that predominates in Law. Drawing on significant texts in the Anthropology of Law, the article highlights the symbolic dimension of rights, characterized as a core aspect of empirical data, and without which demands for rights, judicial agreements and decisions cannot be adequately understood.<br>

Abstract: Although today much of the Mayo-Yoreme sacred myths and their inherent symbolism is rather esoteric knowledge, known to a few only, the community's performance of the responso (ritual of honoring the dead) is important for the re-establishment of relationships between humans and the supernatural beings and between living persons and the ancestors. The communal experience of the responso and the sense of beingenjoined are characteristic of the spiritual experience and fundamental to the musical experience as well Since life/death of any individual is an experience tied to other individuals, I argue that a philosophical inquiry of selfhood—of both the individual and the community—may help us reason about and make possible an understanding of the responso.<br>

Abstract: The principle of hermeneutical interpretation (i.e., the art and discipline of analyzing the symbols of sacred texts) is explained and applied to the analytical group situation. It is maintained that the approach employed by this methodology provides a viable manner for understanding patients' unconscious communications. In particular, the relationship between metaphorical communication and the here-and-now therapeutic experience is discussed. It is argued that the unconscious manifests itself as a set o f metaphorical expressions. The paper presents two clinical vignettes illustrating how this hermeneutical methodology can aid the therapist to "read" the unconscious meanings of such metaphors.<br>

Abstract: In the quest for a more sustainable environment, there appears to be a need to confront issues of tradition vs. modernity and culture vs. technology in a world where boundaries once dividing these issues are collapsing, and differences once separating them are disappearing. This study demonstrates, through examination of a series of built examples, the successful integration of tradition and modernity as they are reflected in Muslim cultures. In practice, the notion of culture and technology is addressed through the built context, ultimately establishing the identity of a society through its architecture. This paper argues for the preservation of a culture through understanding the level of symbolism established in its built environment: the higher the level of symbolism, the further detached an artifact becomes from its place of origin. This research focuses on possible scenarios involving the conscious application of past and present typologies of form and technology in search of a recognizable cultural identity.<br>

Abstract: Stanislaw Lem's "Solaris" vividly embodies the problems surrounding the semantic status of fantastic utterances. It poses the problems as two related questions: what is the "objective" meaning of the notion of the Solarian ocean for the Solarist researchers in the novel, and what is the "symbolic" meaning of the novel's fantastic ocean for its readers. Since the diegetic planet Solaris has no objective relation to the meaning-producing dynamics of human work, the Solarian ocean is a projection of familiar human meanings. As for the fantastic ocean represented for the reader, it can be approached via several semantic interpretations, none of which are fully adequate. Three such approaches are the plasmatic, i.e., the different descriptions of the ocean are instances of the dominant metasemic lexeme "plasma"; the vaginal, i.e., the ocean is a displaced image of female sexuality; and the schizophrenic, i.e., the ocean is an instance of a schizophrenic "miraculation-machine" (derived from Deleuze-Guattari's Anti-Oedipus).<br>

Abstract: The article is intended to indicate how the study of written and cultural texts may be used to approach the problem of identifying the system of thought characteristic of particular groups. Certain premises of what may be called an “interpretative paradigm” have been selected to create a theoretical starting-point, and in this context the most suggestive appear to be the concept of culture developed by symbolic anthropology, the cultural-semiotic concept of text and the multi-dimensional hermeneutic approach to textual intepretation. The author therefore seeks to bring together, in addition to the general features ofinterpetative ethnology, certain theoretical and methodological starting-points derived from the three approaches mentioned. One may approach the problem of understanding of a foreign testimony via “adequate interpretation”. Here, to understand means to adopt the cultural “language” of a message as one's own, and to interpret and so transfer the unknown into an accessible code, most often one's own code. The process of interpretation is understood as the discovery of the hidden content behind the apparent stirface, and in this activity the understanding of culturally remote testimony is axiomatically taken to bepossible and communicable. In a broader epistemological context we can see in adequate intepretation one of the means to the never-ending process of correction of our pre-judged knowledge. In a spirit of critical rationalism we could deflne such interpretation as the working hypothesis that may be falsified by further Scientific activity and then replaced by a better theory. Such conclusions on the methodological range of the interpretative approach indicate only one of the possible syntheses of various epistemological paradigms, for the theoretical use and application of which ethnology seems especially suited.<br>

Abstract: The article presents an analysis of the concept of „subject“ in ethnography from its historical origins through its development over the span of the 20th century. Furthermore, based on her own experience of different cultures, the author conføonts the implicit Western philosophical background in anthropological conceptualisations of the subject and the ethnographic research with alternative philosophical frameworks, specifically the reflexive approach developed by female anthropologists. The main focus of the text lies on a re-conceptualisation of the ethnographic research as an inter-subjective process, and on a new emphasis on the role of the subject in the culture-productive processes of symbolic negotiation.<br>

Abstract: Bohumil Nuska points out the predominant limited conception of rhythm, which is usually linked only with acoustically symbolized and aurally perceived rhythms, while the rhythms that are optically symbolized and visually perceived are utterly ignored. In lyric verse, the double, parallel mental construction, which stems from the opposition of syllable and morpheme as constituents of a higher construct of the word, creates parallel Iines of mixed mental spaces of linear and non-linear rhythms (the rhythm of verse, the rhythm of the situation; the atmosphere of the verse, and the atmosphere of the situation). Shared abstract structures in generic spaces within individual mixed spaces of lyric rhythm are shared axiological structures, represented at the highest level of abstraction by tension and relaxation (detension). The dynamic nature of these structures stems from the asymmetric distribution of tension and relaxation with regard to the dualistic symmetrical model of the axiological system. And thus deviations from its axial scheme emerge, creating these four parallel rhythmicized lyric structures (in terms of form). Similarity amongst the individual mixed mental spaces is only possible in a fractal dimension. In this theory, presented as a working hypothesis, it is assumed that the forms of the rhythm of the verse, the rhythm of the situation, the atmosphere of the verse, and the atmosphere of the situation, will be similar to each other, and their fractal mutual similarity emerges from the text.<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Abstract: Since the Kantian revolution, metaphysical knowledge has been articulated by influential theologians in the language of analogy. In accordance with this tradition, the metaphor found in Luke-Acts, that God does live in houses, but not houses built by men, is explored by studying it as a root metaphor. A root metaphor in the theological sense can be defined as the most basic assumption we can make about man's existence and experience. In this article John H Elliott's proposal that 'temple' and 'household' in Luke-Acts articulate a contrast in social institutions is debated. I wish to argue that this 'contrast' does not really articulate a shift in social institutions, but rather a broadening of an existing social institution as the result of a changed symbolic universe. This shift in symbolic universe is studied against the backdrop of a tendency to broaden the temple as a theological symbol which had already started and which intensified during the Second temple period. It is shown that the temple, its sacrificial offerings and purifying rituals, were closely associated with the household, its meals and purifying ceremonies. Jesus also advocated the broadening of the concept temple/household. His view is reportedly conveyed by Stephen, Peter, James, and Paul.<br>

Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and the extension of anthropological research into the urban and industrial heartlands of the ' developed' world. These substantive consequences have established incontrovertibly the appropriateness and potency of anthropology in the study of such societies; and have also provided a basis from which to inform the core debates and central concepts of the discipline. These developments are evident in recent studies of kinship, social identity and symbolism. The reflexivity which is an essential ingredient of research on these topics (until recently noted with more eloquence and alacrity in France than in Britain) calls attention to the inevitable, and desirable, intrusion of the Self into anthropological research. It also demands the explicit incorporation of the complex Self-Other opposition in the fomulation of anthropological 'problems' — not as a baring of the post-modernist soul, but as an interpretive resource. An important illustration of the power of this resource may be found in the study of ethnic and local identities which are thereby revealed to be a matter of internal discourse (among Selves, so to speak) as well as of relativistic counter-definition. It is in precisely this way that research in anthropologists' 'parochial' or local milieux will contribute to the maturation of anthropology generally.<br>

Abstract: The article examines the phenomenon of communist/post-socialist nostalgia, with a focus on Slovenia and Poland, through the central issue of identity, memory and the concrete manifestations of nostalgia. The emergence of a somewhat distinct 'Eastern European' identity and the East--West divide in historical and cultural terms is explored throught several historical events of the European project between the World Wars. The revival of the communist brands, commercial products, symbols, music and film is the core of the communist 'renaissance', witnessing mainly the need for encountering the past, the selevtiveness of memory and the right and emotional need to value one's own personal history and past.<br>

Abstract: L'expresivité phonologigue de la langue poétique tchèque Nous disposons aujourd'hui de preuves suffisantes pour croire au bien fondé du symbolisme phonétique véritable. Selon les oeuvres cités de Jakobson, Fónagy et Žuravlev on peut donc considérer comme acquis le fait que certaines significations sont naturellement attachées à certains sons et que tout phonème lorsqu'il est réalisé peut se charger de symbolisme par référence à isa nature articulatoire et acoustique. Le but de ce travail est de créer le point de départ objectif a l'interprétation phonostylistique du symbolisme phonétique des sons tchèques. L'auteur suit la doctrine de la méthode psychosémantique, il utilise la différentielle sémantique et présente a 40 sujets tchèques les phonème de leur langue maternelle. Jiráček prouve la validité de son approche par la confrontation des résultats parmi dix groupes des sujets tchèques a 40 personnes. Les résultats de l'ensemble de 400 sujets ont montré des facultés considérables des phonèmes tchèques pour l'expressivité phonologigue univoque. Ala fin de son étude l'auteur cherche d mettre en relation ses constatations scientifiques avec le domaine de la langue poétique tchèque. Il crée les points de départ a la comprehension automatique de la composition des sons du vers. Il donne naissance (en collaboration avec L. Popelinský) du programme automatique de cette analyse du vers et son fonctionnement présente sur la traduction du poème de Paul Verlaine.<br>

Abstract: The 1990s and 2000s saw a memory and remembrance boom at both the national and supra-/transnational level. Crucially, many of these emerging memory frames were not simply about a glorious and heroic past, as in, for example, traditional nationalist narratives. Rather, groups started to narrate their symbolic boundaries in a more inclusive way by admitting past wrongdoings. In this article, we look at a corpus of so-called 'speculative speeches' by leading politicians in the European Union and, against the aforementioned historical background, analyse their representations of Europe's past, present and future. By utilising the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse analysis, narrative theory and elements of Reinhart Koselleck's conceptual history (Begriffsgeschichte), we illustrate how, first, a 'new Europe', based on admitting failure, is narrated. However, second, we also show that such a self-critical narration of a 'bitter past' is, paradoxically, transformed into a self-righteous attitude towards Europe's 'others'.<br>

Abstract: Studies of laboratory research in the natural sciences have shown the significance of crossexperimenter dialogue in the determination of scientific facts. Behavioral and social scientists have largely ignored that role in the construction of scientific facts. A dialogic data base differs epistemogically from strict behavioral observations because of its retroductive and dialectic character. Its symbolic nature calls for hermeneutic efforts designed to achieve and assess consensual rather than empirical validation. Its ultimate aim is social organization rather than prediction and control. In view of this distinction, experimental research of human behavior must show the integration of the empirical and dialogic bases of behavioral data so as to more accurately reflect its constructive nature.<br>

Abstract: The relations between language and imagery are addressed by cross referencing Lacan and James Hillman, along with Mead, Geschwind, and Gibson. Not only is neither symbolic frame reducible to the other, but neither can be rooted in perceptual capacities that would be distinct from or more "primitive" than the other. Outside of specific theoretical agendas that would analyze one by simplifying the other, word and image are co-emergent and co-dependent expressions of the inherent openness of the human mind.<br>

Abstract: In attempting to achieve some form of mapping between consciousness (specifically, consciousness₆) and cognition, I distinguish between a weak and a strong version of the hypothesis, indicating a change in mode of thinking of a metaphoric-symbolic nature (Glicksohn, 1993). The weak version would claim that metaphors, symbols, analogies and images are used in an attempt to depict the experience, which is not easily translatable into words. The strong version would claim that metaphoric thinking is one of the hallmarks of the experience, and is used both in an attempt to depict the experience and also to convey to the reader, and possibly to induce in the reader, some of the qualities of that experience. My discussion of these two options is preceded by some comments on problems inherent in studying altered or alternate states of consciousness. I also discuss the relationships among physiognomic perception, cognitive dedifferentiation, and symbolic cognition.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo procura abordar os papéis de sacerdote, chefe e xamã - todos presentes no ngillatun, ritual de fertilidade mapuche - da perspectiva de seus modos diferenciais de travar relações por meio da linguagem. A linguagem, conforme entendida pelos Mapuche do meio rural chileno, não emerge exclusivamente das intenções de falantes individuais, mas igualmente da força (newen) constitutiva da totalidade do ser. Sacerdotes, chefes e xamãs recorrem à fala para alinhar-se a essa força, que por meio deles se atualiza. Uma tal observação lança nova luz sobre o entendimento de Clastres quanto à relação entre chefia e linguagem. Se, acompanhando os Mapuche, enfatizamos as qualidades indexicais da linguagem, em detrimento das simbólicas, vemos que se torna um tanto problemático analisar a linguagem dos chefes em conformidade com um modelo de “troca”, como faz Clastres. This paper seeks to approach the roles of priest, chief, and shaman — all present in the Mapuche ngilUtun fertility ritual -from the perspective of their differential modes of relating through language. Language, as understood by rural Mapuche, emerges not solely from the intentions of individual speakers, but equally from the force -newen -constitutive of all being. Priests, chiefs, and shamans all seek to align themselves through speech to this force which instantiates itself through them. Such an observation casts new light on Clastres' understanding of the relationship between chiefs and language. If we follow Mapuche in emphasizing the indexical rather than symbolic qualities of language, we see that Clastres'analysis of chiefly language as susceptible to a model of "exchange" becomes somewhat problematic.<br>

Abstract: To discuss the practice of memory and its relations to politics, social scientists rely on three kinds of practices - memorialising, memorising and the act of remembering/forgetting. The commemoration of "1857" is unique in that official celebrations of the event have been instituted even as 1857 continues to refigure in myths and endures as a symbol of popular resistance. The articles in this special issue address the seeming contradictions and complexities that "remembering" 1857 involves, and the tension that prevails between different kinds of recall.<br>

Abstract: If nations are "imagined communities" as many theorists like to define them, then they need an ideology to create a cohesive imagination. In modern times, the project of writing "history" has been an important instrument in the service of this ideological purpose of justifying and reproducing the modern nation-state as the predestined and legitimate container of collective consciousness. School textbooks, at least in South Asia, have long been among the most exploited media for the presentation of the history of the national collective. This essay is a study of school textbooks in Bangladesh. It looks at narrative representations of selected episodes from the past, both pre- and postindependence, in order to reflect on how they construct "history". Through this work I endeavor to relate textual images to issues of community relations and identity by identifying and sharing the ways in which the audience for nationalist discourse is created, nurtured, and secured through symbolic means.<br>

Abstract: Masking is ubiquitous to the culture areas of the world and is a symbolic activity inextricably associated cross-culturally with cosmological drama and shamanic ritual. Our question is, "Masks work how?" In Part 1, we place masks within their physical, cultural and cosmological context so as to view the activity of masking as part of a wider symbolic process. Masks are seen to be transformations of face. In Part 2, the work of masking is realized as a transformation of experience, and is related to a general cycle of meaning in culture whereby cosmological beliefs give rise to direct experience, and experience verifies and vivifies cosmology. And in Part 3 the "how" of masking is explained using a biogenetic structural perspective which traces the possible transformations of brain that may occur within the wearer and audience and that may mediate a variety of mask-related experiences.<br>

Abstract: Metaphor, Vibration and Form identifies a process that underlies all ritual enactments. Whether it is Joseph Campbell's analysis of the Hero's journey, Victor Turner's theoretical and experiential interest in symbols, or Charles Laughlin's cycle of meaning, there is at work a particular kind of behavioral transformation system. It begins with the mind and the meanings provided metaphorically for symbols, then proceeds to an intense focus on symbolic sequences in meditation or in ritual dramas, so that the metaphor is taken into the body as physical experience. From this physical "ownership" of the metaphor, the properties associated with it are encouraged, socially and ritually, to come to the surface and be enacted in the form of everyday behavior. Questions of symbolic appropriation, the redundancy of symbol, and professional responsibility are addressed in the concluding remarks.<br>

Abstract: Starting with Raglan's suggestion that Falstaff may be a "holy fool" and with Auden's belief that he is a comic symbol of charity, this essay explores the medieval tradition of wise fool, and especially Falstaff's always canny use of biblical allusion. His various jests, if read in relation to the political action of the main plot, reveal him as characterizing England's time of day and parodying the unchristian behavior of Hotspur, Henry, and Hal. By the time he dies mumbling Psalm xxiii to an uncomprehending Nell Quickly, there have accumulated many hints that he is, in fact, a candle to his age, a professional Fool with the heart of a faithful Lazarus, and destined to join Mowbray in Abraham's bosom. The merriment for which readers have found him lovable amid his masquerades of vice has its mysterious basis in his covertly Christian understanding of England's neo-Roman Caesars.<br>

Abstract: Concepts of place, narrative, tradition, and identity are employed in a conservative reading of the Texas A&M Bonfire. Texas A&M embodied regional narratives of a dual Southern commitment to economic and technological development and conservation of traditional cultural. Institutionalized at Texas A&M in the late nineteenth century, these narratives made a paradoxical place. Bonfire expressed and obscured this paradox. In line with the narrative of tradition, Texas A&M was an all-male military school until 1965. The students were uniform, isolated, and regimented. This social structure engendered intense feelings of loyalty and community. These social emotions were further aroused at events like yell practice, and projected onto Bonfire. After the Second World War the commitment of university administrators to economic and technological progress increasingly threatened the narrative of tradition and the cultivation of manliness. Student veneration of Bonfire intensified. After 1965 mandatory military drill was discontinued, women were enrolled, and the student body was enlarged. Social pluralism fragmented the meaning of Bonfire; conflict and disorderly behavior ensued. By the 1990s the university had partly rationalized Bonfire as a corporate symbol; however, this trend was tragically terminated in 1999 when the cumulative errors of the oral tradition caused Bonfire to collapse, killing twelve students.<br>

Abstract: Paradise Lost traces evil through three inceptions-Satanic, Adamic, and historical. Each origin seems to envision a different etiology: Satanic evil springs exclusively from the self in an instant of radical "Pelagian" freedom. Adamic evil emerges from the ambiguous interplay between self and seductive environment. Historical evil contaminates the whole race by means of necessary "Augustinian" inheritance. Ricoeur's analysis of the "Adamic Myth" and original sin clarifies etiological traditions Milton assimilates from Christian symbol, myth, and dogma. Through Ricoeur, we can identify the contrasting modalities of evil (inherited and imitative, physical and moral, ontological and existential, necessary and free, communal and individual) fused in Paradise Lost. Ricoeur's work reveals Milton's text to be a subtly inclusive etiological myth, one whose complex genesis of evil recovers Scripture's fullness of meaning in a new mythopoesis.<br>

Abstract: Milton scholarship has long regarded chaos in Paradise Lost as hostile to God and creation. This judgment identifies Milton with traditional Western attitudes toward matter and material disorder-evident as early as the Babylonian creation epic, the Enuma elish. In contrast to such attitudes, modern science conceives of chaos as dynamically productive of order, and postmodern cultural studies sees chaos as a relevant principle of ironic indeterminacy. Milton anticipates the postmodern endorsement of chaos in his theology of matter and in the symbolic reflections and allegorical representations of chaos in Paradise Lost. Appreciation of chaotic disorder and of indeterminacy and disapproval of the tyrannical suppression of these qualities distinguish Milton's idiosyncratic theology, political theory, and aesthetics. Even Milton's God contains the potency of chaotic matter, a womblike virtue essential to God's creative power.<br>

Abstract: Mallarmé constructs a "crisis of verse" that mimes the circumstances of loss and the moment of lamentation to produce his celebrated poetic purity. Indeed, he constructs this purity out of the materials of ritual and philosophical defilement: not only does his poetic theory valorize death and danger, but his poetic practice largely relies on contact with the foreign, on semantic contagion, and on ambiguity. The significance of this defilement spreads in multiple directions: it is instrumental in producing newness and in mediating Mallarmé's professional rivalry with Wagner, it bears witness to the domestic crisis of the Third Republic, and it functions as a form of resistance to cultural assimilation. Moreover, because defilement is at once material and symbolic and because that "symbolism" is an obstinately obscure mode of referentiality, Mallarmé's cultivation of defilement is a recuperation of the scapegoats that "pure" philosophy necessarily exiles: the material and the hyperessential.<br>

Abstract: The "Myth of Creation" in its East African formulation is the central chapter in a book entitled, The Sacred Meadows, by an Egyptian anthropologist who did his field work in the early seventies among the Lamu community in Kenya on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The translator, in her own introduction to the translation, presents the outline of the book and provides the geographical and cultural context of the community in question. The author, in this translated chapter, sets out by exposing his theoretical position which combines both Structuralism and Functionalism. Insights from Claude Lévi-Strauss and Bronislaw Malinowski as well as those of Paul Ricoeur and Victor Turner join to develop the author's notion of myth and its symbolic mode. Then the text of the myth, in its Lamuan formulation, is narrated, followed by a close reading and analysis of its binary oppositions, mediating terms, and the underlying existential contradiction at its crux. Angels, jinn, light, fire, earth, wind, water, Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Satan, serpent, etc. are the agents of this sacred narrative and cosmic drama. The textual unfolding of the myth is followed by an analysis, which makes use of the structural method and explores the semantic connotations of Swahili words and idioms to explain the logic of the symbolic exchange and the rigor of thought. The themes of unity and multiplicity and their different combinations are delineated in this analysis and the repetitions and their relation to transcendence are explained.<br>

Abstract: This article investigates identity in two autobiographies and two life-history interviews from North Africa. The autobiographies show the centrality of "key" self-representational symbols which the authors selectively draw from their cultural lexicon but invest with idiosyncratic affective meanings. The life narratives show how the "structured ambiguity" of self-symbols allows them to be reconfigured to articulate contrasting identities, among which the narrators shift. Generative models of musical cognition describe crucial features of this multiplicity. Against both modernist and postmodernist views of culture and self, narrative data argue for a distributed model of culture and for a theory of multiple identities integrated by "key" cultural symbols.<br>

Abstract: A discussion of the concept of power provides the theoretical basis for a semantic analysis of a case in which power changes hands. It is argued that a relationship of power presumes the capacity of ideas to require submission and that changes of power accompany changes in actors' conceptions of reality. The semantic analysis points to a pan-Indonesian conception of how power is created and destroyed. [power, political anthropology, symbolic analysis, complex organizations, Indonesia]<br>

Abstract: North Indian Rajput and south Indian Nattati Nadar weddings are compared to find the summary images of the bride in the two subcultures of the more general South Asian marriage system. "Woman as tribute" in contrast to "woman as flower" is revealed by such differences as the roles for relatives in the rituals, the severance and nonseverance of the bride from her kindred, and the cooling versus heating effects of preparatory baths.

Abstract: In their interpretations of magical acts and utterances, anthropologists frequently argue that magic and technology are informed by two different kinds of logic, the former "expressive" in character, the latter "instrumental." A close analysis of magical hunting songs used by the Aguaruna of Amazonian Peru reveals that the songs are part of a general ordering process that encompasses the strategic use of thoughts, speech, objects, and acts to achieve practical ends. In Aguaruna thought the expressive imagery of magical songs is an instrumental tool that shapes events in the performer's world.

Abstract: This article describes how the people of Cartago, Costa Rica -- compelled, like each of us, to create -- incorporate the material culture of their town's market and plaza into social situations. In so doing, they move from the physical reality of simply being there to the distinctive social realities of being-in-the-market and being-in-the-plaza. The juxtaposition of these two complementary realities, the article concludes, constitutes the dialectic through which Spanish American culture becomes.

Abstract: Language is constitutive of social reality through the constant articulation and reinforcement of significant linguistic concepts, which give meaning to social relations. Among the Shuar of southeastern Ecuador, discourses on power and knowledge validate the traditional ideological structure and create a new ideological structure through the mobilization of meaning in political speech that legitimates relations of domination. Ideological transformation is assisted by a cultural predisposition to seek non-Shuar sources of technical and symbolic knowledge in the acquisition of power.

Abstract: The indigenous peoples of South America culturally code sensory perceptions in varied and complex ways. This article outlines and compares the sensory models of indigenous cultures from two contrasting South American regions: the central Andean highlands and the Amazonian lowlands. While the various peoples of the Andes appear to share the same basic sensory model, those of the Amazon manifest significant differences in the symbolic values they accord the different senses. One common factor among the Amazonians, which also distinguishes them from the Andeans, is the importance given to the senses dependent on proximity, particularly smell. Such differences can be attributed to a variety of causes and are seen to have a variety of cultural effects. In conclusion, the anthropological implications of examining indigenous theories and modes of perception are explored. [South America, Andes, Amazon, anthropology of the senses]<br>

Abstract: In this article, I use Obeyesekere's concept of the work of culture to examine a case of magical poisoning among the Toraja (South Sulawesi, Indonesia). I argue that episodes of suffering must be situated not only culturally but also within the context of the individual sufferer's life experience, and suggest that we must consider carefully why only certain symbolic transformations of painful emotions may "work" for a given individual, why a symbolic transformation that "works" for one person may not for another, and why even apparently successful transformations of suffering may bring only temporary relief.

Abstract: In this study of Greek dreams at moments of illness and anxiety I explore the relationship between individual experience and cultural representation. Ethnographic data and textual sources show that the image of fields recurs in dreams, thus throwing into question the uniqueness of personal experience as well as the concept of "experience" as something separate from cultural narratives. Yet these same images might also be independently generated "from below" by the emotional, physical experience of distress and illness. This case points to the convergence of cultural and personal symbols and to their fusion in the moment of experience. Approaches from psychoanalysis, cognitive psychology, anthropology, and folklore studies all provide possible theorizations. None of these options excludes the others. The image of the field in dreams is overdetermined precisely because the historicocultural, the cognitive, the psychobiological, and the social all simultaneously figure in human experience.

Abstract: This study describes the symbolic process by which individuals attempted to realize, in organizational form, their variant interpretations of an extended metaphor - community mental health. Their metaphoric construals were embedded in everyday discourse and were initially unrecognized by participants at a community mental health center. The metaphoric process, that is, the movement involving the emergence, interpretation, and realization of these metaphors, was mediated by the self-images of the participants. They had embarked upon an innovative project to realize, in part, an ideal sense of self. The latter was a key factor in the development of new construals of community mental health and the implementation of these construals.<br>

Abstract: Cultural cognition is the product of two different sorts of meaning: (a) the (objective) semiotic organization of cultural texts or models, and (b) the (subjective) processes of meaning construction through which cultural symbols become available to consciousness as "experience." This article proposes a way to bridge these two kinds of meaning by considering how cultural knowledge is grounded in sensory experience. Several cognitive processes (schematization, synesthesia, secondary intersubjectivity) are proposed for linking the objectively available schemata found in cultural practices and the processes of meaning construction by which individuals appropriate symbols to consciousness. The nature of the relation between public symbols and individual experience is discussed in relation to a number of current issues in post-structuralist culture theory.<br>

Abstract: An earlier ecological anthropology defined its project within the compass of the idealism v. materialism debate. Culture was an adaptive tool, instrumental rather than formal; it was intelligible with respect to its material effects, not - as the idealists would maintain - in terms of itself, as an autonomous, self-determining order of reality. This argument was mounted with respect to bounded, stable, self-regulating, local, or at best regional entities and the environment they inhabited. All of the premises of the earlier ecology have since been challenged, and today's ecologies - symbolic, historical, and political - radically depart from the reductions and elisions of the ecological anthropology of the past. In particular, the new ecologies override the dichotomies that informed and enlivened the debates of the past - nature/culture, idealism/materialism - and they are informed by the literature on transnationalist flows and local-global articulations. This introduction positions Rappaport's work within this historical shift from a polarized field of mutually exclusive frameworks to today's synthetic new ecologies and their antireductive materialism. Rappaport's work, produced over three decades, serves, in and through its own transformations, as a bridge between the reductive materialism of the past and a new-materialist ecology.<br>

Abstract: The aim of the article is to present some aspects of Paul Ricœur’s thought, especially his reflection on the servile will. Firstly I present Ricœur’s philosophy of will (in the context of phenomenology of the voluntary and involuntary) and the concept of fallibility. Then I demonstrate the main aspects of Ricœurian rethinking and enlarging of Husserl’s phenomenology what leads to hermeneutic formula: the symbol gives rise to thought. Eventually, I argue that Ricœur’s hermeneutic phenomenology creates a specified anthropological view and understanding of the human condition. This understanding will later become a part of the ‘hermeneutics of the self.’<br>

Abstract: Cet article est issu d'une étude ethnographique menée à l'Université de Cape Town. Il explore la dynamique d'une intervention permettant au personnel de l'université de s'engager dans une voie alternative à celle de l'apartheid en Afrique du Sud. Il traite de la politique sociale qui apparut entre l'intervention, ses participants et non-participants imaginaires par rapport à la vision « transformatrice » de l'université. L'intention des interventionnistes a été retravaillée par les participants des principaux symboles qui mettent en forme les motifs de leurs comportements et donnent un sens à leurs expériences. Utilisant le modèle d'Ortner (1973) de reconnaissance et de symboles-clés, je soutiens que la « transformation » et « l'espace sûr » représentent une élaboration symboles, en ce sens qu'ils ont le pouvoir d'action et d'élaboration conceptuelle. Ces symboles d'élaboration fonctionnent en relais avec une sorte de logique qui « cristallise l'engagement » des participants vers l'intervention d'une manière émotionnellement puissante et relativement indifférenciée. Ce faisant, ils font de l'intervention un symbole capable d'exprimer ce que leur expérience signifie pour eux en tant que communauté imaginée par rapport aux autres.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the formative role of the World War II experience in shaping politically relevant memories in postwar Italy. Rather than considering the past a legacy or a heritage—something abstract, malleable and susceptible to serving political interests—the focus here is on the meaning-giving power of memories and symbols in the historical evolution. The birth of Italian democracy after the war was preceded by disruptive events that could have divided the nation. This article illustrates how contested and fragmented interpretations of critical events were structured by and through the dimension of cultural memory, which sustained social and political imaginations, eventually shaping characters and outcomes of the Italian political transformation.<br>

Abstract: The academic study of Kabbalah has largely been limited to myth and symbol as the two viable forms of kabbalistic discourse. In this essay, I resist those limitations and explore two other possible literary forms: history and fiction. I do not mean history in any positivistic sense but closer to Steven Greenblatt's description of new historicism as cultural poetics. This suggests that literature not only reflects a historical setting but also creates that setting, constructing reality in its own image and directing it toward its desired ends. In looking at Lurianic Kabbalah as fiction, I raise the issue of the “real” and the “true” as it relates to fictive narratives more generally. This essay does not claim that the kabbalists in question did or did not intend to write cultural poetics or fiction. Rather, I use cultural poetics and fiction as possible lenses through which a nontraditional interested reader (i.e., one not invested in the literature as authoritative) can read these texts in a way that can speak to the contemporary world in which we live and think.<br>

Abstract: The literary field in Africa came into emergence as a result of a collective yearning for lesser dependency on the symbolic constraints the Western center is forcing on its margins. Granted that a work sets itself up by setting up its own context, and that the African context stands out as one where oral literature is still alive in society, the manifestation of expressive forms associated with traditional literature in a novel must carry heavy weight in an interpretation of African works. For that reason, this essay will argue that, through her “smuggling” of narrative forms drawn from oral literature, Aminata Sow Fall's fiction testifies to an oral discursivity at work in the novel. The archi-textual approach focuses on various strategies the Senegalese woman writer resorts to in order to inscribe, deep within her creative work in French, a traditional universe hitherto conveyed through oral forms of expression.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: Is SPEP the city of God? This would be going too far. Not even the theological turn in French Phenomenology would make this claim. Dick Howard already threw in a troubling question: “diversification that perhaps gives more breadth than depth?” he asked. And there are plenty more troubling questions. SPEP is now a big operation. It has committees and subcommittees, multiple simultaneous sessions, blind review. All these developments are signs, perhaps inevitable ones, of its success, but all have familiar downsides: bureaucratization, diversification for its own sake, what Habermas would call
   Unübersichtlichkeit. This is what happens when outsiders become insiders, the antis become their own sort of establishment. You can't blame some of us for feeling nostalgic for our long-lost innocence, even though we all know—you don't have to be a philosopher of history to know this—that we can't go there. History has rendered a judgment, but Dick Howard said, “Historywilljudge.” That's one problem with history: It's always rendering judgments, but they are never final. You'd have to be at the end of history for that, and despite the claim of some philosophers, we aren't there yet. The slaughter bench of history looks very different today from the early 1960s, but it's still in some ways a slaughter bench. So how will the SPEP of the early twenty-first century look to the philosopher-historians of 2061—or is it 2062?<br>

Abstract: No doubt the rise of religion has not only posed a particular dilemma for critical theory but also provided a curious place to end this reflection. Having started my career doing philosophy of religion it is somewhat surprising to meet religion again as I turn to what surely must be at least a later phase of my career. I am reminded of Antonio's line from the Italian film
            C'eravamo Tanto Amati, translated asWe All Loved Each Other So Much: “We thought we could change the world, but the world changed us.” “Philosophers only interpret the world, the point is to change it,” so said Marx. But in a curious way those who would change the world are changed by it.<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself.

Abstract: Characterizing the slipstream genre, Bruce Sterling locates it between mainstream and science fiction; it “sets its face against consensus reality” and makes us feel “very strange.” A strong slipstream candidate is Steven Hall’s
         The Raw Shark Texts(2007). Manifesting as a distributed literary system, the text has as its core a print novel, but other internet and real world sites also contain fragments or “negatives.” One of the text’s two villains, Mycroft Ward, has transformed into an online database; a posthuman subjectivity, he appropriates “node bodies” that upload their information and download new instructions. This separation of content (online database) from form (node body) is, according to Alan Liu, one of the primary characteristics of postindustrial knowledge work. To this extent, Hall positions his narrative not only against databases but also against knowledge that is, in Liu’s terms, autonomously mobile, transformable, and automated, having lost its material instantiation and been pulverized into atomized bits of information. The text’s second villain—a “conceptual shark,” the Ludovician—represents the complete fusion of form and content; the typographical symbols used to describe the shark also comprise its flesh in verbal and graphic representations. The text thus positions its protagonist, Eric Sanderson, as caught between twenty-first-century forms of knowledge and the implosion of signifier into signified. In this sense, the novel functions as a parable for the contemporary human condition, looking toward a posthuman future but incarnated within an ancient biological heritage.<br>
