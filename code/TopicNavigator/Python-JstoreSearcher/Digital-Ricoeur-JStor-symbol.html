  Book Title: Shared Land/Conflicting Identity-Trajectories of Israeli & Palestinian Symbol Use<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frank David A.<br>
  Abstract: Shared Land/Conflicting Identity: Trajectories of Israeli and Palestinian Symbol Useargues that rhetoric, ideology, and myth have played key roles in influencing the development of the 100-year conflict between first the Zionist settlers and the current Israeli people and the Palestinian residents in what is now Israel. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is usually treated as an issue of land and water. While these elements are the core of the conflict, they are heavily influenced by the symbols used by both peoples to describe, understand, and persuade each other. The authors argue that symbolic practices deeply influenced the Oslo Accords, and that the breakthrough in the peace process that led to Oslo could not have occurred without a breakthrough in communication styles.Rowland and Frank develop four crucial ideas on social development: the roles of rhetoric, ideology, and myth; the influence of symbolic factors; specific symbolic factors that played a key role in peace negotiations; and the identification and value of criteria for evaluating symbolic practices in any society.<br>

  Abstract: The Oslo Accords could not have occurred without a transformed Palestinian symbol system. Palestinians involved in the Oslo talks recounted that the terms used in describing the Palestinians and the contested land were in dispute at Oslo. However, the Israelis came to accept the phrase “Palestinian people” and the words “West Bank” and “Gaza” rather than “Judea” and “Samaria” to describe a common reality. In turn, the Palestinians recognized the state of Israel. Indeed, demonstrating the importance of the symbol, the wording of the Oslo Accords and references to people and land were at the center of the negotiations.¹ The<br>

  Abstract: La mancornadorais a theme in Mexican music that depicts a heavy existential experience between men and women. The songs are filled with graphic and painful metaphors. The outcome is often tragic and violent, and often involves the killing of women. The termmancornarrepresents power and control, and the animal horn is its symbol. It is a difficult subject to broach, but its presence in a number of songs and in social life suggests certain commonalities that are worth exploring. It is important to locate these themes within a broader frame, which includes ideas from Norman Denzin, Ernest Becker,<br>

  Abstract: so far we have seen that evil became associated early with disobeying father and his representatives. The roots of that association stretch back into antiquity when early human beings felt contaminated by preexisting evil. Ricoeur began his study of the symbolism of evil with an analysis of defilement. Already two things have happened that must now set aside. First, evil is firmly associated with sin, guilt, impurity, and fault; there has been a move beyond pure terror to ethical terror. Second, thought already focuses on the symbol rather than the experience. “By beginning with a symbolism already there,” Ricoeur observes,<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter on soteriology, we noted how the doctrine of justification is the result of theological reflection on the significance of the symbol of Christ as the lamb of God. The innocence of the scapegoated lamb of God is transferred to us. Our own deeds of justice, our own good works, our own holiness, do not make us just in the sight of God. Our justice is rather an alien justice, one that comes to us from without but one that becomes our own through an act of God’s grace. Our justification is a gift.<br>

Nevertheless, in the same moment that, in this document and others, Vatican II was opening the windows of the Church to dialogue, it opened onto a modern world that was already passing—if, in fact, it had ever really been.

They were attracted first of all by its irresistibly fascinating title: “Crime and Punishment.” The reference to Dostoyevsky’s masterpiece is explicit. In the minds of the show’s curators, crime is synonymous with murder: its paintings, photographs, illustrations, and other forms of documentation all display, in various modes, the crime of murder—that is, the individual offense.

  Abstract: What does the cross, both as a historical event and a symbol of religious discourse, tell us about human beings?

The result is a bold and original view of what philosophical anthropology could look like if it took the scandal of the cross seriously instead of reducing it into general philosophical concepts.<br>

In other words, the theorization of community has often tended to disembed this concept from day-to-day sociality. In earlier work (Amit, 2002a), I argued that one version of this tendency towards disembedding has involved an increasing analytical focus on community as an

  Book Title: Cities of Affluence and Anger-A Literary Geography of Modern Englishness<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): KALLINEY PETER J.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a compact literary history of the twentieth century in England, Cities of Affluence and Anger studies the problematic terms of national identity during England's transition from an imperial power to its integration in the global cultural marketplace. While the countryside had been the dominant symbol of Englishness throughout the previous century, modern literature began to turn more and more to the city to redraw the boundaries of a contemporary cultural polity. The urban class system, paradoxically, still functioned as a marker of wealth, status, and hierarchy throughout this long period of self-examination, but it also became a way to project a common culture and mitigate other forms of difference. Local class politics were transformed in such a way that enabled the English to reframe a highly provisional national unity in the context of imperial disintegration, postcolonial immigration, and, later, globalization.Kalliney plots the decline of the country-house novel through an analysis of Forster's Howards End and Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, each ruthless in its sabotage of the trope of bucolic harmony. The traditionally pastoral focus of English fiction gives way to a high-modernist urban narrative, exemplified by Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, and, later, to realists such as Osborne and Sillitoe, through whose work Kalliney explores postwar urban expansion and the cultural politics of the welfare state. Offering fresh new readings of Lessing's The Golden Notebook and Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, the author considers the postwar appropriation of domesticity, the emergence of postcolonial literature, and the renovation of travel narratives in the context of globalization. Kalliney suggests that it is largely one city--London--through which national identity has been reframed. How and why this transition came about is a process that Cities of Affluence and Anger depicts with exceptional insight and originality.<br>

  Abstract: Cities, and capital cities in particular, are clearly the central focus for national memory. At the centre of such memory is the manner in which the city space is captured in the shorthand of symbol or mental representation. For example, the city of Paris is most easily represented by certain of the monuments that define its central space, or possibly by less monumental buildings that nonetheless capture the flavour and atmosphere of a particular quarter or
                  arrondissement(administrative district), made familiar to the intended target of that representation by repeated itineraries and wanderings. Yet this double vision of the city,<br>

  Abstract: To understand the power of the theme of white innocence, one must begin with the cultural conception of innocence. To be innocent is important everywhere in our culture. The argument for the white person’s innocence in matters of race connects with the cultural ideas of innocence and defilement. The very contrast between the colors, white and black, is often a symbol for the contrast between innocence and defilement. Thus, the theme of white innocence in the legal rhetoric of race draws its power from more than the obvious advantage of pushing away responsibility. It takes power from the cultural, religious,<br>

It presupposes that as moderns we aim at a second naiveté in and through critical reflection. It also presupposes that the concepts of immediacy and of the sacred (“the immediacy of the symbol”) are identical and that it is the aim of restorative criticism to disclose that identity.

  Sacramental Presence and the Mother’s Smile from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf1rx">Sacramental Presence after Heidegger</a><br>
  Abstract: The occlusion of the mother’s smile is the death of sacramental presence. The mother’s smile is the kiss of Being, the sign or symbol of all that is gratuitous, all that is gift, and therefore all that is non-calculative, nonmechanical, and non-violent. Its erasure therefore erodes the sacramental foundation of grace. A sacramental “sign,” it is also a phenomenological and metaphysical sign, a “real,” existent form from which breaks forth the splendor of the depths of Being. It signifies the permanence of the truth, goodness, and beauty of the created order. As form, it also refers to infinity, for “it<br>

Nor does the symbol of the cross have the same meaning when worn as a fashion accessory today as it once did in its crude representations on the shields of Constantine’s army. Like any<br>

  Abstract: The late American liberal theologian, Gordon Kaufman, once said something to me that struck my religious sensibilities. “Experience and God,” he said, “is a category mistake.” Kaufman came to his claim by his particular reading of Kant’s
                  Critique of Pure Reason. Kant, according to Kaufman, argued that the ideal of God was a symbol with no corresponding reality. 1 It can be debated whether Kaufmann’s interpretation of Kant is correct. According to Kant scholar Allen Wood, Kant actually held on to the existence of God as the ground of all possibility, namely a “subjectively necessary hypothesis (A 581–2/B 609<br>

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of the Divine Suffering, Volume 2. Evil and Divine Suffering<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the second volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, vol. 2, Evil and Divine Suffering. The larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, then to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. This second volume of studies proceeds on the basis of the presuppositions of this symbol, those implicit attestations that provide the conditions of possibility for divine suffering-that which constitutes divine vulnerability with respect to creation-as identified and examined in the first volume of this project: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life-the imago Dei as love. The second volume then investigates the first two divine wounds or modes of divine suffering to which the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally attest: (1) divine grief, suffering because of betrayal by the beloved human or human sin; and (2) divine self-sacrifice, suffering for the beloved human in its bondage to sin or misery, to establish the possibility of redemption and reconciliation. Each divine wound, thus, constitutes a response to a creaturely occasion. The suffering in each divine wound also occurs in two stages: a passive stage and an active stage. In divine grief, God suffers because of human sin, betrayal of the divine lover by the beloved human: divine sorrow as the passive stage of divine grief; and divine angui~<br>

  Abstract: Juergensmeyer’s fourth symbol for understanding the link between violence and religion is warrior empowerment, which joins two interrelated aspects: the practice and code of the warrior, and the empowering of the warrior. Although Juergensmeyer’s title chapter uses the term “warrior” to structure his analysis, he does not use the term in the body of his writings, preferring to refer to “fighters” and “soldiers.”¹ However, there is evidence that the term “warrior” has been used in communities, for example, the

  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the first volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Divine Vulnerability and Creation. This study first develops an approach to interpreting the contested claims about the suffering of God. Thus, the larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. Through this approach, this volume of studies into the Christian symbol of divine suffering then investigates the two major presuppositions that the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally hold: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life - the imago Dei as love. When fully elaborated, these presuppositions reveal the conditions of possibility for divine suffering and divine vulnerability with respect to creation.<br>

Building on the letter as the intrinsic symbol of the spirit, it understands divine revelation as a system of continuous symbols that join together Christ, his words and works, the apostolic tradition of the church, and the written scriptures and their interpretation. Whenever a synthesis is grounded in symbolism, its aesthetic dimension cannot help but be invoked. Heidegger reminds us, for instance, that symbolism constitutes the essence of art.¹ In the creative fashioning of an artifact, truth itself is preserved as beauty.

Rumor had it that money was indeed something unimportant, at times even suspicious, a neutral “veil” that only obscures the “real” economic basis of society, namely, the good old practice of barter, the direct exchange of good and services.²<br>

  Abstract: Anthropologists have become increasingly involved as participants on development teams, but their great potential to promote sustainable development is hindered by vestiges of one of cultural anthropology’s founding myths. It is the notion of cultures construed as self-contained symbol systems, conceptually opaque to all but true insiders, with an implied notion of correct translation, which makes it an ‘all or nothing’ matter. This notion is also linked to long-standing concerns in the field with moral relativism, value neutrality and colonialism. As a result, within the community of anthropologists working in development, two somewhat opposed positions have arisen: one holds that<br>

  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Seidman Michael<br>
  Abstract: The events of 1968 have been seen as a decisive turning point in the Western world. The author takes a critical look at "May 1968" and questions whether the events were in fact as "revolutionary" as French and foreign commentators have indicated. He concludes the student movement changed little that had not already been challenged and altered in the late fifties and early sixties. The workers' strikes led to fewer working hours and higher wages, but these reforms reflected the secular demands of the French labor movement. "May 1968" was remarkable not because of the actual transformations it wrought but rather by virtue of the revolutionary power that much of the media and most scholars have attributed to it and which turned it into a symbol of a youthful, renewed, and freer society in France and beyond.<br>

Subjectivity turned to stone has also been linked (most notably in the wake of Benjamin’s reflections on Baudelaire) to another distinction—that between symbol and allegory in the aesthetics of poetic representation. In Baudelaire the petrified order of things signifies the death of the “symbol,” understood as the quasi-animistic, “living,” and embodying force of analogy and

Platonic speculation on the sun as symbol of the mind may seem unrelated to the development of a scientific cosmology.

When the Europeans arrived, however, they tended to impel the Jews, not without resistance, to build synagogues on stylistic and monumental models borrowed from European architecture. Thus, a strictly internal and hidden place of worship, in keeping with the tradition of an Israelite temple, was transformed into a symbol of emancipation and integration into modern society.

  Abstract: The followers of Pythagoras introduced us to a sacramental dimension of the ancient concept of the symbol. The secretive tradition that grew up around the Presocratic philosopher’s legend employed his “symbols,” the short epigrammatic sayings attributed to him, as tokens of true identity and as a kind of catechism in a ritualized ascent to knowledge. They also made comparisons between Pythagoras’s symbols and the efficacious speech used in magical practices. But after the third century c.e., the idea that symbols have the power to

  Abstract: The concept of the symbol has appeared often in criticism of music. This is a different kind of symbol from that described by Peirce; for the American semiologist, symbol is opposed to icon and index in a trichotomy of signs. But for the aesthetic idealists, the symbol has a transcendent resonance which gives it a master-function in music and makes it a determinant of moral force and aesthetic value. In this kind of symbol, the relation of signifier and signified is asymmetric; what is signified is a radical idealism, an overcoming of the antinomy of thought and object. The imagination<br>

Portentous and wistful by turns, our talk about Shakespeare habitually sets him between times, last witness for the old, first prophet of the new, a genius of the divided vision and a symbol of our own life on the margins of tradition. Commonplaces can be false, of course, but the proof of this one is repetition, not only iteration of such judgments about Shakespeare’s place in history, but our constant recurrence to his texts, which have<br>

  Abstract: Naming God has enormous discursive power. The implications of “masculine” terminology for God were foundational for second wave feminism. Understandably, feminist theologians have sought to destabilize the gender rigidity of language about God. And yet feminist rearticulations often bring with them the same discursive rules that are criticized in the use of masculine language. When women’s experience becomes the basis of language for God, feminists risk ascribing a fixed symbol upon the divine name. However, in practices of prayer and contemplation the sheer otherness of God draws us to the limits of language, and causes a blurring of all fixed<br>

  Book Title: Aesthetic Vision and German Romanticism-Writing Images<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Prager Brad<br>
  Abstract: The work of the groundbreaking writers and artists of German Romanticism -- including the writers Tieck, Brentano, and Eichendorff and the artists Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge -- followed from the philosophical arguments of the German Idealists, who placed emphasis on exploring the subjective space of the imagination. The Romantic perspective was a form of engagement with Idealist discourses, especially Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and Fichte's Science of Knowledge. Through an aggressive, speculative reading of Kant, the Romantics abandoned the binary distinction between the palpable outer world and the ungraspable space of the mind's eye and were therefore compelled to develop new terms for understanding the distinction between "internal" and "external." In this light, Brad Prager urges a reassessment of some of Romanticism's major oppositional tropes, contending that binaries such as "self and other," "symbol and allegory," and "light and dark," should be understood as alternatives to Lessing's distinction between interior and exterior worlds. Prager thus crosses the boundaries between philosophy, literature, and art history to explore German Romantic writing about visual experience, examining the interplay of text and image in the formulation of Romantic epistemology. Brad Prager is Associate Professor of German at the University of Missouri, Columbia.<br>

  Book Title: The Faustian Century-German Literature and Culture in the Age of Luther and Faustus<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Weeks Andrew<br>
  Abstract: The Reformation and Renaissance, though segregated into distinct disciplines today, interacted and clashed intimately in Faust, the great figure that attained European prominence in the anonymous 1587 'Historia von D. Johann Fausten'. The original Faust behind Goethe's great drama embodies a remote culture. In his century, Faust evolved from an obscure cipher to a universal symbol. The age explored here as "the Faustian century" invested the 'Faustbuch' and its theme with a symbolic significance still of exceptional relevance today. The new essays in this volume complement one another, providing insights into the tensions and forces that gave the century its distinct character. Several essays seek Faust's prototypes. Others elaborate the symbolic function of his figure and discern the resonance of his tale in conflicting allegiances. This volume focuses on the intersection of historical accounts and literary imaginings, on shared aspects of the work and its times, on concerns with obedience and transgression, obsessions with the devil and curiosity about magic, and quandaries created by shifting religious and worldly authorities.

The assertion that Botev and Levski were pitched against each other already in this period, and that after 1944 the communists had elevated Botev as their exclusive symbol at the expense of Levski who was allegedly largely forgotten, was a later hyperbolic interpolation, dating from the 1970s and especially the<br>

Author(s): Vidal Fernando<br>
Abstract: Soteriology,from the Greeksoterion,“salvation,” is the branch of theology that deals with salvation (especially through Christ). The soteriological dimension of alchemy is not directly aimed at a physico‐theology of resurrection. In the thirteenth century, the Oxford Franciscan Roger Bacon looked for ways to give the body incorruptibility and prolonged youth through alchemy, not for youth’s sake, but to prepare it for resurrection and eternal life. The chief means was the consumption of drinkable gold, the incorruptible matter par excellence and a symbol of the equilibrium of the microcosm; see Agostino Paravicini Bagliani, “Storia della scienza e storia della mentalità: Ruggero Bacone, Bonifacio VIII e la teoria della ‘prolongatio vitae,’” inAspetti della letteratura latina nel secolo XIII,ed. Claudio Leonardi and Giovanni Orlandi (Spoleto, 1992), pp. 243–80. After the Reformation, alchemy became entangled with apocalyptic expectations. Its success during the seventeenth century is linked to the perception that it carried “the secret of life itself, and with it the secrets of resurrection, of immortality, of perfection, of final salvation and Beatitude” (Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs, “Alchemical Death and Resurrection: The Significance of Alchemy in the Age of Newton,” inScience, Pseudo‐science, and Utopianism in Early Modern Thought,ed.

Abstract: These collective representations, say the theorists, exert a strong social force. But they are polysemous; the same symbol or collective representation can take on different meanings in different contexts (e.g., Swidler
      2001; Schudson1989; Walzer1985; Sahlins1981; Hall1973). As Paul Ricoeur (1974) writes, people rely on symbols to make sense of experience, but at the same time people interpret the symbols they use (Kane1997). A fundamental task for sociological studies of culture, then, is to conceptualize how people use collective representations to make meaning together in everyday life. This article takes on that task.<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Several of the essays arein the theological senseapologetic. The first is a selfsituating, at times trenchant criticism of cognitive anthropology. The second is a historical account of psychoanalytic anthropology that is so parochial, so superficial that it hardly merits reading. Juillerat considers neither the critiques of psychoanalytic anthropology nor the research of ethnopsychoanalysts such as Paul Parin in Zurich, Waud Kracke in the United States, or the anthropologically oriented psychoanalysts in India, Japan, and South America. It would be a pity, however, if readers dismissed the book at this point, for the remaining essays are theoretically interesting, ethnographically rich, and at times conceptually disquieting. They include such topics as the nature of the symbol; the relationship between Freuds originary fantasies and LviStrausss basic kinship units (
      atomes de parent); the interaction between individual and collective representations; the conjunction of endopsychic projections of cosmologies and social reality; splitting and metamorphosis in the Yafar conception of death; parallels between the evolutionism in Yafar mythology and in BachofensMutterrecht; the stress on the paternal principle in Freud and the maternal in Jung; a rethinking of Maussian exchange theory that recognizes gifts that impose no obligation; an interpretation of a recent cargo cult that relates the land of plenty to the terror and longing for intrauterine return that is expressed in Yafar myth; and a reinterpretation of Naven as a psychodrama in which the uterine nephewthe eternal herois caught between agnatic law and incestuous ties with the mother. The last chapter consists of theoretical excerpts from JuilleratsLavnement du pre(1995), which, though meant to enrich the reading of Yafar ritual and myth, are difficult to evaluate out of context.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur suggests that, for a person, there are a series of dialectics at work in this process of identity narration [
         29]. First, there is explanation and understanding operating in dialectic; a process of interpretation involves a threefold movement of interpretation, understanding, and explanation. In other words, as we saw above, a person interprets a symbol, understands it, and then explains its meaning; Ricoeur argues that this happens regardless of whether we privilege one or the other of two kinds of events—interpretations or facts—because both are present and part of one set of operations. Second, Ricoeur attends to the importance of the dialectic between self and other, which he suggests is multiple in the sense that it is characterized by experience of one’s own body, the self of reciprocity or dialogue with other people, and the dialogue with what can be thought of as the “other within.” The last, he argues, is experienced as conscience. Third, there is the dialectic of identity, which is shaped by narrative in time. Each of these contribute to a dynamic relationship between sameness and selfhood, by which he means that we can be identified in time as the same person, but we also change over time as we develop selfhood.<br>

Abstract: Ibid., 83. For Tesauro, the metaphor of the saint as shield is of great relevance. If in
            SympathyMaurice and the shroud are the shields of the Catholic Savoy family, inEdipo(Oedipus, 1661), Tesauro’s interpretation of Seneca’s tragedy, Oedipus is the shield that prevents the divinity from exerting his power of purification. In Tesauro’s tragedy, Oedipus holds a long monologue on the “voracious plague” that afflicts the city of Thebes. A praetor replies to the Oedipus that the heavens are merciful because “they oppose your [Oedipus’s] virtue like a shield against their own furor.” See Emanuele Tesauro,Edipo, ed. Carlo Ossola (Venice: Marsilio, 1987), 1.1, verse 4, 79, and verses 47–48, 80. We could thus say that, for Tesauro, Maurice is a sort of anti‐Oedipus who has made himself into a lucid mirror of the shroud (the shield reflecting divine will). The saint’s body is a transparent surface reflecting and “actualizing” the “symbol” of the shroud. By contrast, Oedipus’s ignorance of his sins is a darkened, blind shield that prevents the divinity from shining through.<br>

Abstract: The paradox is that the mausoleum was imposed in 1949 as a public symbol and barely existed as private thought. Today, it is physically excised from the public space but is present as an architectural specter in one's private spatial memory: “Let's meet at the mausoleum!”
         103This will be the case until the generations that have seen it will themselves have passed away, and with them any trace of individual memory of the mausoleum will be demographically cleansed. This should bring at last the private and public closure of the mausoleum of Georgi Dimitrov in Sofia. Koselleck has remarked that “political experiences or messages can only be passed down beyond the death of a particular generation with great effort. To this end, societal institutions are required. In any case, the memorial, the supposed guarantor of sensory transmission beyond death, does not appear to be capable of achieving this task by itself. A conscious adoption of the message is always necessary.”104The demolishers seem to have overestimated the power of the memorial.<br>

Abstract: A more adequate interpretation of social responsibility may be developed also by bringing a childist perspective on children’s experiences to the Bible. For example, the very first command from God to humanity is the Gen. 1:28 injunction to “be fruitful and multiply.” As having just been created “in the image of God,” humanity is asked to understand itself somewhat like its own Creator as, primordially, a generative, reproductive, creative being. Most obviously this command implies reproduction of a biological kind, making it inherently related to children. But it can also suggest—as thinkers like Henri Bergson, Martin Buber, Gustavo Gutiérrez, Philip Hefner, and Elizabeth Johnson have variously shown—a broader responsibility for
         socialreproduction, so that responsibility for offspring offers a symbol or model for human responsibility overall.50Responding to children’s poverty, for example, can be placed in the light of a broader human responsibility for social reproduction. Just as God created the world, so also is humanity as God’s image obliged to create or cocreate its own social world ever anew, on a paradigm of parental and social fruitfulness and multiplication through care, love, and nurturance of the next generation.<br>

Abstract: The creative moral capability is ultimately best imagined through the strange language of myth. Myth can simultaneously capture the narrative thickness of actual social dynamics yet also press it toward its own more primordial creative possibilities. Myth arises out of and subjects to critique particular historical conditions. Moral creativity is more concretely imagined the more its mythologization—as, for example, in McFague’s all‐embracing Motherhood—disrupts and transforms present history in a freshly inclusive way. The symbolism of a kingdom of God, by contrast, may now imply such hierarchical social domination that it can no longer function well as a symbol of the hoped‐for new human community. Gustavo Gutiérrez offers still another possibility of the symbolism of “creative freedom” through “work”: “Humankind is created in the image and likeness of God and … fulfills itself only by transforming nature and thus entering into relationships with other persons. Only in this way do persons come to a full consciousness of themselves as subjects of creative freedom which is realized through work.”
         38In whatever form, such moral myths are themselves on some level all‐too‐human creations. Even the myth of the Creator Mother can transform human society only so far. Nevertheless, the value of myth for moral practice and thought lies precisely in its capacity for opening and transforming moral life. It can provoke our easily lost yet always also available faculty for creating together a more profoundly humanized social world.<br>

Abstract: The citation as concept symbol is examined from the perspective of three separate levels of analysis. The micro level refers to individual use of a citation to identify past ideas or innovations that have been previously accepted as legitimate. The meso level is defined as a cluster of citations used to identity a group’s contemporary view of reliable knowledge. The macro level of analysis refers to the entire structure of a citation system used to explain knowledge processes. These three levels of citations as concept symbols are then examined in relation to the correspondence, coherence, and consensus theories of truth. The article lays a foundation for considering the relationship between the cited knowledge systems of science, law, and technology and the three theories of truth. In so doing, Van der Veer Martens demonstrates that citations as concept symbols and boundary objects can help illuminate new approaches to understanding specific aspects of citation analysis theory in library and information science and, in some ways, the social networks of scholarly communication within the intellectual domains of science, law, and technology.<br>

Abstract: Marcel understands that no preconceived notion of life and death, either materialistic or spiritualistic, may help him recover his “mutual predestination” with the soul of his grandmother. All he has to start from is “the originality of his pain”; he must “respect [it]” and follow therefore the logic, which death substituted to the cohesion of his and his grandmother’s souls, “of the mutual grafting in [him] of survival and nothingness.” This logic is bound to remain “incomprehensible” both to his “intelligence” and to his “faint‐heartedness” (which in this specific instance stands for an indolent facet of personal will). But it would be wrong to domesticate, as “intelligence and will” are eager to do, this incomprehensible logic by attributing the consolation of a life‐after‐death to his grandmother. His grandmother’s soul may only be resurrected via the resurrection of Marcel’s lost self, the self that was his soul at the time when his grandmother and he shared a “mutual predestination.” In order to attain the “resurrection” of his own self, Marcel evades the control of intelligence and volition by taking refuge in the world of sleep; and in “the organic depth … of his own viscera,” which stands here for the symbol of his own mortality, he finds the self that his grandmother’s death took away from him. “World of sleep in which our inner awareness, subordinated to the troubles of our organs, speeds up our heartbeat or our respiration, because the same dose of fright, of sadness, of remorse acts with a power a hundred times greater when thus injected into our veins; as soon as we start cruising on the black streams of our own blood as if on the sixfold coils of an inner Lethe, to travel the arteries of the buried city, tall solemn figures appear to us, approach us and then walk away, leaving us in tears.”

Abstract: One undertakes this formation through a variety of strategies, including the application of human power and knowledge to shape personal and social existence in order to relieve human want and suffering, and also the drive to make reality a symbol or organ of human intent. This was, in Christian thought, the way Friedrich Schleiermacher understood the nature of ethics, namely, as the science of history in which reason makes nature its organ. On this, see his
            Lectures on Philosophical Ethics, ed. Robert B. Louden (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002).<br>

Abstract: Bruce Lincoln has pointed out the inestimable significance of binding oaths in launching religions of rebellion,
            42which is supported by Rappaport’s observation that violating oaths is the one apparently universal proscription across cultures, whereas proscriptions against murder, rape, and mayhem may vary considerably.43Swearing by one’s life and the lives of one’s family—presuming one cares about these lives—is common enough in ancient Near Eastern oaths, but the source by which one swears might also be the deity or its symbol. Oaths before a deity in many ancient documents (theIliad, the Bible, Hittite treaties, Assyrian royal annals, even testimonials from the crusades) tend to be cosmically binding, enduring as long as the source by which one swears.44An obvious historical comparison is “taking the cross” for Christian crusaders. It has been argued that taking the cross amounted to a vow before one’s god and that failure in the crusade would invite chastisement by people at home, who saw themselves as defenders of oaths to that god.45The oath holds as long as the god holds. Practically speaking, swearing an oath unto death is equally final.<br>

Abstract: Animals (in this essay referring to all self-moving species, including insects, birds, and fish as well as mammals), as a dominant source for metaphor, simile, allegory, and symbol, abound in literature of all eras. In the Middle Ages, as Jacques Le Goff wrote some forty-odd years ago in
         Medieval Civilization, animals were the subject of constant attention and reflection.10A recent spate of books, all published since 1999, includesMicrologus, Jacques Voisenet'sBêtes et hommes dans le monde médiéval(Beasts and man in the medieval world),L'animal exemplaire au Moyen Âge(The exemplary animal in the Middle Ages), Francesco Zambon'sL'alfabeto simbolico degli animali(Symbolic alphabet of animals), David Salter'sHoly and Noble Beasts, andAristotle's Animals in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.11What has emerged is a recognition of the complexity and diversity of the treatment and role of animals in the medieval imagination.12Rather than simple allegory or moral exempla, particularly after Michael Scot's thirteenth-century translation of Aristotle'sDe animalibus(On animals),13animal representation could include, often in a single case, empirical knowledge, theology, philosophy, politics, and cosmology as well as poetic or artistic ornamentation.<br>

Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
Abstract: Three epigraphs circumscribe the book’s broader themes. The first, from the late philosopher Paul Ricoeur (LaCocque’s friend and collaborator), identifies the role of myth in combining the innocence and guilt of humanity. The second, from Norman Brown’s
      Life against Death, points out how “pyramids and skyscrapers” represent a “flight from death.” The third, from Jacques Derrida, characterizes the Tower of Babel as “an incompletion, the impossibility of finishing, of totalizing” (v). Taken together, these three reflections affirm an understanding of the Babel story as a timeless “symbol of all our constructions and fabrications, with their inexorable outcome: confusion (of our life messages) and scattering (of all the pieces of our projects)” (21). They also provide a model for LaCocque’s own scholarly practice, which is distinctively rigorous yet exploratory at the same time. If, for example, Genesis 11 dates from the exile, it then becomes possible to depict it as a mythic critique of architectural fetishism and political ambition. The “gate of the divine” (Bab-El) thus becomes a dangerous threshold from profane to sacred, one in which the desire to “make a name” reflects an arrogance doomed to confuse all names. As myth, Genesis 11 captures enduring tendencies in human psychology such as infants’ fascination with presence and absence (“fort” and “da”) and the politics of empire.<br>

Abstract: Symbol is a useful construct for literature, theology, and their intersection. Mark Godin, however, cautions against “owned symbols” that appropriate (or colonize) the other (154). Through a discussion of the contemporary literature of Michael Ondaatje and Gabriel Josipovici that draws on Ricoeur and Graham Ward, Godin argues for the importance of touch and vulnerability within the symbolic world. We must not reduce symbol to the universal or ideal. We experience symbols with our minds
      andbodies, opening ourselves to the other, and confronting together via shared fragments our mutual fragility, our depth and this-ness that cannot be categorized.<br>

Abstract: To a certain extent, this line of inquiry was initiated by Paul Ricoeur’s study
         The Symbolism of Evil, which sought to trace changing conceptions of evil in the Western tradition back to their ancient Israelite and Greek origins. Starting from the principle “the symbol gives rise to thought,” Ricoeur recognized the indispensable role of concrete images in the articulation of religious intuitions.
               Put simply, Ricoeur’s investigation was based on the realization that religious experience is mediated by symbols, and accordingly, that an analysis of symbols can reveal a history of earlier conceptions. Unfortunately, this important first step in tracing the origins of the biblical notion of pollution was largely ignored by subsequent research, probably due to the impenetrability of Ricoeur’s work.1

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263722<br>

Author(s): Zahan William G.<br>
Abstract: The very definition of myth is problematic today; here narrow, partial, "monomythic" definitions are rejected in favor of a complex, inclusive one, the seventeen items of which are then discussed. A mythological corpus consists of a network of myths, which are culturally-important imaginal stories conveying, by means of metaphor and symbol, graphic imagery, and emotional conviction and participation, the primal, foundational accounts of the real, experienced world, and humankind's roles and relative statuses within it. Mythologies may convey the political and moral values of a culture, and provide systems of interpreting individual experience within a universal perspective, which may include the intervention of suprahuman entities, as well as aspects of the natural and cultural orders. Myths may be enacted or reflected in rituals, ceremonies, and dramas, or provide materials for secondary elaborations. Only a polyphasic definition will provide appreciation of their manifold roles within a society.<br>

Article Title: Political Culture and Political Symbolism: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis<br>
Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
Issue: i308701<br>
Date: 7 1, 1977<br>
Author(s): Dittmer Lowell<br>
Abstract: The concept of political culture embraces some of the most basic, perennially fascinating concerns in behavioral political science; because of certain ambiguities in its theoretical formulation, however, there has been a tendency for the term to grow fuzzy with continued use. Its connection with related concepts, such as political psychology, political structure, and political language, has remained unclear, with the result that political culture has been difficult to isolate as an independent variable. Thus it has come to occupy a position on the periphery of politics, and is usually presumed to reinforce the status quo. This paper re-examines previous formulations of the concept and proposes a theoretical synthesis. The analytical framework is derived from semiological theory, a branch of science specifically designed for the analysis of meanings. The central variable is the political symbol. By analyzing the interactions of political symbols within a comprehensive semiological framework, the traditional concerns of political culture can be accommodated in a more precise and systematic way.<br>

Abstract: By studying Durkheim through a Schopenhauerian lens, the one-sidedly cognitivist and functionalist reception of his social theory can be balanced. Durkheim explicitly rejected such monistic interpretations. His dialectical approach was always aimed at an essentially dualistic perception of man and society, wherein the lower pole, the individual, is central. In Durkheim's symbol theory, this position leads to two kinds of symbols: those that are bound to the human body, here called "this and that" symbols, and those people can choose freely, here called "this for that" symbols. This twofold symbol theory can already be found in medieval philosophy (e.g. Dante Alighieri) as well as in the work of Paul Ricoeur. For Durkheim the human person is the symbol par excellence. By implication the rituals in which the person is (re)constructed, that is the rites of passage, should be central. The interpretation here opens up new perspectives for a more psychological interpretation of Durkheim's sociology.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

Article Title: "I DON'T DO SYSTEMS": AN INTERVIEW WITH CLIFFORD GEERTZ<br>
Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23548454<br>

Author(s): GEERTZ CLIFFORD<br>
Abstract: I had the honor of interviewing Clifford Geertz at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, USA, on October 18, 2000. The interview focused on Geertz's theoretical conceptions, the tradition on which he draws, the critique he has encountered, and on interpretive anthropology's future development. Of particular interest was the clarification of his much-debated method, his definition of symbol and his famous definition of religion as a cultural system. Geertz emphasizes his attempt to exercise an applied pragmatic phenomenological and hermeneutical method without any general theory (or philosophy) of meaning, phenomenology, or culture. He maintains that he only has a conceptual framework inspired by different scholars, which nevertheless has consistent focus and perspective, i.e., meaning and symbol. In relationship to this, Geertz defines his symbol within the Peircean semiotic tradition. Therefore, the term symbol is understood as a sign (an index for example), which becomes a symbol via a cultural interpretation. Furthermore, his definition of religion as a cultural system is, in his view, a non-essentialistic definition and therefore is not—as Talal Asad claims—ethnocentric. Although it is Geertz's opinion that interpretive anthropology has been influenced by postmodernism, he predicts that interpretive anthropology's future development will be in reasonable continuity with its past. In my closing comments I tentatively suggest that Geertz may have a theory of interpretation because of his definition of the symbol, his unavoidable assumptions, and his unique method, which has the capacity of grasping the cultural specific in a general way.<br>

Abstract: The current methods in psychoanalytic studies of God images and representations have focused almost exclusively on individual, internal processes. This article examines how psychological anthropologists go about formulating symbolic representations of deity in their research, in comparison with the object relations method of God-representations. Drawing on Melford Spiro's integrative proposal for interpreting the mental and collective representations in religious symbol systems, this paper proposes that there is a need for a comprehensive model of the representational process in the Eastern world in order to suit its cultural traditions. The author uses both theoretical and historical materials as well as personal narrative throughout its entirety to balance the two in a mutual and coherent flow of understanding. Noting the culturally patterned interactions with culturally postulated God-symbols, the object relations method of God-representations will be utilized to probe how God is both created and found on a collective (cultural) level as well as individual level.<br>

Abstract: Es wird eine Theorie des Gedächtnisses für autobiographisches Material dargestellt. Diese Theorie beinhaltet als zentrale Annahmen: Einen Symbolbildungsprozeß, der einerseits affektiv erlebte Objektbeziehungen innerlich in Form von Propositionen (Repräsentanzen) abbildet und andererseits diese Repräsentanzen wiederum in mitteilbare Symbole transformiert; Verdrängung, die solche Repräsentanzen erfassen kann und somit ein Unbewußtes schafft, das in Objektbeziehungen gründet; Abwehrprozesse, die Teil der Symbolisierungsfunktion sind und die unbewußte Repräsentanzen in bewußte, aber verzerrte Symbole transformieren. Erklärt werden sollen durch diese Theorie Gedächtnisphänomene wie Erinnern, verzerrtes Erinnern und Wiederholen vom Charakter des Wiederholungszwanges. A theory of memory for biographical material is proposed. This theory consists in the following central assumptions: a symbol formation process, which on the one hand maps affectively experienced object relations into inner propositions (representations) and on the other hand transforms representations into communicable symbols; repression which may affect representations and which thus establishes an unconsciousness which is rooted in object relations; defense mechanisms, which are part of the symbol formation process and which transform unsonscious representations into conscious but distorted symbols. This theory is supposed to explain remembering, distorted remembering, and phenomena of compulsive repetition.<br>

Author(s): WATSON STEPHEN H.<br>
Abstract: Paul Klee's art found broad impact upon philosophers of varying commitments, including Hans-Georg Gadamer. Moreover, Klee himself was not only one of the most important artists of aesthetic modernism but one of its leading theoreticians, and much in his work, as in Gadamer's, originated in post-Kantian literary theory's explications of symbol and allegory. Indeed at one point in Truth and Method, Gadamer associates his project for a general "theory of hermeneutic experience" not only with Goethe's metaphysical account of the symbolic but equally with a "rehabilitation" of allegory. In this paper, I examine this position and Gadamer's own use of it in his analysis of Klee's work, contrasting it with that of Walter Benjamin's account of allegory, equally indebted to Goethe and this archive. Finally, I contrast the resulting interpretations of Klee, discussing the implications that evolve for understanding both Gadamer and Benjamin—but equally for understanding Klee's work and, provisionally, the work of art, thus construed, for philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Much archaeological scholarship on consumption has approached its subject matter as the means to an end—e.g., as a way of studying socioeconomic status—rather than as a proper object of study in its own right. The "consumer choice" school, and, more recently, advocates of consumer behavior studies, have supported approaches that emphasize quantitative methods, at the same time downplaying the "qualitative" or symbolic aspects of consumption. A considerable body of literature on the symbolic aspects of consumption exists both in historical archaeology and other fields. The intention of this essay is to draw together this recent literature on consumption and combine it into a single approach that emphasizes shopping as the meaningful action at the very heart of consumption. With the emphasis on agency, this approach presents shopping as that crucial moment of transformation where identity, intention, and symbol combine in the decision to purchase, to own, an object.<br>

Abstract: Die Frage, wie eigentlich im bibl. Hebr. das Wort “ Warnung" ausgedriickt wird,
fiihrte mich zu der interessanten Beobachtung, daB im Gesenius-Worterbuch, 17.Aufl.,
S. 1005 dabei als erstes an “Vt" gedacht wurde. MuB Vt etwas Sichtbares sein? An
den weitaus meisten Stellen ist das der Fall. In 1 Sam 14,10 allerdings ist es etwas, das
gehort wurde. Wenn der Sabbat (Ex 31,17; Ez 20,12.20) oder die Beschneidung (Gen
17,11) mit diesem Terminus bezeichnet werden, dann denken wir im Dtsch. eher an
eine Einrichtung als standige Mahnung (ahnlich wie es der l.Mai, der Volkstrauertag
oder auch die kirchlichen Feste bei uns sind). Die Namen der Kinder in Jes 7,14 und
8,18 sind wohl eher als Illustrationen zur prophetischen Verkiindigung zu verstehen,
insofern schon symboltrachtig, aber kaum Zeichen im eigentlichen Sinn. In Jes 66,19
bleibt offen, was einmal Vt sein wird. In Num 17,25 soil Aarons Stab ein Symbol der
Warnung sein, in Ez 14,8 paBt nur noch die Bedeutung “Warnung" und Vt ^mt - von
Rahab in Jos 2,12 den Kundschaftern abverlangt - ist nicht ein sichtbares Zeichen ge-
wesen, sondern es bestand in einem Eid. (Zwar spielt bei Rahabs Errettung ein rotes
Seil eine Rolle, aber dieses ist nicht als *wt ^mt bezeichnet worden, sondern allein der
Eid, den die Kundschafter der Rahab geben sollten; das Seil dient zwar in der Erzah-
lung als Zeichen, aber es wird spater von Rahab den Israeliten gegeben- ein wich-
tiger Unterschied.)<br>

Author(s): Scheuch Erwin K.<br>
Abstract: First of all an overview is presented of the development in the social sciences that led to postmodernism. The starting point for this is the modernity that was under the influence of Parsons after the second World War. It extended to the Third World mainly in the context of development research. Since the end of the 1970s the contributions of two German scientists, Niklas Luhmann and Jürgen Habermas, have received international recognition. During this time the first critical voices concerning the modernist theories were heard. Among ideas opposing these theories the approaches should be named first, which the author calls "post industrial". To these he counts primarily the analysis of the modern socio-economic system by Daniel Bell and the studies of the "post-material personality" by Ronald Inglehart. Research on the change of values in modern societies should be named in the same context. However, "post-industrial" should not be confused with "post-modern". The origin of the latter term from the "culture scene" is explained. The language of the post-modernists can be viewed as their characteristic, as well as the attempts of deconstruction imprinted by Derrida. Ever since Lyotard the strong bond between the name and the named object within the language has been questioned. Therefore, Jean Baudrillard is correct in noting a loss in the sense of orientation of the modern human being. For example, the works of two post-modernists, Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck, are discussed in detail, after which the author concludes: "That is the most important meaning of postmodernity: as a symbol for the weakened autonomy of the sciences and arts, as a lack for the support of sciences in culture and politics". Nevertheless one can observe a return to rationality in recent years.<br>

Article Title: Symbolic Dimensions in Cultural Anthropology [and Comments and Reply]<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i327968<br>
Date: 4 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Webster Steven<br>
Abstract: Using the hermeneutical theory of Paul Ricoeur, it is possible to discern symbolic dimensions in cultural anthropology. Symbols, here, are dominant images in anthropologists' texts, creatively posited by inquirers, that, most importantly, possess a surplus of meaning. A symbol's fullest surplus of meaning is a prereflexive and comprehensive "understanding" (Verstehen) that may encompass a scholar's attempts at "explanation" (Erklaren). Examples of this symbolic dimension are the "understandings" that lie implicit in two elaborate anthropological systems: Levi-Strauss's structuralism and Harris's cultural materialism. Amid their commitments to anthropological "science" and "explanation," the works of each disclose a distinctive Verstehen. For Levi-Strauss, this "understanding" is nurtured by his image "world of reciprocity." For Harris, it is carried by the image "nature." This "understanding" has two major functions. On the level of the intellectual coherence of their texts, it gives unity to their intercultural interpretations of other societies and to their intracultural interpretations of their own traditions. On a moral level, it includes modes of being-in-the-world that Levi-Strauss and Harris prefer and ocasionally press upon their readers. Discernment of symbolic dimensions of "understanding" in anthropologists' texts may be an initial step toward reflection on the matrices out of which diverse explanations are presented in anthropological literature.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo explora el impacto de la globalización en la memoria, centrándose en el ordenador considerado como agente (y símbolo) de la primera y como instrumento de la segunda. Pero el ordenador también puede considerarse un eslabón de una larga cadena histórica que empezó con la invención de la escritura: ésta es la razón (defiende el artículo) por la que las reflexiones de Platón y Aristóteles sobre escritura y oralidad, memoria y recuerdo, todavía tienen relevancia para nosotros. El artículo trata principalmente de las implicaciones cognitivas de memoria y recuerdo, pero en la última sección aborda brevemente las implicaciones morales y políticas de ambas, refiriéndose al libro reciente de Paul Ricœur, La memoria, la historia, el olvido, así como a las comisiones establecidas en distintas partes del mundo para investigar las violaciones de los derechos humanos del pasado reciente y no tan reciente. /// The paper explores the impact of globalization on memory focusing on the computer, considered as an agent (and a symbol) of the former, and as an instrument of the latter. But the computer can be also seen as a link in a long historical chain which began with the invention of writing: this is why (the paper argues) Plato's and Aristotle's reflections on writing and orality,memory and recollection, are still relevant to us. The paper deals primarily with the cognitive implications of memory and recollection, but the last section addresses briefly the moral and political implications of both, referring to Paul Ricœur's recent book La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli, as well as to the commissions set up in various parts of the world to investigate human rights violations of the recent and the not so recent past.<br>

Author(s): Lamont Michele<br>
Abstract: How can an interpretive theory gain legitimacy in two cultural markets as different as France and the United States? This study examines the intellectual, cultural, institutional, and social conditions of legitimation of Jacques Derrida's work in the two countries and develops hypotheses about the process of legitimation of interpretive theories. The legitimation of Derrida's work resulted from a fit between it and highly structured cultural and institutional systems. In France, Derrida capitalized on the structure of the intellectual market by targeting his work to a large cultural public rather than to a shrinking group of academic philosophers. His work appealed to the intellectual public as a status symbol and as a novel and sophisticated way to deal with late 1960s politics. In the United States, Derrida and a group of prestigious literary critics reframed his theory and disseminated it in university departments of literature. His work was imported concurrently with the work of other French scholars with whom he shared a market. Derrida's support is more concentrated and stronger in one discipline than the support for other French intellectuals. In America, professional institutions and journals played a central role in the diffusion of his work, while cultural media were more central in France.<br>

Publisher: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland<br>
Issue: i330183<br>
Date: 3 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Ohnuki-Tierney Emiko<br>
Abstract: Most symbols are polytropic as well as polysemic in that their multiple meanings in various contexts functions as different types ot trope. This article pursues the complex nature of polytropes through a formulation of synecdoche as an interstitial trope between metaphor and metonymy, and demonstrates how the two conceptual principles of analogy and contiguity, that define metaphor and metonymy respectively, are interdependent and interpenetrated, rather than of basically different natures as presented in the biaxial image of structural linguistics. The analogic thought expressed in methaphor involves movement and temporality, just as does the discursive thought of metonymy. The interpenetration of the two modes of thought is demostrated through an analysis of the process of objectification of what, throughout history, has been a dominant symbol of self in Japanese culture: the monkey. As a polysemic and polytropic symbol, the monkey takes on different meanings, and functions as different tropic types, sequentially or simultaneously, as actors use and/or interpret the symbol in varying historical and social contexts.<br>

symbol in the composition, in other words the more successful the dis-

Publisher: British Forum for Ethnomusicology<br>
Issue: i354683<br>
Date: 1 1, 1977<br>
Author(s): Witherspoon Timothy<br>
Abstract: Musical meaning is examined from three perspectives, with ethnographic examples from Bulgarian music. First, music's significance for human life and its very nature are understood through metaphorical predication - for example, music is art; music is social behaviour; music is commodity; music is symbol or text. Interpretations of musical signification result from processes of identity, iconicity, association and contrast, which help to create multiple meanings for music. Finally, while states and other institutions often try to control music's meaning, its polyvalent nature and the differing social and historical positions of its interpreters militate against all such efforts.<br>

Article Title: Art and Agency: A Reassessment<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i357335<br>
Date: 9 1, 1981<br>
Author(s): Wolff Robert<br>
Abstract: In his book, Art and agency, Alfred Gell presents a theory of art based neither on aesthetics nor on visual communication. Art is defined by the distinctive function it performs in advancing social relationships through 'the abduction of agency'. Art objects are indexes of the artist's or model's agency. This article examines Gell's use of agency, particularly in relation to the ritual art that is central to his argument. Focusing on Gell's employment of Peirce's term 'index' (out of his triad of index, icon, and symbol), I note that Peirce's approach deflects attention from signification towards the link between art works and the things to which they refer. I consider what Peirce meant by abduction, and conclude that while Gell makes a good case for the agency of art objects he does not explain the distinctive ways in which art objects extend their maker's or user's agency. Gell lacked the time to make detailed revisions before publication and I acknowledge that, given more time, he might have revised some parts of the book. / Dans son livre Art and Agency, Alfred Gell présente une théorie de l'art qui ne se base ni sur l'esthétique, ni sur la communication visuelle. Il définit l'art par sa fonction distinctive dans l'établissement de relations sociales, par «l'abduction de l'intentionnalité (agency)». Les objets d'art sont des index de l'intentionnalité de l'artiste ou du modèle. Le présent article analyse l'utilisation par Gell de l'intentionnalité, notamment dans le cadre de l'art rituel qui constitue un axe central de son raisonnement. En se concentrant sur l'usage par Gell du terme «index» de Peirce (dans la trichotomie index, icône, symbole), l'auteur note que l'approche de Peirce prête moins d'attention à la signification qu'au lien entre les œuvres d'art et les objets auxquels elles font référence. Il examine ce que Peirce entendait par «abduction» et en conclut que si Gell s'en tire bien sur l'intentionnalité des objets d'art, il n'explique pas de quelle m~<br>

Publisher: Maney Publishing<br>
Issue: i288901<br>
Date: 4 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): FreudAbstract: Although the depiction of a Neanderthal people in "The Inheritors" by William Golding is based mainly on the author's imagination and is thus anthropologically untenable, the author's treatment of Oa the earth goddess, worshipped by this tribe, is of unique value and justly represents his key concept. The reciprocity between the symbolic system and the symbol-dissolving element, both inherent in Oa, is very significant regarding cultural, religious, and psychological aspects in relation to the human beings in this novel. This reciprocity helps in the rediscovery of human potentialities that might be repressed and buried under the power structure of a given society.<br>

Publisher: Faculdade de Filosofia<br>

Author(s): Renaud Michel<br>
Abstract: Este estudo dedica-se à teoria da verdade tal como se apresenta nas obras de Ricoeur entre 1947 e 1960. Procura-se sublinhar o vaivém entre uma compreensão ontológica da verdade, marcada antes de mais pelo pensamento de Karl Jaspers (1947), e uma compreensão fenomenológica da verdade centrada na teoria do juízo (1960). Contudo a análise da tensão entre a unidade do verdadeiro e a multiplicidade das filosofias permite elaborar o conceito de verdade como comunicação e de verdade como objecto de esperança. Procura-se então mostrar o fundamento desta esperança bem como a dimensão pela qual ela ultrapassa o universo da filsosofia. A conclusão sublinha que os desenvolvimentos ulteriores de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sobre a hermenêutica do símbolo, da metáfora e da narrativa ganham em serem relidos no horizonte das tensões do problema da verdade. /// Cette étude est consacrée à la théorie de la vérité telle qu'elle se présente dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur entre 1947 et 1960. On cherche à souligner le va-et-vient entre une compréhension ontologique de la vérité initielement influencée par la pensée de Karl Jaspers 1947, et une compréhension phénoménologique de la vérité centrée sur la théorie du jugement (1960). L'analyse de la tension entre l'unité du vrai et la multiplicité des philosophies débouche cependant sur le concept de vérité comme communication et comme object d'espérence. On cherche alors à montrer le fondement de cette espérance ainsi que la dimension par laquelle elle dépasse l'univers de la philosophie. La conclusion souligne que les développements ultérieurs de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sur l'herméneutique du symbole, de la métaphore et du récit ont tout à gagner à être replacés et relus à l'horizon des tensions du problème de la vérité. /// This study pays special attention to the theory of truth elaborated in Ricoeur's work from 1947 to 1960. It seeks to stress the complication of–on one hand–ontological understanding, at first influenced by Karl Jasper's thought (1947), ~<br>

Abstract: This article constitutes an exploration of Mahmud Darwish's poem, "The Hoopoe," as part of a study on the relationship of myths to culture, in general, and to literature and poetry, in particular. It starts from the hoopoe as a mythical symbol pulling the text in two directions. First, a direction that relates the poem, through time, to the realms of the universe, dream, and poetry, using the language of insinuations and allusions; second, a fictional direction that makes of the the poem-through evocation of previous quest journeys, including texts by Al-Jahiz, Avicenna, Al-Suhrawardi, Al-Hallaj, Aristophanes, and Farid Al-Din Attar-a quest into the depths of the individual and the collective self. Memory, history, and language, culminate in the discovery of the mother-land. Thus, Darwish's poem may be classified as poetry, prose, drama, and epic. It is, in fact, a mixture of all these genres, as well as a literary myth narrating the story of the search for a sacred time-the time of beginnings, and of childhood. /تمثل المقالة حفراﹰ استبطانياﹰ في قصيدة "الهدهد" لمحمود درويش - ضمن بحث في علاقة الأساطير بالثقافة عامة وبالأدب والشعر خاصة - انطلاقاﹰ من الهدهد كرمز أسطوري يتجاذب النص في اتجاهين اثنين: أ- اتجاه جدولي، يصل القصيدة - عبر الزمن - بعالم الكون وعالم المنام وعالم الشعر في لغة اللمح والإشارة٠ ب- اتجاه أفقي قصصي، يجعل من القصيدة - عبر رحلات نموذجية سابقة ومن خلال نصوص حاضرة غائبة للجاحظ، وابن سينا، والسهروردي، والحلاج، وأرسطوفان، وفريد الدين العطار، وغيرهم - رحلة في أعماق الذات الفردية، وفي أعماق الذات الجماعية ذاكرة وتاريخاﹰ٠ تجمع قصيدة درويش بين "الشعر" و"النثر" والمسرحية والملحمة، كما أنها أسطورة أدبية تقص علينا قصة بحث عن زمن مقدس هو زمن البدايات والطفولة٠‬<br>

Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: Ever since Plato the identity of philosophy has been at issue in the quarrel between philosophy and poetry. Can changing times alter the identity of philosophy, and simultaneously the identity of poetry? In the Republic poetry is a third rate illusion compared with contemplation of "the things that truly are". We can trace the background of this disqualification when we distinguish three levels in the relation of language to reality. 1. We can distinguish assertion, melody and rhythm. The first is the same in poetry and prose, the last is superfluous. 2. Speech is superior to writing in virtue of the speaker's inner mastery over himself. 3. The interiorizing move culminates in the soundless conversation of the soul with itself, contemplating the eternal identical "without the stain of speech or sign" (Boutens). For Plato, then, we move from poetry to prose, from prose to speech, from speech to silence. Is there room for aesthetics in this view? In the second part of my lecture I reconstruct Symbolism, a current in literature that in every respect is the opposite of Platonism. Although the goal is the same — the search for true reality — the difference is that the route is now reversed. I restrict myself to the French branch. 4. Baudelaire formulated the basic principle of Symbolism: the ineffable does not exist. "The ultimate goal of the universe is to be expressed" (Valéry). The same worldview is expressed later by Gadamer: an ontology "guided by language". 5. The second principle is that the primary language is script, "Book" (Mallarmé). 6. Poetry proves to be the true language. The music (rhyme, rhytm, tune) reveals the things "exactly as they are" (Wallace Stevens). In poetry the linguistic sign becomes a symbol because the sound, the physical aspect of the linguistic sign, plays a role in the production of meaning. A poem is a "sustained hesitation between sense and sound" (Valéry). Is sound not however a disturbing factor in revealing the things 'as they are'?~<br>

Article Title: Le Quilt : un mémorial vivant pour les morts du sida<br>
Publisher: Armand Colin<br>
Issue: i40044534<br>
Date: 3 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Fellous Michèle<br>
Abstract: Le Quilt possède une double dimension, singulière et militante : chaque panneau, chaque nom énoncé lors du déploiement signifie l'unicité de chaque disparu ; mais l'assemblage des patchworks, leur abandon à l'association qui va les recueillir, les assembler et les utiliser pour porter à l'attention du monde entier l'énormité de la catastrophe renvoie à la dimension sociale inhérente au décès de chaque individu mort du sida. Le développement fulgurant du rite du patchwork aux États-Unis s'explique par ce double enjeu et par la réappropriation de symboles fondateurs de l'imaginaire américain. En se réappropriant un symbole commun, le Quilt légitime et réintègre la communauté gay porteuse du projet dans cette société qui l'a niée. The Quilt has from the outset both a singular and militant dimension : each panel, each name mentioned during the unfolding means the uniqueness of each dead ; but the assembled patchworks, their donation to the association which will conserve, assemble and use them to draw worldwide attention to this dreadful disaster refer to the social dimension inherent to each individual having died of AIDS. The extremely rapid development of the patchwork rite in the United States can be explained by these two functions and within the reappropriation of founding symbols of the Americans'world of imagination. By reappropriating a common symbol the Quilt legitimates and reintegrates the gay community, bearer of the project, into a society from which it was rejected. Von Anfang an hat der Quilt eine eigenartige und zugleich militante Dimension. Jeder Teil des Patchworks, jeder Name, der während der Entfaltung ausgesprochen wird, besagt die Eigenartigkeit jedes Gestorbenen. Doch verweisen das Zusammenfügen der Patchworkwerke und ihre Überlassung dem Verein, der sie bewahren, zusammenfügen und verwenden wird, um die Aufmerksamkeit der ganzen Welt auf diese schreckliche Katastrophe zu lenken, auf die dem Tode jedes AIDSkranken inhärente soziale Dimension.

Abstract: Norbert Elias never presented his views regarding collective memory in a systematic manner. However, his approach may be reconstructed on the basis of such works as The Civilizing Process, Time: An Essay and The Symbol Theory. The most important tenet of Elias is that human memory can only be explained by the symbol theory. Human ability to use socially created symbols in communication is applied in activities in which symbols are used (speaking, thinking, knowing and remembering), which makes memory a part of general process of symbolic communication. Memory research needs to account for the interactive and communicational origins of both individual and collective remembering. One of the crucial issues related to remembering is collective forgetting. According to Elias it operates by three main mechanisms: (1) elimination and creation of fantastic notions (fantasy being a substitute and subsidiary for experience), (2) modification of social canons of reference as a result of power struggle in social figurations, and (3) delegitimization of alternative imageries by means of marginalization or elimination of groups acting as their social vehicles. I discuss these mechanisms and the dynamics of memory they entail in the broader conceptual framework of the theory of civilizing processes referring to Central and Eastern European examples in order to demonstrate the productivity of Elias's interdisciplinary and multidimensional analysis in social memory studies focusing this region.<br>

Publisher: Presses de Sciences Po<br>
Issue: i40104982<br>
Date: 6 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Bohnekamp Dorothea<br>
Abstract: On sait combien l'Allemagne fédérale a construit sa légitimité démocratique sur le traitement de la mémoire de la Shoah. Mais comment la communauté juive présente dans le pays a-t-elle reçu cette mémoire ? Cet article tente de répondre a cette question en s'appuyant notamment sur la presse judéo-allemande et en dressant une chronologie depuis la guerre. Dorothea Bohnekamp montre comment, apres la désillusion des communautes juives apres 1945 face à l'absence d'intérêt manifeste par les autorités à leur endroit, 1952 représente un tournant, quand l'attention portee à la vie juive en Allemagne devient un critère d'évaluation de la democratisation de la RFA. L'après-1989 constitue une nouvelle étape, avec l'arrivée massive de Juifs russophones renouvelant la vie communautaire. Toutefois les debats passionnés sur le Musée juif de Berlin ou sur le Mémorial de l'Holocauste invitent à se demander dans quelle mesure les Juifs vivant en Allemagne ne sont pas en définitive dépossédés de la mémoire de la Shoah au profit des descendants des bourreaux. Centrale au sein de la culturelle mémorielle allemande, la mémoire de la Shoah reste un imperatif politique fort en République fédérale allemande, dont Pidentite democratique s'est construite en opposition absolue au nazisme. Après le déni des crimes nazis dans l'après-guerre, la réactivation du passé depuis les annees 1970 participe d'une représentation politique du judaïsme considérée comme symbole de la culture républicaine du pays. Or, les nombreuses expressions de la culture mémorielle en Allemagne (musées, mémoriaux, etc.) ont souvent été sujet à polémique, dans la mesure où leur utilisation publique reflète aussi la difficulté à imprimer une logique collective à des souvenirs traumatiques irréductiblement individuels. Si les communautés judéo-allemandes renaissent depuis la Réunification, elles ne se sentent pas toujours pleinement représentees par la culture memorielle officielle et restent réfractaires a toute instrumenta~<br>

Abstract: Cet article offre une vision globale de l'œuvre de Ricœur, l'auteur proposant d'y lire une logique de développement en spirale, parce que dans les ouvrages les plus tardifs du philosophe nous trouvons un retour de la recherche sur la volonté — inscrite dans le cadre d'une anthropologie philosophique — qui avait inspiré son projet de jeunesse. Mouvement en spirale, et non retour circulaire aux origines, car entre le début et la fin il n'y a pas coïncidence mais enrichissement après un long détour à travers l'univers du langage. Ce détour — selon l'hypothèse de travail de l'auteur — progresse à travers trois paradigmes: symbole, texte et traduction. Dans la traduction travaillent le propre et l'étranger, le soi et l'autre, l'autre que nous retrouvons en nous et qui ne se réduit pas à l'altérité de l'autre homme. Un concept pluriel d'humanité — qui est pourtant une — y est à l'oeuvre. Le travail jamais accompli de la traduction suggère enfin l'idée d'une herméneutique de l'inachèvement. This article offers a global vision of Ricœur's work, in which the author suggests the existence of a spiral development, insofar as in the most recent works we find a return to the same research on the will — within the context of a philosophical anthropology — that inspired the project of Ricœur's youthful years. Spiral movement and not circular return to the origin, because the beginning and the end do not coincide but rather enrich one another, after a long detour of many decades through the universe of language. This detour — according to author's working hypothesis — has progressively developed through three paradigms: symbol, text and translation. In translation, what is at work is the familiar and the foreign, the self and the other, the other that we find in ourselves and that cannot be reduced to the otherness of the other man. In translation we find a plural concept of humanity, which is nevertheless one. The never complete work of translation suggests ultimately the idea of ~<br>

Abstract: Since the Kantian revolution, metaphysical knowledge has been articulated by influential theologians in the language of analogy. In accordance with this tradition, the metaphor found in Luke-Acts, that God does live in houses, but not houses built by men, is explored by studying it as a root metaphor. A root metaphor in the theological sense can be defined as the most basic assumption we can make about man's existence and experience. In this article John H Elliott's proposal that 'temple' and 'household' in Luke-Acts articulate a contrast in social institutions is debated. I wish to argue that this 'contrast' does not really articulate a shift in social institutions, but rather a broadening of an existing social institution as the result of a changed symbolic universe. This shift in symbolic universe is studied against the backdrop of a tendency to broaden the temple as a theological symbol which had already started and which intensified during the Second temple period. It is shown that the temple, its sacrificial offerings and purifying rituals, were closely associated with the household, its meals and purifying ceremonies. Jesus also advocated the broadening of the concept temple/household. His view is reportedly conveyed by Stephen, Peter, James, and Paul.<br>

Abstract: A metafísica aristotélica não considera o ser enquanto ser em si mesmo, mas enquanto símbolo daquilo que é simultaneamente o mais universal e o mais singular para o espírito. Platão antecipou a concepção propondo uma dialéctica ascendente, completada por uma dialéctica descendente, cuja dinâmica fora objecto de pesquisa nas suas últimas obras. A metafísica encontra-se na intersecção destas duas dialécticas, no eixo em que a primeira passa na outra. Este eixo começa a fazer sentido a partir do saber que o pensamento tem de si mesmo. A mentalidade representativa, desatenta à especificidade deste eixo, não consegue aceder à dimensão dos caminhos da razão. O eixo no coração das dialécticas clássicas é assumido pela metafísica contemporânea em termos de tempo associado com o espírito vivo em detrimento do ser conceptual. Aristotelian metaphysics does not consider being qua being in itself, but rather as a symbol of what is, for the spirit, at once the most universal and the most particular. Plato had anticipated the conception, the dynamic of which had been the object of investigation in his last works. Metaphysics finds itself at the intersection of these two dialectics, at the axis around which the first passes into the other. The axis takes its sense from the knowledge that thought has of itself. The mentality, based on representation, inattentive to the specificity of this axis, does not have access to the amplitude of the paths that reason can take. The axis at the heart of classic dialectics is taken up by contemporary metaphysics in terms of time associated with the living spirit rather than as conceptual being.<br>

Abstract: To discuss the practice of memory and its relations to politics, social scientists rely on three kinds of practices - memorialising, memorising and the act of remembering/forgetting. The commemoration of "1857" is unique in that official celebrations of the event have been instituted even as 1857 continues to refigure in myths and endures as a symbol of popular resistance. The articles in this special issue address the seeming contradictions and complexities that "remembering" 1857 involves, and the tension that prevails between different kinds of recall.<br>

Abstract: Metaphor, Vibration and Form identifies a process that underlies all ritual enactments. Whether it is Joseph Campbell's analysis of the Hero's journey, Victor Turner's theoretical and experiential interest in symbols, or Charles Laughlin's cycle of meaning, there is at work a particular kind of behavioral transformation system. It begins with the mind and the meanings provided metaphorically for symbols, then proceeds to an intense focus on symbolic sequences in meditation or in ritual dramas, so that the metaphor is taken into the body as physical experience. From this physical "ownership" of the metaphor, the properties associated with it are encouraged, socially and ritually, to come to the surface and be enacted in the form of everyday behavior. Questions of symbolic appropriation, the redundancy of symbol, and professional responsibility are addressed in the concluding remarks.<br>

Abstract: Le symbole opère en signifiant et signifie en opérant. Pour fonder plus tard ce propos philosophique, il convient de revenir sur trois débats qui ont contribué à résoudre le sens du symbole dans l'éthique : la scission du symbole d'avec le signe, sa reprise dans le langage, son expulsion du sacré. Si l'on est conduit à redéfinir les droits, mais aussi les conditions et les modes d'une ontologie du symbole, on ne saurait négliger ce qui rend celui-ci possible : la culture. Identifiée à la structure signifiante et opérante du symbole, la culture s'entremet entre les capacités de symbolisation du vécu sensible et l'actualisation cognitive et pratique des symboles effectifs. The symbol operates by signifying and signifies by operating. In order to justify this philosophical affirmation, it is convenient to look back at three debates which have contributed to determining the sense of the symbol in ethics: the distinction between the symbol and the sign, the symbol's reintegration in language, and its expulsion from the domain of the sacred. If one is led to redefine not only the rights, but also the conditions and modes of an ontology of the symbol, then one may not neglect the thing which makes this possible: culture. Identified with the significant and operative structure of the symbol, culture places itself between the capacities for symbolisation of sensitive living, and the cognitive and practical actualisation of existing symbols.<br>

Abstract: Alors que le Quatrième Évangile rapportait dialogues et symboles à la communication de la Révélation, la théologie contemporaine les renvoie souvent à une altérité constitutive de toute éthique. Partant de cet écart, irréductible à un simple renversement, l'article cherche à montrer comment le dialogisme et le symbolisme, grâce à leur dissemblance, demeurent aussi essentiels l'un que l'autre à l'accueil de l'Évangile, de la Révélation, du Salut. L'identification du croyant passe aussi bien par un dialogue né d'une séparation que par un symbole ordonné à un rassemblement. Pour parvenir à cette conclusion, l'article doit d'abord définir les conditions requises pour que chacune des deux formations signifiantes ouvre à la fois à un monde et à une communauté : un être et un agir nouveaux. While the Fourth Gospel draws upon dialogues and symbols for the communication of revelation, contemporary theology often relegates them to an otherness constitutive of any ethic. Beginning with this rupture, irreducible to a simple reversal, this paper seeks to show how dialogue and symbolism, thanks to their dissimilarity, remain so essential to each other for the reception of the Gospel, of revelation, of salvation. The identification of the believer passes just as well through a dialogue born of a separation as by a symbol ordered to a gathering. In order to arrive at this conclusion, this paper assumes the task of defining the conditions necessary for each of the two significant formations to open upon a world and a community: a new being and act.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219705<br>
Date: 1 1, 1972<br>
Author(s): Sittler Roy<br>
Abstract: Starting with Raglan's suggestion that Falstaff may be a "holy fool" and with Auden's belief that he is a comic symbol of charity, this essay explores the medieval tradition of wise fool, and especially Falstaff's always canny use of biblical allusion. His various jests, if read in relation to the political action of the main plot, reveal him as characterizing England's time of day and parodying the unchristian behavior of Hotspur, Henry, and Hal. By the time he dies mumbling Psalm xxiii to an uncomprehending Nell Quickly, there have accumulated many hints that he is, in fact, a candle to his age, a professional Fool with the heart of a faithful Lazarus, and destined to join Mowbray in Abraham's bosom. The merriment for which readers have found him lovable amid his masquerades of vice has its mysterious basis in his covertly Christian understanding of England's neo-Roman Caesars.<br>

Abstract: Concepts of place, narrative, tradition, and identity are employed in a conservative reading of the Texas A&M Bonfire. Texas A&M embodied regional narratives of a dual Southern commitment to economic and technological development and conservation of traditional cultural. Institutionalized at Texas A&M in the late nineteenth century, these narratives made a paradoxical place. Bonfire expressed and obscured this paradox. In line with the narrative of tradition, Texas A&M was an all-male military school until 1965. The students were uniform, isolated, and regimented. This social structure engendered intense feelings of loyalty and community. These social emotions were further aroused at events like yell practice, and projected onto Bonfire. After the Second World War the commitment of university administrators to economic and technological progress increasingly threatened the narrative of tradition and the cultivation of manliness. Student veneration of Bonfire intensified. After 1965 mandatory military drill was discontinued, women were enrolled, and the student body was enlarged. Social pluralism fragmented the meaning of Bonfire; conflict and disorderly behavior ensued. By the 1990s the university had partly rationalized Bonfire as a corporate symbol; however, this trend was tragically terminated in 1999 when the cumulative errors of the oral tradition caused Bonfire to collapse, killing twelve students.<br>

Article Title: "Say First What Cause": Ricoeur and the Etiology of Evil in Paradise Lost<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219783<br>

Author(s): Webber John S.<br>
Abstract: Paradise Lost traces evil through three inceptions-Satanic, Adamic, and historical. Each origin seems to envision a different etiology: Satanic evil springs exclusively from the self in an instant of radical "Pelagian" freedom. Adamic evil emerges from the ambiguous interplay between self and seductive environment. Historical evil contaminates the whole race by means of necessary "Augustinian" inheritance. Ricoeur's analysis of the "Adamic Myth" and original sin clarifies etiological traditions Milton assimilates from Christian symbol, myth, and dogma. Through Ricoeur, we can identify the contrasting modalities of evil (inherited and imitative, physical and moral, ontological and existential, necessary and free, communal and individual) fused in Paradise Lost. Ricoeur's work reveals Milton's text to be a subtly inclusive etiological myth, one whose complex genesis of evil recovers Scripture's fullness of meaning in a new mythopoesis.<br>

Abstract: The aim of the article is to present some aspects of Paul Ricœur’s thought, especially his reflection on the servile will. Firstly I present Ricœur’s philosophy of will (in the context of phenomenology of the voluntary and involuntary) and the concept of fallibility. Then I demonstrate the main aspects of Ricœurian rethinking and enlarging of Husserl’s phenomenology what leads to hermeneutic formula: the symbol gives rise to thought. Eventually, I argue that Ricœur’s hermeneutic phenomenology creates a specified anthropological view and understanding of the human condition. This understanding will later become a part of the ‘hermeneutics of the self.’<br>

Abstract: This paper emerges out of an ethnographic study conducted at the University of Cape Town that explored the dynamics of an intervention providing a ‘safe space’ for university staff to engage in alternative ways with South Africa's apartheid past, the university's institutional culture and with each other. This paper focuses on the social politics that arose between the intervention, its participants and imagined non-participants in relation to the university's ‘transformation’ vision. The interventionist intention was reworked by participants at a ground level into key symbols by which participants shaped the patterns of their behaviours and gave meaning to their experiences. Utilising Ortner's (1973) model for recognising and using key symbols, I argue that ‘transformation’ and ‘safe space’ are
         elaboratingsymbols in that they have conceptual and action elaborating power. These elaborating symbols operate in relay with a kind of logic that ‘crystallises commitment’ from participants to the intervention in an emotionally powerful and relatively undifferentiated manner. In so doing, they render the intervention a ‘summarising’ symbol capable of expressing what their experience means to them as an imagined community in relation to others.<br>

Article Title: Lurianic Kabbalah and Its Literary Form: Myth, Fiction, History<br>
Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: pft.2009.29.issue-3<br>
Date: October 2009<br>
Author(s): Magid Shaul<br>
Abstract: The academic study of Kabbalah has largely been limited to myth and symbol as the two viable forms of kabbalistic discourse. In this essay, I resist those limitations and explore two other possible literary forms: history and fiction. I do not mean history in any positivistic sense but closer to Steven Greenblatt's description of new historicism as cultural poetics. This suggests that literature not only reflects a historical setting but also creates that setting, constructing reality in its own image and directing it toward its desired ends. In looking at Lurianic Kabbalah as fiction, I raise the issue of the “real” and the “true” as it relates to fictive narratives more generally. This essay does not claim that the kabbalists in question did or did not intend to write cultural poetics or fiction. Rather, I use cultural poetics and fiction as possible lenses through which a nontraditional interested reader (i.e., one not invested in the literature as authoritative) can read these texts in a way that can speak to the contemporary world in which we live and think.<br>

Article Title: Poetry Is Theft<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: I am proposing the cannibalistic logic of poetic displacement as an alternative to the concept of “uncreative writing” that has begun to gain currency among North American poets and scholars. Kenneth Goldsmith has argued, along with Marjorie Perloff, Craig Dworkin, and Brian Reed, that a key tendency in late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century poetry is that of “information management.” This tendency is characterized by the “rhetoric of the Internet search result,” which Dworkin glosses as “a collage of unpredictably discontinuous and truncated quotations, with certain words repeated and emphasized.”
      
            More than a period style, argues Reed, it is a “period ethos,” and he identifies as twenty-first-century “appropriation poetries” those that redirect language (somewhat like an Aikido master re-channels energy). Reed writes, “Today's poet … stands outside in a data-storm, and she clings to the few language scraps she is able to rescue as they blow by.”21
         
            He likens this composition process to the strumming of a harp in Herman Melville's declaration in22
         Battle-Pieces: “I seem, in most of these verses, to have but placed a harp in a window, and noted the contrasted airs which wayward winds have played upon the strings.”
            This lovely comparison aims at an anti-subjective origin for poetry, but ends up reifying the guiding consciousness of the person who thought to place a harp (that consummate lyric symbol) in a window, or to stand outside in a storm.23<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: This phonetic–semantic relationship purports to transcend language's failure to mean. As such it might claim to transcend (in a way we might see as Utopian in a Thomist or Blochian sense) the inherent problems of the material human condition. For Joyce this eventually represents a transformation of death (which is the ultimate loss of meaning) into life (or at least into the infinite and immortal memory that literature encompasses). The
         phonicturns thefinisinto thephoenix; yet for Joyce this symbol of resurrection and redemption is not unproblematic in itself (or in the tension between the Utopian ambition and the real history that it holds in suspension): It is “Fiendish” and “sphinxish”—it is a “foenix”—a plagiarist, a parasite, a parrot.
               It is “parody's bird” rather than any Utopian bird of paradise.122
            
               As Herring has suggested, this is a text that witnesses “language at war with itself.”123
