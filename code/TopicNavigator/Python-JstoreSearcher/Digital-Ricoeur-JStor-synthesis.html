  Paolo Sarpi and the Renaissance Tradition from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pp5kk">A Usable Past</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the most extraordinary and yet obscure currents in the intellectual history of the Renaissance was the interest of Christian thinkers in the Jewish cabala. This concern extended from Pico’s attempt to absorb cabala into a Christian synthesis of universal knowledge at the end of the fifteenth century well into the seventeenth, and included writers and scholars from every major European country. Yet, in spite of the wide distribution of cabalistic interest in both time and space, the problem of explaining the movement, in the sense of relating it to the general concerns of its historical setting, has not<br>

  Abstract: The tradition of mystical allegorical commentary on Homer has survived in substantial form only in the writings of the Neoplatonists, but evidence from the first two and a half centuries of the Christian era—before the great synthesis of Plotinus, which marks the beginning of Neoplatonism proper—indicates that this period was a crucial one in the development of that tradition. Félix Buffière’s insistence on the second century as the time of the birth of mystical allegory needs qualification, as the discussion of the role of the Pythagoreans has suggested, but this does not alter the fact that Numenius and<br>

  Abstract: Twice in recent chapters, I have invoked Richard Lanham’s definition of catachresis as a wrenching of metaphor or an extravagant use of it, in any case, as a violent (mis)use of language. Qualifying Lanham’s definition, I have also observed the appreciation of traditional rhetoric for the necessity, and not merely the extravagance, of catachresis in the absence of any other suitable words. Lanham’s definition is a cogent synthesis abstracted from classical and Renaissance sources, and I have annotated it as such, along with reference to Patricia Parker’s provocative analysis of definitions of metaphor and catachresis from classical times to the<br>

  Abstract: The reader will have gathered, from the epigraphs that head this study, that its orientation is mainly European and phenomenological. The study derives, however, from American and traditional sources as well, and is therefore, in another sense, a work of synthesis. Each point deserves to be amplified, and the best way to do this, it seems to me, is to take them up one at a time. I have accordingly divided the preliminary section of the book into two parts: a methodological introduction, which clarifies phenomenological assumptions and procedures, and this foreword, which will attempt to explain the background of<br>

  Abstract: For some economists, institutional theories offer an attractive alternative, or perhaps better put, attractive supplements, to conservative approaches based on the work of free-market theorists such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, as well as liberal theories based on the work of John Maynard Keynes, which taken together form the central doctrines of what has been called the “neoclassical synthesis.”¹ According to one noted conservative economist, neoclassical economic theory is based on several fundamental assumptions, including the following: “1. People have rational preferences among outcomes. 2. Individuals maximize utility and firms maximize profits. 3. People act independently on the basis<br>

  Abstract: We need, and our society needs, to create a vision of our human future and to actualize that vision in practice. I believe that just such a vision can emerge from a synthesis of feminist, philosophical, and spiritual resources. While the project of constituting such a vision is implicit in the work of writers and activists in a variety of fields, I hope in this paper to make a contribution by making the project of synthesis explicit and discussing some of its theoretical and concrete ramifications.

It would be unfair, of course, to ascribe to Murray and Hermstein all the noxious views of their sources. Mere association with dubious thinkers does not discredit the book by itself. But even a superficial examination of the primary sources suggests that some of Murray and Hermstein’s substantive arguments rely on questionable data and hotly contested scholarship, produced by academics whose ideological biases are pronounced.

Sahlins has proved a more difficult (and diffdent) subject for celebratory synthesis than many of his peers.

  Abstract: In the next three chapters, we carry through in a practical way Christian responsible witness as social ethics in political, economic, and environmental practice. In the last chapter, we focused on responsible witness to the other, the church, and the world. In each case, there is a dialectical movement between synthesis and diastasis, between the homogeneity and heterogeneity of church and world. As demonstrated earlier, the church as the “inner circle” is a witness to the “outer circle” of the civil community demonstrating how it, as secular witness, can affirm social ethical practice that is free and open-ended as it<br>

  Abstract: Our argument thus far has relied on Dupré’s observation that the ontotheological synthesis of the West consists of three elements: the noetic subject as the interpreter of reality; the extra-subjective cosmos; and the transcendent source of both. Dupré affirms that modernity results from mind’s assertion of its creative prerogatives over against a more passive assimilation of the physical world on whose forms mind, in other respects, depends. In meeting the modern problem with a model of nature and grace, chapter 4 argued that Thomas’s instinct of faith, as retrieved by Seckler, accounts for the dynamic release of the human subject’s<br>

  Book Title: The Rhizomatic West-Representing the American West in a Transnational, Global, Media Age<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): Tatum Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Using Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's concept of the rhizome, Neil Campbell shows how the West (or west-ness) continually breaks away from a mainstream notion of American "rootedness" and renews and transforms itself in various cultural forms. A region long traversed by various transient peoples (from tribes and conquerors to immigrants, traders, and trappers), the West reflects a mythic quest for settlement, permanence, and synthesis-even notions of a national or global identity-at odds with its rootless history, culture, and nature. Crossing the concept of "roots" with "routes," this book shows how notions of the West-in representations ranging from literature and film to photography, music, and architectural theory-give expression to ideas about identity, nationhood, and belonging in a world increasingly defined by movement across time and borders.
      The Rhizomatic Westoffers a new vision of the American West as a hybrid, performative space, a staging place for myriad intersecting and constantly changing identities.<br>

  Abstract: The Anastenaria is concerned with healing in the broadest sense. It is both a religious ritual and a form of psychotherapy. Any attempt to understand the Anastenaria as a system of religious healing must therefore integrate approaches from medical anthropology with those from the anthropological study of religion. It must bring together the concerns of transcultural psychiatry and those of symbolic anthropology. Such a synthesis, which constitutes an interpretive or hermeneutic approach to the study of ritual therapy, provides the theoretical framework for this study of the Anastenaria.<br>

  Book Title: The Intimate. Polity and the Catholic Church-Laws about Life, Death and the Family in So-called Catholic Countries<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): PÉREZ-AGOTE ALFONSO<br>
  Abstract: The waning influence of the Catholic church in the ethical and political debate. For centuries the Catholic Church was able to impose her ethical rules in matters related to the intimate, that is, questions concerning life (from its beginning until its end) and the family, in the so-called Catholic countries in Western Europe. When the polity started to introduce legislation that was in opposition to the Catholic ethic, the ecclesiastical authorities and part of the population reacted. The media reported massive manifestations in France against same-sex marriages and in Spain against the de-penalization of abortion. In Italy the Episcopal conference entered the political field in opposition to the relaxation of several restrictive legal rules concerning medically assisted procreation and exhorted the voters to abstain from voting so that the referendum did not obtain the necessary quorum. In Portugal, to the contrary, the Church made a “pact" with the prime minister so that the law on same-sex marriages did not include the possibility of adoption. And in Belgium the Episcopal conference limited its actions to clearly expressing with religious, legal, and anthropological arguments its opposition to such laws, which all other Episcopal conferences did also. In this book, the authors analyse the full spectrum of the issue, including the emergence of such laws; the political discussions; the standpoints defended in the media by professionals, ethicists, and politicians; the votes in the parliaments; the political interventions of the Episcopal conferences; and the attitude of professionals. As a result the reader understands what was at stake and the differences in actions of the various Episcopal conferences. The authors also analyse the pro and con evaluations among the civil population of such actions by the Church. Finally, in a comparative synthesis, they discuss the public positions taken by Pope Francis to evaluate if a change in Church policy might be possible i~<br>

Although this part of the theory is foundational for the part that follows in chapter 2, there are works by Bartok for which these fundamental concepts are the only ones that an analysis using the theory can successfully employ.

  Author(s): ALMÉN BYRON<br>
  Abstract: Byron Almén proposes an original synthesis of approaches to musical narrative from literary criticism, semiotics, historiography, musicology, and music theory, resulting in a significant critical reorientation of the field. This volume includes an extensive survey of traditional approaches to musical narrative illustrated by a wide variety of musical examples that highlight the range and applicability of the theoretical apparatus. Almén provides a careful delineation of the essential elements and preconditions of musical narrative organization, an eclectic analytical model applicable to a wide range of musical styles and repertoires, a classification scheme of narrative types and subtypes reflecting conceptually distinct narrative strategies, a wide array of interpretive categories, and a sensitivity to the dependence of narrative interpretation on the cultural milieu of the work, its various audiences, and the analyst.
      A Theory of Musical Narrativeprovides both an excellent introduction to an increasingly important conceptual domain and a complex reassessment of its possibilities and characteristics.<br>

As one of the few process theologians working from within the Catholic tradition, Bracken has produced an unparalleled synthesis of the Catholic tradition and modern process metaphysics. In doing so, he is a living exemplar of how historically the best Catholic philosophers and theologians have seriously engaged the intellectual currents of their day. Bracken is important for Catholics thinkers because he makes a well-informed case that process metaphysics must not be rashly dismissed but seriously considered as a necessary rethinking of metaphysics in our day.<br>

  Book Title: The Uncertain Sciences-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mazlish Bruce<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging book one of the most esteemed cultural historians of our time turns his attention to major questions about human experience and the attempts to understand it "scientifically." Bruce Mazlish considers the achievements, failings, and possibilities of the human sciences-a domain that he broadly defines to include the social sciences, literature, psychology, and hermeneutic studies. In a rich and original synthesis built upon the work of earlier philosophers and historians, Mazlish constructs a new view of the nature and meaning of the human sciences.Starting with the remote human past and moving through the Age of Discovery to the present day, the author discusses what sort of knowledge the human sciences claim to offer. He looks closely at the positivistic aspirations of the human sciences, which are modeled after the natural sciences, and at their interpretive tendencies. In an analysis of scientific method and scientific community, he explores the roles they can or should assume in the human sciences. Mazlish's approach is genuinely interdisciplinary, and he draws on an array of topics, from civil society to globalization to the interactions of humans and machines, to inform his thought-provoking discussion of historical consciousness.<br>

  Book Title: Passage to Modernity-An Essay on the Hermeneutics of Nature and Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dupré Louis<br>
  Abstract: Did modernity begin with the Renaissance and end with post-modernity? In this book a distinguished scholar challenges both these assumptions. Louis Dupré discusses the roots, development, and impact of modern thought, tracing the fundamental principles of modernity to the late fourteenth century and affirming that modernity is still an influential force in contemporary culture.The combination of late medieval theology and early Italian humanism shattered the traditional synthesis that had united cosmic, human, and transcendent components in a comprehensive idea of nature. Early Italian humanism transformed the traditional worldview by its unprecedented emphasis on human creativity. The person emerged as the sole source of meaning while nature was reduced to an object and transcendence withdrew into a "supernatural" realm. Dupré analyzes this fragmentation as well as the writings of those who reacted against it-philosophers like Cusanus and Bruno, humanists like Ficino and Erasmus, theologians like Baius and Jansenius, mystics like Ignatius Loyola and Francis de Sales, and theosophists like Weigel and Boehme.Baroque culture briefly reunited the human, cosmic, and transcendent components, but since that time the disintegrating forces have increased in strength. Despite post-modern criticism, the principles of early modernity continue to dominate the climate of our time.
      Passage to Modernityis not so much a critique as a search for the philosophical meaning of the epochal change achieved by those principles.<br>

It disappears and reappears periodically, based always on the placing together of the unity of the senses, self-consciousness, intuition, empathy, and creative imagination — in<br>

  Abstract: Sato Naokata was one of the most orthodox advocates of Zhu Xi’s neo-Confucian philosophy in the early eighteenth century. Born in southwestern Japan, he studied neo-Confucianism with Yamazaki Ansai* in Kyoto, at a time when the latter was still a fervent exponent of orthodox Zhu Xi learning. When Ansai later developed his synthesis of Shinto and neo-Confucianism, Naokata broke with him. Indeed, Naokata emerged thereafter as one of the harshest and most sarcastic critics of Shinto and its chauvinistic hyperbole about the superiority of Japan vis-à-vis all other countries.

  Book Title: The Sense of the Universe-Philosophical Explication of Theological Commitment in Modern Cosmology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Nesteruk Alexei V.<br>
  Abstract: The Sense of the Universe deals with existential and phenomenological reflection upon modern cosmology with the aim to reveal hidden theological commitments in cosmology related to the mystery of human existence. The book proposes a new approach to the dialogue between science and theology based in a thorough philosophical analysis of acting forms of subjectivity involved in the study of the world and in religious experience. The uniqueness of this book is that it uses recent advances in phenomenological philosophy and philosophical theology in order to accentuate the existential meaning of cosmology as the discourse that ultimately explicates the human condition. The objective of the book is not to make a comparative analysis of the cosmological scientific narrative and that of the Bible, or the Fathers of the Church (in what concerns the structure of the universe), but to reveal the presence of a hidden theological dimension in cosmology originating in the God-given ability of humanity to discern and disclose the sense of creation. The book contributes to the synthesis of appropriation and incorporation of modern philosophical ideas in Christian theology, in particular its Eastern Orthodox form.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter we analyze the general epistemological conditions for knowability and explicability of the universe as a whole. Both knowability and explicability imply an anthropological dimension in cosmology, for both these requirements have human origin: to speculate about the universe one must experience its presence through the instantaneous synthesis associated with conscious life. It is argued that the cosmological principle acts as reduction of this synthesis to a mental spatial uniformity of the universe. However, the contingent facticity of the cosmological principle leads to the necessity of its explication in terms of generative steps required to grasp the sense<br>

  Book Title: Origins and Ends of the Mind-Philosophical Essays on Psychoanalysis<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Brassier Ray<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis claims that the individual human mind is structured by its childhood relationships with its parents. But the theory of attachment, evolutionary psychology and contemporary philosophy of mind have all recently re-introduced new dimensions of innateness into mental development and pathology. If attachment is an instinct, then what is the psychological status of the child's relation to the mother? If the mind is in part a product of evolution, then how far down do the inhibitory mechanisms of the mind go? If the mind of the child is shaped by their encounter with a set of prohibitions, how, in the light of contemporary 'cognitive science' and philosophy of mind, can the child be conceived as 'taking on' a rule? How is the construction of the mind related to the normative ends of cognitive experience? Today, it is Lacanian psychoanalysis which most vigorously defends psychoanalytic theory and practice from the encroachment of the biological and 'cognitive' sciences. But a paradigm shift nevertheless appears to be underway, in which the classical psychoanalytic theories about the Oedipus complex, primary and secondary repression, sexual difference and psychosexuality, the role of symbols,etc, are being dismantled and reintegrated into a new synthesis of biological and psychological theories. In this collection of theoretical essays by philosophers and psychoanalysts, encounters are brought about between Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis on the one hand, and attachment theory, evolutionary psychology and philosophy of mind on the other.<br>

  Abstract: Since the colonial era, Mexican art has emerged from an ongoing process of negotiation between the local and the global, which frequently involves invention, synthesis, and transformation of diverse discursive and artistic traditions. In this pathfinding book, María Fernández uses the concept of cosmopolitanism to explore this important aspect of Mexican art, in which visual culture and power relations unite the local and the global, the national and the international, the universal and the particular. She argues that in Mexico, as in other colonized regions, colonization constructed power dynamics and forms of violence that persisted in the independent nation-state. Accordingly, Fernández presents not only the visual qualities of objects, but also the discourses, ideas, desires, and practices that are fundamental to the very existence of visual objects.<br>

The synthesis of the arts in the service of social and cultural regeneration was a particularly German dream, which made Wagner and Nietzsche the other center of aesthetic modernism alongside Baudelaire and Mallarmé.<br>

  Book Title: Promises of 1968-Crisis, Illusion and Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): TISMANEANU VLADIMIR<br>
  Abstract: This book is a state of the art reassessment of the significance and consequences of the events associated with the year 1968 in Europe and in North America. Since 1998, there hasn’t been any collective, comparative and interdisciplinary effort to discuss 1968 in the light of both contemporary headways of scholarship and new evidence on this historical period. A significant departure from earlier approaches lies in the fact that the manuscript is constructed in unitary fashion, as it goes beyond the East–West divide, trying to identify the common features of the sixties. The latter are analyzed as simultaneously global and local developments. The main problems addressed by the contributors of this volume are: the sixties as a generational clash; the redefinition of the political as a consequence of the ideological challenges posed to the status-quo by the sixty-eighters; the role of Utopia and the de-radicalization of intellectuals; the challenges to imperialism (Soviet/American); the cultural revolution of the sixties; the crisis of ‘really existing socialism’ and the failure of “socialism with a human face”; the gradual departure from the Yalta-system; the development of a culture of human rights and the project of a global civil society; the situation of 1968 within the general evolution of European history (esp. the relationship of 1968 with 1989). In contrast to existing books, the book provides a fundamental and unique synthesis of approaches on 1968: first, it contains critical (vs. nostalgic) re-evaluations of the events from the part of significant sixty-eighters; second, it includes historical analyses based on new archival research; third, it gathers important theoretical re-assessments of the intellectual history of the 1968; and fourth, it bridges 1968 with its aftermath and its pre-history, thus avoiding an over-contextualization of the topics in question.<br>

Abstract: As I read Durantis article, I found myself wondering whether paradigm was the best term to use for these trends in the intellectual history of linguistic anthropology. Certainly it serves the purpose of getting the conversation started, but it is also interesting to consider how the use of other terms might enable us to think differently about the same trends. How would it change our understanding (if at all) if Duranti had used the term school instead? Alternatively, what would it do to the article if the three paradigms were instead labeled thesis, antithesis, and synthesis? While any of these labels would stimulate debate in interesting ways, I am partial to thinking about them in terms of Raymond Williamss dominant, residual, and emergent forms of culture. If we used these terms, we could situate our analysis of the cultural and intellectual history of our subdiscipline in the context of theories of social change more broadly. It would also then be clear why elements of Durantis three different paradigms can often be present at the same historical moment.<br>

Abstract: No one exposed this alienation of the thing by the concept that precedes and reconstitutes it into an object better than Hegel. In naming a thing, man substitutes for its immediate being and its qualities of sensible representation “a
         name, asoundmade by [his] voice, something entirely different from what [the thing] is in intuition”; but this name that is not the immediacy of the thing, this name into which the thing “withdraws,” becomes “something spiritual, something altogether different.” Thus nature transforms itself into “a realm of names,” because “the external object itself was negated in that very synthesis.”16The object appears henceforth as such—as alienated being, which has lost its being in order to receive it from theI: “the object is not what it is … the thingis notwhat itis.”17Thus, “man speaks to the thing ashis. And this is thebeingof the object.”18The being of the object only consists in receiving its being from man, who alienates it in so very far as he names it. Put another way, “by means of the name … the object has been born out of the I [and has emerged] asbeing. This is the primal creativity exercised by Spirit. Adam gave a name to all things.”19Hegel obviously alludes to the Biblical episode in which God gives to man power over the animals by giving him the right to name them: “[He] brought them to the man to see what he would call them” (Gen. 2:19). Adam gives a name, and thus a definition to the animals, which thus become subject to him, because in general all knowledge by concept reduces what is known to the rank of object. Adam thus names in the manner by which theIknows—by concepts of objects. However, Adam has the power thus to name only that which can legitimately become for him an object: the animals (and the rest of the world), and perhaps the angels, but not God, and not himself. If, moreover, he claimed to name them, either this name would have no validity, or, if it had validity, what he named would not be man as such (~<br>

Abstract: What some may think was the rhetoric of a young Turk trying to make his mark, or simply a critique growing out of U.S. historiography’s long antitheoretical tradition, I believe can instead be explained in three complementary ways. First, Bailyn was not alone in finding fault with the lack of integration in Braudel’s tripartite structure. In a 1957
         JMHarticle, “French Scholarship in Modern European History: New Developments since 1945,” Edward R. Tannenbaum characterized the debate as one between conventional and innovative history: “[Braudel’sLa Méditerranée] has stimulated an international controversy between conventional historians and those who want history to include the techniques of other disciplines in an all‐embracing synthesis.”34Hans Kellner, writing inHistory and Theory(1979), summarized the early criticism ofLa Méditerranéeas posing the question, “Was the work an enormous heap of diverse materials or a truly revolutionary step in historical methodology?”35<br>

Abstract: Conformity with fact is thus irrelevant to the status of a message as information. The definition offered here is a synthesis of several current information theories. I have attempted to steer between a kind of universal cybernetics, in which everything is information, and a theory based too narrowly on the concept of digitization and the technology of the computer. For an example of the latter concept of information, see Michael Dertouzos,
            What Will Be: How the New World of Information Will Change Our Lives(New York, 1997). I have adhered most closely to the working definition of Hobart and Schiffman,Information Ages,who stress the capacity for transmission and storage as the defining properties of information. For the historical vicissitudes of the concept of fact, see Mary Poovey,A History of the Modern Fact: Problems of Knowledge in the Sciences of Wealth and Society(Chicago, 1998). The notion of information is closer to what Poovey means by the “modern fact” than to the ordinary language sense.<br>

Author(s): Robbins,  Jeffrey W.<br>
Abstract: The question then becomes: to what extent does the pattern of ontotheology permit such distinctions? For Marion, not at all, since the God of ontotheology is stigmatized as a philosopher’s God to be overcome in the search for a truly theological thought of God. When Robbins claims that Marion provides a model of philosophical theology to the extent that “[he] accepts the bounds established by the ontotheological condition” (p. 101), there is either a massive misreading of Marion or what is meant by ontotheology remains imprecise. Some clarity might be achieved by sticking to Heidegger, who offers the classic conceptualization of ontotheology. For Heidegger, ontotheology is the answer to the question “How does God enter philosophy?” As such, it would not allow conversation between philosophy and theology because the God it thinks, even theologically, is already the God of philosophy. In Robbins’s work, by contrast, ontotheology stands for a “synthesis” (p. 11), a “dialogue” (p. 14), or a “mixed discourse” (p. 15) of philosophy and theology that best resists the corrosive fragmentation and dangerous purification of thought and culture. I cannot help but feel that in the transition from overcoming ontotheology to accepting it, what is being saved or maintained is not what was being overcome.<br>

Abstract: We saw above how configuration is the work of the productive imagination [
         14]. This imagination is not only rule governed; Ricoeur argues that it “constitutes the generative matrix of rules” [14, p. 68]. The imagination synthesizes in a narrative way that connects understanding and intuition such that it is possible to speak of “a schematism of the narrative function” [14, p. 68]. This schematism in turn is constituted within a tradition, where tradition is understood as an interplay of innovation and sedimentation; that is, there is a history of interpretation in conflict with “interpretation now” [38]. Beyond this, Ricoeur argues that tradition in turn is referenced to paradigms encompassing form, genre, and type and that paradigms constitute the “grammar that governs composition of new works” [14, p. 69]. This narrative tradition enriches the labor of imagination in the operation of configuration. A library, when defined as a synthesis of narratives, both embodies and signifies acts of imagination. Such acts can operate at different levels; for example, they are inherent to the levels of the hierarchy of activity we see above. They are inherent in personal acts and in cultural acts. The library is an enabler of new meanings and active participant in the creation of “worlds in front of the text.” Given the above, new work could take these ideas much further in LIS and well beyond the framework that is currently offered [3].<br>

Abstract: At the end of this beautifully crafted series of identifications, Maurice “contemplates Christ’s martyrdom in His image and his own martyrdom in Christ’s.”
      108If the shroud is the visible reminder of an internal shroud that lies dormant within us, the image of the angelic witness Maurice contemplating his own biography in the shroud is a powerful synthesis of this process of self‐enlightenment. In the shroud Maurice recognizes the sense of his martyrdom in the light of the Word’s biography. The image of the shroud is the emblem of our human experience. By visiting the cathedral of Turin, we become “witnesses” of a divine “sympathetic” mirroring between the shroud and its angelic martyr. To meditate on the shroud means to let the reflection between the shroud and the relics of Maurice be reflected on our inner “mirror,” the intellect.109<br>

Abstract: However, being a practical theologian, he considers empirical description—“descriptive theology,” as he calls it—without normative reflection worthless: this is the fifth characteristic.
         5In short: practical theology arises from interaction between empiricism and normativeness.6For this interaction, Browning coined the term “practical‐theological ethics.”7For Browning the normative choices made in practical theology are crucial. He and I share an admiration for the synthesis made by Paul Ricoeur, who ingeniously combined three moral traditions: teleology, deontology, and situational ethics. In this synthesis, deontology (especially Immanuel Kant) functions as a filter for teleology (especially Aristotle), whereupon this teleology is applied with wisdom in people’s concrete, contingent, and unique situations to direct their actions.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Abstract: It would take further work to describe how such an inclusive and narrative human creative capability might realize itself in substantive moral norms.
         37Clearly, they would not involve history’s coming to completion or its being left behind in an ahistorical or ineffable transcendence. Clearly also, no single individual could fully imagine what such a perfect narrative creativity would actually look like, involving as it does the working through of the creative tensions of actual human difference, even if each can and must participate. The aim would consist in no Hegelian synthesis of historical forces either, for what is to be realized is a dynamic capability for making meaning amid rather than beyond historical plurality. The aim is nothing less than the imitation within our own diverse, complex, and finite moral worlds of a dynamic, narrative, and radically inclusive Creator.<br>

Author(s): Wall,  John<br>
Abstract: Moral Creativityis also a book about Paul Ricoeur. Throughout, Wall turns to Ricoeur’s philosophical and religious thought for theoretical support, using a wide range of primary and secondary literature. Wall works from a Ricoeurian idea that the self is a synthesis of activity and passivity, freedom and finitude. He finds in this ontology of selfhood a basis for conceiving of creativity as the activity of inventing free action amid the limitations of finitude. This anthropology is then tied to Ricoeur’s work on narrative identity, love, ideology, and other topics. Wall’s exegesis of Ricoeur is accurate and astute, succinctly connecting the thinker’s early and late writings on selfhood. The book faults Ricoeur for having an insufficient sense for the entrenchment of social/cultural injustice and for the radical otherness of other people. The discussion of Ricoeur and Emmanuel Levinas on otherness is one of the most interesting parts of the book but also an argument that might need expansion. Wall laments Ricoeur’s decision to separate philosophy from religious discourse, claiming this was a purely pragmatic decision whereby “Ricoeur ultimately does himself a disservice” (181). This may be so, but regardless of intent, wouldn’t we have to say that such a separation is part of the thought world projected by Ricoeur’s writings? Patching over this separation may bring Ricoeur closer to writers of the current “theological turn” of postmodernism but possibly at the price of losing one of Ricoeur’s great virtues—his usefulness in mediating between postmodernism and the modernity that insists on dividing religion and reason.<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Each of Smith’s works is an elaboration on climactic moments in the Bible story. The main characters in the Book of Mormon are refugees from Palestine immediately prior to the Babylonian assault who ensure the continuation of Israel’s covenant by taking it to the Western hemisphere. Escaping foreign captivity and domestic colonization by successive imperial reigns and creating a parallel story to the Jewish diaspora and Christian synthesis, the Book of Mormon peoples received the resurrected Christ and the fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham. This same promise is the centerpiece of Smith’s Book of Abraham and becomes the occasion to provide an alternative account of human origins in creation, as well as of Israel’s origins in the Abrahamic covenant. Most aggressively, in the first six chapters of JST Genesis, Smith wrests the entire Christian narrative from its traditional moorings, giving it a new beginning and eliding differences between old and new covenants. Among the more audacious changes is the addition of a precreation event into the Genesis narrative and a new “Genesis 1” that ascribes a specific purpose to creation. These changes suggest another metaphor for understanding Smith’s “translations.”<br>

Abstract: The initial purpose of this article is to develop a foundation for understanding the philosophical problem of truth in librarianship and, in so doing, locate the concept of truth closer to the core of philosophical debates within library and information science. This is followed by a synthesis of the concepts of truth currently found in the literature. After reviewing the three prevailing theories of truth applied to the field of librarianship, we introduce a new theory of truth in librarianship grounded in historicism. We argue that this theory offers a new approach to understanding how the objective practices of librarianship only can be adequately explained by considering their place within a contextualized process of historical development. Before examining theoretical considerations of truth, an elaboration of the possible ways in which philosophy contributes to social scientific inquiry in librarianship would be instructive.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: Marcel’s bodily interiors are translucid to the dreamer who, having divested himself of intelligence and volition, sails the feelings of “fright, sadness, remorse” that unconscious memory “injects in his blood stream.” The “mirror” that, at the instant when involuntary memory showed him the prostrated body of his grandmother, revealed to him the estrangement of his own soul from hers, is displaced by a new mirrorlike effect, that is, the oneiric “reflection” of the “painful synthesis” showing him that his grandmother’s annihilation is organismically grafted upon his own survival. Reborn, thanks to this dream, to the old self of his cohesion with his grandmother, to the old self of their two souls’ mutual fusion, Marcel is now conscious of carrying within his own soul “the diminished life” of his resurrected grandmother, “as pale as a memory.”

Abstract: The central scene in Dupré's tableau depicts the emergence of the human mind as the sole “source of meaning and value.” As with Blumenberg, Gauchet, and Taylor, the autonomy of the self is here presented as a response to theological problems originating in the medieval period. Once God had been enshrined as absolute in the “classical-Christian synthesis” of nominalist theology, transcendence posed as much of a threat as an assurance. The omnipotence of divine will, Dupré observes, “abrogated the link of intelligibility that connected the source of reality with its created effect,” so that “God no longer provided rational justification of the world.” In the aftermath of this rupture, “meaning” would now have to be “imposed by the human mind,” a task that in turn required Descartes, Locke, Kant, and their contemporaries to develop “a new sense of selfhood” (Dupré, xi-6, 19–46, quotes on xi, 2–3, 45).<br>

Abstract: This analytic framework can be adapted to elucidate the biblical notion of blood-guilt, which is depicted in numerous passages as a source of pollution (e.g., Numbers 35:33–34; Deuteronomy 21:1–9). The biblical corpus gives abundant expression to the view that the spilling of innocent blood results in a stain that would provoke a divine punishment on the entire community unless proper action was taken against the murderer. While some sources depict a personified conception in which the blood of the victim remains in a state of distress as long as the perpetrator goes unpunished (Genesis 4:11; Job 16:18),
         
               most sources depict retribution as an automatic mechanical process in which references to “blood” (86
            damim) denote an invisible taint which threatens to invite punishment until the blood-debt is paid of.

Abstract: The essays in
         Eric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmodernsare uniformly excellent in their exploration of “foundations without foundationalism”; however, like most volumes of collected essays, it only offers suggestions of a synthesis between Voegelin and postmodernism. Both have different interpretations of classical philosophy and transcendence; both are critics of the metaphysical certainty of the Enlightenment project; and both fail to offer a theory of institutionalized politics. Interestingly, at the end of the volume, the editors propose Camus as a possible synthesis to understand Voegelin and other postmodern thinkers. They fail to develop this theme, however, which is all the more puzzling, since both editors have written on Camus (“Reconstructing the World: Albert Camus and the Symbolization of Experience,”JOP61:2 [1999]); or, it may be that they plan a sequel that will expand on their suggested synthesis.<br>

Abstract: There are two ways of reading Goffman--as a theorist of trust and ritual accommodation, that is, as a theorist of the interaction order, or as a theorist of deception. I suggest a way of making these two readings compatible, by arguing that Goffman was interested in what I call the “production of credibility.” Credibility is the quality of being believable, and this quality is integral to both trust and deception. Viewed in this way, Goffman explored the ways in which people make their actions convincing to other people. Although Goffman's analysis of the interaction order did not need a theory of the self, his work actually contains two quite different theories of the self: one linked to role analysis, one to his analysis of mental illness. I argue for the latter at the expense of the former. I conclude that Goffman both initiated substantive work about the interaction order and contributed to a synthesis of a theory of the interaction order and a theory of the self.<br>

Author(s): Hahm Chaibong<br>
Abstract: This paper reflects on the implications of postmodern political discourse for East-Asian politics. It argues that the postmodernist deconstruction of modern epistemology and politics provides an opportunity for the reappraisal and rehabilitation of Confucianism in East Asia. First, the paper begins with an account of Cartesian epistemology which undergirds the liberal conceptions of selfhood and politics. Second, it provides a brief history of the Neo-Confucian synthesis and the resulting epistemology based on an intersubjective and ethical understanding of being human. Third, it gives an account of how East Asian thinkers have until recently tried to overcome Confucianism as a way of achieving modernity. Fourth, it attempts to show how the Heideggerian deconstruction of Cartesian epistemology reveals the intersubjective and ethical nature of Dasein which allows for a reevaluation of Confucianism. Fifth, this paper describes earlier attempts by East Asians to go beyond modernity and the way they have led to detrimental consequences. It concludes that the current debate should proceed with a more careful and balanced consideration of both modernity and Confucianism.<br>

Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
Issue: i308701<br>

Author(s): Dittmer Lowell<br>
Abstract: The concept of political culture embraces some of the most basic, perennially fascinating concerns in behavioral political science; because of certain ambiguities in its theoretical formulation, however, there has been a tendency for the term to grow fuzzy with continued use. Its connection with related concepts, such as political psychology, political structure, and political language, has remained unclear, with the result that political culture has been difficult to isolate as an independent variable. Thus it has come to occupy a position on the periphery of politics, and is usually presumed to reinforce the status quo. This paper re-examines previous formulations of the concept and proposes a theoretical synthesis. The analytical framework is derived from semiological theory, a branch of science specifically designed for the analysis of meanings. The central variable is the political symbol. By analyzing the interactions of political symbols within a comprehensive semiological framework, the traditional concerns of political culture can be accommodated in a more precise and systematic way.<br>

Author(s): Schielke Samuli<br>
Abstract: In late 19th century, Islamic saints-day festivals ("mawlids") became the subject of strong criticism. A festive tradition that until then had been central to the religious and communal life of Egypt was now increasingly criticised for being backward and un-Islamic. "Mawlids", popular festivals that combine the atmosphere of a fair with the ecstatic spirituality of Sufism, were not only problematic for the new models of nation and religion, criticising them was also functional for the demarcation of these. Constructs of this type are characteristic for the project of modernity that is defined through binary distinctions, with labels such as 'backwardness' and 'un-Islamic innovations' serving as distinctive markers of modernity and authenticity. This development was not a consequent continuation of an earlier Islamic tradition, nor was it a simple takeover of European colonial concepts and disciplining practices. It was the product of a creative and selective synthesis of the two, producing novel interpretations of both Islam and modernity that, in the course of the 20th century, have managed to gain a hegemonic position in much of the Middle East. This emergence of Islamic reformism and modernism from a synthesis with colonial discourses compels us to rethink a currently popular endeavour in Islamic studies: the study of Islam as a discursive tradition.<br>

Abstract: Existential phenomenology is the synthesis of existential philosophy and Husserl's phenomenological method. This paper discusses how this perspective is related to the phenomenological school of sociology and more broadly to the main sociological tradition of subjective realism. The complementarity of existential phenomenology and sociology opens up the possibility of a future general theory of social existence.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: The „petite éthique“ which Ricœur develops in Soi-même comme un autre is distinctive in its way of paying attention to the individual, the other and the society all at the same time. For this very reason the problem of the distribution of social goods is fundamental. Ricœur tries to solve this problem through a synthesis of teleological and deontological considerations, and here the approach of Rawls occupies a central place. On the one hand, the attempt to solve this problem in the framework of a teleological approach draws on principles of justice which Rawls establishes through formal procedure; on the other hand, Rawls‘ position depends on a number of teleological presuppositions which are not compatible with his deontological approach. Ricœur does not only attempt to refute Rawls, but to interpret his principles of justice as the result of a rationalisation of a sense of justice which is simply presupposed.<br>

Author(s): GUTIÉRREZ RAFAEL ROJAS<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the relationship between poetics and politics in Martí's work. By way of an archeology of the political images in his poetry (Ismaelillo, Versos sencillos, Versos libres) and, conversely, of the poetic representations that abound in his prose and oratory, the author argues for a tension between the two textual dimensions that is never quite resolved or diluted within a discursive or historical synthesis. And yet, the authorial schism is not exactly a fault to be "corrected" by critical reading, but rather the very axis of a martinian hermeneutics. Este ensayo explora las relaciones entre poética y política dentro de la escritura de José Martí. A través de una arqueología de las imágenes políticas que aparecen en su poesía (Ismaelillo, Versos sencillos y Versos libres) y, a la inversa, de las representaciones poéticas que abundan en la oratoria y la prosa de Martí, el autor sostiene que esos dos mundos del texto viven siempre en tensión, sin que ambas identidades textuales puedan diluirse en una síntesis discursiva o histórica. Sin embargo, la escisión de la autoría no es, aquí, una falla que el crítico debe "corregir", sino el eje de una hermenéutica del sujeto martiano.<br>

Author(s): Benjamin Roy<br>
Abstract: In this paper, I examine the influence of the Gospel of John on Joyce's aesthetic. My basic claim is that the gospel aided Joyce in charting a middle course between materialism (body without spirit) and spiritualism (spirit without body). After examining the temptations of flying too high (symbolism, mysticism, gnosticism) and flying too low (historicism, realism, materialism), I show how Joyce made use of the Johannine strategies of epiphany and realized eschatology to achieve a synthesis between these extremes. The essay is much indebted to two students of John—Rudolph Bultmann and Franz Mussner—who examined John's peculiar synthesis of fact and allegory. In addition, the scholar Jacques Aubert was indispensable for his analysis of a similar trajectory in Joyce's aesthetic.<br>

Author(s): Marder Michael<br>
Abstract: The goal of "Phenomenology of Distraction" is to explore the imbrication of attention and distraction within existential spatiality and temporality. First, I juxtapose the Heideggerian dispersion of concern (which includes, among other things, the attentive comportment) in everyday life, conceived as a way to get distracted from one's impending mortality, to Fernando Pessoa's embracing of the inauthentic, superficial, and restless existence, where attention necessarily reverts into distraction. Second, I consider the philosophical confessions of St. Augustine and Jean-Jacques Rousseau as evidence for the proto-phenomenological temporal synthesis that hinges upon distraction and dispersion, despite the confessors' best efforts to pay attention to their inner life and to concentrate it in the eternal present. The paper concludes with an assessment of the ethical effects of mutual distraction, outlining a model of "distracted intersubjectivity."<br>

Abstract: I take distance here from the language used by K.-O. Apel. Apel speaks of a 'transcenden-
tal-hermeneutical synthesis' which would be proper to the pre-theoretical constitution of
the Lebenstaeli (Heidegger, Wittgenstein) and which would found the kantian synthesis of
apperception. See Apel, Transformation der Philosophie, vol. 1, pp. 246, 308.1 reject however
the notion of pre-theoretical 'synthesis' and prefer the notion of 'systasis', i.e., the oneness
(één-zijri) of man and world, subject and object, in pre-scientific experience. Transcendental
hermeneutical reflection can for the rest not be called pre-scientific, because and insofar as
it is explicitly engaged in tracing man's transcendental openness.<br>

Abstract: In this connection the emergence of the Self Psychology of Heinz Kohut et al. in which the
self as structure and process is the center of the therapeutic context as a correction to
traditional psychoanalytic preoccupation with id and ego is significant. See Heinz Kohut, The
Restoration of Self (New York: International Universities Press, 1977). And Daniel Stern has
published The Interpersonal World of the Infant (New York: Basic Books, 1985) in which sense of
self is the central theme of a theory which seeks a new synthesis beyond psychoanalysis and
developmental psychology.<br>

Abstract: Precisely this transformation of the concrete I into a theoretical I was the reason for philo-
sophers like Kant and Husserl to distinguish, next to the empirical I, a transcendental I. These
thinkers do not consider the 'theorization' of the I as a shortcoming; rather, it expresses some-
thing very essential: the transcendental I (ego) becomes the condition for knowing. The fact
that I (empirical subject) can think thoughts (object) is possible only on the presupposition of
a transcendental I as the necessary condition for the synthesis of the subjective and the
objective moment in (self-)knowledge. This transcendental ego has a purely formal status, no
empirical content at all.<br>

Abstract: Les rapports entre islam et psychologie en Égypte sont ici étudiés sur le terrain, dans une association de conseil et de formation psychologique cairote dont les responsables revendiquent une expertise reposant sur un processus d'institutionnalisation de la psychologie plus que centenaire. Une seconde ressource normative invoquée au sein de l'association est la religion. En réponse à l'indétermination qui peut résulter de ces efforts de synthèse, les aspirations au statut de classe moyenne constituent le troisième élément à prendre en compte pour comprendre la façon dont ce discours psychologique évolue. Il est alors possible de s'interroger sur les influences extérieures s'exerçant sur la discipline, notamment à travers les objectifs thérapeutiques qui lui sont assignés. This article seeks to explore the links between Islam and psychology in Egypt, focusing on the example of a Cairo-based association proposing counseling and teaching. Its leaders claim an expertise based on a more-than-a-century-old process of psychological institutionalization. Religion is a second normative resource used by the association. To resolve the qualms resulting from these efforts to produce a synthesis between the two, a third element has to be taken into account: the life aspirations linked to the middle class status. Eventually, this case study provides an insight on the external influences that shape the discipline, notably in the light of the assigned therapeutic goals. Las relaciones entre islam y psicología en Egipto son aquí estudiadas en el campo, en una asociación de consejo y de formación psicológica cairota cuyos responsables reivindican una expertise que reposa en un proceso de institucionalización de la psicología más que centenario.

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>

Author(s): Carr Steven G.<br>
Abstract: If, as many historians and theorists now believe, narrative is the form proper to historical explanation, this raises the problem of the terms in which such narratives are to be evaluated. Without a clear account of evaluation, the status of historical knowledge (both in itself and in all those social, political, and other contexts in which appeal to historical explanation is made) remains obscure. Beginning with the view, found in Hayden White and others, that historical narrative constitutes a meaning not reducible to the factual content it engages, this essay argues that such meaning can arise only through a synthesis of cognitive and normative discourses. Narrative combines "heterogeneous" language games in such a way that neither appeal to "truth content" nor to "justice" suffices to decide the question of which of two competing historical explanations is, as a whole, superior. Examining in critical detail the opposed positions on this issue articulated by two recent theorists-Frank Ankersmit ("narrative idealism") and David Carr ("narrative realism")-the paper concludes that the debate between those who hold that historical narratives should be judged in essentially cognitive terms and those who hold that they should be judged in essentially political terms cannot be resolved and that a philosophical view of historical narrative that is neither realist nor idealist needs to be developed.<br>

Abstract: Many Natural Law theorists thought that God could not rightly violate or alter
principles of justice, but argued instead that there must be independent moral grounds to
which even God would have to appeal for justification. Hugo Grotius expressed an early
form of the idea in 1625, in the Prolegomena to his De lure Belli ac Pads. Other Natural
Law theorists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, who expounded variations of
the doctrine, include Samuel von Pufendorf (De lure Nature et Gentium Librii Octo,
1672), Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui (Principes du droit naturel, 1747), and Emerich de
Vattel (Le Droit des Gens, 1758). See A.P. d'Entrèves, Natural Law (London, 1951),
ch. 3; cf. Voltaire, 'Remerciement sincère à un homme charitable', in Vol. V of
Montesquieu's De l'Esprit des lois (Paris, 1816 [1750]), pp. 257-62. See also John

Abstract: Network analysis is one of the most promising currents in sociological research, and yet it has never been subjected to a theoretically informed assessment and critique. This article outlines the theoretical presuppositions of network analysis. It also distinguishes between three different (implicit) models in the network literature of the interrelations of social structure, culture, and human agency. It concludes that only a strategy for historical explanation that synthesizes social structural and cultural analysis can adequately explain the formation, reproduction, and transformation of networks themselves. The article sketches the broad contours of such a theoretical synthesis in the conclusion.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i345794<br>
Date: 12 1, 1909<br>
Author(s): James Kevin<br>
Abstract: This essay argues that in Henry James's The Ambassadors (1903) Mrs. Newsome, who appears to be merely a representative of everything un-Jamesian, particularly a lack of moral and aesthetic imagination, should not be so quickly dismissed. Post-structuralist critics do not hesitate to denounce her. They typically identify Mrs. Newsome's "book" of expectations for Strether, her emissary, and for Chad, her successor, with the closed book of logocentric tyranny; both are said to rely on unambiguous reference and to enforce the cold rationality of linear causation. Derridean readers of The Ambassadors unmistakably prefer Madame de Vionnet's Paris, embodying as it apparently does their own essentially skeptical doctrines about representation. James, however, plays a more subtle game of balance and synthesis, suggesting that while Newsome's book is firm against new impressions, expecting experience to submit utterly to preconceived plans and moralistic evaluations, it also successfully asserts against Parisian representational openness and mystery the viability of reasonable explanation. Her book is vindicated insofar as it stands for the persistent relevance of linear causality and for the nonabsolute grounding of speculation in the concrete world of events and consequences. Newsome's extreme rationalism is in fact denied full authority early in the novel, whose true subject is located when extreme skepticism seems to dominate and explanation seems irrelevant. During the course of the story, time's subtle order slowly reemerges, and James the realist steps forward from behind the post-structuralist veil.<br>

Author(s): Nagel Marco<br>
Abstract: The coherence of the "Dialogues" can be vindicated in opposition to the widespread view-notably espoused by Jean Starobinski-that their ethical position overturns the Rousseauian synthesis elaborated in earlier systematic works. Rousseau's "Dialogues" amount to a transcendental problem which accepts the self it portrays as given: an account is needed of how this self arises by arguments that move from stated facts to points of principle offered in Rousseau's philosophy. Only then can we recover agency concealed by the rhetorically infelicitous objective, third-person optic Rousseau adopts to present and defend his self.<br>

Abstract: O enigma do mal, o escândalo do mal em todas as suasformas, não cessa de inquietar a consciência humana, revelando-se hoje como obstáculo principal à crença em Deus e assunindo proporções tais que as teodiceias do passado, por vezes heróicas, deixaram mesmo de ser possíveis. O presente artigo não as pretende justiflcar, nem sequer desculpar Deus. O seu ponto de partida está antes na consciência de que não se pode separar o mal e os maus, a maldade e o sofrimento, o qual é muitas vezes o reverso do crime. Para o autor, a síntese e o nó górdio da questão do mal está na infelicidade (malheurj no sentido que lhe dá Simone Weil (ódio, opróbrio e sofrimento indissoluvelmente ligados) e a figura do Servo Sofredor. O mal puro, o "mal radical", constitui um desafio à metafísica, desafio este que ela deve ter a coragem de aliviar, de questionar sem cessar, mesmo sabendo que não há solução para o problema do mal, pois que quanto mais lidamos com ele tanto mais se nos obscurece e transforma em mistério. /// The riddle of evil, the scandal of evil in all its forms, does not stop disturbing the human conscience, revealing itself today as the main obstacle to the belief in God and assuming such proportions that even the theodicies of the past, sometimes heroic, stopped being possible. This article does not wish to justify them nor even excuse God. Its starting point is rather in the conscience that evil and the evil ones, wickedness and suffering cannot be separated, which is many times the reverse of crime. According to the author, the synthesis and the Gordian knot concerning evil is in the unhappiness (malheur) according to Simone Weil's sense (hate, opprobrium and suffering indissolubly connected) and the Suffering Servant figure. Pure evil, or "radical evil", is a challenge to metaphysics, challenge that metaphysics should have the courage to mitigate, question unceasingly, even knowing that there is not a solution for the problem of evil as the more we deal with it, the more~<br>

Abstract: Segment contestataire de la biomédecine moderne, le mouvement des soins palliatifs constitue actuellement un « paradigme global » de prise en charge du mourir, de la mort et du deuil, proposant simultanément une approche holistique du malade, un modèle d'organisation des soins, une éthique alternative et un projet politique dont l'ensemble fusionne en une synthèse inédite. Aussi, l'impact grandissant des soins palliatifs en France mérite que l'on retrace l'historique de leur institutionnalisation et que l'on mette au jour les fondements idéologiques (clinique, humaniste, herméneutique et chrétien) de leur doctrine. Ainsi définis, les soins palliatifs incarnent-ils à nos yeux un mouvement paradoxal de médicalisation du mourir contemporain. Contestant segment of the modem biomedical world, the palliative care movement represents a « Paradigm » of care of the dying, death and mourning, proposing simultaneously holistic approach of patient, work organisation, alternative ethics and political project which blend into an original synthesis. Thus, the growing impact of palliative care in France leads us to retrace the history of their institutionalisation and to analyse the ideological basements (clinical, humanistic, hermeneutic and Christian) of their doctrine. So defined, the palliative care movement embodies a paradoxical movement of medicalization of contemporary dying.<br>

Abstract: Husserl war wie die meisten Logiker seiner Zeit vor allem am apophantischen Sprachgebrauch, an der logischen Problematik des Urteils, interessiert : mehr als seine Vorgänger und Zeitgenossen jedoch hat er sich auch eingehend mit der Problematik des nicht-apophantischen Sprachgebrauchs, im besonderen mit Logik und Genealogie der Frage beschäftigt. Im ersten Teil dieses Beitrags wird ein Uebersicht über die Positionen seiner Zeitgenossen und Vorgänger in diesem Bereich gegeben : implizit oder explizit hat Husserl gegen diese Auffassungen, in der Weise einer mittelalterlichen „quaestio”, polemisiert. Im zweiten Teil wird Husserls frühe Theorie (Logische Untersuchungen), im dritten Teil seine spätere Theorie (Ideen, Analyses zur passiven Synthesis und „Erfahrung und Urteil”) analysiert. Die erste Theorie gibt eine reinlogische Analyse des Frageverhaltens, wobei ihre sprachliche und kommunikative Bedeutung auf den Hintergrund bleibt. Die späteren Darlegungen befassen psychologische Betrachtungen über die Genese von Fragen im Bewustsein und über ihre Bedeutung im Erkenntnisprozess. Im letzten Teil wird versucht sowohl der primären phänomenale Gegebenheit von Fragen u. dgl. als Sprechakt Rechnung zu tragen, wie auch den Elementen einer „erotetischen Logik”, die in der Denkwelt Husserl und seiner Vorgänger und Zeitgenossen nicht oder nur ungenügend figurieren. Eine vollständige Phänomenologie des Fragens umfasst nicht nur logisch- und psychologischphänomenologische Betrachtungen, sondern auch „pragmatische” : ihre sprachliche und kommunikative Aspekte sind nicht von neben sächlicher, sondern von essentieller Bedeutung. Will man vollständig verstehen was Fragen „bedeutet”, so muss man sich jedoch dem Problem des Fragenden und In-Frage-gestelten Menschen zuwenden. Das wird, am Leitfaden der Phänomenologie von Heidegger und Levinas, von Sartre und Merleau-Ponty, aber auch von Gadamer, Jaspers und anderen zeitgenössischen Autoren, in einen Beitrag auseinandergesetzt welche im A~<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'interroge sur le statut à la fois épistémologique et ontologique d'un passé qui « a été » et dont les individus comme les sociétés retiennent le souvenir, mais qui, comme le langage ordinaire l'exprime, « n'est plus » . Toute une tradition de réflexion sur la conservation du passé par la mémoire depuis Platon et Aristote a voulu ramener la mémoire à la métaphore de l'empreinte. En revanche, cet article tente de montrer que la mémoire à plusieurs dont dépend la connaissance historique n'est pas simplement assimilable à ce topos traditionnel. Ce qui caractérise la mémoire plurielle et publique qui alimente le travail de l'historien, c'est le statut privilégié du témoignage, la possibilité de confronter différents témoignages les uns aux autres, dont dépend la crédibilité du récit historique. C'est ainsi moins la problématique d'une ressemblance entre récit et événements racontés — problématique de la trace, héritée d'une tendance traditionnelle à identifier la mémoire avec l'empreinte — que la confrontation de témoignages dans leurs différents degrés de fiabilité qui nous fait assister à l'événement raconté. Cette réflexion sur le décalage entre mémoire et histoire ouvre, dans la deuxième partie de cet article, à une analyse approfondie de la temporalité propre au passé qui fait l'objet du souvenir et conduit à une confrontation avec privilège accordé, dans la synthèse des trois modes du temps, chez saint Augustin au présent et, chez Heidegger, au futur. De cette manière, l'article tente de rééquilibrer la synthèse des temps en lui restituant un autre rapport au passé, que l'on ne saurait atteindre à partir d'Augustin ou de Heidegger. Libérer l'histoire du paradigme de la trace, de la métaphore de la mémoire comme empreinte, revient précisément à la restitution de ce mode de temporalisation du passé jusqu'ici esquivé : cet autre rapport au passé vise, conjointement à la mise en évidence du témoignage propre au travail de l'historien, à souligner la dette~<br>

Author(s): Wiley Douglas<br>
Abstract: This article argues for a synthesis of George Herbert Mead's conception of the temporal and intersubjective nature of the self with Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory of narrative identity. Combining the insights of Ricoeur's philosophical analysis with Mead's social-psychological orientation provides a subtle, sophisticated, and potent explanation of self-identity. A narrative conception of identity implies that subjectivity is neither a philosophical illusion nor an impermeable substance. Rather, a narrative identity provides a subjective sense of self-continuity as it symbolically integrates the events of lived experience in the plot of the story a person tells about his or her life. The utility of this conception of identity is illustrated through a rereading of Erving Goffman's study of the experience of mental patients. This example underlines the social sources of the self-concept and the role of power and politics in the construction of narrative identities.<br>

Author(s): Adams Julia<br>
Abstract: How did cultural dynamics help bring about the societies we now recognize as modern? This article constructs seven distinct models for how structures of signification and social meaning participated in the transitions to modernity in the West and, in some of the models, across the globe. Our models address: (1) the spread, via imitation, of modern institutions around the world (memetic replication); (2) the construal, by socio-cultural forces and by state organizations, of the modern citizensubject (social subjectification); (3) the continual search for new meanings to replace traditional religious meaning-systems (compensatory reenchantment); (4) repeated attempts, in modern revolutions, to remake society completely, according to a Utopian vision (ideological totalization); (5) the cultural origins and social consequences of scientific and humanistic worldviews (epistemic rift); (6) the gendered politics of state formation (patriarchal supercession); (7) the invention and production of race in the colonial encounter (racial recognition). We explicate the models in reverse chronological order, because in our synthesis, we argue that the original modern break results from a dynamic combination of racial recognition, patriarchal supercession, and epistemic rift; these changes set the stage for the four other processes we theorize. In addition to our synthesis, we also consider, from a more neutral perspective, the kinds of causal arguments upon which these models tend to rely, and thus explicate the analytical undergirding for the application of any of these models to empirical research on transitions to modernity. Throughout the article, we consider how these models might, and might not, mesh with other families of explanation, such as the politico-economic.<br>

Abstract: La « petite éthique » que déploie Ricœur dans Soi-même comme un autre se distingue par le fait qu'elle rend justice à l'individu, à l'autre et à la communauté tout à la fois. C'est ainsi que le problème de la distribution des biens sociaux se révèle fondamental. Ricœur essaie de le résoudre à partir d'une synthèse de considérations téléologiques et déontologiques dans laquelle l'approche de Rawls occupe une position centrale. D'un côté, la tentative de résoudre le problème dans le cadre d'une approche téléologique appelle le recours aux principes de justice qu'établit Rawls à l'aide d'une procédure formelle, de l'autre, la position rawlsienne dépend d'un nombre de présuppositions téléologiques qui ne sont pas compatibles avec son approche déontologique. Ricœur ne poursuit pas simplement le but de réfuter Rawls, il propose plutôt d'interpréter ses principes de justice comme résultat d'une rationalisation d'un sens de justice préalable. The « minor ethics » which Ricœur develops in Soi-même comme un autre is distinctive in its way of applying justice to the individual, the other and the community all at the same time. For this reason the problem of distribution of social goods is fundamental. Ricœur attempts to resolve this problem through a synthesis of teleological and deontological considerations, and here the approach of Rawls occupies a central place. On one hand, the attempt to solve this problem in the framework of a teleological approach draws on principles of justice which Rawls establishes through formal procedure ; on the other hand, Rawls' position depends on a number of teleological presuppositions which are not compatible with his deontological approach. Ricœur does not only attempt to refute Rawls, but to interpret his principles of justice as the result of a rationalisation of a sense of justice which is simply presupposed.<br>

Abstract: Pour tous les jacobins, la souveraineté du peuple définit la citoyenneté. Le groupe girondin tient à son propos un discours minimaliste (la formation de l'opinion publique est la première étape de l'exercice de la souveraineté). Les cordeliers et les jacobins radicaux tiennent un discours maximaliste (le peuple fait la loi et juge la conformité de la loi avec le droit naturel). On note une inflexion marseillaise de ces discours. Les patriotes modérés y évoquent « la souveraineté relative et pour ainsi dire locale ». Les patriotes radicaux évoquent à partir du printemps 1793 une insurrection marseillaise prenant le relais de Paris comme moteur de la Révolution, et après le succès de cette insurrection, une organisation du pouvoir exécutif caractérisée par la multiplication des instances intermédiaires. Maignet, représentant en mission dans les Bouches-du-Rhône, tente une synthèse : le partage des fonctions (la Convention fait la loi, les départements s'occupent des problèmes locaux, les districts surveillent l'application des lois, les municipalités et les comités révolutionnaires s'occupent de tout ce qui est relatif aux personnes). For all Jacobins, citizenship was defined by the sovereignty of the people. The Girondin faction stuck to a minimalist discourse whereby the formation of public opinion is the first step in the exercise of sovereignty. The maximalist discourse of the Corde liers and the radical Jacobins held that the people make the law and judge the conformity between the law and natural right. One notes a marseillaise inflexion in this discourse. At Marseille, the moderate patriots evoked "the relative and local sovereignty, so to speak". From spring 1793 the radical patriots evoked a marseillaise insurrection taking its lead from Paris as motor of the Revolution and, after the success of the insurrection, and organization of the executive power characterized by the multiplication of intermediary governmental bodies.

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Abstract: This study considers Schumann's Kinderszenen (1838) from the point of view of the branch of literary criticism known as narratology. The author's aim is not to ascribe a specific narrative content to Schumann's cycle of thirteen brief pieces for piano, but rather to shed light on the inner nature of the work by identifying various ways in which Schumann adopts and adapts the techniques and strategies of narrative toward specifically musical ends. As the author observes, this approach is justified on at least two levels: first, by Schumann's passion for literature in general, and for the works of Jean Paul in particular; and second, by a variety of attributes of the work itself, the most obvious being the overall title as well as the specific titles given to its thirteen movements. Drawing on a broad spectrum of narratological writings - both in the areas of literary theory (Genette, Barthes, Ricceur) and musicology (Adorno, Newcomb) - the author proposes analogies between the various elements of literary narrative and their counterparts in Schumann's Kinderszenen. Specifically, the "narrator" of the cycle is identified with the composer himself, the overall structure of the work is construed as an "epic" as opposed to a "dramatic" one (owing to its articulation in thirteen diminutive episodes), and "diatonicism" and "chromaticism" are viewed as the cycle's principal "characters". For the author, the latter analogy is the decisive one. A substantial portion of the article is devoted to showing how the narrative design of the work as a whole arises from the interaction, alternation, and ultimate synthesis of these domains.<br>

Abstract: Dans la seconde moitié du XXe siècle, les principaux aspects de la définition et de la compréhension « aristotélicienne » de la métaphore ont été mis en question: théorie de la substitution, teleologie de l'univocité, subordination de la métaphore à la connaissance, et jusqu'à la centralité même conférée à la métaphore aux dépens d'autres figures (métonymie, synecdoque, catachrèse. .. ). Dans cet article, nous tentons de résumer et de discuter les points essentiels de cette contestation multiforme, en nous attachant particulièrement à la déconstruction derridienne de la métaphore « dans le texte philosophique » et à la synthèse, par Ricoeur, de la « nouvelle » théorie de la métaphore. In the second half of the twentieth century, the main aspects of the « aristotelian » definition and understanding of metaphor have been questioned : substitution-theory, teleology of univocity, subordination of metaphor to knowledge, and the very centrality attributed to metaphor at the expense of other tropes (metonymy, synecdoque, catachresis...). In this paper, we try to summarize and discuss various aspects of this dispute, paying special attention to Derrida's deconstruction of metaphor « in the philosophical text » and to Ricoeur's synthesis of the « new » theory of metaphor.<br>

Abstract: Les conceptions épistémologiques de Rousseau affectent ses perceptions et son discours sur la politique. L'accord de Rousseau avec la critique moderne des idées innées et son désaccord avec le monisme matérialiste dans la psychologie empirique ne rendent pas seulement compte de la manière (ou méthode) par laquelle Rousseau perçoit la politique, mais aussi du remplacement de l'idée classique de la raison pratique par les principes formels d'égalité et de liberté comme principes du jugement politique. La reconnaissance par Rousseau des limites du formalisme, comme étant le motif d'une pratique individuelle, explique son emploi d'artifices à la fois rhétoriques et poétiques, servant à donner une substance dynamique aux « formes » que son enseignement préconise. Sa vision politique devient ainsi une synthèse ingénieuse du formalisme mathématique et de l'aisthesis poétique. Rousseau's epistemological conceptions affect his perceptions and discourse on politics. Rousseau's agreement with the modern criticism of inate ideas and his disagreement with materialist monism in empirical psychology do not only account for the manner (or method) in which Rousseau perceives of politics, but also the replacement of the classical idea of practical reason by formal principles of equality and liberty as principles of political judgement. Rousseau's recognition of the limits of formalism as the grounds for individual practice explains his use of both rhetorical and poetic devices which give dynamic substance to the " forms " envisaged by his teaching. His political vision thus becomes an ingenious synthesis of mathematical formalism and poetical aisthesis.<br>

Abstract: The role of nonhumans in social life has recently generated significant scholarly interest. The two main paradigms for explaining the sociological significance of nonhumans are constructivism and actor-network theory. We propose a pragmatist synthesis inspired by George Herbert Mead, demonstrating how interactions with nonhumans help constitute the social self—that is, the identity one constructs by imaginatively looking upon oneself as others would. Drawing upon observations of humans interacting with objects, animals, and nature, we identify two complementary ways that nonhumans organize the social self and enable people to experience group membership in absentia: (1) by molding how one is perceived by others and constraining alternative presentations of self and (2) by acting as a totem that conjures up awareness of, and feelings of attachment to, a particular social group. This formulation moves beyond constructivist claims that nonhumans reflect people's self-definitions, and it offers a corrective to actor-network theory's neglect of sociality.<br>

Abstract: América Latina fue un laboratorio de debate y acción impulsado por varias corrientes del pensamiento desarrollista que resguardaron los anhelos de las burguesías nacionales que soñaban con la euforia de sus homólogas europeas. Este trabajo indaga en los albores del término desarrollo y discute los acercamientos más relevantes. Se rescatan las críticas que se instauraron como alternativas al pensamiento burgués y que expresaron alianzas más incluyentes que intentaron ser el background para una ruptura con el capitalismo. A su vez, la derrota de ambos proveaos implicó el caldo de cultivo para el pensamiento neoconservador y la reestructuración capitalista de los últimos años. La síntesis del debate actual de las alternativas lleva a reflexionar sobre una senda alternativa bajo una re-definición del imaginario del desarrollismo clásico. Latin America was a laboratory for debate and action driven by various currents of development thinking which protected the wishes of the national bourgeoisies who dreamed euphorically of their European peers. This work investigates the dawning of the term "development" and discusses the most relevant approaches. It rescues the critiques that were established as alternatives to bourgeois thinking and which expressed more inclusive alliances intended as the background for a rupture with capitalism. Meanwhile, the failure of both projects represented the culture medium for neoconservative thinking and for the capitalist restructuring of recent years. The synthesis of the present debate on alternatives leads to reflections on an alternative route using a redefinition of the imagined classic development. L'Amérique latine a été un laboratoire pour le débat et l'action impulsés par plusieurs courants de la pensée développementiste qui ont préservé les souhaits des bourgeoisies nationales qui rêvaient de l'euphorie de leurs homologues européennes.

Abstract: The claim of this essay is that those who study ritual should make fuller use than has been made so far of the literature in philosophy of art. The relevance of aesthetic theory to several questions currently being addressed in ritual studies will be shown, and a model based on what we call "ritual spaces" will serve as the basis for interpreting certain types of ritual. We apply our theory to the ancient Zoroastrian high liturgy, the Yasna. Implications of this interpretive model will also be explored; they include discussions on the following issues: the role of ritual language, the relationship of the various dimensions of ritual, and the basic functions of liturgical performance. The essay begins with analysis and concludes with synthesis.<br>

Abstract: Par sa notion de « lecture » et de « décréation », Simone Weil ébauche une philosophie critique en tant qu'analyse perceptive du réel que nos jugements font éclater, à tout instant, en une infinité de textes valorisés. Guidée par la méthode reflexive d'Alain et de Lagneau, elle dépasse la problématique phénoménologique des actes interprétatifs dans une herméneutique métaphysique. Le désir constitue alors le fondement de toute métaphorisation du réel à partir d'une conscience gestuelle où les signes, les symboles et les concepts préfigurent une transcendance absente, mais néanmoins réelle. Saisir, à la suite de Kant, cette contradiction en tout objet, c'est fonder la pratique perceptive sur le modèle christologique qui remplit par excellence la fonction d'une « métaphore réelle ». L'exigence proprement philosophique d'une telle synthèse permet de reconnaître une valeur originale à S. Weil dans le débat moderne autour de l'élaboration du signifié. Through her ideas of « lecture » and « décréation », Simone Weil sketches out a critical Philosophy as well as a perspective analysis of that which is real which our judgments, at every moment, split up into an endless number of valued texte. Guided by the reflexive method of Alain and of Lagneau, she goes beyond the phenomenological problematic of interpretative acts into a metaphysical hermeneutic. Desire then constitutes the foundation of every métaphorisation of the real starting with a consciousness in wich signs, symbols and concepts foreshadow an absent, but nevertheless real, transcendence. Taking hold of this contradiction in every object, following upon Kant, is to establish the perceptive practice on the christological model which fulfills belter than any other the function of a "real metaphor". The properly philosophical demand of such a synthesis allows us to recognize an original value in Simone Weil within the modern debate concerning the elaboration of that which is signified.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur se propose de vérifier l'affirmation de Lavelle selon laquelle l'ouvrage de 1937, De l'Acte, se serait progressivement développé comme une synthèse complète de sa philosophie. Or il existe, à l'état dactylographié, une version antérieure de ce livre, qui permet de comprendre combien l'aisance presque trop grande des analyses de 1937 cache en fait une élaboration lente et un effort continu. La version inédite insiste sur l'intemporalité transcendantale de l'acte, et sur l'impersonnalité de l'acte fondateur de toutes les existences personnelles. Ces thèses seront abandonnées en 1937. On analyse ensuite l'article « Être et Acte » et la conférence de la société française de philosophie sur « Acte créateur et acte réflexif », où est discutée la position de Jean Nabert. Les thèses de De l'Acte montrent une progression de l'identité de l'être et de l'acte (dans l'acte d'être) jusqu'à l'acte en sa forme la plus haute, l'acte d'amour. Situer cette œuvre capitale implique qu'on ait bien compris l'interprétation du sensible comme de la donnée matérielle qui doit être spiritualisée. L'expérience extérieure du sensible s'oppose à l'expérience intérieure de l'esprit. Et l'acte est l'œuvre de l'être spirituel. L'ontologie dynamique de Lavelle est une affirmation de la liberté humaine comme participation à l'acte créateur divin. Divin ou humain, l'être est subjectif parce que libre. Ainsi Lavelle s'inscrit dans la tradition platonicienne moderne, celle d'Avicenne d'abord, celle de Hegel ensuite. The author proposes to verify Lavelle's assertion that the 1937 work, De l'Acte, would be progressively developed as a complete synthesis of his philosophy. Now there exists in typewritten state an earlier version of this book, which allows us to see the extent to which the almost excessive facility of analyses of 1937 in fact conceals a slow development and a continuous effort. The unedited version insists upon the transcendental atemporality of act, and upon the impersonality of ~<br>

Abstract: This article focuses on the concepts of deliberative democracy and African palaver to conceptually (re) formulate and make intelligible the practices and performance of governance in Africa, with the aim of achieving a genuine normalization of societal behavior. Based on an analysis of the texts and a synthesis of texts analyzed, and drawing on the evidence at the present time, this is about establishing that the African palaver, often excluded from the cartography of official epistemology and relegated to the level of indigenous knowledge and practice, can define the conditions of possibility and feasibility for deliberative democracy, a political paradigm deemed dominant universal. However, the issue is that of cognitive decentering. How can one imagine that African conceptual categories, labeled as cheesy and reduced to the mere field of ethnological studies, can interact and correlate with modern recipes, with the idea of starting a process of governability, the realization of which is resilient democracy?<br>

Abstract: It is not new for poets to renovate the language of poetry by appropriating or sending up enervated, devalued language as a way to critique discourses of power. It may even be one of the oldest methods of literary innovation, considering the Roman appropriation of Greek literature. But some contemporary, experimental poets explicitly link mass production of capitalist consumer products and the logic of the copy
         
               to the production of art in a Benjaminian vein. De la Torre refers to the age of mechanical reproduction in an epigraph to “Photos While U Wait,” which she borrows from Jacques Barzun's introduction to Gustave Flaubert's110
            Dictionary of Accepted Ideas: “The cliché, as its name indicates, is the metal plate that reproduces the same image mechanically without end.”
               Poems written under constraint and composed of recombined, appropriated text at times thematize the activity of appropriation itself as endemic to capitalism. The supermarket is a popular trope for the destruction of authenticity, disenfranchisement, and advertising's interpellation of the subject. A discursive tone dotted with imperatives mark these poems, as they echo the language of consumerism. African American poet Harryette Mullen's111
            S*PeRM**K*T, included in herRecyclopedia, is structured according to the logic of supermarket aisles (“sort of like your shopping list”), and the missing letters in its title spell outu are, as in, “you are what you eat,” as Mullen explains in an author's note. “I was thinking about domestication, about the role of women, women as consumers, women having supposed power as consumers but also being disempowered in other ways…. You can't necessarily buy who you really want to be. You have to buy the available images,” she writes in an accompanying statement.
               Mullen, like Hayes, also connects her poetics to that of a woman poet predecessor. Her books112

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Hyperbole can offer a way of playing with meaning at the extreme boundaries of thought where no synthesis or middle ground is sought or desired. It is “an incredible, exaggerated utterance [that] interrupts the language and logic of the existing argument” by shifting “one level of meaning to another, re-invented meaning” (Stanivukovic
         2007, 20). The question for hyperbole is the one posed by Gerard Genette in his essay “Hyperboles”: “Does not this hyperbolic mode of thought (wit) have its reasons, which commonsense ignores and which reason wishes to know?” (Johnson2010, 4).What these statements indicate is that hyperbole is a complex trope in relation to language and thought and that it can offer epistemological insight through its interruption of logic and as a “hyperbolic mode of thought.”<br>

Article Title: “Time and History in Blake's<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.22.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: William Blake's poem
         Jerusalem(1804–20), like all Perennial utopias, achieves a dialectical synthesis of the ideal and the actual through the narrative focalization of a religious experience at the level of character, one that is at once transhistorical and universal. By reading the poem through the lens of the Perennial paradigm, we discover that the temporal aspects ofJerusalemare intimately tied to the religious dimensions of Blake's utopian vision. In addition to giving us a new way to understand the well-documented distinctiveness of Blake's religious message, the Perennial paradigm shows Blake's soteriology inJerusalemto be utopian rather than salvationist (that is to say, individual-religious as opposed to collective-political). Because of the ultimately subjective nature of apprehension of the Divine Vision, Blake's utopian thought is not “clearly a forward-directed anticipatory and visionary concept,” as Magnus Ankarsjö has recently argued (15). Blake does not rally the reader towards some “ensuing peaceful millennium” (15) but rather to find enlightenment in the eternal moment. In light of Blake's suspicion of ratiocination, combined with his deliberate use of narrative focalization of Albion's religious vision, readingJerusalemas a Rational utopia grounded in Judeo-Christian of notions of Apocalypse is to miss Blake's core religious message.<br>

Abstract: Louis Althusser once invoked “a new philosophy, one which was no longer an
         interpretation, but rather atransformationof the world.”
               Yet Joyce at times reminds us that texts are merely representational and interpretational—they are not literally or fundamentally transformative; they do not in the end build brave new worlds, try though they may. As Roland Barthes would suggest, dominant meanings are privileged in the generation of such connotative semantic structures as literatures and cultures: this process for the most part represents an act of ideological reinforcement, one contained within Orwell's hegemonic whale. At its most radical, therefore, literature may from this perspective advance a work of subversion or deconstruction rather than one of intentional revolutionary construction—the synthesis of a satirical Laputa rather than of a realizable Utopia.138<br>
