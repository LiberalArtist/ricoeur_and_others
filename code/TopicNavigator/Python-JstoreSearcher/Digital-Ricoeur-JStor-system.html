  Abstract: Social policies ineluctably invoke target populations—people who, in the case of Social Security, would contribute to and benefit from an insurance or investment system. Whether supporting or opposing a policy proposal, debate participants address various qualities of a target population. Policymakers may assert that future retirees harbor hopes and dreams for their retirement, while retirees may expect policies to help them realize their visions. Beyond aspirations, potential beneficiaries may exhibit stated and unstated needs. Workers certainly do not plan to suffer a serious on-the-job injury or premature death, but they may need to protect their families against a tragic<br>

  Abstract: The Oslo Accords could not have occurred without a transformed Palestinian symbol system. Palestinians involved in the Oslo talks recounted that the terms used in describing the Palestinians and the contested land were in dispute at Oslo. However, the Israelis came to accept the phrase “Palestinian people” and the words “West Bank” and “Gaza” rather than “Judea” and “Samaria” to describe a common reality. In turn, the Palestinians recognized the state of Israel. Indeed, demonstrating the importance of the symbol, the wording of the Oslo Accords and references to people and land were at the center of the negotiations.¹ The<br>

  Abstract: The conversations between Ogotemmêli, an elder of the Dogon in the Western Sudan, and the ethnographer, Marcel Griaule, took place over thirty-three successive days in October 1946. During that time, according to Griaule, Ogotemmêli ʺlaid bare the framework of a world system: … a cosmogony as rich as that of Hesiod, poet of a dead world, and a metaphysics that has the advantage of being expressed in a thousand rites and actions in the life of a multitude of living beingsʺ (1965: 3). That ʺsystemʺ—or the part of it presented to Griaule—sets up a vast web of correspondences<br>

  Book Title: Reason to Believe-Cultural Agency in Latin American Evangelicalism<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Smilde David<br>
  Abstract: Evangelical Protestantism has arguably become the fastest-growing religion in South America, if not the world. For converts, it emphasizes self-discipline and provides a network of communal support, which together have helped many overcome substance abuse, avoid crime and violence, and resolve relationship problems. But can people simply decide to believe in a religion because of the benefits it reportedly delivers? Based on extensive fieldwork among Pentecostal men in Caracas, Venezuela, this rich urban ethnography seeks an explanation for the explosion of Evangelical Protestantism, unraveling the cultural and personal dynamics of Evangelical conversion to show how and why these men make the choice to convert, and how they come to have faith in a new system of beliefs and practices.<br>

  Abstract: Central to the great upheavals marking the transition between the medieval and the modern world were profound disagreements about the nature of order, whether in the social and political realm, in the church, in the cosmos, or in the exalted spheres of metaphysics. High medieval culture, broadly speaking, had tended toward a unified and hierarchical conception of order which assigned to all men, experiences, places, things, and ideas their appropriate positions in a vast, graded system of values. Conversely the attack on medieval civilization at its deepest level, operating simultaneously in both the material and ideal realms, was directed at<br>

  Abstract: Immediately after Anwar Sadat’s accession to power in November 1970, the seemingly united front of Nasserism began to collapse. In less than a decade the authoritarian populism and socialist dogmatism of the previous era were replaced by a political system of authoritarian pluralism. Expanded and bureaucratically perfected by President Husni Mubarak since 1981, this new political system has had a paradoxical quality: For the liberalization of the political and cultural arenas and the diversification and privatization of the media and the economy did not undermine authoritarianism but only strengthened it.

I show how debates surrounding the establishment of an educational system and educational language policy in colonial Mauritius became a privileged site for contesting hegemonic claims in the form of negotiating the relationships of different groups in a colonial plantation setting. Conflicting approaches to language in education also informed debates about the role and significance of Indo-Mauritians in ascribing an identity to Mauritius with its lack of a precolonial population.At the<br>

  Abstract: Nietzsche is fundamentally concerned with the circuitous and deceptive character of our relations to things, and with the transcendence of actuality to our representations of it at the level of the signifier. But to a semiotician, the distinction between linguistic activity and extralinguistic reality is naive, and so I turn to Umberto Eco’s more doggedly semiotic approach to this distinction in
                  A Theory of Semiotics. Eco divides semiotics into two parts: the theory of codes or signification and the theory of sign-production or language use.Codedesignates the system of rules that “generate signs as concrete occurrences in communicative intercourse.”¹<br>

  Abstract: Even as contemporary conditions precipitated a flood of peoples from the Spanish-speaking islands of the Caribbean to the American mainland, a stream of English-speaking immigrants from the West Indies—a parallel diasporic movement—flowed to both Great Britain and the United States. These Hispanic and Commonwealth migratory streams are linked by the legacies of colonial history or what the historian Gordon Lewis (1983) describes as an “agrosocial system of slavery developed in its fullest and most harsh form” (2).

He finds ample material for the devotional sentiment of love in the biblical Song of Songs. He writes no fewer than eighty-six sermons on the first chapters of this short book of Hebrew wisdom literature, which consists of a series of poetic exchanges between two lovers.

  Book Title: Structures of Appearing: Allegory and the Work of Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Machosky Brenda<br>
  Abstract: Taking a phenomenological approach to allegory, Structures of Appearing seeks to revise the history of aesthetics, identifying it as an ideology that has long subjugated art to philosophical criteria of judgment. Rather than being a mere signifying device, allegory is the structure by which something appears that cannot otherwise appear. It thus supports the appearance and necessary experience of philosophical ideas that are otherwise impossible to present or represent. Allegory is as central to philosophy as it is to literature. Following suggestions by Walter Benjamin, Machosky argues that allegory itself must appear allegorically and thus cannot be forced into a logos-centric metaphysical system. She builds on the work of Maurice Blanchot and Emmanuel Levinas to argue that the allegorical image is not a likeness to anything, not a subjective reflection, but an absolute otherness that becomes accessible by virtue of its unique structure. Allegory thus makes possible not merely the textual work of literature but the work that literature is. Machosky develops this insight in readings of Prudentius, Dante, Spenser, Hegel, Goethe, and Kafka.<br>

  Abstract: Confucianism, as the dominant philosophical/cultural system of East Asia that has evolved over two millennia, is multidimensional and multilayered. Consequently, its interpretations diverge depending on which elements get emphasized and how they are arranged. Most, if not all, of such interpretations may contain some truth, but no one interpretation may capture the whole monolithic and unchangeable “Truth” of Confucianism. Confucianism is a

  Abstract: In this chapter, I situate Timothy Morton’s and Slavoj Žižek’s “ecology without nature” (hereafter EWN) within the broader history of transcendental-structuralist ontology.¹ I will argue that, notwithstanding Morton’s recent turn to object-oriented ontology, his deconstruction of a certain notion of nature, which we provisionally describe as the extra-lingual intelligible order, does not deviate from the a-cosmic trajectory of late modern thinking, from nineteenth-century transcendental philosophy, through hermeneutics and semiotics to Lacanian psychoanalysis. Even if something like nature in fact existed, the argument goes, we would have little to say about it, locked as we are into a self-referential meaning system,<br>

  Abstract: That a particular outfit or a more general style of clothing should make a ‘‘statement’’ is a familiar enough idea in the twenty-first century. It assumes that clothing, like language, participates in a system of signs, and that plain clothing, such as chinos or blue jeans, can be every bit as much a statement as can a dark suit, a pink dress, or a tuxedo. But when we take clothing to be making a ‘‘statement,’’ rhetorically we are using a metaphor, or possibly a metonymy, or both.

  Abstract: For Vladimir Jankélévitch, forgiveness presents a moral dilemma. The oscillation between the unfortunate and the wicked and the oscillation between love and evil imply a dilemma that Jankélévitch maintains is insoluble. This dilemma contains within it the tension between justice and forgiveness and forces a decision within morality itself, for forgiveness and love, according to Jankélévitch, introduce an asymmetry that is at odds with the symmetry implicit in ethics and in law. This moral dilemma consequently appears as the conflict between two moralities, or, as Jankélévitch says, as the paradox of morality itself: on the one hand, the system of<br>

Instantly recognizable to general global audiences, yet flexible enough to serve both as a legitimate monster and as the punch line to a bad joke, the figure of the mindless undead has clearly found resonance in late capitalist culture and has been connected to a wide range of concepts and ideas.

The exposure to this situation offers an opening for thinking from beyond the instrumental rationalism of contemporary modernity, from radical exteriority. Latin America is a concrete living and articulate reality that, as the underside of modernity, displaces the Western North American and European claims to a hegemonic, selfsufficient, and autonomous power and causes a fecund opening for understanding anew philosophical thought.

  Abstract: Hegel is without a doubt one of the most misunderstood thinkers in Western intellectual history, a history he claimed to sum up and bring to its maturity. This misunderstanding has several roots. One is the intrinsic difficulty of grasping Hegel’s thought. It is dense, technical, dialectical, and arranged in such a way that, to understand anything in it, one has to understanding its linkage with the whole system of thought. This means that one could easily take any given statement out of context and find in it a meaning that on the surface sounds preposterous.<br>

  Book Title: Keeping the Feast-Metaphors of Sacrifice in 1 Corinthians and Philippians<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Patterson Jane Lancaster<br>
  Abstract: Patterson uses cognitive metaphor theory to trace the apostle Paul's use of metaphors from the Jewish sacrificial system in his moral counsels to the Philippians and the Corinthians. In these letters, Paul moves from the known (the practice of sacrifice) to the unknown (how to live in accord with the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ). Patterson illustrates that the significant sacrificial metaphors in 1 Corinthians and Philippians are not derived from Jewish sacrifices of atonement, but rather from the Passover and sacrifices of thanksgiving. Attention to these metaphors demonstrates that imagery drawn from these sacrifices shapes the overall moral counsel of the letters, reveals more varied and nuanced interpretations of sacrificial references in Paul's letters, and sheds light on Paul's continuity with Jewish cultic practice.<br>

  Author(s): Reybrouck Mark<br>
  Abstract: Transdisciplinary and intermedial analysis of the experience of music Nowadays musical semiotics no longer ignores the fundamental challenges raised by cognitive sciences, ethology, or linguistics. Creation, action and experience play an increasing role in how we understand music, a sounding structure impinging upon our body, our mind, and the world we live in. Not discarding music as a closed system, an integral experience of music demands a transdisciplinary dialogue with other domains as well. Music, Analysis, Experience brings together contributions by semioticians, performers, and scholars from cognitive sciences, philosophy, and cultural studies, and deals with these fundamental questionings. Transdisciplinary and intermedial approaches to music meet musicologically oriented contributions to classical music, pop music, South American song, opera, narratology, and philosophy.<br>

  Book Title: Religion Without Redemption-Social Contradictions and Awakened Dreams in Latin America<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Löwy Michael<br>
  Abstract: The world’s eyes are on Latin America as a place of radical political inspiration and as an alternative to the neoliberal model. Each country in the region deals differently in its method of government, yet there are common cultural themes that tie the continent’s trajectory together. Religion without Redemption looks at the sociology of religion, political philosophy and the history of ideas of the continent, in an attempt to show how Western understanding fails to come close to a correct analysis of how and why political and economic characteristics work as they do. Luis Martínez Andrade focuses on how the centrality of religion for the people of Latin America has influenced how they interact with the changes in the modern economic system. Capitalism, for example, has taken on religious characteristics: it has sacred places of worship (the shopping mall) as well as its own prophets. Martínez Andrade discusses how this form of ‘cultural religion’ accompanies many aspects of life in a contradictory manner: not only does it fulfil the role of legitimating oppression, it also can be a powerful source of rebellion, unveiling thus a subversive side to the status quo. Religion Without Redemption advances the ideas of liberation theory into the 21st century, and challenges the provincialism to which many Latin American thinkers are usually consigned.<br>

Anthropologists have always – at least since Boas and Malinowski – wished to call attention to the ways in which the economy is an integrated part of a social and cultural totality, and to reveal that economic systems and actions can only be fully understood if we look into their interrelationships with other aspects of culture and society.

  Book Title: Border Watch-Cultures of Immigration, Detention and Control<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Mitchell Jon P.<br>
  Abstract: Questions over immigration and asylum face almost all Western countries. Should only economically useful immigrants be allowed? What should be done with unwanted or 'illegal' immigrants? In this bold and original intervention, Alexandra Hall shows that immigration detention centres offer a window onto society's broader attitudes towards immigrants. Despite periodic media scandals, remarkably little has been written about the everyday workings of the grassroots immigration system, or about the people charged with enacting immigration policy at local levels. Detention, particularly, is a hidden side of border politics, despite its growing international importance as a tool of control and security. This book fills the gap admirably, analysing the everyday encounters between officers and immigrants in detention to explore broad social trends and theoretical concerns. This highly topical book provides rare insights into the treatment of the 'other' and will be essential for policy makers and students studying anthropology and sociology.<br>

  Book Title: Cities of Affluence and Anger-A Literary Geography of Modern Englishness<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): KALLINEY PETER J.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a compact literary history of the twentieth century in England, Cities of Affluence and Anger studies the problematic terms of national identity during England's transition from an imperial power to its integration in the global cultural marketplace. While the countryside had been the dominant symbol of Englishness throughout the previous century, modern literature began to turn more and more to the city to redraw the boundaries of a contemporary cultural polity. The urban class system, paradoxically, still functioned as a marker of wealth, status, and hierarchy throughout this long period of self-examination, but it also became a way to project a common culture and mitigate other forms of difference. Local class politics were transformed in such a way that enabled the English to reframe a highly provisional national unity in the context of imperial disintegration, postcolonial immigration, and, later, globalization.Kalliney plots the decline of the country-house novel through an analysis of Forster's Howards End and Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, each ruthless in its sabotage of the trope of bucolic harmony. The traditionally pastoral focus of English fiction gives way to a high-modernist urban narrative, exemplified by Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, and, later, to realists such as Osborne and Sillitoe, through whose work Kalliney explores postwar urban expansion and the cultural politics of the welfare state. Offering fresh new readings of Lessing's The Golden Notebook and Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, the author considers the postwar appropriation of domesticity, the emergence of postcolonial literature, and the renovation of travel narratives in the context of globalization. Kalliney suggests that it is largely one city--London--through which national identity has been reframed. How and why this transition came about is a process that Cities of Affluence and Anger depicts with exceptional insight and originality.<br>

  Abstract: A cursory survey of nineteenth-century fiction indicates that few English writers were willing to represent the urban class system as a site of national cohesion.

I have argued that Jenson’s attention to the centrality of God’s identity as the God of Israel permeates his theology, and its profound importance for Christian theology is convincingly developed<br>

When Kant states that in proceeding through theCritiquewe shall be “proceeding precisely on the lines of Copernicus’ primary hypothesis,” he is suggesting that we invert classical modes of knowing.

Through the constitution of a system of conceptual interpenetrations derived from a dialectical tradition which has Hegel, Lacan and Adorno as its central figures – a system designed to privilege questions set in motion by the notions of desire, drive, fantasy and action – the aim of the ensuing pages has chiefly been to demonstrate how, remarkably often, an indistinct picture is indeed the one we need.

  Abstract: In the 1990s, there was much debate among observers of the ‘normalisation’ of French industrial relations (Freyssinet 1993; Ruysseveldt and Visser 1996; Goetschy 1998). Broadly, the argument is that there has been a shift from an under-institutionalised system in which state intervention was needed to mediate a more or less naked class conflict between capital and labour to one based upon regular decentralised compromise bargaining between ‘social partners’. From this perspective, the system of labour regulation in France – the ‘rules of the game’ by which wages and working conditions are established – is coming to resemble more closely that of other<br>

But it seems to me that a “middle position” must, by definition, compromise the truths of both religion and economics. Indeed, such a premise accepts what is one of the primary problems with modern economics, namely, the belief in the so-called “equity/efficiency” trade-off. That is, the belief that an economic system can be equitable or it can be efficient, but it cannot be both.<br>

  Book Title: Grasping Truth and Reality-Lesslie Newbigin's Theology of Mission to the Western World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Le Roy Stults Donald<br>
  Abstract: When Lesslie Newbigin returned to Britain in 1974 after years of missionary service, he observed that his homeland was as much a mission field as India, where he had spent the majority of his missionary career. He concluded that the Western world needed a missionary confrontation. Instead of the traditional approach to missions, however, Newbigin realized that the Western world needed to be confronted theologically. From his earliest days at Cambridge University, Newbigin developed the theological convictions that shaped his understanding of the Christian faith, and he used these theological convictions as criteria to evaluate the belief system of Western culture and to provide an answer to its dilemma. The Enlightenment reintroduced humanism and dualism into Western culture, which resulted on the loss of purpose and the rise of skepticism. This book discusses Newbigin's theological convictions and how they factored into both his critique of and his solution to Western culture's spiritual and worldview problems. Donald Le Roy cleverly explains Newbigin's solution to reintroduce the Christian belief system into Western culture in order to restore purpose and truth to Westerners and put them back in contact with true reality through Jesus Christ.<br>

According to editors Sven Beckert and Seth Rockman, the issue is not whether slavery itself was or was not capitalist but, rather, the impossibility of understanding the nation's spectacular pattern of economic development without situating slavery front and center. American capitalism-renowned for its celebration of market competition, private property, and the self-made man-has its origins in an American slavery predicated on the abhorrent notion that human beings could be legally owned and compelled to work under force of violence.<br>

  Book Title: Ancestral Memory in Early China-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Brashier K. E.<br>
  Abstract: Ancestral ritual in early China was an orchestrated dance between what was present (the offerings and the living) and what was absent (the ancestors). The interconnections among the tangible elements of the sacrifice were overt and almost mechanical, but extending those connections to the invisible guests required a medium that was itself invisible. Thus in early China, ancestral sacrifice was associated with focused thinking about the ancestors, with a structured mental effort by the living to reach out to the absent forebears and to give them shape and existence. Thinking about the ancestors—about those who had become distant—required active deliberation and meditation, qualities that had to be nurtured and learned. This study is a history of the early Chinese ancestral cult, particularly its cognitive aspects. Its goals are to excavate the cult’s color and vitality and to quell assumptions that it was no more than a simplistic and uninspired exchange of food for longevity, of prayers for prosperity. Ancestor worship was not, the author contends, merely mechanical and thoughtless. Rather, it was an idea system that aroused serious debates about the nature of postmortem existence, served as the religious backbone to Confucianism, and may even have been the forerunner of Daoist and Buddhist meditation practices.<br>

This requires three things: an informed theoretical perspective, an adequate system of classification, and broad and specific comparative material. The first third of this chapter will describe several scholars and works that contribute to the eclectic theoretical perspective of this study. However, this study does not delve into unplowed ground. Unfortunately, most previous studies of the public and private<br>

  Abstract: Lezama’s theories cannot be reduced to a system of aesthetics in the philosophical sense of the term. Neither can they be reduced to a set of concepts that one would be able to define and use elsewhere. This is because in his theory of the arts there are no transhistorical constants that give sense to the history of forms. Even in a more specific or circumscribed setting, his method of reading rests on the idea that no two styles can be the same and, as an extension, that there are no two ways of putting together the materials that give<br>

Hodgson’s “A Sermon in Behalf of Southern Sufferers” paints a dire picture of the South in the two years since the war had ended, with floods, droughts, and impending famines adding to the grim reality of an already devastated economy and a defunct social system. With this picture in mind, Hodgson reminds his audience of the Christian imperative of hospitality by citing<br>

  Abstract: Reading the works of Shmuel Yosef Agnon in New York in 2008 against the backdrop of the economic crisis evolving in the United States at that time had an unintended effect: I started to think of Agnon as an economist. Encountering Agnon in high school (as every child who grows up in the Israeli education system does), and later in university, my perception of the canonical author was shaped through Gershon Shaked’s paradoxical definition of Agnon as a “revolutionary traditionalist.” Born in 1888 in Galicia, an erudite “pupil” of the Jewish sacred multi-textual tradition but also of the writings of<br>

  Abstract: Following the aforementioned definition, which corresponds also to theoretical approaches of embodiment and its perception (Merleau-Ponty 1964, 159–90; Lesure 2005), it is argued that the built environment demonstrates from prehistoric times an anthropogenic system of closed and open spaces for hosting every-day life, economic, social and symbolic activities. It represents, therefore, an agent through which the needs, abilities and habits of humans are embodied, but also the field for economic and social interaction. Moreover, built environment — domestic, funeral, and sacred — displays the existential ground of culture that allows the identification of its cognitive creator and owner.<br>

The peculiar difficulty of dialectical writing lies indeed in its holistic, “totalizing” character: as though you could not say any one thing until you had first said everything; as though with each new idea you were bound to recapitulate the entire system. So it is that the attempt to do justice to the most random observation of Hegel ends up drawing the whole tangled, dripping mass of the Hegelian sequence of forms out into the light with it.

  Abstract: One persistent theoretical and practical problem in Marxism was to explain the failures of working-class opposition to capitalist exploitation. Karl Marx had assumed that the organized working class would eventually engage in a successful political struggle against the ruling class alongside a background of systematic crises in the economic system. A wide range of explanations as to why this transformation did not take place has been developed over the decades after Marx’s death in 1883. At the end of the nineteenth century, it appeared that the condition of the German working class had improved, suggesting that capitalism could be reformed.<br>

Inspired by the visit of the Danish antiquarian Worsaae and his account of the development of the chronological framework known as the “Three Age System” (Worsaae 1845–7, 312–14), members of learned societies and students of the past visited and described a variety of mounds and megalithic constructions.

With this in mind, I will pause here to create a quick overview of some of the myths of disability that are ubiquitous across cultures and eras and that condition our understanding of disability (and thus of all identity and all bodies).

Using a series of examples she shows that the interaction between an Englishman and a Pole does not always go smoothly, because of the fact that differences in the formulation and interpretation of requests can lead to misunderstandings. According to Wierzbicka, two cultural values held by Poles seem to motivate certain lexico-syntactic phenomena in this type of speech acts namely cordiality and courtesy.<br>

The public face of an oppressive system can change (or alternate, at times), between oppressor and oppressed subordinated other; aspects of the new facade may even appear representative of the oppressed. But the death-dealing policies continue to the detriment of the oppressed.

However, the French university system did share, only much earlier, many of the key changes that have come to Irish universities since the 1980s. It experienced a surge in university numbers slightly earlier than its Irish counterpart.

One cannot understand France during the 1960s, as well as the nature of the political system against which the sixty-eighters rebelled, without examining the general’s central role. By the same token, the political closure the general had mandated engendered a trenchant body of oppositional cultural criticism that ultimately succeeded in undermining Gaullism’s credibility as a political model.

For the philosophers, such unexplained insights invited a speculative search for an alternative and more naturalistic system of cognition.<br>

Since divination seems not to have a place in the normal modes of thinking, they propose that some other form of insight dwells in the soul’s other parts, situated closely to our creaturely selves.

  Abstract: Freed from the constraints imposed by the “closed system” that had been both the sustainer and the stifler of much Han classical scholarship, thinkers increasingly used the commentary as a vehicle for expressing individual thought from the early third century on. Although all interpretation can be considered a creative act,¹ when a commentary introduces a philosophical platform or series of platforms that are foreign to or undeveloped in the original text, it becomes more than an appendage to another body of writing and a work in its own right. Some of the more prominent examples of this written in the<br>

This world is bounded on one frontier by the spirit world and on the other by the non-Chinese world. It is organized internally according to nested structures of kinship and obligation, which are made to account for geography and fealty. And it finds itself in the times recounted by historiography, in a consciously late Zhou moment. Although<br>

Ironically, nowhere is the “domination system” that Wink identified in his series more prominent or pertinent than in corporate globalization.<br>

  Abstract: The genres of autobiographical writing and utopian writing have little in common. While an autobiography is an account of the life of an individual written by that individual, utopian narrative offers a vision of an ideal place and social system for a collective. In fact, according to Robert F. Sayre, autobiography and utopia indicate polarities: between experience and prophecy, self and society, private and public or emotional unity and rational order (Sayre 1972, 21, 23). Both forms have firmly marked their presence in the culture and history of Australia. Autobiography, as Joy Hooton writes, has always been a prolific genre<br>

  Abstract: The empire binds time. The idea of time being bound by institutions of power (ancient or modern) to have a normalizing effect, of course, comes from Elizabeth Freeman. She identifies such a binding as chrononormativity, “the use of time to organize individual human bodies toward maximum productivity.”¹ Under a modern capitalist system, for example, a normal “workday” is arranged (including “free” time) in such a way that workers produce more labor, and thus capital, for their employers. Chrononormativity, therefore, produces the most benefit for those at the top of the socioeconomic hierarchy.<br>

  Book Title: The Music of Béla Bartók-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): WILSON PAUL<br>
  Abstract: According to Wilson, earlier critics of Bartók's music have often sought to discover an unvarying precompositional system that accounted for individual musical events. Wilson's approach is different in that he develops a way to explore each work within the musical contexts that the work itself creates and sustains. Wilson begins by discussing a number of fundamental musical materials that Bartók employed throughout his oeuvre. Using these materials as foundations, he then describes a series of flexible, behaviorally defined harmonic functions and a model of pitch hierarchy based on the functions and on several connective designs. Wilson shows how these hierarchical structures provide meaningful forces for coherence and for dynamism and progressional drive in the music. After analyzing the five works from Bartók's oeuvre, he concludes by explaining the philosophical similarities between his theory and the work of David Lewin and Charles Taylor in the related fields of perception and hermeneutics.<br>

He now develops that analysis further, using examples from a very wide range of comics, including the work of American artists such as Chris Ware and Robert Crumb. He tests out his theoretical framework by bringing it up against cases that challenge it, such as abstract comics, digital comics and sh?jo manga, and offers insightful reflections on these innovations.<br>

  Abstract: Clockers (1995) begins with signs of violence: still shots of brutally shot people, all young, all black, all apparently inner city.¹ On the sound track Marc Dorsey sings a cool jazz “People in Search of a Life” (written by Raymond James). Capitalism is an extremely violent social system, but that violence is mostly symbolic in the bourgeois boardrooms and in the middle-class experience. In the inner city, where poverty is extreme, the violence is literal and very real. It is the dark side of the American way, of the American dream. But it is, essentially, the same system.

  Author(s) Young Elspeth<br>
  Abstract: It is often assumed that customary concepts of common property must hamper development, and must be eradicated in favour of more individualistic ownership which promotes entrepreneurial approaches and wealth generation. Such assumptions are not new. History presents some strong supporting evidence for their validity, but also raises questions, particularly in relation to equity in resource distribution. In Scotland, for example, the transformation two centuries ago from the communally based run-rig system to the enclosure of the land into individual plots laid the basis for land improvement, agricultural intensification and the introduction of new crops and livestock. Without such changes the<br>

  Author(s) NAZIKIAN FUMIKO<br>
  Abstract: THE TWO TERMS in the title of this chapter, “truth” and “authorship,” have long been central topics in narrative research. They remain ineludible because they are not only core elements of narrativity but also raise key questions about the roles of narrative in social life. The chapter seeks to show how truth and authorship are shaped by the path taken by witnesses’ depositions within the institutional meanders of the justice system. It does so by focusing on the multilateral character of storytelling in institutions and the complex processes of entextualization, decontextualization, and recontextualization.<br>

  Book Title: Being in the World-Dialogue and Cosmopolis<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Dallmayr Fred<br>
  Abstract: In
      Being in the World, noted political theorist Fred Dallmayr explores the globe's transition from the traditional Westphalian system of states to today's interlocking cosmopolitan network. Drawing upon sacred scriptures as well as the work of ancient philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle and more recent scholars such as Martin Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Raimon Panikkar, this book delves into what Dallmayr calls "being in the world," seen as an aspect of ethical-political engagement. Rather than lamenting current problems, he suggests addressing them through civic education and cosmopolitan citizenship. Dallmayr advocates a politics of the common good, which requires the cultivation of public ethics, open dialogue, and civic responsibility.<br>

  Author(s) Mailloux Steven<br>
  Abstract: Interpretive theory has been unsuccessful in finding a system of rules that can be applied in legal reasoning or in the interpretation of literature. Theorists’ aspiration toward such a system of rules and their skepticism that such rules are possible have given rise to much controversy.¹ Rhetoric offers a way out of this impasse because it is an art of reasoning adapted to the particularities of situation and action. This art is reasonable but does not presuppose that, in order to be used intelligently, rules and terms must be determinate (specifiable precisely, repeatable in different situations, and univocal).

But they may have influenced the scientific movement in a substantial albeit indirect way. Platonic speculation on the sun as symbol of the mind may seem unrelated to the development of a scientific cosmology. Yet as Hans Blumenberg has shown, it removed the principal philosophical obstacle that barred the way toward the acceptance of a heliocentric system.

Appreciating this fact is crucial if we are to understand his intellectual accomplishments; but it must also be kept in perspective.

That is to say, adult constructions of the child often do not correspond to what children themselves say and do. Paradoxically, children can lose their child status when they do not act

This was true for each of two major families of justice claims: claims for socioeconomic redistribution and claims for legal or cultural recognition.

  Book Title: Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): MATSUMOTO STACIE<br>
  Abstract: The first three centuries of the Heian period (794–1086) saw some of its most fertile innovations and epochal achievements in Japanese literature and the arts. It was also a time of important transitions in the spheres of religion and politics, as aristocratic authority was consolidated in Kyoto, powerful court factions and religious institutions emerged, and adjustments were made in the Chinese-style system of ruler-ship. At the same time, the era’s leaders faced serious challenges from the provinces that called into question the primacy and efficiency of the governmental system and tested the social/cultural status quo. Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries, the first book of its kind to examine the early Heian from a wide variety of multidisciplinary perspectives, offers a fresh look at these seemingly contradictory trends. Essays by fourteen leading American, European, and Japanese scholars of art history, history, literature, and religions take up core texts and iconic images, cultural achievements and social crises, and the ever-fascinating patterns and puzzles of the time. The authors tackle some of Heian Japan’s most enduring paradigms as well as hitherto unexplored problems in search of new ways of understanding the currents of change as well as the processes of institutionalization that shaped the Heian scene, defined the contours of its legacies, and make it one of the most intensely studied periods of the Japanese past.<br>

  Abstract: The situation of the Bali Aga within changing Balinese representations of their society is part of a contested and emergent knowledge system, drawing on a range of culturally specific metaphors of time and movement and, more recently, on a more “global” and Western-influenced vocabulary of modernity. But how do these local representational models compare and relate to Western portrayals of the Bali Aga, as reflected in an abundant and changing anthropological literature on Balinese society?<br>

My emphasis in this section will be on the fate of those individuals who were caught in the system and obliged both to think of themselves and to present themselves to others in class terms. If the relegation of a student to a particular class category was not a function of his immutable social essence but the result of a struggle, a class trial, one may begin to speak of the elaboration of Bolshevik<br>

  Abstract: What are the philosophical antecedents of Freud’s attempt to establish a science of the mind? As already briefly mentioned, during his early university days Freud explicitly rejected philosophy, because of its “speculative” character. He struggled with balancing the intellectual appeal of philosophy with the “certainty” he hoped to find in positivist science. That move heralded the series of clinical studies that would eventually emerge in the therapeutic system of psychoanalysis, a psychiatry he would consistently call a “science.” Freud never abandoned his commitment to scientific knowledge and perhaps more importantly, scientific reason.

At this historical juncture, over six million foreigners, including Gastarbeiter (guest workers), refugees, asylum seekers, writers, artists, and professionals are permanently settled in Germany. In the embattled Europe of the post-cold-war era, Germany, with its economic power, political stability, generous welfare system, and what until recently were very flexible asylum laws, has become, perhaps quite unwittingly and unwillingly, the destination for a growing body of dis- placed peoples.

  Abstract: From 1958 to 1969 General Charles de Gaulle wholly dominated the landscape of French politics. One cannot understand France during the 1960s, as well as the nature of the political system against which the sixty-eighters rebelled, without examining the general’s central role. By the same token, the political closure the general had mandated engendered a trenchant body of oppositional cultural criticism that ultimately succeeded in undermining Gaullism’s credibility as a political model. As the decade evolved, pathbreaking works of fiction, film, and theory emerged, forming a cultural template through which the sixty-eighters viewed the shortcomings of postwar French society.<br>

  Abstract: The emerging figures of legitimacy described in the foregoing chapters are part of a vast “decentering” of democratic systems. No one believes any longer that democracy can be reduced to a system of competitive elections culminating in majority rule. This is an important development. For two centuries the history of democracy was a history of polarization. It was as if the general will existed as a genuine force only when enshrined in a central government by way of an election. This notion was intimately associated with the conditions under which mankind had gained its freedom from the old ruling powers.<br>

Although pharmacotherapy is less often used for symptoms specific to PTSD, several drugs have been found to have a modulating effect on intrusive phenomena, such as nightmares and dream recollections, and symptoms of autonomic nervous system arousal, such as irritability, aggressive outbursts, exaggerated startle response, and hypervigilance.

Although civil society in the past largely coincided with the boundaries of the state, it is now being reconstructed internationally in ways that strain the capacity of any government to order, guide, or control.

  Abstract: THE SYSTEM of classification long in place in our libraries and bibliographies posits the kinship of autobiography and biography, ranging them both under the aegis of history as categories of the literature of reference, kinds of writing determined by their presumed basis in verifiable fact. Yet it is precisely with regard to this central identifying feature of reference to a world beyond the text that theory of autobiography today differs from the practice of biography. Thus it has become commonplace for students of autobiography to assert that the past, the ostensible primary reference of such texts, is a fiction. As<br>

  Abstract: Perhaps, these lyric poems propose, the weather can serve as a forceful wartime medium, broadcasting the voices or at least the sounds of distant violence, carrying in its currents an audible, palpable sense of suffering elsewhere. This was one way war at a distance could invade—affectively and effectively—the home front. An air-borne sense of suffering, however, escaped like involuntary sighs or moans from a growing, more rationalized understanding of global weather and global war. The new meteorology aimed to regularize violent extremes into an intelligible system, less felt than observed, and predicated on a predictable and continuous nature.<br>

  Book Title: Politics and the Imagination-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geuss Raymond<br>
  Abstract: In politics, utopians do not have a monopoly on imagination. Even the most conservative defenses of the status quo, Raymond Geuss argues, require imaginative acts of some kind. In this collection of recent essays, including his most overtly political writing yet, Geuss explores the role of imagination in politics, particularly how imaginative constructs interact with political reality. He uses decisions about the war in Iraq to explore the peculiar ways in which politicians can be deluded and citizens can misunderstand their leaders. He also examines critically what he sees as one of the most serious delusions of western political thinking--the idea that a human society is always best conceived as a closed system obeying fixed rules. And, in essays on
      Don Quixote, museums, Celan's poetry, Heidegger's brother Fritz, Richard Rorty, and bourgeois philosophy, Geuss reflects on how cultural artifacts can lead us to embrace or reject conventional assumptions about the world. While paying particular attention to the relative political roles played by rule-following, utilitarian calculations of interest, and aspirations to lead a collective life of a certain kind, Geuss discusses a wide range of related issues, including the distance critics need from their political systems, the extent to which history can enlighten politics, and the possibility of utopian thinking in a world in which action retains its urgency.<br>

  Abstract: An academic field of inquiry is a paradigm inhabiting a structure. Thirty years ago, the paradigm for academic literary studies became detached from the institutional structure it inhabited. This phenomenon was masked by the circumstance that the American university was enjoying a period of rapid expansion, which made the discrepancy between scholarly assumptions and institutional determinants easily finessed. Challenges to the received structure of academic inquiry did not have to be faced; they could simply be tacked onto the existing system. Today the effects of that detachment have become apparent.

In this way, no text (indeed, no system of signification) can purport to be the one unique text, the text that could, through its own unity, lead us towards a unified totality. The notion of a unified literary tradition in which a singular voice could take on the value of the whole is therefore constantly dissolved in the multiplicity of voices that tradition is constituted by.

  Abstract: It is not a coincidence that postmodernism and postcolonialism have materialized at the same time as objects of study in the human sciences: the one is a function of the other. The collapse of the
                  grands récitsof the Enlightenment that Jean-François Lyotard (1986) identifies as the signifying mark of postmodernity is contingent upon the end of the great European nation-state empires and of capitalism grounded in nation-states. Trans-or multinational capitalism is a system that has outgrown the institutions that created a space for its expansion, as it previously outgrew and disregarded the centralized monarchies that fostered its development over<br>

  Abstract: Intellectuals comprise a supposedly enlightened elite who become involved in political matters in order to offer guidance to the masses in the search for their true objective interests. The role of intellectuals is derived from and legitimized by an ethical system that relied on reason to discover and explicate objective justice. While Protestant ethics (particularly Calvinism) is conducive to a subjective understanding of interests in which feelings provide the measuring rod, the Catholic ethical tradition tempers the individual’s ability to determine her or his own rules of conduct. Intellectuals claim that because of their ability to reason, they have direct<br>

In the previous chapter I argued, with the support of a good number of political economists, that even in the present neoliberal decade such a counter-movement does exist. People continue to defend their habitation against the inroads of the self-regulating market system. Yet the movement is small.

The subject, being unextended, is not even in space; the world is a spatial system of objects that the subject contemplates from a “position” that is not part of that system.

  Book Title: The World in the Trinity-Open-Ended Systems in Science and Religion<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Bracken Joseph A.<br>
  Abstract: Joseph A. Bracken argues that the failure of theology and science to generate cohesion is the lack of an integrated system of interpretation of the Christian faith that consciously accords with the insights and discoveries of contemporary science. In The World in the Trinity, Bracken utilizes the language and conceptual structures of systems theory as a philosophical and scientific grammar to show traditional Christian beliefs in a new light that is accessible and rationally plausible to a contemporary, scientifically influenced society. This account opens new possibilities for rethinking the God-world relationship, the Trinity, incarnation, creation, and eschatology within the context of a broader ecological and cosmological system. In re-describing these articles constitutive of Christian belief, the author is conscious of the vital importance of retaining the inherent power and meaning of these concepts. This volume freshly retrieves pivotal themes and concepts constitutive of the Christian tradition in a conscious rapprochement with current scientific understandings of nature.<br>

In other words, is the Church primarily an institutional entity with a relatively fixed identity as a result of its longstanding doctrinal and liturgical heritage, or is the Church primarily a process or system for handing on<br>

  Book Title: America's Education Deficit and the War on Youth-Reform Beyond Electoral Politics<br>
  Publisher: Monthly Review Press<br>
  Author(s): GIROUX HENRY A.<br>
  Abstract: America's latest war, according to renowned social critic Henry Giroux, is a war on youth. While this may seem counterintuitive in our youth-obsessed culture, Giroux lays bare the grim reality of how our educational, social, and economic institutions continually fail young people. Their systemic failure is the result of what Giroux identifies as four fundamentalisms: market deregulation, patriotic and religious fervor, the instrumentalization of education, and the militarization of society. We see the consequences most plainly in the decaying education system: schools are increasingly designed to churn out drone-like future employees, imbued with authoritarian values, inured to violence, and destined to serve the market. And those are the lucky ones. Young people who don't conform to cultural and economic discipline are left to navigate the neoliberal landscape on their own; if they are black or brown, they are likely to become ensnared by a harsh penal system.Giroux sets his sights on the war on youth and takes it apart, examining how a lack of access to quality education, unemployment, the repression of dissent, a culture of violence, and the discipline of the market work together to shape the dismal experiences of so many young people. He urges critical educators to unite with students and workers in rebellion to form a new pedagogy, and to build a new, democratic society from the ground up. Here is a book you won't soon forget, and a call that grows more urgent by the day.<br>

  Book Title: Negotiating Justice-Progressive Lawyering, Low-Income Clients, and the Quest for Social Change<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Shdaimah Corey S.<br>
  Abstract: While many young people become lawyers for the big bucks, others are motivated by the pursuit of social justice, seeking to help people for whom legal services are financially, socially, or politically inaccessible. These progressive lawyers often bring a considerable degree of idealism to their work, and many leave the field due to insurmountable red tape and spiraling disillusionment. But what about those who stay? And what do their clients think? Negotiating Justice explores how progressive lawyers and their clients negotiate the dissonance between personal idealism and the realities of a system that doesn't often champion the rights of the poor.Corey S. Shdaimah draws on over fifty interviews with urban legal service lawyers and their clients to provide readers with a compelling behind-the-scenes look at how different notions of practice can present significant barriers for both clients and lawyers working with limited resources, often within a legal system that many view as fundamentally unequal or hostile. Through consideration of the central themes of progressive lawyering - autonomy, collaboration, transformation, and social change - Shdaimah presents a subtle and complex tableau of the concessions both lawyers and clients often have to make as they navigate the murky and resistant terrains of the legal system and their wider pursuits of justice and power.<br>

  Abstract: In Part I we tried to show how France, America, and England developed different civility preferences due to the manner in which each nation was affected by a variety of factors, including political philosophy and system of government, religion, intellectual history, geography, economy, familial norms, and the manner in which emotions were restrained and expressed. By the close of the nineteenth century each nation possessed its own civility and interaction ethos. The industrialization of the West did not have a substantial levelling effect over national identity or national ideology.<br>

  Abstract: All the existentialists are united in their opposition to idealist philosophies which ignore space and time as necessary conditions of the human existence. In no way is the finiteness of the human creature more evident than in the fact that he must live an earthly existence, and, since things in time have a beginning and an end, that he must be subject to the mysteries of birth and death. Ignoring these fundamental facts, the idealists sought to transcend the time process by rational system and they imposed a rational pattern upon the course of historical events.

  Abstract: THE 1960s can be called the decade of education, because a great number of changes and reforms have taken place and are taking place all over the world, in order to meet the increasing demands from a society which itself is changing rapidly. This growing awareness of the role of education meets with increasing demands for well educated and specialized people. Governments realize that they have an obligation to provide the means for an efficient educational system. It is characteristic that parliaments and governments really begin to listen when shown that expansion in education provides for economic growth. Generally speaking,<br>

This concept, however, was nowhere developed in a thematic way, referred to only rarely and seemingly in passing.

From a phenomenological viewpoint, in the photograph, the power of authentication exceeds the power of representation’ (Barthes 1984: 88–9).

  Abstract: The idea of naturalism as a comprehensive philosophical stance is one that is widely regarded as clear, reasonably stable in intension, and tolerably well understood, whether one is an advocate or an opponent of that stance. The approximate idea is one according to which the world is a unitary causally interconnected system, without ‘gods’ or systemic ‘purposes,’ and best understood, or only rationally intelligible, by scientific means. Yet it proves quite challenging to give the idea detail and precision, with a result that won’t be bland and uncontroversial, at least for most philosophers, or with a result that won’t be<br>

  Abstract: In the history of modern philosophy, after the systems of Kant and Hegel – systems respectively of the immanent critique and the apotheosis of Reason – the non-rationalist image of philosophy as anti-system or immanently creative Difference is born with Nietzsche. As the first of the three models of Difference analysed by Laruelle, Nietzschean Difference may be considered in an important sense as the base or standard model for the analysis overall.¹ Nietzschean Difference represents, from this point of view, the more general philosophical platform upon which the other, more specialised models of Difference will be constructed.

  Abstract: The democratisation of South Africa has become widely celebrated. Apartheid, a legalised system of white domination over a majority black population imposed by post-1948 National Party (NP) governments, was peculiarly vilified in a post-Nazi, post-colonial world. By the 1980s, the polarisation between pro-democratic forces and the regime was threatening conflagration of the most advanced industrial economy in Africa. Yet in 1994 South Africa held a first democratic election following a four-year transition process whereby previously warring parties negotiated a highly praised constitution founded upon human equality, liberal democracy, a separation of powers, minority representation and socio-economic as well as individual<br>

  Book Title: Post-Foundational Political Thought-Political Difference in Nancy, Lefort, Badiou and Laclau<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Marchart Oliver<br>
  Abstract: A wide-ranging overview of the emergence of post-foundationalism and a survey of the work of its key contemporary exponents.This book presents the first systematic coverage of the conceptual difference between ‘politics’ (the practice of conventional politics: the political system or political forms of action) and ‘the political’ (a much more radical aspect which cannot be restricted to the realms of institutional politics). It is also the first introductory overview of post-foundationalism and the tradition of ‘left Heideggerianism’: the political thought of contemporary theorists who make frequent use of the idea of political difference: Jean-Luc Nancy, Claude Lefort, Alain Badiou and Ernesto Laclau.After an overview of current trends in social post-foundationalism and a genealogical chapter on the historical emergence of the difference between the concepts of ‘politics’ and ‘the political’, the work of individual theorists is presented and discussed at length. Individual chapters are presented on the political thought of Jean-Luc Nancy (including Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe), Claude Lefort, Alain Badiou, and Ernesto Laclau (including Chantal Mouffe).Overall the book offers an elaboration of the idea of a post-foundational conception of politics.Other titles in the Taking on the Political series: Valentine and Arditi/ Polemicisation 0 7486 1064 2Shapiro/ Cinematic Political Thought 0 7486 1289 0Chambers/ Language and the Politics of Untimeliness 0 7486 1766 3Bowman/ Post-Marxism Versus Cultural Studies 978 0 7486 1762 3Simons/ Critical Political Theory in the Media Age 0 7486 1583 0<br>

For Badiou, true philosophy is always systematic, yet it is not systematic in the sense of being centered around a keystone: ‘if by “system” you mean, first, that philosophy is conceived as an argumentative discipline with a requirement of coherence, and second, that philosophy never takes the form of a singular body of knowledge but, to use my own vocabulary, exists conditionally with respect to a complex set of truths,<br>

  Abstract: Understanding continuity and change in international order is a central question in the study of International Relations. IR theories conceptualize order in different ways. Each theory underpins a narrative about how an effective resolution to obstacles or tensions in the international system can be reached and stability secured. Neorealists conceive order as the result of power balances in the international system between dominant states (Waltz 1979). The English school conceives order being built on a “society of states” (Bull 2002; Linklater and Suganami 2006; Linklater 2007).

  Abstract: Ethnographic studies of “dangerous men” have generally taken us behind bars. Erving Goffman’s (1961) arresting critique of the confinement setting as a generative milieu for the exercise of power helped to spawn a series of monograph-length works recounting life, death, and survival behind prison walls (e.g., Jacobs 1978; Sykes 1971; Toch 1977). A second wave of penological analysis, still concerned with “everyday experience” behind bars, challenged the correctional system as an extension of the state’s regulatory ambit. For example, Irwin’s (1970, 1985) studies of the felon and the jail respectively ushered in a new era of incisive commentary. Crime control<br>

  Abstract: Well over a hundred years after the narration of the Californio testimonials, their descendants, the Chicanos, continue to face a number of social problems and contradictions that first came to the fore in the nineteenth century with invasion and modernization, that is, with conquest, the collapse of feudalism and the definitive inclusion of the territory within capitalism. The contingencies of social reality and politics, specifically an emergent dislocation and shift in social positioning, gave rise to an initial “space of indeterminacy” that ostensibly allowed the Californios to infiltrate and advance within the new system. By 1870, however, it had become<br>

  Abstract: Every system of thought traces, as if along a Mobius strip, its own system of unthought, and in the process unfolds a history of alterity that reveals how the other, “at once interior and foreign,” has been provisionally unthought, exteriorized, and “shut away (in order to reduce its otherness).”² Though “shut away,” the other is absolutely integral to the selfsame, a necessary parable (Gr.

  Abstract: In this chapter, I examine the relationship of poetry to the neurobiological condition known as Tourette syndrome in order to describe a kind of physiological materialism that situates itself within the hierarchy of levels of organization I examined in the preceding chapter. Tourette syndrome is clearly an organic condition that involves, among other symptoms, the seeming emotion-charged use of language, the spouting forth of obscene language that, as researchers note, “may represent,” among other symptoms, “a common clinical expression of underlying central nervous system dysfunction” (Fahn and Erenberg 1988, 51).¹ That Tourette syndrome entails the automatic outpouring of emotionally charged<br>

  Abstract: In the United States, the field of architecture is in the process of evolving from what has been a practice, informed by other disciplines, into a discipline with its own body of knowledge.¹ Since the nineteenth century, its locus of education has changed from the architecture firm to the higher education institution. Its instructional practices have shifted from a predominantly apprenticeship system to a system of classroom-based teaching supplemented by apprenticeship. The role of architectural instructors is changing from master architect, whose knowledge and theory of making buildings is personally held, implicit, practical, and integrated, and who instructs by demonstration,<br>

The fundamental thesis is that these institutional changes, produced by underlying political changes, do not alter the class nature of the bourgeois State, but rather perfect it, making it adequate to the new needs<br>

  Abstract: Andrews provides new readings and interpretations of Bolaño's novels, including
      2666,The Savage Detectives, andBy Night in Chilewhile at the same time examining the ideas and narrative strategies that unify his work. He begins with a consideration of the reception of Bolaño's fiction in English translation, examining the reasons behind its popularity. Subsequent chapters explore aspects of Bolaño's fictional universe and the political, ethical, and aesthetic values that shape it. Bolaño emerges as the inventor of a prodigiously effective "fiction-making system," a subtle handler of suspense, a chronicler of aimlessness, a celebrator of courage, an anatomist of evil, and a proponent of youthful openness. Written in a clear and engaging style,Roberto's Bolano's Fictionoffers an invaluable understanding of one of the most important authors of the last thirty years.<br>

There, treating neurotic patients, he developed the discipline that was to become psychoanalysis.

  Abstract: In Kant, the dual question of reference and self-reference is left to be read from his terms “representation” and “reflection”—representation embodying the mind’s movement toward what is not itself, namely, the object; reflection, the mind’s questioning of its own structures. And yet, in the Kantian system, the conjunction of these two notions turns out to be, in the final analysis, impossible. This impossibility is expressed in a strange oxymoron, the use of which causes the entire framework to implode.

One track offers basic rights to self-determination and participation for those who satisfy the criteria of rational thought and independence; the other offers special treatment and, quite often, social and political exclusion.

Victims and oppressors, at the outset indistinguishable in their needs, became bound together in a symbiotic relationship by the relief operation and the politics that determined its path. Seemingly powerless to change the political context in which their work was embedded, aid agencies had to confront the probability that their aid was reviving one of the most brutal regimes in modern history, the Khmer Rouge.¹<br>

  Book Title: Edinburgh German Yearbook 9-Archive and Memory in German Literature and Visual Culture<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Osborne Dora<br>
  Abstract: In recent years, the discourse of memory - and of German memory culture in particular - has become increasingly concerned with questions of the archive. An archive can refer to a physical place, the material found there, or the system that orders this material; in its broadest sense, it might refer to something public (records housed in a municipal building), or something private (photographs in a family album). The material and documentary qualities of the archive confer on it an authenticating function attributed only cautiously to memory, but theories of the archive have questioned the status of material, documentary vestiges of the past. Memory and the archive are inextricably linked, but how does this affect the mediation of the past? This volume explores the changing relationship between memory and the archive in German-language literature and culture since 1945. Contributions approach this topic from a range of perspectives (film, visual culture, urban culture, digital technology, as well as literature) and offer illuminating studies of Harun Farocki, Anselm Kiefer, Thomas Demand, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Jürgen Fuchs, Stefan Wolter, and Sasa Stanisic.

  Abstract: In the
                  Archeology of Knowledge, Michel Foucault identifies in the archive a “particular level” that “between tradition and oblivion, […] reveals the rules of a practice that enables statements both to survive and to undergo regular modification. It isthe general system of the formation and transformation of statements.”¹ Because statements emerge as meaningful discourse at a given time, their appearance is accompanied by the possibility that they might not appear. They thereby point to the ways in which language is an event, the possibility of something being said or not said, a matter of whether enunciations even take place<br>

  Abstract: Franz Kafka once claimed that all human beings were caught between two competing technological systems: one sponsoring “ghostly” absence (the postal system, telegraph, and telephone) and one encouraging “natural” presence (trains, planes, and automobiles). To humanity’s woe, the ghostly side was winning: “To attain a natural intercourse, a tranquility of souls, [humanity] has invented the railway, the motor car, the aeroplane — but nothing helps anymore: These are evidently inventions devised at the moment of crashing” (

  Book Title: Representing the "Good German" in Literature and Culture after 1945-Altruism and Moral Ambiguity<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Schönfeld Christiane<br>
  Abstract: In the aftermath of the Second World War, both the allied occupying powers and the nascent German authorities sought Germans whose record during the war and the Nazi period could serve as a counterpoint to the notion of Germans as evil. That search has never really stopped. In the past few years, we have witnessed a burgeoning of cultural representations of this "other" kind of Third Reich citizen - the "good German" - as opposed to the committed Nazi or genocidal maniac. Such representations have highlighted individuals' choices in favor of dissenting behavior, moral truth, or at the very least civil disobedience. The "good German's" counterhegemonic practice cannot negate or contradict the barbaric reality of Hitler's Germany, but reflects a value system based on humanity and an "other" ideal community. This volume of new essays explores postwar and recent representations of "good Germans" during the Third Reich, analyzing the logic of moral behavior, cultural and moral relativism, and social conformity found in them. It thus draws together discussions of the function and reception of "Good Germans" in Germany and abroad.

  Author(s) Torres Isabel<br>
  Abstract: Herrera’s heliocentric formulations fixed the linguistic aspirations of the late sixteenth century upon the iconic authority of natural and perfect form, the circle. In a post-Copernican allegorical system, the vernacular ‘sol’ was figured as the ideal centre around which not only the fates of individual poets, but the destiny of the Spanish empire itself could, and should, revolve in conterminous motion. Notwithstanding the anxieties and ambivalences which, as we have seen, complicated this correlative arrangement, other paradoxes would ultimately destroy the illusion of centric stability. Firstly, the allegorical frame itself was intrinsically flawed. Herrera’s new brand of collective cultural heroism,<br>

  Book Title: Love and Death in Goethe-`One and Double'<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Dye Ellis<br>
  Abstract: Goethe, in association with his younger Romantic compatriots the Schlegels, Novalis, Fichte, and Schelling, struggled with the subject-object dichotomy, and tried to bridge the gap between self and other, consciousness and nature. His theory and practice prefigured the Romantics' determination to display and interrogate the linguistic and cultural structures informing their own thinking and modes of representation--what Goethe calls one's "Vorstellungsart." His work exploits, subverts, and supplants inherited conventions and signs, demonstrating with virtuosic irony that literature is a system of texts, pre-texts, and pre-established but dynamic conceptual models. 'Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double"' explores Goethe's use, in a wide range of his poetry and prose, of the theme of 'Liebestod' (love and death) and related embodiments of the paradox of unity in duality. Ellis Dye also examines Goethe's use of other themes related to love and death--the 'femme fatale', the 'vagina dentata, Frau Welt', the Lorelei, venereal disease, the 'Lustmord' --and considers issues of selfhood and individuation as well as the possibility that the love-death theme contains an implicit gender bias toward the existential fact of personal separateness. Poems, plays, and novels are dealt with, nevertheless, as works of art, not only as illustrations of an idea or as points of intersection in a system of rhetorical conventions, and are examined for intellectual cohesiveness, elegance, and integrity of design as well as special meanings and effects. ' Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double" ' explores the meaning of the central theme of Romantic poetry in the works of the most important Romantic poet of all. Students of literary culture, both the lay reader and the Goethe specialist, will be enlightened by its approach and find pleasure and instruction in its revelations. Robert Ellis Dye is professor of German at Macalester College.<br>

With the slogan “Maîtres chez nous” French Canadians claimed their cultural and economic independence from English-Canadian and American dominance. Authorities that had gone unchallenged for centuries were now questioned: Women began to emancipate themselves from patriarchal power structures, and society freed itself from the clerical system of education.

  Book Title: Narrative Deconstructions of Gender in Works by Audrey Thomas, Daphne Marlatt, and Louise Erdrich-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Rosenthal Caroline<br>
  Abstract: By analyzing the works of Thomas, Marlatt, and Erdrich through the lenses of subjectivity, gender studies, and narratology, Caroline Rosenthal brings to light new perspectives on their writings. Although all three authors write metafictions that challenge literary realism and dominant views of gender, the forms of their counter-narratives vary. In her novel 'Intertidal Life', Thomas traces the disintegration of an identity through narrative devices that unearth ruptures and contradictions in stories of gender. In contrast, Marlatt, in 'Ana Historic', challenges the regulatory fiction of heterosexuality. She offers her protagonist a way out into a new order that breaks with the law of the father, creating a "monstrous" text that explores the possibilities of a lesbian identity. In her tetralogy of novels made up of 'Love Medicine', 'Tracks', 'The Beet Queen', and 'The Bingo Palace', Erdrich resists definite readings of femininity altogether. By drawing on trickster narratives, she creates an open system of gendered identities that is dynamic and unfinalizable, positing the most fragmented worldview as the most enduring. By applying gender and narrative theory to nuanced analysis of the texts, Rosenthal's study elucidates the correlation between gender identity formation and narrative. Caroline Rosenthal is Professor and Chair of American Literature at the Friedrich-Schiller University in Jena, Germany. Her book 'Narrative Deconstructions of Gender' was published by Camden House in 2003.<br>

In some dozen books and hundreds of essays, he elaborated an unfolding theoretical system that not only had a far-reaching, formative influence on sociological thought and research but also extended to other social sciences, including economics, political science, anthropology, psychology, and psychoanalysis.<br>

  Book Title: Promises of 1968-Crisis, Illusion and Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): TISMANEANU VLADIMIR<br>
  Abstract: This book is a state of the art reassessment of the significance and consequences of the events associated with the year 1968 in Europe and in North America. Since 1998, there hasn’t been any collective, comparative and interdisciplinary effort to discuss 1968 in the light of both contemporary headways of scholarship and new evidence on this historical period. A significant departure from earlier approaches lies in the fact that the manuscript is constructed in unitary fashion, as it goes beyond the East–West divide, trying to identify the common features of the sixties. The latter are analyzed as simultaneously global and local developments. The main problems addressed by the contributors of this volume are: the sixties as a generational clash; the redefinition of the political as a consequence of the ideological challenges posed to the status-quo by the sixty-eighters; the role of Utopia and the de-radicalization of intellectuals; the challenges to imperialism (Soviet/American); the cultural revolution of the sixties; the crisis of ‘really existing socialism’ and the failure of “socialism with a human face”; the gradual departure from the Yalta-system; the development of a culture of human rights and the project of a global civil society; the situation of 1968 within the general evolution of European history (esp. the relationship of 1968 with 1989). In contrast to existing books, the book provides a fundamental and unique synthesis of approaches on 1968: first, it contains critical (vs. nostalgic) re-evaluations of the events from the part of significant sixty-eighters; second, it includes historical analyses based on new archival research; third, it gathers important theoretical re-assessments of the intellectual history of the 1968; and fourth, it bridges 1968 with its aftermath and its pre-history, thus avoiding an over-contextualization of the topics in question.<br>

Such a definition of the system and the cosmos to which it is related is a conception of identity.

  Book Title: What Holds Europe Together?-  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Michalski Krzysztof<br>
  Abstract: The book addresses contemporary developments in European identity politics as part of a larger historical trajectory of a common European identity based on the idea of 'solidarity.' The authors explain the special sense in which Europeans perceive their obligations to their less fortunate compatriots, to the new East European members, and to the world at large. An understanding of this notion of 'solidarity' is critical to understanding the specific European commitment to social justice and equality. The specificity of this term helps to distinguish between what the Germans call "social state" from the Anglo-Saxon, and particularly American, political and social system focused on capitalism and economic liberalism. This collection is the result of the work of an extremely distinguished group of scholars and politicians, invited by the previous President of the European Union, Romano Prodi, to reflect on some of the most important subjects affecting the future of Europe.<br>

Constitutional provisions are phrased in a general manner: their open texture often offers little specific guidance for the resolution of particulars in constitutional claims. Despite fleeting indeterminacy in constitutional adjudication, in the thousands of judgments being handed down in constitutional cases each year courts tend to rely on relatively few types of arguments. This phenomenon evokes an deep Aristotelian current in legal reasoning and makes the (post-)modern observer mindful of the stasis (status) system developed to analyze legal conflicts using a set of formal<br>

Abstract: Bonnet, who was perfectly aware of those debates, was not interested in determining an exact location. He left the job to physiologists but remarked that, whatever their opinions, the “immediate” instrument of the operations of the soul must be a single, unitary organ.
         115The significance of this anatomical requirement explains Bonnet’s reaction to the Italian anatomist’s Vincenzo Malacarne’s observation that nerves entering the brain do not converge onto a single location. Bonnet, whose psychological writings inspired the anatomist, initially accepts he might be wrong.116Later, however, he admits his reluctance to give up all convergence and emphasizes that the soul cannot be present simultaneously throughout the nervous system. “Excuse me,” he tells Malacarne, “if I insist on this point: you see well enough that thePalingénésieyou love is based a little on thatseat of the soulthat your anatomical research very much undermines.”117In short, for Bonnet, the possibility of the resurrection as full restitution of bodily and personal identity depends on a cerebro‐germinal particle whose existence is incompatible with the dispersion of soul in different brain locations.118<br>

Abstract: Communication is at the core of recent scholarship in the sociology of culture. Culture, this current work says, is a set of publicly shared codes or repertoires, building blocks that structure people’s ability to think and to share ideas. A society’s collectively held symbolic system is as binding and real as a language (see, e.g., Alexander and Seidman
      1990; Alexander and Smith1993; Bellah et al.1985; Kane1997; Rambo and Chan1990; Sewell1992; Somers1995; Steinberg1999; Swidler 1986; Tipton1982; Wuthnow1984,1987,1991,1992). Earlier work (e.g., Almond and Verba1963; Parsons and Shils1951) treated culture as a set of inner beliefs and values that people may never express but carry around in their heads. Those earlier works made a conceptual leap from the social system straight into the individual’s psyche and back out, with little attention to patterns of communication. The recent concepts of culture, in contrast, all draw upon something like Emile Durkheim’s ([1912]1995) understanding of the binding, structured, and structuring property of culture. For simplicity’s sake, this article will refer to these newly prominent concepts of culture—different as they are—with Durkheim’s term, “collective representations.”<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Fortunately for the state of linguistic anthropology, the loose congeries of problems and methods which Duranti describes as paradigms do not live up to that designation in Kuhnian terms. Indeed, it seems to me doubtful that Durantis first and second paradigms need involve incompatible views of language at all, any more than do, for example, phonetics and syntax as subdisciplines of linguistics proper. It seems to me telling in this regard that Dell Hymes, one of the originators of the ethnography of communicationand hence of Durantis second paradigmhas in addition to his work in that area never stopped doing straightforward descriptive linguistics and grammatical analysis of the kind that belongs firmly within Durantis first paradigm. The same goes for many other linguistic anthropologists who were trained in the sixties, seventies, and eighties. It is true that researchers views of language structure tend to vary according to their views about how language functions in relation to other aspects of human social life, but few if any ethnographers of speaking or Labovian sociolinguists have attempted to dissolve the notion of grammar entirely or the need to main a level of analysis which treats it as at least a semiautonomous formal system, without thereby denying its status as an interactional achievement both in everyday acts of language use and in the long term as languages change over time. Exemplary in this regard is the work of Duranti himself, whose outstanding studies of language and politics in Samoaaptly characterized by the title
         From Grammar to Politics(1994)have been grounded in both detailed ethnography and rigorous grammatical analysis of verbatim transcriptions of Samoan oratory and disputation.<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: Theories are always, in some way, about their theorists. While Luhmann’s variant of mutant functionalism is not palatable to American tastes, his theories are as reflective of late‐20th‐century European sensibilities as Parsons’s were of mid‐20th‐century America or Bellah and Geertz’s of the upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, some art critics have warmed to Luhmann’s book as an exemplar of one of the newer “cool” theories of art; that is, those that challenge more subject‐centered and humanist theories and aim to accommodate the growth of new mediums such as digital art and cyberspace. But in any conception of art that includes culture, the medium is only as good as the meaning it conveys. And it is the meaning of art that is sorely lacking in Luhmann’s appraisal. Paul Ricoeur once wrote that “materialism is the truth of a world without truth.” It might then be said of Luhmann’s conception of the art system that it is the truth of art without meaning.<br>

Abstract: Thus, by incorporating the computer as the physical extension of his own body, Hawking can mobilize and extend his intellectual capabilities. He can excorporate and make visible the neuromotor functions of his body,
         60as well as all the dysfunctions in the technical system surrounding him, and can mobilize the human competences required for the smooth functioning of this collective. Finally, and consequently, he can simultaneously fulfill his role as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. That is to say, he can write his own history by answering my questions on his role in the scientific community, the intellectual authority of his status, the changes it underwent over time, the characteristics he would like to see in his successors, and the importance of his peers’ role as regards the authority of his own status. We thus witness the operation, maintenance, and(non)simultaneousarticulation, through the mediation of the computer, of what I call, to paraphrase Ernst Kantorowicz, Hawking’s three bodies: first, anatural human bodycollectivized—this natural human body cannot function without this collective; second, acollective body(human body/computer/assistants) naturalized—this collective body becomes “his” body; and third, asacred body—the representative of the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics (which “is not subject to Passions as the other is, nor to Death, for as to this Body the [Professor] never dies).”61<br>

Abstract: Neal‘s account of the origin and early history of the Quakers in
      The History of the Puritanssignals another set of boundaries within the ranks of eighteenth‐century Dssent. Fox’s father is described as a “poor weaver,” which he was not. It is implied that Fox abandoned his apprenticeship to a shoemaker, though in fact he completed it. The account of Fox’s subsequent actions makes no explicit judgment against him, but in its chill distance it adopts the perspective of the powers that be. “It cannot be expected that such an unsettled People should have an uniform System of rational Principles,” Neal haughtily pronounces, and represents the early Quakers as uneducated, devoid of coherent principles, antisocial in their public behavior, and inculcating no secure set of moral values.52Neal’s concluding remarks even endorse the punitive measures of the commonwealth authorities against his fellow Dissenters. He is also icily patronizing about contemporary Quakers: “the Disturbances they gave to the publick Religion for a Course of many Years was so insufferable, that the Magistrates could not avoid punishing them as Disturbers of the Peace; though of late Years they are become a more sober and inoffensive People; and by the Wisdom of their Managers, have formed themselves into a Sort of Body politick.”53<br>

Abstract: Mme. Braudel writes, as “a witness to the intellectual origins of Fernand Braudel,” that in 1939 “what he had in his head was a fantastic phantasmagoria of colors, of landscapes, of men, of great events and small anecdotes, a composite of what he recombined and resuscitated from life.” Readers have to see beyond the trees to the forest, just as Braudel the author had to rely on his prodigious memory to create an ensemble of the distant sea from his prison camp in Lübeck “from a thousand facts and a thousand details often very far removed from one another in time and space.” Mme. Braudel describes Braudel’s “intellectual adventure” as “a slow accumulation little by little not of ideas, and less even of a system of ideas, but of images by the millions, the fabulous spectacles of history, mixing yesterday and today. In all of it, not a concern for logic.” She identifies Braudel’s key organizing principle as “a spectacle—it is a spectacle that he says took off, not a previous idea”
         72and she quotes hisJMHautobiographical essay: “And my vision of history took on its definitive form without my being entirely aware of it, partly as a direct intellectual response to a spectacle—the Mediterranean—which no traditional historical account seemed to me capable of encompassing, and partly as a direct existential response to the tragic times I was passing through.”73Turning that “spectacle” into a “vision of history” is a first, shorthand answer to our question of what readers remember.<br>

Abstract: If I must pause here, at the threshold of a subject that would appear to be of less than universal current interest—composition pedagogy—it is in the recognition that the subject of composition, how to compose one’s thoughts and words, was the greater part of education from antiquity to the nineteenth century. What we call expository writing, the one‐ or two‐course sequence that our university students are everywhere compelled to take, is only an echo of this immemorial “method of tradition.” The failure to reduce writing to method in our modern post‐Ramistic sense, to a quasi‐science of transmission, is related to the larger failure, perhaps the necessary failure, of modern educational theory to bring communication within the system of the disciplines, as both object of knowledge and means of transmitting knowledge. In this postrhetorical condition, information technologies proliferate with familiar paradoxical effects, such as the degradation in the communicative efficacy of writing lamented by Tufte and Lanham. Without falling back upon a narrative of decline, which would in any case concede a failure of historical understanding, I conclude on the threshold of a second question, much larger than that of composition pedagogy in the contemporary university. On this threshold, I envision, or call for (in the spirit of my epigraph from Bacon) an inquiry into the question of why writing has remained the indispensable “art of transmission” in the era of technologically mediated information.

Abstract: The dynamic that is interpretation incorporates the nonmethodical moment of understanding and the methodical moment of explanation [
            18,20,21]. “Understanding … precedes, accompanies, concludes, and thusenvelopsexplanation. Explanation, in turn,developsunderstanding analytically” [20, p. 142]. As there is a dialectical relationship, interpretation cannot be reduced to either side of the dialectic; and yet, these cannot stand alone. “Just as language, by being actualized in discourse, surpasses itself as system and realizes itself as event, so too discourse, by entering the process of understanding, surpasses itself as event and becomes meaning” [20, p. 78].<br>

Abstract: In
         Gender TroubleButler proposes the idea of gender as a performance constructed in the very act of performing, the performance a challenge to the ubiquity of gender categories. Although at moments Butler alerts readers to the punitive system of gender performances within compulsory social systems, the book proliferates the idea of gender as infinite, individualistic performance, as rebellious carnival, without much attention to the pains and problems of performing (1990, 139). Considerations of race are virtually unaddressed in the book. However, at the end, Butler confronts the epistemology of theories that “elaborate predicates of color, sexuality, ethnicity, class, and able‐bodiedness” and “invariably close with an embarrassed ‘etc.’ at the end of the list” (143). Butler suggests that the “etc.” should not be read as a sign of failure but as a sign of the “illimitable process of signification itself,” the “excess that accompanies any effort to posit identity once and for all” (143). Problematically, what Butler questions here is the idea of an identity prior to signification, not the analogizing of vastly different vectors such as able‐bodiedness and color.<br>

Abstract: I borrow Min’s helpful definition of religion as “concrete totalities”: “a system of symbols that comprises beliefs, rituals, and practices that embody the collective self‐understanding of its adherents within a ‘plausibility structure’ (Peter Berger), i.e., those objective socio‐historical conditions that render such self‐understanding plausible” (Min, “Dialectical Pluralism,” 590). For the dynamic models of culture that stress the indeterminate, hybrid, conflictual, and contested character of cultural identity formation predicated on sociohistorical processes and an understanding of religion in accordance with those models of culture, see Tanner,

Abstract: One often hears arguments as to whether one can make significant generalizations about the internal logic of Midrash, or whether it is more nearly an exegetical art with typical formal moves like those to which Robert Alter recently drew attention. A puzzle or a kind of gap in a biblical verse is stated; next, reference is made to verbal or semantic parallels in parts of the Bible distant from the original verse. With their help, one returns to the original verse, often with something like an element of surprise connection—hence the temptation of poststructuralists to see Midrash as an instance if not a paradigm of intertextuality—and so covers the hiatus between verse and problem. There seems to be general agreement among the Rabbis that the literal sense takes priority over any other in this operation (at least until Kabbala), but this seems to be more an insistence on sticking to the recognized range of use of specific biblical words than a self‐conscious appeal to a logical or other, wider frame for interpretation. What the rabbis agree on is not generally as ambitious as, for example, the rule that interpretation covers in three aspects,
            explicatio,meditatio,applicatio, or the distinction between varieties of nonliteral senses. Midrash is unlike Christian theology but may well fill a similar function: showing the community how to use its sacred text, and doing so through the instrument of a kind of instruction that has continuity of form. In each case, the ultimate recipient of instruction is the community, and it is equally true that in each case the instructional activity is itself communally sanctioned. The method of instruction is in each case one of defining the elements of that religion as a semiotic system, and we might say after Max Weber that rabbis and theologians are ideal types. The mode of instruction employed in each case is in the service of the tradition.30<br>

Abstract: Unfried's article itself can be approached in different ways. One can see it as a case of speculative interpretation, based not on first‐hand research but on a priori models. This is, of course, a more charitable way of saying that it is a case of sloppy research, given the fact that by the time he was writing his article there had already been numerous Bulgarian publications on the novel cultural treatment of former monuments, the mausoleum included.
         56But one can also treat it as a case of scholarly balkanism: the notion that explanatory approaches to phenomena in southeastern Europe often rest upon a discourse (in the Foucauldian sense)—or upon what might be called a stable system of stereotypes by those who shun the notion of “discourse”—that places the Balkans in a cognitive straitjacket. InImagining the Balkans,I refrained from generalizing about scholarly output, maintaining that the scholarly project moves along different lines than does the production of popular mythology and only occasionally intersects with it. My caveat was: “This is not to say that a great number of the scholarly practitioners of Balkan studies in the West do not share privately a staggering number of prejudices; what it says is that, as a whole, the rules of scholarly discourse restrict the open articulation of these prejudices.”57I still believe this to be true, and if I have erred, it is only in the direction of too much leniency.<br>

Abstract: In applying their social‐contract argument, Frické, Mathiesen, and Fallis point out that the fifth article states that access is not to be decided on the basis of origin, age, background, or views. Again, they argue that the fundamental thrust of the LBR is well intentioned but that the absolutism presents difficulties for praxis. They maintain that the LBR’s literal meaning could be construed as removing moral responsibilities for the welfare of, say, children. It is evident that their argument, consciously or not, meets with approval in many libraries. A recent survey asked a sample of librarians if they favor restricting access to pornographic Web sites in the library (if technology made this possible). A total of 37.3 percent of the respondents were somewhat or strongly in favor of that kind of restriction [
         23, p. 370]. Perhaps the most common example of restriction at this time is the existence of acceptable‐use policies in libraries. For the most part, but not exclusively, these policies refer to electronic resources, such as Internet searching and use. Many types of libraries adopt acceptable‐use policies, but they are most commonly applied in public libraries and school library media centers. One purpose of these policies is to alert library users about copyright laws and the limitations they impose. Other purposes extend beyond law and move into the realm of more discretionary information resources. The policy of the Eugene School District’s 4JNet (a communications network) states that “the use of profanity, obscenity or other language that may be offensive to another user” is prohibited, as is the “use of the network to access pornographic or obscene material” [24]. The Salt Lake County Library System uses similar language: “Using the library’s Internet connection (either in a Library or via the Home Page) to view pornography or obscenity is prohibited” [25]. Dworkin points out that cities can enact zoning regulations that limit where adult enter~<br>

Abstract: Specifically, I will attempt to show that Smith’s biblically based narratives recalibrated traditional Christianity’s theology of human creation, fall, and salvific potential, as it relates to the origin and end of evil. As such, Smith’s new mythos overtly redistributed the privilege central to both Jewish and Christian biblical myth: the capacity to know God, as expressed most directly in Exodus 19 and John 17. To state these aspects of Smith’s work discursively obscures the narrative forms in which they are communicated to and function among believing readers. Again, though necessitated at times by the analytical approach of the article, reducing Smith’s event‐driven narratives to propositional statements is alien to the religious system he created. Thus, I conclude with a discussion of the function of Smith’s narratives in creating a livable future for his believing readers.<br>

For this object does not lie within the range of perception since it does not have form. Nor does it lie in the range of the various forms of inference since it is devoid of distinguishing marks). See also ibid., 63, line 4 (I.1.4): “na ca pariniṣṭhitavastusvarūpatve ʿpi pratyakṣādiviṣayatvaṃ brahmaṇaḥ” (Though it is brahman’s nature to be a thoroughly known reality, still, brahman is not an object of the worldlypramāṇas). More ambiguous, perhaps, is the question of theātman’s accessibility to the worldlypramāṇas. Tilmann Vetter’s suggestion, inStudien zur Lehre und Entwicklung Śaṅkaras([Vienna, 1979], 118), of a division of labor between “reason” and revelation corresponding toātmanand brahman, respectively, “Śāstra (Schriftzitate und das mit ihnen begründete theologische System) macht das Absolute zugänglich, Yukti (rationale Überlegung) den Kern der Person” (Śāstra [scriptural citations and the theological system based on them] makes the Absolute accessible; Yukti [rational reflection] makes the core of the person accessible), suggests a greater willingness on Śaṅkara’s part to concede the empirical knowability of theātman. Yet Śaṅkara does not seem to have much confidence in (independent) reason’s ability to know the self, either. This is suggested, above all, by his criticism of the Mīmāṃsā tenet regarding the accessibility of the self to perception and inference (Halbfass,Tradition and Reflection, 148); for a discussion and critique of Vetter’s view, see 142, 177–80.<br>

Abstract: This unique notion of truth for librarianship that we are proposing is derived from what has been called historicism. Historicism is not really a theory of truth as much as it is a theory of knowledge in which the question of objective truth is eliminated. This elimination of objective truth implicit in historicism has been attacked from many quarters. The origin of this theory is J. G. Herder’s
         Reflections on the Philosophy of the History of Man[71]. With regard to the question of truth, historicism interprets both human consciousness and the propositions expressing the nature of humans themselves and all of reality as historically conditioned, even current knowledge [71, pp. 96–104]. Herder looked at the supposed teleological progression of reason and found it often wanting. Nevertheless, he believed that reason and goodness would eventually triumph over irrationalism and human folly [71, pp. 115–18]. Consider the following example that illustrates the difference between historicism and the three theories of truth discussed above. For the historicist, the proposition that the world is the center of the universe was true for the medieval mind. For the correspondence theorist, that proposition is simply false, although the additional fact that the medieval mind accepted this proposition to be true would be conceded. The coherence theorist would say that, although the medieval mind accepted the Aristotelian‐Ptolemaic view of the universe, which in itself is a coherent system of propositions, this coherent system would eventually be supplanted by Copernicus’s view. This revolutionary change in knowledge is often expressed as a paradigm by Thomas Kuhn and other philosophers of science. The historicist would point out that such paradigms of knowledge usually have a localized point of origin and gradually expand to the other areas of scholarship, finally entering the public consciousness, where they are accepted or rejected [67, pp. 160–73].

Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

Abstract: Now psychoanalytic, now generic and historical, broader methodologies collide—merge and rework each other—across the medial (in this case linguistic) workings of text, including their workings upon us. That dialectical interplay of historicist (over against idealist) discourse out of which the novelistic genre arose, stressed by McKeon as epistemological versus ethical, does not vanish into its hermeneutic spiral. Such a dialectic sustains the very terms of reading's feedback loops, where the checks and balances of thematized form and formalized value are reconfigured yet again in the zone of uptake—a
         responseby no means detached, as etymology might suggest, from the judgments associated with responsibility. Whether or not, for such reasons, we would want to call narratography an ethics of reading in its own right, one thing is clear. Its formal vigilance is anything but cold to the exposed ethical discrepancies of content. Exactly because it does not subordinate medial hypersensitivity to a broader comprehension of a governing narrative system, it can become a rigorously epistemological mode of textual attention.<br>

Abstract: À la limite, even my own first‐person, self‐conscious, and affective response to the neuroactivity provoked in my brain by a given set of circumstances is a neuronal phenomenon; as such, it may be propositionally mapped on the basis of brain imaging—but not better by me than by any neuroscientist reading my brain scans. Neuroscience makes us dispassionate spectators of a conative performance that we not only care passionately about, but are the protagonists of. Regardless of how precisely my and my neighbor’s brain scans image the neuroactivity corresponding to our decision making, and regardless as well of how unaware both of us are of the distinctive patterns in our brain’s degeneracy, it remains that my and my neighbor’s respective participation in the spectacles of these neuroactivities differ in kind. I conceive of myself (and narrate myself) as the protagonist of my own intentions and the spectator of my neighbor’s. The degree of personal freedom whereby I cope with the constraining necessities imposed on my intentions by external circumstances is the negative carbon copy of the degree of necessity whereby I cope with my neighbor’s personal freedom in dealing with his or her own constraints. I consider myself accountable for my actions and emotions in inverse proportion to the constraints imposed on my intentions; I consider myself accountable for my neighbor’s actions and emotions in direct proportion to my ability to affect the constraints imposed on his or her intentions. And I consider my conscious reaction to the stimuli received from my neighbor’s and my external circumstances as efficacious in “steering [my] nervous system,” to adopt William James’s terminology inPrinciples of Psychology, rather than a mere reflection of the causal effects exercised by my brain’s neuronal firings on my actions and decisions.8<br>

Abstract: Describing the affections in moral terms takes note of the fact that they are shaped by cultural influences. It is no stretch for Augustine to describe the emotions, as Paul Lauritzen does, as a “kind of cultural artifact.”
         56Emotions cannot occur outside of a horizon of expectations, a moral world in which our conduct is indexed against a hierarchy of values. The quality of the emotions, says Augustine, lies in “the character of a man’s will. If the will is wrongly directed, the emotions will be wrong; if the will is right, the emotions will not only be blameless, but praiseworthy.”57In this way, emotions are themselves rule‐governed and depend upon a wider system of shared meanings according to which the will directs itself. Emotions are expressions of agency shaped by standards of value, what Charles Taylor calls norms of “strong evaluation.”58Such norms articulate goods toward which persons order their commitments and from which they derive their bases for self‐interpretation.<br>

Abstract: While any discipline will no doubt have a dominant question it seeks to answer, this question, I contend, is embedded in a network of other questions that link and reflexively relate disciplines. Freedom to think beyond the logic of a center has profound ramifications for theological ethics since most of its forms have been dominated by that logic; they have been theocentric, Christocentric, logocentric, or ecclesiocentric in structure and purpose. Yet at the level of knowledge, we need to think of disciplines, and so theological ethics, as multidimensional in shape. As Mary Midgley has noted, “We exist, in fact, as interdependent parts of a complex network, not as isolated items that must be supported in a void. As for our knowledge, it too is a network involving all kinds of lateral links, a system in which the most varied kinds of connection may be relevant for helping us to meet various kinds of questions.”
         32Attending to the debate about humanism and religion as encoded yet intractable perspectives on lived reality is important because it alerts us to the multidimensionality of knowledge and thus the demand to develop disciplines of thought that resist reduction to one form or one center. Any discipline so conceived must clarify lateral links within the network of knowledge and how it brings its resources to bear within the wider field of inquiry. Knowledge is a reflexive space of reasonable claims advanced and redeemed in response to basic questions. These links are important in order to establish the cogency, scope, and validity of a “discipline.”<br>

Abstract: Such diversity inevitably generates interpretive contradictions and makes the author's stated goals—to compare the films' thematic content and form with those of the colonial cinema that preceded it and to use postcolonial film as a barometer for assessing how French collective memory has come to terms with its imperialist history—difficult to achieve. While Eades's painstaking analysis of the continuities and ruptures between colonial and postcolonial cinema is impressive, her contention that the latter “forced recognition of a reality grudgingly accepted by political authorities and the general population” (22) until the mid‐1990s and “called into question imperial ideology in all its dimensions” (203) is less convincing. While the majority of these films do at some level acknowledge the failures and abuses of French imperialism, most also avoid explicit reference to controversial issues and events (most notably, the French army's practice of torture in Algeria) and ignore the subjective experience of colonized peoples, highlighting instead the plight of colonizers caught in morally untenable situations because of the corrupt system that surrounds them. The result, as Eades recognizes, is that the colonized tend to remain little more than stereotypes while audiences are encouraged to identify with the European perspective. In so doing, postcolonial cinema implicitly perpetuates the epistemological prejudices of overtly imperialist films from the 1920s and 1930s.<br>

Abstract: The film object exists differently, or not at all, when kidnapped by consumers and sequestered on their computer desktops. Not only do individuals watch films on PCs at their leisure (stopping and starting at will, sampling chapters, and so on), they watch them on one window among several that may be running simultaneously (including those that hold email messages, the IMDb entry on the film, notes, a blog, and the current weather). Cinema constitutes just one kind of software content available to the powerful Windows operating system and the all‐encompassing PC hardware. Called up on demand or via YouTube, a movie appears on a flat panel, where many windows are displayed—as many as the user chooses, then shuffles, moving them around like cards in a game of solitaire.

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: This volume is something of a companion to Ricoeur’s earlier collection,
      The Just(Chicago, 2000), but positions the question differently. Ricoeur characterizes the aim of the earlier volume as a focused treatment of the relationship between justice as a moral ideal and justice as a system of institutions. “In the present volume, the adjective ‘just’ is traced back to its terminological and conceptual source, as we find it in Plato’s Socratic dialogues” (1). The volume is divided into three parts, titled respectively, “Studies,” “Readings,” and “Exercises.” This tripartite structure is one that appears constantly in Ricoeur's work. The essays in the first section isolate the idea of justice. In this initial section, Ricoeur brings thought to bear on the principal phenomenological structures through which the problematic of justice manifests itself: the necessary distance introduced into the question of justice by the imposition of a rule of justice, the relation of passivity and autonomy in the articulation of the imperative of justice, the paradoxical nature of authority, and the aporia that opens between the reflection of justice as an abstract, transhistorical ideal and justice as a historically conditioned set of institutional practices. The essays in the second section place the idea in the context of thought about justice. The principal figures who come into the discussion here are Kant, Weber, and Charles Taylor. The essays in the third section deal with the ideal of justice in the realm of practical, or regional, ethics; Ricoeur’s primary interests here are legal and medical ethics and their similarities, differences, and relations. In each of these proceeding sections, issues raised in the first section are taken up and dealt with at a progressively less abstract level. There is then a discernible trajectory that holds these essays together, one that might be characterized, without too much oversimplification, as a movement from abstract structuring of~<br>

Abstract: D'Holbach's caveat is essential for understanding the implications of his system for the relationship between person and nature, but also between the transcendent and the immanent. If nature is meant to assume the role once assigned to the divine in Christian theology, it does so in an entirely different manner—not as an all-knowing, all-powerful subject, but as a blind and will-less force. At the same time, the human person is both identified with and in large part reduced to an effect of this force. D'Holbach's abandonment of transcendence in his materialist system thus drastically altered the relationship between God and soul as it was understood in orthodox religion. What had been an exchange between two distinct, albeit unequal persons, was reduced to an arrangement between two objects. The meaning of immanence likewise changed. Once mainline Christian theology began to assert the self's inward transcendence vis-à-vis the world as “masters and possessors of nature” (to cite Descartes), atheist philosophes such as d'Holbach reacted by asserting the immanent power of things to dispossess the self in order to repudiate the concept of divinity that stood behind it. However, this was no mere reversion to the world of “enchantment.” While d'Holbach was momentarily willing to anthropomorphize nature for rhetorical effect, he and Spinoza persistently applied the mechanized organization of the universe to human beings as well. In lieu of the semitranscendent, personified objects of the enchanted universe, one was left with the prospect of a world inhabited by wholly immanent, objectified entities.<br>

Abstract: Consider recent thinking on ritual, music, and persuasion: “The formality, sequence, pattern, and repetition of such musical structures themselves elicit emotional response through their instantiation of ritual. Music thereby creates an emotive ‘proto‐symbolic’ system capable of abstracting both the signals and structure of ritual” (Alcorta and Sosis, “Ritual, Emotion, and Sacred Symbols,” 336–37). “Human use of ritual to conditionally associate emotion and abstractions creates the sacred; it also lies at the heart of symbolic thought” (348–49).<br>

Abstract: In many of Dante's animal similes, the poet/pilgrim, or Beatrice, or angels become that other, share the being of the other, thus following the Franciscan tradition and intimating that, for the duration of the simile at least, what separates the human from the animal in a fixed hierarchy of creatures might be overcome at least poetically via an analogy that cuts off difference and replaces it with similarity in a moment of transcendent immanence or immanent transcendence. Following Emmanuel Levinas's understanding of transcendence, here transcendence finds itself in immanence, as the subject loses itself in the other.
      48This is an insight Dante himself hints at with several reflexive neologisms inParadiso, as, for example, when the pilgrim Dante remarks to Folco of Marseilles, the Provençal poet with whom he converses, that he cannot “inyoumyself” as you “inmeyourself”: “Già non attendere’ io tua dimanda, / s'io m'intuassi, come tu t'inmii” (Surely I should not wait for your request, were I in you, even as you are in me) (Paradiso9.80–81). Both reflexive verbs are neologisms, and as transitive actions require the actor (in this case a pronoun) and the undergoer (the reflexive pronoun) to be filled by one entity, thus overcoming apparent alterities.49Dante the pilgrim makes clear that he cannot overcome that alterity like Folco has, who, as a resident of the heavenly sphere, has surpassed ordinary human binaries. But this becoming the other remains, as in Levinas's ethical system, the ultimate purpose of the pilgrim's journey.50<br>

Abstract: This approach, however, is not altogether new. We must be careful not to presume—as Jasper does—“the impossibility of any systematic theology in a time of the unsystematic and aphoristic” (5). Fragment and system are not mutually exclusive. Aphorism acknowledges the apophatic, and a complex Neoplatonic system informs the negative theology that resonates with many of the essays in this volume. Here, it is encouraging that Jasper, Hass, and Kelly Van Andel all invoke Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Van Andel is correct that Coleridge’s theories of symbol and imagination, as well as his practice as a poet, challenge what often passes for literature and theology by celebrating “open ambiguity rather than closed certitude” (212). Coleridge fails to complete his system—his impossible quest for unity—but he nonetheless articulates (through symbol) a systematic method. To understand this, we must recognize the relation of Coleridge’s symbol to traditional allegory and negative theology via a more careful reading of
      The Statesman’s Manual(London, 1816) that considers (contra Van Andel’s overreliance on Thomas McFarland) the hermeneutic and biblical context of the symbol/allegory distinction in Coleridge’s lay sermon. This is a minor but important adjustment that reinforces the larger claim that the tensional practice of literature and theology can revitalize old truths, for “the renewal of traditions is often accomplished through discomforting processes of radical critique” (2).<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: The treatment of the ancient and modern examples is also somewhat too neat and overly selective. For example, it is definitely appropriate to analyze the relationship between theory and practice in rabbinic Judaism on the basis of Hadot’s analysis of ancient philosophy. But Fisher should have reflected on the interplay of theory and praxis in rabbinic Judaism in light of the Aristotelian tradition, which is utterly and consistently ignored in this book. Similarly, Fisher admits that his analysis of
      Mekhihta of Rabbi Yishmaelis indebted to Max Kadushin’s insightful presentation of rabbinic Judaism as “organismic” system of value concepts (105), but Fisher does not analyze the philosophical basis of Kadushin’s reading, as does Peter Ochs, whose book is cited in the notes but whose analysis is not engaged. The treatment of Rosenzweig also exhibits a penchant for selectivity. To show how his model of Jewish theological practice applies to contemporary debates about Rosenzweig and therefore to contemporary Jewish theology, Fisher singles out two interpreters: Leora Batnitzky (whose interpretation he finds “idiosyncratic” [163]) and Peter Gordon (who is accused of “grossly distor[ting] Rosenzweig’s point” [166]). While Fisher’s own interpretation of Rosenzweig is most suggestive, whether Jewish theological practice is a viable model cannot be decided by showing the limitations of two interpretations of Rosenzweig to the exclusion of all others.<br>

Abstract: But if
      Lear’s emphasis on individual responsibility leaves us without a recognizable political system, it also leaves us without a recognizable ethical system. Though the play thrusts us into the realm of the ethical (l’éthique), this realm does not resolve into an ethics (une éthique).
            Or, to put it another way, the drama does not yield up or yield to a set of general rules capable of determining the proper course of action anterior to or outside of the event. Categorical imperatives cannot tell us what Cordelia ought to do when asked to profess her love, or what Lear ought to do when betrayed by his eldest daughters, or what Edgar ought to do when solicited by his suicidal father. Clearly, these characters must respond to the other, but the quality of their response remains rooted in the moment, deeply infixed in “ripeness” and “feeling” rather than in precepts and rules. With a few notable exceptions (e.g., the treachery of Edmund, the cruelty of Cornwall and Regan), the challenging emotional landscape of this play is not to be navigated by a priori ethical precepts—which is one of the many reasons it feels so Levinasian to me. Whereas someone like Kant envisions ethics as a matter of principle, such that uprightness consists of accepting and enacting impersonal, rational rules, Levinas believes it is unconscionably reductive to regard the other or my relation to him as universal instances or generic abstractions. The other is neither an instance nor an abstraction: he is who he is. Consequently, the ethical experience must be personal and particular, not principled.55
         
            Levinas argues—and I think56
         Learis in broad agreement—that one cannot resort to preconceived imperatives if one is to respond authentically. Rather, what one must do is resign oneself to a thoroughgoing passivity in which responsiveness is determined wholly in the moment, entirely by the other.<br>

Abstract: This does not exclude critique. Conflicts and contesting claims have very often served as triggers for the production of alternate narratives. History, then, would never come in the singular
         
               and tends to be contested and endangered. Like memory it has to be studied as a social and communicative enterprise.35
            
               Critically, from the start on, history—as opposed to mere memory—introduces contingency in order to question the established truths of others. To introduce competition into the legitimizing repository of the past is a powerful instrument, but risky. Thus, some epochs and some cultural realms are more open to historiography than others. Religion in particular does not seem a very likely candidate for history. To the contrary, metahistorical claims, gods outside time and immune against change, that is, traditional authority in a Weberian sense seem to be the hallmarks of religion. Frequently myths tell stories of a distant past that establish binding norms despite the fact that this past is categorically different from today, but yet binding based on this fact. Without the help of emic narratives, it seems difficult to narrate a history for a system of rituals.36
            
               Georg Wissowa’s famous handbook37
            Religion und Kultus der Römertried to build a description of Roman religion on a purely systematic reading of Varro’sAntiquitates.
               A polytheist religion, an embedded religion of a city in particular, is an unlikely example for a strategy that seems typical at best for monotheistic, prophetic religion comprising a theology of a history of salvation. Thus, identifying ancient attempts at giving a history to religion would be momentous.38<br>

Abstract: The working of metaphor in
      The Duchess of Malfiand other early modern tragedies lays the foundation for the genre’s and the culture’s representations of violence. The associative and interpretive aspects of metaphor create discourse communities that understand pain as a meaningful experience with affective consequences beyond physical empathy. As a result, all forms of violence are potentially meaningful or even coercive. InThe Duchess of Malfi, the tortures Ferdinand proposes for his sister and Antonio are made meaningful through metaphor, as he imagines forms of violence that target the aspects of her crime that he finds most repulsive:
            The coal-pit scenario stems from a reaction against the possibility that heaven might bless their marriage, as suggested by the Duchess during the actual
               
         
                  
               I would have their bodies
                  Burn’t in a coale-pit, with the ventage stop’d,
                  That their curs’d smoake might not ascend to Heaven:
                  Or dippe the sheetes they lie in, in pitch or sulphure,
                  Wrap them in’t, and then light them like a match:
                  Or else to boile their Bastard to a cullisse [strong broth],
                  And give’t his leacherous father, to renew
                  The sinne of his backe.

               per verba de presenticontract (1.1.463, 475–76). The burning imagery from both this and the following vision recall the characterization of lust as a fire that consumes an individual, making it appropriate that Ferdinand would use the sheets from their bed as a tool of murder. The murder of the child becomes an indictment of the lust that created it as well as an echo of the ghastly practice of feeding a parent his or her own children seen in Seneca’sThyestesand Shakespeare’sTitus Andronicusas perhaps the ultimate form of revenge.

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: This book about the conversation of philosophy itself connects with a number of conversations current in philosophy and religious studies. For one, Peperzak provides a compelling defense of the claim that philosophy is fundamentally a way of life and not only a scholastic practice of system building. In this, he joins a growing interest among neohumanists and continental thinkers in reviving premodern senses of philosophy as a spiritual practice, drawing off the earlier work of Pierre Hadot and others.<br>

Abstract: 1. A survey of music-historical periodizations of the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, together with comments on the current status of periodistic thinking in musicology in general. It is argued that with respect to European music as a whole, the older sense of "Baroque" lasting until ca. 1750 is untenable; it is better to understand a distinct period ca. 1720-80, centering around the Enlightenment, the galant, the international "system" of Italian opera, and (toward the end) the cult of sensibility. The consequence is that the years before
            andafter 1800 must be understood as a period in their own right.<br>

Author(s): Yehoshua Dani<br>
Abstract: The introduction of entrepreneurial education (EE) in the Israeli education system is discussed in this article as an example of the introduction of new curriculum. We argue that this introduction should be construed as a consequence of major ideological changes in Israel and its education system, a change from collectivist to individualistic values. We open with an analysis of a Ministry of Education publication that introduces the EE program and find that it is loaded with references to Zionist myths. We suggest that relying on references to these myths in promoting EE reflects a need to disguise the discontinuity between the social values behind the new curriculum and the traditional collectivist values of pioneering Zionism. We note that the Israeli programs exercise EE in groups, whereby the responsibility for the new ventures is shared by the group members. We suggest that adopting the group method indicates a compromise between a completely individualistic and competitive approach to entrepreneurship and a collectivist approach to coping with new tasks-which is more in line with traditional Zionist values. We argue that the change of atmosphere from collectivism to individualism is a result of demographic and economic processes that have occurred since the establishment of the Israeli state, and that these processes may be exposed through observing the Israeli youth movements and the public discourse. We believe that the gradual shift from collectivism to individualism is a central factor in explaining the timing of EE's introduction in Israel.<br>

Abstract: Aspects of the Pratyabhijñā philosophical theology for monistic Śaivism of the ninth- and tenth-century Kashmiri thinkers Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta are interpreted in relation to their relevance and pre-sumptiveness to contemporary Western thought. It is claimed that the Pratyabhijñā system elucidates important features of our past and present deliberations about the role of interpretation in experience and provides us with a sound way of arguing for the reality of God.<br>

Author(s): Van Ijzendoorn Carole<br>
Abstract: À une époque où l'on dit des jeunes qu'ils sont dépolitisés, nous nous sommes interrogés sur l'éducation politique des jeunes Québécois. Cet aspect de leur éducation est analysé à partir de la documentation du ministère de l'Éducation et à partir d'entrevues et de questionnaires distribués dans des écoles primaires, secondaires et des Cégeps de la région de Québec. La grande majorité des étudiants du collégial et du secondaire que nous avons interrogés disent s'intéresser à la politique. Par contre, leurs professeurs soutiennent que ces derniers ne s'y intéressent pas d'une façon soutenue. Quoiqu'il en soit, les étudiants ne semblent pas très bien connaître le système politique canadien. Les auteurs de cet article suggèrent d'améliorer l'apprentissage du civisme par des activités de sensibilisation et d'implication dans la vie de l'école. /// Many believe contemporary youth are apolitical. We have chosen to assess this belief by studying the political education of Quebec youth. Ministry of Education documents, and interviews and questionnaires from elementary and secondary schools and CEGEPS of the Quebec City region, showed the great majority of CEGEP and secondary school students claimed to be interested in politics. Their teachers, however, say that student interest is not always sustained. Certainly students do not know the Canadian political system very well. Improved civic education requires that schools introduce pupils to political life and involve them in school life.<br>

Abstract: Foucault, talking of his work with the Groupe d'information de prisons: "When the
prisoners began to speak, they possessed an individual theory of prisons, the penal system,

Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
Issue: i308720<br>
Date: 4 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Jonsson Christer<br>
Abstract: Several recent studies of Soviet foreign policy formation have sought to bring organizational and cognitive considerations to bear on the subject. The article evaluates these perspectives and suggests how future research may, through the use of cognitive methods of analysis, distinguish formally between different conceptualizations of Soviet foreign policy formation, thus permitting a more rigorous empirical examination of the organizational issues involved. A model of inference that accounts for organizational and cognitive links between the Soviet press and Soviet foreign policy formation is also constructed; examples are drawn from the items under review. In conclusion, the article outlines a research strategy for cumulating knowledge about how the Soviet system works, and specifies what the organizational and cognitive frameworks for the study of Soviet foreign policy formation may contribute to such a project.<br>

Author(s): Lemel Yannick<br>
Abstract: Les théories de la modernisation proposées dans les années cinquante et soixante avançaient l'idée que les sociétés convergeaient vers les valeurs modernes et abandonnaient progressivement leurs valeurs traditionnelles. Cette idée de convergence est réexaminée dans cet article, dans le contexte des seules sociétés européennes, à partir de l'exploitation des enquêtes Valeurs. Une série d'échelles d'attitudes sont construites, puis analysées par des techniques multivariées. Deux résultats principaux se dégagent de cette étude. Tout d'abord, il apparaît que, quelle que soit la date ou les pays examinés, les valeurs des Européens se structurent toujours autour d'un axe de traditionalisme. Un tel résultat est évidemment en contradiction avec les thèses, fortement critiquées par ailleurs, de convergence vers la modernité. Ce résultat est aussi l'occasion de réfléchir sur le pendant du traditionalisme -- faut-il l'appeler "modernité"? -- et sur les liens entre les attitudes économiques et les attitudes morales. En second lieu, la religiosité est étroitement liée à cette structuration des valeurs, mais elle oppose principalement les Européens affiliés à une religion quelle qu'elle soit aux sans-religion, plutôt que -- comme on l'imagine souvent -- les catholiques aux protestants. Au total, la tension entre tradition et modernité reste au cœur du système de valeurs des sociétés européennes. /// The modernization theories developed in the 1950s and 60s put forward the idea that societies were converging toward modern values and gradually abandoning their traditional values. Using data from the Values surveys, the article reexamines the convergence idea in the context of European societies. A set of attitude scales was constructed, then analyzed using multivariate techniques. Analysis yielded two main results. First, regardless of date or country examined, Europeans' values seem still to be structured around a traditionalism axis. This result obviously runs counter to converge~<br>

Article Title: A Principle of Text Coherence in Indonesian Languages<br>
Publisher: The Association for Asian Studies, Inc.<br>
Issue: i309685<br>
Date: 8 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Wurm Richard<br>
Abstract: The logic of Indonesian subjectless and tenseless expressions appears to have cultural implications, just as the use of tenses in English scientific writing entails much more than grammatical minutiae. A. L. Becker has pointed out that tense in English functions in a "coherence system" that pervades and transcends grammar. A parallel coherence system is suggested for Indonesian, based not on tense but on topic. Paul Ricoeur's distinction between LANGUAGE and DISCOURSE is the basis of the claim that Indonesian sentences cohere on the bond between grammatical subject and discourse topic. Examples are drawn from a number of contexts that call forth passive sentences in Indonesian. The article concludes on another suggestion by Becker. The Indonesian topic may be part of a larger deictic category of person, which may be related in discourse to orientation in space--both physical and social--of participants in the speech event. If this suggestion is correct, then the contrast between English and Indonesian coherence systems may be found in the opposition tense/time vs. person/space.<br>

Article Title: When an Authoritarian State Victimizes the Nation: Transitional Justice, Collective Memory, and Political Divides<br>
Publisher: M. E. Sharpe<br>
Issue: i20628279<br>
Date: 4 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Curry Jane L.<br>
Abstract: In this article, the author uses the concept of "transitional justice"—defined as the way societies or groups elect to deal with the past as they establish a new system—to examine the manner in which political behavior in postauthoritarian states both manifests and modifies aggressor—victim memory. Comparing the cases of transition from authoritarianism to democracy in South Africa, El Salvador, and Poland, she contrasts the positive outcomes of the open confrontation with "silent memory" in South Africa with the failure of Poland and El Salvador, in different ways, to deal conclusively and consistently with the past. In the case of Poland, the initial silence turned the past into a political football that soured the citizenry on political participation. In the case of El Salvador, the author posits that "boomerang justice" stimulated by outside interests has split the population and alienated both sides from effective political action. The article thereby advances an interpretation of political behavior as a locus for collective memory in nation-states, with the conclusion for postauthoritarian states that transitional justice can free political behavior from the trappings of the past, but only if aggressors and victims confront one another and move toward reconciliation.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23013006<br>
Date: 5 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Gelbart Matthew<br>
Abstract: The Clash's London Calling was released just at the moment when the British punk movement seemed to be imploding. From the earliest reviews, it was received as a musical masterpiece that drew on many styles while still managing to be `punk' in some sense. This article argues that London Calling normalized punk, allowing it to be more than an event: punk could henceforth be assimilated into traditional musical discourse and aesthetics. As a careful balancing act between punk street-cred and mainstream musical values, London Calling allowed a double reading. Punk fans could find in it what they sought: anti-establishment anger and at times a messy, disdainful approach to conventional musicianship. At the same time critics and listeners who had come since the late sixties to assimilate rock into a Romantic (or post-Romantic) system of `art' values could find in it what they sought: stylistic growth, organic coherence, originality, and even a `universal' narrative of struggle, triumph, and redemption played out across the album. It is possible to isolate not only a story, but musical connections between the songs (keys, recurrent motifs, and topoi) all laid out in a logical manner. However, unlike concept albums in the seventies' progressive rock style against which punk reacted, London Calling often calls attention away from its musical coherence, and even its textual coherence, rather than towards it—such as by the last-minute addition of a bonus track that disrupts the narrative and key schemes established earlier. The ease with which the album can be praised in established musical language should not completely obscure its potential (and the general potential of punk) to undercut and confront conventional musical discourse.<br>

Abstract: This article breaks the poetic code in Agnon's A Guest for a Night by deciphering its system of lexical and semantic signs, which link this novel with the Talmud in numerous ways. The article reaches two conclusions: (1) Agnon did more than integrate traditional motifs and stories in this novel — he used agadic and halachic material to relink Modern Hebrew literature with the Talmud. (2) This novel is nothing less than an old-new key to the Talmud which Agnon wrought by blending its language and that of Modern Hebrew literature into a new style.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this essay is to define the nature of the metaphor in Berdiczewski's novel Miriam (1921). For this purpopse I examine the short story included in Miriam about the scholar who was studying a book entitled The Gate of Heaven. Comparing this story with other literary texts which present a hero who stands in a mystical or philosophical sense before the gate of Heaven illuminates the historic-generative essence of the above metaphor. Using the theoretical and methodological system developed by three scholars (P. Ricuer, D. Schon and B. Indurkyia) to follow the metaphorical process, I attempt to show that Berdiczewski's metaphors are not only figures of speech; they form our essential cultural and historical cognition (tolada in Hebrew). I therefore suggest applying to Berdiczewski's metaphor the form 'historic-generative metaphor.'<br>

Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23548426<br>
Date: 1 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): ALBINUS LARS<br>
Abstract: The aim is to show how formations of discourse can be seen as the subject matter for the historian of religions, drawing on structuralist and hermeneutic approaches. Although these may differ on important theoretical and methodological issues, I find the way in which they correspond, namely by pointing to the topic of discourse as their field of investigation, even more important. In this article a discourse is understood as a framework of communication, and the focus is laid upon religious discourse as a special kind of authorization. In ancient Greece, for example, "authors" such as Homer and Orpheus were the authorities of two different discursive traditions. The analysis of discourse can present us with a view of how certain frames of communication were interacting by means of contest, and how, eventually, it was the very strategy of authorization that was contested. Hence, what has often been seen as a paradigmatic shift from mythos to logos could more fruitfully be viewed from a discursive angle than from a perspective of different mentalities. Discourse analysis, as presented in this article, is a way of coming to terms with the process of transformation by regarding dynamic properties of communication, that is, as interrelated strategies on connected levels of system and event.<br>

Article Title: "I DON'T DO SYSTEMS": AN INTERVIEW WITH CLIFFORD GEERTZ<br>
Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23548454<br>
Date: 1 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): GEERTZ CLIFFORD<br>
Abstract: I had the honor of interviewing Clifford Geertz at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, USA, on October 18, 2000. The interview focused on Geertz's theoretical conceptions, the tradition on which he draws, the critique he has encountered, and on interpretive anthropology's future development. Of particular interest was the clarification of his much-debated method, his definition of symbol and his famous definition of religion as a cultural system. Geertz emphasizes his attempt to exercise an applied pragmatic phenomenological and hermeneutical method without any general theory (or philosophy) of meaning, phenomenology, or culture. He maintains that he only has a conceptual framework inspired by different scholars, which nevertheless has consistent focus and perspective, i.e., meaning and symbol. In relationship to this, Geertz defines his symbol within the Peircean semiotic tradition. Therefore, the term symbol is understood as a sign (an index for example), which becomes a symbol via a cultural interpretation. Furthermore, his definition of religion as a cultural system is, in his view, a non-essentialistic definition and therefore is not—as Talal Asad claims—ethnocentric. Although it is Geertz's opinion that interpretive anthropology has been influenced by postmodernism, he predicts that interpretive anthropology's future development will be in reasonable continuity with its past. In my closing comments I tentatively suggest that Geertz may have a theory of interpretation because of his definition of the symbol, his unavoidable assumptions, and his unique method, which has the capacity of grasping the cultural specific in a general way.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo consiste numa análise da noção zubiriana de mentalidade. Começa por descrever a razão como busca para descobrir a estrutura da realidade. Esta busca requer um método que inclua um sistema de referência, que é o seu ponto de partida no sentido de sugerir hipóteses e teorias que expliquem a realidade. O sistema de referência deriva da transformação do campo de realidade. Esta transformação, que não segue uma via única, depende da "mentalidade" dos que procuram a realidade profunda. Em Zubiri, o conceito de "mentalidade" é polissémico. Existe uma "mentalidade estrutural e intrínseca", uma "mentalidade situacional extrínseca" e um "horizonte mental". Neste artigo estudam-se as três mentalidades e a sua relevância na constituição do sistema de referência e na elaboração de hipóteses e teorias. Finalmente, o artigo analisa a relevância destas mentalidades para compreender os contributos da investigação interdisciplinar e os seus desafios. The following paper is an analysis of Zubiri's notion of mentality. It starts by describing reason as a quest to uncover the structure of reality. This quest requires a method that includes a system of reference, which is its point of departure in the sense of suggesting hypotheses and theories that explain reality. The system of reference results from a transformation of the field of reality. This transformation, which does not follow a unique path, depends on the "mentality" of those who seek to deepen reality. In Zubiri the concept "mentality" is polysemic. There is a "structural and intrinsic mentality", an "extrinsic situational mentality" and a "mental horizon". The three of them and their relevance in the constitution of the system of reference and the elaboration of hypotheses and theories are studied. Finally the paper analyzes the relevance of these mentalities to understand the contributions of interdisciplinary research and its challenges.<br>

Abstract: À ceux qui ont pu s'étonner de l'estimation globalement positive de la phrénologie par Auguste Comte, les historiens et les philosophes des sciences ont pu opposer des arguments épistémologiques et méthodologiques convaincants, qui permettent de rendre raison de l'engouement comtien pour une entreprise souvent considérée aujourd'hui comme irrémédiablement pseudo-scientifique. Pourtant, il existe d'autres motivations, de nature politique ou — comme Comte le dirait lui-même — sociologique, qui nous paraissent pouvoir expliquer cet engouement mais qui n'ont pas jusqu'ici reçu la même attention. En effet, la « physiologie phrénologique » fournit à l'édifice comtien la base d'une authentique « théorie de la nature humaine » à partir de laquelle penser l'organisation ou la réorganisation des sociétés occidentales. Ce rôle crucial dévolu à la phrénologie n'est quant à lui que l'illustration d'une spécificité encore plus générale du système comtien, à savoir le rapport privilégié, dans l'ordre de la connaissance, qui unit sociologie et biologie. Or, pour bien saisir toute la difficulté du problème du rapport biologie/sociologie chez Comte, il est éclairant de considérer la manière dont il s'articule dans le cas précis de la question de l'égalité des sexes. Ce que nous aimerions mettre en évidence, en nous appuyant plus particulièrement sur la correspondance de Comte et John Stuart Mill lue à la lumière du Cours de philosophie positive, c'est la manière dont la biologie, et en particulier la phrénologie, œuvre de manière souterraine au cœur même de l'argument sociologique de Comte en faveur de l'assujettissement des femmes et les conséquences potentielles de cette « contamination » biologique. To those who have been puzzled by the globally positive assessment Auguste Comte made of phrenology, historians and philosophers of science have responded by offering convincing epistemological and methodological arguments, which enable one to suggest a rationale for his interest in wh~<br>

Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23653923<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Taylor Betsy<br>
Abstract: The global justice movement reveals a diverse array of emergent publics striving politically for a sustainable world. Working partly from John Dewey, we try to illuminate democratic grounds for knowledge and action in these endeavors. We begin by situating Dewey's ideas in the politics of American history, especially historian John Diggins' countervailing approach to issues of authority, knowledge and opinion. Diggins, against Robert Westbrook and others, contends that Dewey's philosophy of politics chased radical democratic illusions, whereas he might have learned from Charles S. Peirce to uphold the boundary between professional communities and other entities including democratic publics. Dewey saw no democratic alternative to harness the political energy of ordinary people. We argue that Dewey had come to understand that a corporate state system of political economy had come to engulf both the liberal democratic polity and the professions. Dewey's political challenge to the professions and his illumination of the aesthetic ecology of democratic publics prefigure a democratic republican alternative that opens up a new basis for participation in the global justice movement confronting, among other obstacles, a transnational corporate state based in the USA. A Marxist-progressivist notion of the ongoing socialization of markets by corporate capitalism too often reinforces an anti-Populist intellectual sensibility that is coupled with, whether wittingly or not, either a social-democratic elitism or a revolutionary vanguardism. Globalization struggles need, on the contrary, a pragmatic vision of democratic publics instituting a true diversity of policies assuring a world-in-common. The fight for public spaces in the treacherous politics of civil society and global consumerism is a struggle against subjectivization. The fact that corporate state elitism, in the U.S. context, feeds on a rightist version of nationaism does not mean we can junk the history of democratic s~<br>

Abstract: The myth of Śunaḥśepa (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 7.13-18) constitutes a primary acknowledgment by brahmanic tradition of the existence of peoples living outside of the varṇa system. The principal themes of this account served as the grounds for a socio-religious ideology that continued to develop throughout the history of brahmanic literature. This ideology established an opposition between the center—authority, sacrifice and cows of the brahmin Vasiṣtḥa; and the periphery—antinomian power and asceticism of the non-brahmin Viśvāmitra, and haunt of marginals and their dogs. This ideology breaks down in late variants of this myth, in which the expanded universe of bhakti can even encompass the excluded. Le mythe de Śunaḥśepa (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 7.13-18) constitue un premier constat par la tradition brahmanique de l'existence de peuples hors du système des varṇa. A partir des éléments principaux de ce récit, une idéologie socioreligieuse ne cessera de s'élaborer à travers l'histoire de la littérature hindoue. Cette idéologie opposera au centre, à l'autorité et au sacrifice du brahmane Vasiṣtḥa vivant par ses vaches, la périphérie : « chaos » dominé par le pouvoir antinomien de l'ascète non brahmane Viśvāmitra, où les exclus vivent par leurs chiens. Dans des variantes tardives de ce mythe, il y a un effritement de cette idéologie, du fait que l'univers élargi de la bhakti englobe même les exclus.<br>

Abstract: Centrée sur l'élaboration d'un système de la religion à partir des sources du judaïsme, la dernière pensée de Hermann Cohen repose sur le concept de fils de Noé. Avec lui, Cohen réfute la thèse de Spinoza sur la nature politique de la loi juive, montrant que non seulement elle préserve la pureté du monothéisme, mais pose les fondements du droit naturel moderne. Articulant après Maïmonide les notions d'étranger, de résident et de fils de Noé, la Religion de la raison construit un lien systématique entre les concept d'autrui et d'humanité universelle. Elle ouvre ainsi l'espace où s'inscriront de manières différentes Franz Rosenzweig, Leo Strauss ou Emmanuel Lévinas. Focused on the drawing up of a system of religion by the sources of judaism, Cohen's last philosophy is based on the concept of the Sons of Noah. With it, he disproves Spinoza's thesis about Jewish law's political nature. He shows that not only this law preserves the purity of monotheism, but also gives the foundation for modern natural right. Because Cohen, after Maimonides, builts an articulation between the notions of the stranger, the resident alien and the sons of Noah, Religion of the Reason promotes a systematic link between the concepts of the other man and the universal hunanity. It opens the way for the philosophy of Rosenzweig, Strauss, or Levinas.<br>

Abstract: Confrontant les thèses des anthropologues qui ont tendance à voir dans la mafia une structure plurielle, informelle, dispersée sur le territoire, très dépendante de chaque chef de cellule mafieuse (cosche) et se regroupant à des fins pratiques (task oriented), et les thèses des juges palermitains qui ont tendance à considérer la mafia comme une organisation centralisée de type Cosa nostra, l'auteur montre qu'une analyse dynamique permet de dépasser la confrontation. Ainsi en étudiant les capacités d'adaptation de l'organisation et les différents vecteurs qu'elle peut utiliser (violence marché), il déplace les enjeux du débat et repense le phénomène mafieux dans son rapport à l'État en suivant une problématique weberienne. Haciendo una comparación de las tésis de los antropólogos que tienen la tendencia a ver en la mafia una estructura plural, informal, dispersa en el territorio, muy dependiente de los capos de las células mafiosas, (cosche) y que se reagrupan con objetivos prácticos (task oriented), con las tesis de los jueces palermitanos, inclinados a considerar a la mafia como una organización centralizada de tipo Cosa nostra, el autor muestra que un análisis dinámico permite sobrepasar la confrontación. Asi, estudiando la capacidad de adaptación de la organización y de los diferentes vectores (violencia-mercado) desplaza los terminos del debate, hace el re-examen del fenómeno mafioso en relación con el Estado, siguiendo las pautas de una problemática weberiana. Confronting (comparing) on the one hand anthropologists thesis who have a tendency to see in mafia a plural structure, informal, spread out on the territory, very depending upon their local chiefs (cosche) and meeting for task oriented, and on the other hand the palermitan judges who have a certain tendency to consider mafia as a Cosa Nostra centralized organization type, the author shows that a dynamic analysis allows to go further than confrontation.

Abstract: In order to manage our daily lives, we make many decisions based on empirical evidence derived from instrumental action. At the other extreme, we are often attracted by a so-called postmodern solution that invites us to make arbitrary choices. In the education system, the pressing dilemma should not be a choice between standards of competence or unthinking relativism, but how to take action towards intercultural tolerance. Establishing a small teacher training course for a group of British Muslims has shown that communicative action informed by understanding can be disabled by the instrumentality of positivist frameworks, such as those used by government inspectors. In philosophy, Ricoeur offers a provisional dialectic of hope that can be used to show why neither positivist methods, rational analytic philosophy, postmodernity nor any one belief system for interpreting the world should be allowed to exert hegemonic control. The ethicopractical philosophy of Ricoeur also offers a reconstructive view of reality that helps us to rehabilitate belief in human nature and encourages us to seek solutions to conflicts of interpretation in understanding others. It is applied, in this instance, to project work with Muslim women in the UK, in which an ontology of action shows the power of working collaboratively towards an understanding of oneself as another.<br>

Author(s): Schleicher Marianne<br>
Abstract: Responding to the ethical and performative call of Judith Butler not to propagate the sex- and gender-related violence of the imbedded discourse that we study, this article inquires into the discursive strategies of Jewish scripture by analysing how it orchestrates certain norms of sex and gender and makes them serve the overall aim of securing cultural survival. Following this, it traces reflections on persons of ambiguous or indeterminate sex from rabbinic to modern Judaism so as to inquire into the rabbinic dependency on scripture when non-conforming individuals challenge its bipolar sex and gender system. Finally, the article considers if scripture, as suggested by Butler, can play a subversive role in how we attend to non-conforming others today. To do so, the author's distinction between hermeneutical and artifactual uses of scripture is presented to evaluate the extent to which modern Jews and non-Jews are able to influence their own representations of sex and gender and thus liberate themselves from the normativity implied by scriptural discourse.<br>

Abstract: Religious echoes are resonant with race and gender in Beloved, raising questions best posed in a psychoanalytic register. Freud's sceptical questioning of religion is important for a consideration of the gendered, raced, and specifically religious subjectivities explored in the novel, as is Lacan's paradigm of entry into the symbolic order. Reading the religious in Beloved in light of both Freud and Lacan, and reading the poetically evocative Word in all three, I locate within the novel a profound ambivalence, an awareness of the limitations of language under the Name of the Father and the necessity—even potential good—of imagining within its system.<br>

Abstract: Finke, pp. 41-42: "In the Middle Ages, torture was not regarded simply as a form of
punishment. It was, as Foucault has shown, a technique and a ritual, a semiotic system which 'must
mark the victim.' Torture inscribed on the victim's body the 'signs' of the ruler's power. It was
one of the most visible displays of that power, an art, 'an entire poetic' that competed with other
visual displays of theocratic rule. The marking of the victim's body signifies the power that
punishes. "In the 'excesses' of torture, a whole economy of power is invested". In her excesses,
the mystic becomes at once both torturer and victim. This, it seems to me, is the whole point. The
mystic's pain - her inflicting of wounds upon herself — grants her the authority to speak and be
heard."<br>

Abstract: The curriculum for biblical studies in the Israeli public high school system is designated by the official program of the ministry of education to be taught along essentially critical lines based on historical-philological research tools. The aim of this article is to expound on the cultural consequences and hermeneutical problems which are a direct product of this prescription, with emphasis on three major points: first, the fact that the official program of studies has completely disregarded contemporary hermeneutical approaches; second, the import of this hermeneutic deficiency given a literal reading of the biblical text which is meager in descriptive details but is hermeneutically saturated; third, the cultural status of the Bible class as sole agent of socialization pertaining to Jewish knowledge in Israeli public high-schools.<br>

Abstract: Clifford Geertz définit l'idéologie comme une sorte de carte symbolique, un ensemble d'images évocatrices
(suasive images) fournissant à l'individu un ensemble de croyances, de récits historiques et de valeurs qui l'aident
à trouver sa place dans la société et à s'orienter dans ses actions. L'idéologie constitue une grille de lecture et de
compréhension du monde extrêmement séduisante parce qu'elle tire son pouvoir de persuasion de sa capacité à
rendre compte des aspects de la réalité sociale qui produisent un décalage entre les valeurs des individus et leurs
pratiques telles qu'elles sont motivées par leurs intérêts. Clifford Geertz, « Ideology as a Cultural System »,

Abstract: Les années 1960 apparaissent comme un moment de profonde remise en question du système scolaire (particulièrement du modèle secondaire), tant du fait des réformes initiées par les premiers gouvernements de la Cinquième République que de la dynamique des débats publics de cette décennie, couronnée par le colloque d'Amiens, en mars 1968. Or l'étude systématique du discours tenu dans la presse sur ce sujet montre que l'affichage zélé d'un consensus apparent masque de profondes incertitudes quant au modèle scolaire qu'il faudrait inventer en remplacement du système présenté comme unanimement condamné. On constate également que ce large accord ignore l'importance des pesanteurs conservatrices, qui, même marginalisées, peuvent facilement alimenter des doutes, qui ne manqueront pas de s'exprimer si une situation conflictuelle vient à se présenter. The 1960's appear as a moment when real doubts concerning the French School system (particularly the traditional Secondary model) came to light, partly because of the reforms initiated by the first governments of the Fifth Republic but also as a result of the state of the discussions arising over that decade, and coming to a head at the colloquium held in Amiens in March 1968. However, the systematic study of the discourse held in the newspapers about this subject reveals that the zealous show of an apparent consensus masked deep uncertainties relating to the school model which needed to be invented to replace the widely condemned system. We also notice that this broad agreement ignored the importance of conservative obstacles which, even when marginalised, could easily fuel doubts, and would certainly be expressed as soon as a conflictual situation arose.<br>

Author(s): Seerveld Calvin<br>
Abstract: Cf. Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative (1985), translated by Kathleen Blamey and David
Pellauer (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988) 3:184-85, 310 η.3· 1 am uncertain as
to precisely what Ricoeur implies with his statement: "What is surprising is that this inter-
lacing of fiction and history in no way undercuts the project of standing-for belonging to
history, but instead helps to realize it; 0:186). Giambattista Vico's fanciful division of
universal history into four periods, associated with the tropes of metaphor, synecdoche,
metonymy, and irony (in Scienze Nuova (1744, third édition), par. 400-411), is the
apparent source of this peculiar categorial framework adopted by Kenneth Burke and
(altered) Northrop Frye. Hayden White claims these tropes are the 'transformational
system built into Foucault's conception of the succession of forms of the human sciences,
even though Foucault appears not to know that it is there.'! Cf. Hayden V. White, 'Foucault
Decoded: Notes from Underground', in History and Theory 12 (1973): 45. This judgment
may apply to Hayden White himself.<br>

Abstract: In human beings in a vegetative condition the cerebral cortex and important parts of the
limbic system are switched off. The brainstem (and basic nuclei) however are intact. These
patients are in permanent coma, and are unconscious, although they can as a rule breathe and
swallow without mechanical help. In other words, these coma patients have an intact 'reptilian
brain', but do not function in the perceptive sense.<br>

Abstract: I concur with Shah and Farr (2011) vs. Obama. First comes a quote from President
Obama, then their commentary: '"What our deliberative, pluralistic democracy demands is that
the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal, rather than religion-specific,
values." Religious motivation is fine; just don't make your religious views the basis for public
policy. But democracy "demands" no such thing. Democracy is a system that adjudicates
contending claims.'<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de François Laplanche prend délibérément pour objet la longue durée : l'exégèse biblique entretient un rapport constant au Texte originel et l'historien ne peut s'exonérer de connaître les interprétations patristiques et médiévales de la Bible. L'histoire d'une pratique de lecture savante est ici réintégrée à l'intérieur de l'ensemble de la culture, de la société et des événements d'une période donnée. Prenant pour centre d'analyse les théologiens calvinistes de Saumur vers 1620-1670, François Laplanche montre que, tandis que leur système demeure arrimé à l'orthodoxie réformée, ils la minent et conduisent à une désacralisation de l'Écriture par un double éloignement : éloignement de l'origine puisque la disqualification de l'Ancien Testament le transforme en objet d'histoire; éloignement de la fin des temps par la récusation catégorique du prophétisme et du millénarisme. The work of François Laplanche deliberately deals with long duration: biblical exegesis maintains a constant relationship to the original Text and the historian cannot exempt himself from knowing the patristic and medieval interpretations of the Bible. The history of scholarly reading is here reinstated within the culture, society and events of a given period. Taking as the center of his analysis the Calvinist theologians of Saumur around 1620-1670, François Laplanche shows that, while their system remains linked to reformed orthodoxy, they are undermining it and go towards a desecration of Scripture via a double remoteness: remoteness from the origin since the disqualification of the Old Testament transforms it into an historical object; remoteness from the end of time via the adamant disqualification of prophecy and millenarianism. La obra de François Laplanche toma deliberadamente como objeto la larga duración: la exégesis bíblica establece una relación constante con el Texto original y el historiador no puede eximirse de conocer las interpretaciones patrísticas y medievales de la Biblia.~<br>

Abstract: This essay applies Roman Jakobson's binary system of rhetoric to the representation of death in Women in Love. While Lawrence's novel harks back to traditional configurations of death as metaphoric event, geared to transformations, it also anticipates contemporary conceptions of death as metonymic event, stripped of meaning and devoid of transcendental resonance.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i342774<br>
Date: 3 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Woolfolk Craig J.<br>
Abstract: This article explores the meanings that consumption experiences hold for professional working mothers engaged in the culturally prominent lifestyle known as "juggling." A discussion is given to prior research documenting the cultural and historical processes that gave rise to this lifestyle pattern. These analyses suggest that "jugglers" of the baby boom generation have been socialized in a common system of conflicting cultural ideals, beliefs, and gender ideologies. A hermeneutic research approach is used to explicate the emic consumer meanings that arise in relation to the participants' salient life concerns and their sense of personal history. An etic framework is then derived that further analyzes these perceptions in the context of issues related to the social construction of feminine identities and cultural conceptions of motherhood. The conceptual and methodological implications of the emic and etic frameworks for consumer research are discussed.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses human resources management (HRM) systems and practices in a large multinational management consultancy firm. The firm invests considerable resources in HRM, and is frequently praised by employees for its accomplishments in hiring, developing, and promotion. However, this general faith in HRM does not align particularly well with employees' experiences and perceptions of the specific HRM practices in the firm. The paper critically interprets the meaning and the functions of the HRM system and the beliefs supporting it. The paper suggests a reinterpretation of HRM systems and practices based on a cultural-symbolic perspective. It introduces the concepts of excess ceremonialism, identity projects, and aspirational control to highlight and interpret the significance of organizational symbolism in accounting for the role of HRM systems and practices, and the various effects of HRM systems and practices on employee identity and compliance.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i25472056<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Ongstad Sigmund<br>
Abstract: The article investigates in the first part critically dyadic and essentialist understanding of signs and utterances in mathematics and mathematics education as opposed to a triadic view. However even Peircean semiotics, giving priority to triadic, dynamic sign may face challenges, such as explaining the sign as a pragmatic act and how signs are related to context. To meet these and other hurdles an explicit communicational, pragmatic and triadic view, found in parts of the works of Bühler, Bakhtin, Habermas, and Halliday, is developed. Two basic principles are combined and established in a theoretical framework. Firstly, whenever uttering, there will exist in any semiotic sign system, dynamic reciprocity and simultaneity between expressing through form, referring to content, and addressing as an act. Secondly, meaning will be created by the dynamics between given and new in utterances and between utterances and contextual genres. The latter principle explains how meaning merge in communication dynamically and create the basis for a discursive understanding of semiosis and hence even learning at large. The second part exemplifies each of the three main aspects and the dynamics of utterance and genre and given and new by excerpts from a textbook in mathematics education. The concept 'positioning', in use for operationalisation, is explained in relation to main principles of the framework. The article ends focusing crucial implications for validation when moving from a dyadic to a triadic understanding of mathematics and mathematics education.<br>

Author(s): Candler G. G.<br>
Abstract: Alberto Guerreiro Ramos's intellectual trajectory is analyzed to show his permanent concern with the condition of contemporary humanity. Two moments in his trajectory are specifically addressed. In the first, under the strong influence of Christian intellectual thought, the category of human person was most important to him. In the second moment he sought to demonstrate autonomy from those earlier influences, secularized his thought, and coined the expression Parenthetical Man, which was central to his criticism of the social sciences and especially of organizational theory. From this he proposed his theory of social system delimitation. From this point of view, it is possible to affirm that Guerreiro Ramos's sociology is predominantly antropocentric, in other words, Ramos takes man as the main reference in his design of social systems.<br>

Abstract: In this updated and revised version of his 2008 Society for Business Ethics presidential address, Richard Nielsen documents the characteristics and extent of the 2007–2009 economic crisis and analyzes how the ethics issues of the economic crisis are structurally related to a relatively new form of capitalism, high-leverage finance capitalism. Four types of high-leverage finance capitalism are considered: hedge funds; private equity-leveraged buyouts; high-leverage, subprime mortgage banking; and high-leverage banking. The structurally related problems with the four types of high-leverage finance capitalism converged in something of a perfect economic storm. Explanations for the crisis are offered in the context of the type of the high-leverage finance capitalism system that permitted and facilitated the economic crisis. Ethics issues and potential reforms are considered that may be able to mitigate the destructive effects of what Schumpeter referred to as the "creative destructive" effects of evolutionary forms of capitalism while realizing the Aristotelian economic ideal of creating wealth in such a way as to make us better people and the world a better place.<br>

Author(s): Scheuch Erwin K.<br>
Abstract: First of all an overview is presented of the development in the social sciences that led to postmodernism. The starting point for this is the modernity that was under the influence of Parsons after the second World War. It extended to the Third World mainly in the context of development research. Since the end of the 1970s the contributions of two German scientists, Niklas Luhmann and Jürgen Habermas, have received international recognition. During this time the first critical voices concerning the modernist theories were heard. Among ideas opposing these theories the approaches should be named first, which the author calls "post industrial". To these he counts primarily the analysis of the modern socio-economic system by Daniel Bell and the studies of the "post-material personality" by Ronald Inglehart. Research on the change of values in modern societies should be named in the same context. However, "post-industrial" should not be confused with "post-modern". The origin of the latter term from the "culture scene" is explained. The language of the post-modernists can be viewed as their characteristic, as well as the attempts of deconstruction imprinted by Derrida. Ever since Lyotard the strong bond between the name and the named object within the language has been questioned. Therefore, Jean Baudrillard is correct in noting a loss in the sense of orientation of the modern human being. For example, the works of two post-modernists, Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck, are discussed in detail, after which the author concludes: "That is the most important meaning of postmodernity: as a symbol for the weakened autonomy of the sciences and arts, as a lack for the support of sciences in culture and politics". Nevertheless one can observe a return to rationality in recent years.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines the linkages among the ideological, political, and economic dimensions of the world-system by looking at changes in the publication of two types of utopian novels in the United States. We argue that positive and negative visions of the future (eutopian and dystopian literature, respectively) can be treated as aspects of the ideological dimension of the world-system. As part of such an interrelated system, the volume of utopias should change in response to periods of crisis and stability in the political, economic, and cultural dimensions of the system. A time-series analysis indicates that both types of utopian literature are affected by changing conditions of the world-system. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that the world-system perspective represents a promising approach for the study of ideological change.<br>

Abstract: Une longue série de détournements d'avions et d'explosions en vol accompagnent l'histoire de l'aviation civile. Comment peut-on rendre compte de ce qui est thématisé par les acteurs comme une «menace» à la fois insaisissable et persistante? Comment procède-t-on à la «mise en sécurité» d'un aéroport? L'article propose une description de la prévention du terrorisme aéroportuaire comme un dispositif de tri censé, par la vigilance, permettre le filtrage des personnes et des objets potentiellement dangereux. Pour les autorités, confrontées à un adversaire adoptant les habits de la normalité pour se dissimuler, et faisant, par là même, planer un doute sur sa présence, exercer le soupçon apparaît à la fois comme une nécessité, dans la mesure où il peut permettre d'empêcher un attentat, et un risque, dans le fait que le soupçon peut facilement apparaître comme arbitraire. L'une des réponses apportées à ce dilemme est à chercher dans le design du dispositif: en inscrivant le double impératif – assurer la sécurité sans mettre en cause les libertés publiques – dans sa matérialité et dans ses procédures, la contradiction, sans être toujours entièrement levée, tend néanmoins à être désamorcée. Cette configuration ne manque pas de soulever des interrogations concernant la sociologie de la menace où le soupçon est généralement traité uniquement du point de vue du risque d'arbitraire. The history of civil aviation has been accompanied by a long series of hijackings and in-flight explosions. How are we to account for something that the actors themselves refer to as an elusive yet constant threat? How does one go about "securing" an airport? The article proposes to describe airport terrorism prevention as a sorting device that is supposed to filter out potentially dangerous people and objects through vigilance. Airport authorities are faced with an adversary who takes on ordinary habits to conceal himself and thereby generates doubts about his presence. For these authorities, exercis~<br>

Abstract: The critique of these bourgeois values was developed by writers after Freud, particu-
larly by Marcuse. From the latter's perspective, Freud's concept of the super-ego is anachro-
nistic: in modernity no genuine individuation and autonomy are acquired by the institution of
the super-ego, since the father and other close figures are no longer significant in forming this
psychic agency. 'Under the rule of economic, political, and cultural monopolies', Marcuse
writes, 'the formation of the mature super-ego seems to skip the stage of individuation: the
generic atom becomes directly a social atom. The repressive organization of the instinct
seems to be collective, and the ego seems to be prematurely socialized by a whole system of
extra-familial agents and agencies' (p. 97). This understanding of the super-ego and of the
resultant 'surplus repression' leads Marcuse to demand radical reorganization of social and
economic institutions in a manner that differs from Freud' s cautiousness and adherence to the
bourgeois order. See Marcuse, Eros and Civilization.<br>

Abstract: Through the experience of some ethnographic fields between France and Italy, Tuscany and the Alps, this paper reflects upon the potential of oral history and biography both as cognitive sources and as heritage assets contributing to the processes of improving the cultural values. In particular, we try to clarify the relationship between regional research projects, exhibitions and archiving processes of the sources of ethnographic research. This in relation to the development of new technologies including the web and to the social and cognitive potential use of oral sources in the capitalization and sharing of research materials with cultural communities and within their possible uses for the scientific community. What can become an anthropological interview once recorded, stored and catalogued? What is the potential of these audio recordings and their written versions within projects of participatory museography? How can the web offer new opportunities to those sources by including them in a global system of dialogue between archives? This view changes the responsibilities and possibilities of the researcher producer of sources and collector of voices, engaging him in a quite different consideration of his work to the benefit of societal projects.<br>

Abstract: The past decade has brought advanced information technologies, which include electronic messaging systems, executive information systems, collaborative systems, group decision support systems, and other technologies that use sophisticated information management to enable multiparty participation in organization activities. Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose adaptive structuration theory (AST) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. AST examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of AST, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system (GDSS). A GDSS is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the GDSS is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied. We begin by positioning AST among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to GDSS use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of AST. We outline an analytic strategy for applying AST principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of AST is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization r~<br>

Abstract: Anthropologists have overlooked the importance of the metaphor in human culture. Core etaphors can help us identify ultimate cosmic constructs underlying a given social or religious world view. But, even more centrally, metaphors can serve as key data in our attempts to understand how a cultural system adapts to and incorporates sensated experience from the physical world. Metaphors thus provide both a "reality" principle and a "tool" for change. Their special status rests on the way in which a metaphor moves between two different types of thought (Fernandez, CA, 1974). A variety of comments which E. R. Leach and C. Levi-Strauss have made on this issue are summarized, and it is pointed out that both men have underestimated the possibilities for images to develop meaning at the level of affect and motor experience alone, without recourse to opposition or to categorical contrast. Along similar lines, it is argued that many authors mistakenly attempt to isolate metaphoric from metonymic thought. This is taken as a false problem, and the continuity of a process which uses both paradigm contrast and analogic continuity is seen as fundamental. The paper concludes by suggesting that the contemporary theological and anthropological approaches to metaphor are roughly complementary. It is hoped that they will come to interact. Fernandez's article is seen as a useful step in this direction.<br>

Abstract: A number of investigators are agreed that the popular medical systems of tribal, peasant, and allied peoples are "effective." Most of the literature closely examining that effectiveness focuses on the ethnopharmacological dimensions of the healing systems and generally ignores psychosocial factors. Recent developments in psychophysiology may offer insights into these neglected areas. The specific idea to be examined here is that successful "general medical treatment," or "symbolic healing," by either the shaman or physician, is based in part on a psychosocial mobilization of the patient's biochemical response system. Moreover, it is argued that to account fully for these processes we must reconceptualize the character of the human organism; a unitary alternative to standard Western Cartesian dualism (mind vs. body) is proposed, based on a model derived from recent research in neuroendocrinology. This model can be the basis for a nonreductionist theory of medical effectiveness needed to account for a series of observations (derived from both anthropological and medical contexts) which seem to transcend the explanatory powers of the traditional reductionist biomedical model.<br>

Article Title: Schneider's Symbolic Culture Theory: An Appraisal [and Comments and Reply]<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i327937<br>
Date: 9 1, 1979<br>
Author(s): Watson-Gegeo Karen Ann<br>
Abstract: Two traditions have been vying for supremacy in the area of cultural analysis. The first sees culture as encompassing the totality of socially learned human phenomena; the second restricts the term to shared mental-primarily cognitive-properties. David Schneider has achieved a dominant positon in the latter school. In this paper I examine critically Schneider's approach to culture, with special attention to the problems raised by his perspective with respect to intracultural consistency and contradiction. While agreeing that the ethnographer must attempt to shun prior assumptions as to the nature of symbolic and conceptual domains recognized by the people under study, that it is incumbent on the anthropologist to comprehend reality from the natives' point of view before attempting to formulate laws or generalizations, that the symbolic systems and their associated meanings plays an essential part in making sense of any human action system, I shall argue that cultures do not exhibit the degree of integration, consistency, and articulation assumed by Schneider, that in his attempt to render culture wholly integrated and consisten he strips the concept of its analytic utility, that social action and symbolic systems are empirically and epistemologically more closely intertwined than he would lead us to believe, and that the very debate over what culture "really" is constitutes an exercise in reification.<br>

Author(s): Hershberger John K.<br>
Abstract: This paper places the problem of child abuse in the perspective of evil. In so doing it calls into question the amoral assumptions of social science and human services. The current social science paradigm paradoxically dismisses evil as a real factor in the world, despite its concern for indisputably moral issues such as child abuse. The practical advantages of a perspective incorporating evil are several. Among them are a more realistic appreciation of the need for mechanisms of social control in preventing abuse, the role of confession and conversion, and the role of pastoral care as a support system for families.<br>

Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i27643230<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Doja Albert<br>
Abstract: The system of beliefs and practices related to Bektashism seems to have corresponded to a kind of liberation theology, whereas the structure of Bektashi groups corresponded more or less to the type of religious organization conventionally known as charismatic groups. It becomes understandable therefore that their spiritual tendency could at times connect with and meet social, cultural and national perspectives. In turn, when members of the previously persecuted religious minority will acquire a degree of religious and political respectability within society at large, the doctrines of heterodoxy and liberation theology fade into the background. In the end, the heirs of the heterodox promoters of spiritual reform and social movement turn into followers and faithful defenders of a legitimate authority. They become the spokespeople for an institutionalized orthodoxy whose support is sought by the political regime.<br>

Abstract: Cogito, as the first principle of Descartes' metaphysical system, initiated the modern philosophy of consciousness, becoming both the source and subject of modern Western philosophical discourse. The philosophies of Maine de Biran, Kant, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and others developed by answering the following questions? Is consciousness substantial or not? Does consciousness require the guarantee of a transcendental subject? Is Cogito epistemological or ontological? Am I a being-for-myself or a being-for-others? Outlining the developmental history of the idea of Cogito from Descartes to Sartre is important for totally comprehending the evolution and development of Western philosophy.<br>

Issue: i330152<br>

Abstract: It is argued that, contrary to the received view, there is not one but at least two significant conceptions of society as a moral system in the structural functionalist tradition. They express a weak and a strong sense of `morality' respectively. This conceptual equivocation is a pregnant construction of Durkheim's sociology and is dramatically brought forth by Evans-Pritchard's notorious recommendation to turn away from orthodox functionalism to semantic analysis. As the equivocation implies that social anthropology is bound by a stultifying analytical dualism, profound change of presuppositions seems a prescribed therapy.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i348147<br>
Date: 12 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Weltman Sharon Aronofsky<br>
Abstract: Ruskin's complex attitude toward women has long been important to feminist and Victorian studies; over a quarter-century ago Kate Millett published Sexual Politics and its famous attack on Ruskin's essay "Of Queens' Gardens." She charged Ruskin with promoting a sugar-coated but perfidious system of separate spheres for men and women. Yet shortly after Ruskin produced that idealized vision of housewife-queens in 1865, he created a new ideal queen in his mythological study The Queen of the Air (1869), this time elaborated from Athena. Through his mythopoesis, Ruskin disrupts both conventional gender categories and his own implication in them. Ruskin presents a series of binary oppositions that he immediately conflates: Athena and Medusa, air and earth, bird and snake, formation and destruction, science and myth, male and female. Ruskin documents the instability of his oppositions through a bizarre "natural language" where real-life creatures such as birds and snakes serve as eternal hieroglyphs, signifying universally recognizable abstractions. That seemingly fixed signs in Athena's hieroglyphic code inevitably change is clear from Ruskin's acknowledgment of Darwin's evolutionary theory. But evolution slips into a wild image of degenerative metamorphosis, where all the divisions that Ruskin has so laboriously noted dissolve. Since Ruskin identifies Athena with each seemingly opposed animal signifier in his language of living hieroglyphs, he subverts all linguistic difference and ultimately feminizes signification itself. Through myth Ruskin creates a mutable language, one where genders as well as signs become mobile rather than fixed.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines how art history, like other disciplines and societies, defines itself through order and classification. From many possibilities, it considers three examples: a listing of fields of art history, a library system for classifying art books, and the plotting of space and time in art history survey texts. Central to the discussion is the geography of art history. How and why do disciplinary classifications that aspire to be global remain local? What are the consequences of our continued use of mappings that have their origins and bases in geopolitical spaces that no longer exist?<br>

Abstract: Sociology of religion and more specifically of ideologies is governed by the opposition between a certain tradition which considers religion as an instrument of communication and learning, i.e. as a structured and structuring system, and another tradition which emphasizes the political function of religious ideology. In fact, it is through its logical function of prescribing its structure to the mind, that religion fulfils the political function of maintaining the eternity of structures, i.e. the absolute of the relative and the legitimacy of the arbitrary and thus the domestication of the dominated. /// Se halla dominada la sociología de la religión (y más generalmente la de las ideologiás) por la oposición entre la tradición que trata la religión como instrumento de communicación y de conocimiento, es decir como sistema estructurado y estructurante, y la tradición que insiste en las funciones políticas de la ideología religiosa. En realidad, es precisamente porque cumple una función lógica, imponiendo sus estructuras al pensamiento, que la religión desempeña el papel político de eternización de las estructuras, es decir de absolutización del relativo y de legitimación del arbitrario y, con eso, de domesticación de los dominados. /// Die Soziologie der Religion und - allgemein gesehen die Soziologie der Ideologien - wird beherrscht vom Gegensatz einerseits zwischen der Tradition, die die Religion als ein Kommunikations- und Wissensinstrument ansieht - das heisst, als ein strukturiertes und strukturierendes System - und anderseits der Tradition, die die politischen Funktionen der religiösen Ideologie unterstreicht. In Wirklichkeit erfüllt die Religion nur insofern eine politische Funktion der Verewigung der Strukturen - das heisst die Absolutisierung des Relativen und die Legitimation des Willkürlichen und dadurch die Zähmung der Beherrschten - als sie eine logische Funktion erfüllt, indem sie dem Denken ihre Strukturen auferlegt. /// Социология религии (и вообще вс~<br>

Date: 7 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Yeats Paul F.<br>
Abstract: The apex of American legal thought is embodied in two types of writings: the federal appellate opinion and the law review article. In this Article, the author criticizes the whole enterprise of doctrinal constitutional law scholarship, using a recent U.S. Supreme Court case and a Harvard Law Review article as quintessential examples of the dominant genre. In a rhetorical tour de force, the author argues that most of modern constitutional scholarship is really advocacy in the guise of scholarship. Such an approach to legal scholarship may have some merit as a strategic move towards a political end; however, it has little value as scholarship, the goal of which is to seek truth. As a formerly monolithic legal system becomes more culturally heterogeneous, judges and academics no longer share as many assumptions about social truth. Hence, they have an increasing need to mask political judgments in order to avoid the contentious political battles that this increased diversity produces. Legal academia's present obsession with defending constitutional law as something more than an ad hoc rationalization of what are essentially political choices suggests that the present genre of constitutional scholarship may well have outlived its usefulness as a discursive form.<br>

Author(s): FreudAbstract: Although the depiction of a Neanderthal people in "The Inheritors" by William Golding is based mainly on the author's imagination and is thus anthropologically untenable, the author's treatment of Oa the earth goddess, worshipped by this tribe, is of unique value and justly represents his key concept. The reciprocity between the symbolic system and the symbol-dissolving element, both inherent in Oa, is very significant regarding cultural, religious, and psychological aspects in relation to the human beings in this novel. This reciprocity helps in the rediscovery of human potentialities that might be repressed and buried under the power structure of a given society.<br>

Author(s): Westin Georges<br>
Abstract: Recalling several profound disagreements about business ethics as it is currently discussed in Western societies, I emphasize the need for business ethics as an academic discipline that constitutes the "backbone" for both teaching business ethics and improving business practice (section 1). Then I outline a conceptual framework of business ethics that promotes a "bottom-up" approach (section 2). This "problem- and action-oriented" conception appears to be fruitful in terms of both practical relevance and theoretical understanding. Finally, I argue for (section 3) the relevance of discussing goals at all levels of human action (i.e., individuals, organizations, systems) as well as the indispensability of human rights, and propose Amartya Sen's "goal-rights-system" approach as a normative-ethical framework for business ethics that integrates these two fundamental aspects.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion, Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i40000341<br>
Date: 3 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Chidester David<br>
Abstract: In "Primitive Culture" (1871), E. B. Tylor supported his theory of religion, animism, by referring to reports about "savage" dreams. Citing Henry Callaway's "Religious System of the Amazulu" (1868-1870), Tylor invoked the dreams of a Zulu diviner, a "professional seer" who becomes a "house of dreams," as a classic example of animism because "phantoms are continually coming to talk to him in his sleep." In the original account, however, these spirits were not coming "to talk" to the diviner. They were coming to kill him. By situating nineteenth-century Zulu dreams and visions in a colonial contact zone of transcultural relations and asymmetrical power relations, we find a hermeneutics of dreams dealing with indeterminacy, an energetics of dreams, linking dreams to ancestral ritual, which is radically disrupted, and a new interreligious space of resources and strategies for negotiaing and navigating within a violent world.<br>

Abstract: This paper continues a dialogue begun in the Focus on Cosmogony and Religious Ethics published in JRE 14/1 (Spring, 1986). There Charles Reynolds and Ronald Green argued for a model of comparative religious ethics that seeks to locate certain "descriptive universals" across cultural boundaries in diverse forms of religious ethics. The present paper argues that this approach is dangerously imbalanced in its emphasis on similarities, ignoring the importance of diversity for interpreting cross-cultural phenomena and tending to impose a heterogeneous conceptual framework on all religious ethical systems examined. Using the case of the Aztec ethic, the paper argues instead for an approach that studies each particular system in depth in its own context. Such an approach, besides being more faithful to each system being examined, also carries the potential of enriching the search for universals by nuancing the description of the patterns being sought.<br>

Abstract: The field of library and information science (LIS) has built its practice and research perspective on a logico-analytic philosophy, which has generated useful, tangible technologies. Lately there is interest in nonempirical philosophies, such as hermeneutics and critical theory, to fulfill better LIS' service-oriented mission of providing "information" to user populations. One dimension of critical theory, Jürgen Habermas' theory of communicative action, can expand LIS' conception of information and supplement logico-empirical research methods and research practices. This article examines how LIS, particularly research into librarian-patron interaction and information system design, favors an empiricist view of language and, as a consequence, may be limiting its effectiveness. It proposes how the field might expand to include communicative action in fulfilling its mission and research agenda.<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo expone los principales resultados de una investigación realizada con el objeto de analizar el papel que cumplen las emociones colectivas en el mantenimiento del orden social. En concreto, trata de explicar el hecho de que las noticias más importantes que aparecen en los medios de comunicación sean noticias de horror, es decir, noticias en las que la muerte siempre aparece en el primer plano de la escena. Los informativos de los medios de comunicación expresan y fomentan la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. Ahora bien, para entender esta cultura es preciso determinar previamente la naturaleza emocional del horror, así como establecer una definición sociológica de este sentimiento. El horror es una emoción compleja compuesta por sentimientos de terror, de asco y de conmoción. El horror, sociológicamente, puede entenderse como "la emoción mediante la que un orden social señala sus límites más extremos". El estudio concluye señalando que existen dos modos alternativos de mantener el orden y la cohesión en el seno de un sistema social. El primer modo de legitimación, característico de las sociedades centrípetas, funciona mediante la gran potencia atractiva que ejerce sobre el campo social un núcleo central de valores sociales positivos. El segundo, característico de las sociedades centrífugas, funciona mediante la gran potencia repulsiva que ejercen sobre el campo social las transgresiones flagrantes del orden moral. El modo típico en el que las sociedades centrífugas regulan el orden social explica la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. /// This article sets out the main results obtained from a research study carried out for the purpose of analysing the role that collective emotions play in maintaining social order.

Abstract: O autor partindo de textos-base de instituições internacionais, como a O.C.D.E. e a UNESCO, e sobretudo da Lei de Bases do Sistema Educativo Português (L.B.S.E.) ensaia o modo como eles, com especial destaque para o texto da L.B.S.E., possam garantir a pluralidade do pensar na instituição escolar. Por outras palavras, tenta-se dar subsídios que assegurem, pelo menos teoricamente, a formação de uma consciência educativa (democrática) contraposta à lógica reducionista e positivista que sempre tem caracterizado esse mesmo tipo de consciência. Igualmente é apontado que, muito provavelmene, só uma "co-gestão" escolar, tal como o conceito é habitualmente entendido, é possível de garantir o re-nascimento e mesmo a sobrevivência do espírito democrático educacional. /// Sur la base de textes-clés d'institutions internationales tels que l'OCDE ou l'UNESCO, et surtout à partir de la Loi Cadre du Système Educatif Portugais, l'auteur vérifie la façon dont ces textes, et spécialement ce dernier, peuvent garantir la pluralité des idées dans l'institution scolaire. En d'autres termes, on s'efforce de fournir une contribution pour garantir au moins théoriquement la formation d'une conscience. De même, on souligne que très probablement seule une "co-gestion" scolaire ainsi qu'on l'entend habituellement est susceptible de garantir la "renaissance" et même la survie de l'esprit démocratique en matière d'éducation. /// On the bases of fundamental texts of international institutions (O. C. D. E. and UNESCO) and chiefly of the law which determines the Portuguese Educational System (L. B. S. E.), the author seeks to examine the guarantees of having plurality of thought in educational institutions. In other words, there is attempt to suggest ways by which — at least theoretically — the formation of the democratic educational consciousness can be maintained against positivist positions. It is also suggested that only a co-administered education can guarantee the rebirth and even the survival~<br>

Abstract: O estruturalismo levistraussiano tern urn vasto alcance critico em relação ao conceitochave da filosofia do conhecimento que é a razão. Alicerçando a racionalidade num inconsciente universal, num sistema formal categórico, e postulando urn isomorfismo entre a natureza e a cultura, Lévi-Strauss faz uma critica nova da razão humana. Esta não pode ser concebida como consciência, como representação, tão ao gosto do racionalismo moderno e de algumas filosofias contemporàneas, nem perspectivada dialectica e temporalmente, como o fazem o positivismo e o hegelianismo. /// Levi-Strauss' structuralism strongly criticizes "reason", a key-concept in the philosophy of knowledge. Grounding rationality upon a universal unconscious and upon a categorical formal system, and postulating an isomorphism between nature and culture, Strauss produces a new criticism of human reason. Reason can no longer be conceived as it is both in modern rationalism and in some contemporary philosophical trends, as consciousness, as representation. Nor can it be thought of from either a temporal or a dialectical point of view, as it is in positivism and in hegelianism.<br>

Author(s): da Veiga Manuel Alte<br>
Abstract: Na la meditação «em que se pretende não falar de valor», o autor esforça-se por manter um discurso linear sobre o interesse humano de pensar e agir relativamente a um tema tão fundamental, que parece quase impossivel evitar a «petitio principii». Pode-se sintetizar a primeira meditação nestas duas alíneas: (a) O desejo de felicidade é o grande motor da busca de meios para uma vida sempre melhor; (b) O ser humano estrutura a sua ideia de felicidade, vida, meios adequados, objectivos de graus diversos, em função dos conhecimentos de que disōpe. A 2 a meditação reconhece que a neutralidade de discurso da 1a meditação não teve éxito. As palavras são extremamente analógicas e pressupōem um «pensamento e discurso ocultos» , coniventes com o conceito de valor, que se pretendia evitar. O desejo de plenitude da qualidade de vida implica o acto, por vezes inconsciente, de valorização. /// The 1.st meditation aims to maintain a discourse independent of the concept of value. Like in an « Impossible mission», we face a project that easily forces the adventurer to return over his lost pathways in a desert. I. e., falling in a «petitio principii». The result of that l. st meditation could be synthesized as it follows: (a) The desire of hapiness is what forces us to search a better and better quality of life; (b) Human beings structure their idea of hapiness. life, adequate means to various kinds of objectives, according to their available knowledge. The 2. nd meditation recognizes the failure of the searched neutral discourse in the l. st meditation: its words and concepts exemplify a very deep analogy and reveal an occult system of thought and discourse, where the notion of value is unmistakably implicated. The desire of a quality of life in all its richness implies, although some times unconsciously, the act of evaluation.<br>

Abstract: Descartes atribui enorme importância aos três sonhos que teve na noite de São Martinho de 1619, que liga directamente ao descobrimento da sua via científica, quer no Discurso do Método, quer nas Meditações. O presente estudo procura compreender filosoficamente este episódio onírico e a autointerpretação cartesiana, numa perspectiva filosófica, que une referências históricas e psicanalíticas, mas encontra a sua fenomenologia na projecção extática do tempo e na experiência da dualidade. /// Descartes describes the three dreams he dreamed the night of Saint Martin 1619 as a most important episode in relation with the discovery of his method and system, as he says in the Discours de la Méthode and in the Méditations. The present paper aims to understand them in a hermeneutical and phenomenological way, without forgetting the relevance of the psychoanalytical and historical interpretation. The clue to the dreams is founded in the ecstatic projection of time and in the experience of dualism.<br>

Author(s): Djezriri Souria<br>
Abstract: The modernisation theories developed in the 50s and 60s suggested that societies were converging toward modern values, gradually abandoning their traditional values. This convergence idea is re-examined in the following article within the context of European countries and on the basis of processed Values surveys. A set of attitude scales was constructed and then analysed through multivariate techniques. Two main results emerge from this analysis. First, it appears that, regardless of date and country, the Europeans' values are still structured around a traditionalism axis. This result obviously contradicts the theories of convergence towards modernity, theories that are strongly criticised. It is also an opportunity to reflect on the counterpart of traditionalism -need it be called "modernity"?- and on the relations between economic and moral attitudes. Second, religiosity is strongly linked to this structuring of values but it mainly opposes European members of whatever religious denomination to non-members, rather than -as is often imagined-Catholics to Protestants. All in all, the tension between tradition and modernity remains at the core of the value system of European societies.<br>

Issue: i40019126<br>
Date: 4 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Margulis Mario<br>
Abstract: En este artículo se rescata la tradición crítica del concepto "Ideologia". Se le intenta definir tratando de superar los problemas que emanan de su polisemia y de su utilización desde el sentido común. Para definirlo, el autor inicia su análisis a partir del apartado sobre fetichismo de la mercancía en el primer volumen de El Capital de Marx. Partiendo de los efectos del fetichismo sobre los procesos de pensamiento y los códigos de la cultura en un sistema productor de mercancías, se exponen los efectos sociales de la reificación (Lukács y Goldmann) y los rasgos principales de los contenidos ideológicos presentes en los discursos. El autor considera que las luchas sociales por el poder y la dominación son paralelos con las pugnas por la construcción social del sentido. En esa línea, llega a definir ideologia como "las huellas dejadas por las luchas por la hegemonía en los códigos de la cultura". /// The critical tradition attending the concept of'ideology' is recovered by defining this term in a way to avoid the traps set by its many meanings and its common sense usage. The author grounds his analysis on the arguments about the fetishism of commodities in the first volume of Marx's Capital. Taking as his starting point the effects of fetishism on the processes of thought and cultural codes in a commodity-producing system, he explains the social effects of reification (Lukacs and Goldmann), and the main characteristics of ideological contents in discourses. The author considers that social struggles over power and domination run parallel to competing social constructions of meaning. He defines ideology as "the tracks left by the fights over hegemony in the codes of culture".<br>

Abstract: This paper is an anthropological reading of mythical and historical texts aimed at exploring the dynamics by which archaic Egyptian cosmology was constructed and reconstructed. Using Dumont's ideas of hierarchy and Sahlins' work on cultural reproduction, the study presents a synchronie and diachronic analysis of the underlying themes and principles upon which archaic Egyptian cosmology was constructed. The opposition of visible/invisible is the common principle around which other principles or sets of oppositions are clustered. The study shows that archaic Egyptian cosmology underwent a transformation from a structure based on natural entities into socially significant cosmological system. The paper further elaborates the striking homology between the archaic social cosmology represented in Osirian mythology and Christianity in the early centuries of the Christian era.<br>

Abstract: The paper considers the map and the milieu of Europe. Five distinguishing characteristics are discussed. Special attention is given to the "states system" of Europe, the intensity of the boundary network and the increasing tendency from the point of view of human geography to treat the continent as divided rather than as unitary. The first post-war generation of British geographers tended to neglect Europe in favour of North America. Sweden and France have been important in restoring the connection. Those whose research focuses on European topics will encounter bibliographical, linguistic and other problems; but these will be offset by the cordial working relationships among European geographers which, as among colleagues in the English-speaking world, seem to spring from the nature of the subject itself.<br>

Author(s): Caraglio Martine<br>
Abstract: Le sujet est la construction identitaire des lesbiennes qui se perçoivent elles-mêmes comme masculines et qui sont ainsi perçues par leur entourage: par les lesbiennes aussi bien que par les autres personnes. Le "masculin" est envisagé comme une création dans et par la hiérarchie de genre.L'au teure a mené pendant un an une enquête dans une discothèque; 19 histoires de vie apportent leur témoignage. Au terme de ses recherches, la masculinité en question apparaît: 1) comme une manière supportable d'être une femme pour celles qui ne sereconnaissent pas dans le stéréotype féminin; 2) comme un "paysage", c'est-àdire comme quelque chose dontlalesbienne trouve les traits dans le système de genres de la société et dont elle s'empare, faute de mieux ou d'autre chose, pour manifester son refus de la position genrée à quoi la société l'assigne. This article is about the construction of identity among lesbians who perceive themselves and are perceived as "masculine" by others, including other lesbians. The "masculine" is seen by the author as a construction of the gender hierarchy. The author has conducted interviews for a year in a bar and has collected 19 life-stories.Her findings show that the masculinity attributed to lesbians is: 1) a way of making tolerable the fact of being a woman for those women who do not accept the feminine stereotypes; 2) a landscape: an environment made up by lesbians with elements they find in society's gender system, for lack of alternative models, and which they use to express their refusal of the gendered position society wants to assign them.<br>

Author(s): Olsen Ole Johnny<br>
Abstract: The thesis that the German dual system of vocational training as well as skilled labour in general are threatened by erosion is challenged in this article by theoretical arguments and empirical evidence from Norwegian studies. The question is discussed whether the 'erosion thesis' exaggerates the discontinuity of industrial organization principles, thus prematurely devaluating the productive potentials of skilled workers. The author points out that the presumption of an erosion process is based on a restricted concept of 'Beruf' (vocation) and of work organization. Rather than seeing 'process orientation' as an organizational principle that contradicts the concept of 'Beruf', the author argues that it could supplement professional responsibilities, thus extending and renewing the concept. He wonders whether the 'erosion thesis' sufficiently considers the criticism of the neo-classical view of economic behaviour, which was brought forward during the eighties. According to this criticism, the socialization and integration of skilled workers into a professional community can be seen as the well-working institutionalization of a 'practical professionalism' which also includes innovative and future-oriented capacities. Finally, a research perspective is sketched out regarding the future of vocational training and skilled labour.<br>

Abstract: Die strukturelle Sprachwissenschaft wird aus einem philosophischen Gesichtspunkt her betrachtet. Wir versuchen die Grundeinsichte dieser Sprachwissenschaft herauszuarbeiten : Sprache als autonome Entität innerlicher Differenzen und Dependenzen, Sprache als Form und nicht als Substanz. Längere Zeit ist die strukturelle Semantik vernachlässigt worden. Im Buche A. J. Greimas' : Sémantique structurale finden wir eine eindringliche Beschreibung des Aufbaues und der Strukturen der Bedeutungswelt. Mit Paul Ricoeur holen wir die philosophisch relevante Voraussetzungen des Sprachbegriffes der strukturellen Sprachwissenschaft hervor : die Sprache ist das Objekt einer empirischen Wissenschaft ; die Veränderung in der Sprache ist nur eine Bedrohung für das System der Sprache ; die Sprache ist Form, nicht Substanz ; die Sprache als strukturelles System - auch im Bereiche der Semantik - ist an der konkreten, extra-linguistischen Realität abwesend ; das Sprachzeichen soll nicht definiert werden als eine Referenz zum Ding, sondern als eine Opposition mit allen anderen Sprachzeichen und als eine innerliche Differenz zwischen dem akustischen Bilde und der Wortbedeutung. Welche Mangel hat dieser Sprachbegriff nun ? Die strukturelle Sprachwissenschaft betrachtet allzu wenig die Sprache als freien Akt des Gesprächs. Nur im Gespräch leuchtet die Notwendigkeit auf, die Worte für die konkrete Realität zu öffnen. Nur im Gespräch erfährt man den Zugriff der Wirklichkeit auf die Worte. Auch orientiert sich die strukturelle Sprachwissenschaft allzu einseitig an Bedeutungswelten, in denen die Inhalte nicht die Kraft besitzen, sich eine Interpretationsgeschichte zu erringen. In letzter Zeit gibt es aber einige neuen Wege in der Sprachwissenschaft (die französische und amerikanische sind nur betrachtet worden), die vielleicht eine grössere Chance versprechen für die Möglichkeit der Öffnung der Sprache für die konkrete Realität, die das Gespräch der Menschen winkt. Im Bereiche der syntaktischen St~<br>

Abstract: Cet article explore les dynamiques de l'échange communicationnel à l'époque de Stalin et son impact sur la formation de l'opinion. Alors que les journaux, qui présentent leurs auteurs dans un état solitaire de monologue intérieur, révèlent souvent des étendues d'ambiguité et de doute, une communication engagée, particulièrement entre personnes se faisant confiance, est beaucoup plus à même de donner naissance à des jugements et des opinions clairs, ce qui est de la plus haute importance sur le plan de la capacité critique. La riche correspondance personnelle de la famille Kravčenko-Spunde, famille de vieux bolcheviks engagés, montre à quel point un échange ouvert peut susciter et renforcer tant le soutien que la critique la plus âpre du système. Ces documents mettent en lumière un changement majeur, le passage d'un soutien quasi inconditionnel au régime stalinien à sa critique de « fossoyeur de la révolution » , condamnation qui émerge du débat politique tenu dans le cercle étroit de la famille. De plus, la défense d'un bien commun à l'encontre du discours public pousse les discutants à transcender leur cercle restreint et à chercher un contre-public indispensable pour lever le soupçon de particularité qui pèse sur les « biens » défendus au sein de ce cercle et pour confirmer ainsi leur caractère de « bien commun ». La tentative d'élargissement du cercle communicationnel mène à une nouvelle activité dans l'écriture mémorielle qui se propose aussi bien de dévoiler les mensonges du système que de révéler un héritage révolutionnaire distinct de la représentation officielle monopolisée par le régime. L'expérience des relations personnelles pendant la révolution joue un rôle essentiel pour cette revendication dissidente d'un héritage révolutionnaire. Camaraderie et confrontation unie face à l'ennemi pendant la guerre civile doivent être distinguées de l'énonciation et de l'élaboration d'opinions lors de débats publics. Seule cette seconde expérience, basée sur la récipro~<br>

Abstract: La plongée sous-marine en milieu naturel est une activité qui modifie l'équilibre et la perception du corps. Les plongeurs – souvent convaincus de pratiquer une activité sans danger – s'exposent pourtant à des risques potentiellement mortels. À partir d'une enquête ethnographique, l'auteur montre qu'en définitive ce sport laisse une place aux transgressions des normes où le risque est progressivement converti en sécurité. Cet arrangement implique d'acquérir la maîtrise des « techniques de neutralisation ­­» du risque, permettant aux plongeurs d'entretenir paradoxalement un système normatif, tout en le « violant ». Il apparaît ainsi que la transgression des normes de sécurité est moins un acte individuel qu'une conduite déterminée par l'organisation sociale de la plongée. Diving in a natural medium modifies the equilibrium and perception of the body. Divers — often convinced to practice a safe activity — expose themselves to potentially mortal risks. On the basis of an ethnographic survey the author shows that this sport leaves room for an infringement of norms where risk is progressively neutralized. This implies that divers master the neutralization techniques that enable them paradoxically to maintain a normative system and to violate it at the same time. Infringement of safety norms thus appears to be an individual act rather than a behaviour determined by the divers' social organization. Der Tauchsport in einem natürlichen Medium verändert das Equilibrium und die Wahrnehmung des Körpers. Die Taucher — die oft davon überzeugt sind, dass sie einen risikolosen Sport treiben — setzen sich potentiell tödlichen Risiken aus. Auf der Basis eiener ethnographischen Studie zeigt der Autor, dass dieser Sport Platz für eine Übertretung der Normen lässt, wo das Risiko allmählich neutralisiert wird. Dies setzt voraus, dass die Taucher die Neutralisationstechniken beherrschen, die sie paradoxerweise ermöglichen, ein normatives System zu erhalten und zur gleicher Zeit zu verletz~<br>

Abstract: Il s'agit d'éclairer plusieurs déplacements qui se sont produits dans les trente dernières années. Tout d'abord la création d'un milieu d'experts intermédiaires entre la politique, l'administration et la recherche. Ensuite un changement du cadre à l'intérieur duquel se situe la réflexion. Il s'agit moins de penser la cohésion d'une société dans un cadre national qu'à la manière dont le pays peut maintenir son rang dans la compétition internationale. Enfin un changement d'orientation politique : le souci de la formation de l'élite redevient primordial même s'il ne s'agit plus de maintenir une tradition culturelle mais de sauvegarder ses parts de marché. Le texte étudie ces évolutions en France en distinguant trois périodes : une période de « politique à l'état gazeux » où la gauche tente de transformer les idéaux libertaires de 1968 en programme de gouvernement ; une tentative de passage à l'état solide avec la loi d'orientation de 1989 et la création de la Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective ; une déstabilisation de ce système par le ministre Claude Allègre qui jette le système éducatif français dans le grand bain de la concurrence internationale. Il s'ensuit une période à la fois « sous influence » et d'incertitude. The idea is to explain several moves that have happened in the last thirty years. First of all, the creation of a body of experts, middlemen between politics, government and research. Then a change in the setting of the thinking process. It is less to think about social cohesion within a national setting than the way the country can live up to its ranking when competing at the international level. Finally, a change in political orientations: teaching the elite becomes a crucial problem again even if it does not mean keeping cultural traditions alive any more but securing market shares. This article studies those changes and defines three periods: firstly, a period of politics in "gaseous-state" in which the left tried to change 1968's liberta~<br>

Abstract: Cet article (1) présente une réflexion théorique sur la notion de genre, de ses définitions et ses usages en sciences sociales. S'opposant à l'approche dominante qui conçoit le genre comme identité ou attribut socialement construits des personnes, conception qu'elle considère comme essentialisante ou substantialisante, l'auteur argumente en faveur d'une approche relationnelle du genre conçu comme modalité des relations sociales. Elle se fonde pour cela sur des travaux d'anthropologie comparative et historique qui contraignent à reconsidérer le dualisme du moi et du corps constitutif de l'idéologie individualiste de la personne, et critique I'hypostase du Moi comme homoncule constitué à partir d'une absolutisation de la première personne. Analysant le système sexué des trois personnes grammaticales, elle soutient que, n'étant pas référentiel, « le je de l'interlocution n'a ni sexe, ni genre ». Les apports croisés de l'anthropologie et de la philosophie analytique la conduisent à revoir la notion de personne pour mieux penser la capacité proprement humaine de se reconnaître comme d'un sexe sans être jamais assigné à celui-ci. This article presents a theoretical work on the idea of gender, its definitions and uses in social science. The author objects to the mainstream approach that sees gender as an identity or an attribute that some people socially construct. She sees that idea as essentializing or substantializing. She argues in favor of a relational approach of gender conceived as mode of social interactions. Her approach is based on comparative and historical works of anthropologists that lead to consider the dualism of the ego and the body which make the individualistic ideology of a persona, and she criticizes the hypostasis of the ego as homunculus made up from absolutizing the id. Analyzing the gender system of the three grammatical persons, she asserts that, as it is not a reference, the other person's "I" does not have a sex nor a gender. The contributions f~<br>

Author(s): Zerubavel Pablo<br>
Abstract: On the U.S.-Mexican border, the label "Mexican" refers simultaneously to both nationality and ethnicity. Playing with the multiple meanings of the word, border actors construct narratives about themselves and Others to deal with a local hegemonic discourse that states that "poverty is Mexican." Thus, while border identities are constructed within a culturally specific system of classification, people also develop a sense of themselves as subjects by imagining themselves as protagonists in stories. To know border narratives is important because people generally act according to how they understand their place in any number of social relations whose meaning is narratively constructed.<br>

Abstract: O artigo pretende apresentar um novo modelo de distribuição das ajudas sociais na França, modelo esse entretanto conhecido pelo nome de "alocação personalizada". Trata-se de um mecanismo que, em seu mesmo funcionamento e nas suas justificações éticas, se opõe seja ao sistema actual dominante, herdeiro do Estado-Provi-dência, seja ao projecto alternativo de alocação universal, ou basic income, entretanto amplamente debatido. Objectivo principal do artigo, porém, é explorar os fundamentos filosóficos subjacentes à proposta em causa. Tal como o próprio nome indica, o princípio da "alocação personalizada" apoia-se sobre o contributo de uma filosofia social específica, o personalismo. Assim, evocando principalmente os escritos de Emmanuel Mounier e de Max Scheler, os autores pretendem mostrar até que ponto esta filosofia social suporta uma concepção original da solidariedade, ela própria fundada sobre uma relação específica aos outros. Neste sentido, a proposta que aqui se faz em favor de uma "alocação personalizada" pode ser lida e interpretada como uma aplicação directa da perspectiva personalista a um problema preciso de economia política, a saber, o da organização da assistência social. This paper intends to present a new model for distribution of social assistance in France, a model which has been known by the name of "personalized allocation". It is a mechanism which opposes itself, in its own functioning and in its ethical justifications, both to the present dominant system, heir to the Welfare State, and to the alternative project of universal allocation, or basic income, which in the mean-while has been largely debated. The main aim of this paper, then, is to explore the philosophical fundaments underlying the proposal of the model in question. Like the very name indicates, the principle of "personalized allocation" is based on the contribution of a specific social philosophy, namely personalism. Thus, chiefly calling forth the writings of Emmanuel Mounier and M~<br>

Author(s): MORAWSKI WITOLD<br>
Abstract: On the assumption that harmonization of the allocative efficiency of market, state redistributionism and the social values of solidarity and social justice is the key to successful systemic transformation, the author analyzes systemic change from the institutional perspective. Thus he is able to interpret the new systemic rules in their interaction with the environment and to interpret change in evolutionary terms. The analytic design has seven components: new rules, their intrinsic domestic sources, the need to adjust structurally to the West, environmental contingencies (values, actors and their methods of operation, public or private space, time and circumstances), the mechanisms of emergence of the new system (via establishment of new institutions, deinstitutionalization, reinstitutionalization etc.), impact of the heritage of the past, and, finally, the effectiveness of the new institutions (the state, the economy and civil society). Both in the analysis of universal challenges and the analysis of Polish problems, the author emphasizes the need to develop adaptive rationality, which he views as a superior, synthetic form of overcoming the dilemmas posed by the systemic transformation.<br>

Abstract: Theodore Abel belonged before Talcott Parsons to the pioneers of "Weberians"' kind in America. In his Systematic Sociology in Germany the first systematic exposure of Max Weber's ideas in English appeared. Abel was the first to use Verstehen and Verstehende Soziologie in English literature. Abel also pioneered the research on the Nazi phenomenon. The manifestations of nazism and communist totalitarianism in the 20th century put the sociological theory and methodology to a critical test. Examining Abel's work as a case study, it is possible to see more clearly the ethical and methodological problems of the humanistic sociology—the "understanding" or interpretative one. The sense and implications of understanding in sociology still require greater clarity in order to better understand the understanding. Abel's diary sheds light on the methodological problems of his understanding research of nazism. The source of danger and ethical dilemmas of that discipline lies in the tradition of understanding sociology and Weber's method of ideal types connected with the principle of freedom from valuation. Also in that very tradition there are beginnings for development of its rightful cause and vocation. Provided, just like in Znaniecki's concept of humanistic coefficient, not only meanings but also valuations and social sentiments given in people's experience are taken into account. Full understanding cannot imply complete tolerance if meanings and values of individuals and groups are coupled with hate and other hostile feelings. Social feelings—hate and love (altruism)— constitute a sociologist's axiological system of negative and positive reference.<br>

Abstract: Even though the European Union has become an "ever closer union" in economic and political terms, the problem of the emotional deficit of the EU identity calls for solutions. Metaphor offers an untypical yet interesting mechanism of overcoming the alien aura of the EU. Taking into consideration the cognitive value of metaphors, Antony Judge, the EU expert, designed the dynamic system of metaphors to articulate the new European identity. At the same time, in the candidate countries the alternative discourses of European identity emerge. Polish press makes use of the emotional potential of metaphors. With the help of metaphors Polish pubic discourse grounds the claim of the rightful and necessary belonging of Poland to the European Union thus engaging in symbolic politics. Moreover, through metaphoric images the relations between Europe and the "Self" are critically or ironically assessed. In an ambiguous period of accession negotiations these metaphors empowered Polish public to create their own conceptions of what the European identity is.<br>

Abstract: Neorealism and some versions of realism seek to furnish nomothetic theories of the international system at the same time that they also strive to prescribe policy for political leaders. Insofar as practical advice is insufficiently articulated by means of either nomothesis or the structural theoretical framework that (neo-)realist paradigms supply, these two aspirations seem contradictory. This essay is an examination of what contemporary realism and, especially, neorealism require to make practical wisdom available for practitioners. It argues that narrative, which is exemplified in the so-called classical realism of Thucydides, remains a crucial component of practical realism and neorealism.<br>

Author(s): Boldyrev Ivan A.<br>
Abstract: Hegel ist als Philosoph des Systems bekannt. Sein System aber unterscheidet sich von denen, die Walter Benjamin in seiner "Erkenntniskritischen Vorrede" zum "Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels" kritisierte. Was Hegel avisierte, war nicht ein Netz von Begriffen als neutralen Instrumenten der Weltbeziehung und Welterschließung. Das ist eher das Entfalten seines Systems selbst, das die Welt, die Geschichte, und die Weltgeschichte konstituiert. Dadurch sind wir berechtigt, seine Philosophie als ein performatives Projekt zu analysieren, das in dem Sinne auch zur Literatur gehören kann. Hegels Gedicht "Eleusis" vermittelt uns die immanenten Konflikte und Widersprüchlichkeit seines eigenen Diskurses (das Unaussprechliche auszusprechen) und sanktioniert sich performativ; Phänomenologie des Geistes ist nicht nur eine Galerie von Bildern/Gestalten und eine selbstbehauptende Konstruktion, sondern auch eine Verarbeitung von Hegels eigenen literarischen Erfahrungen, sei es in der Dichtung ("Eleusis"), Tragödie (Antigone-Übersetzung), oder Formen des Essays/Fragments ("Wer denkt abstrakt?").<br>

Abstract: In 1884 an Ottoman public prosecutor and fellow officials stood trial for abusing their official authorities when attending to an incident in one of Istanbul's neighborhoods. A published verbatim report of the proceedings is used in this article for discussing Ottoman socio-legal change in the late nineteenth century, employing a microhistorical perspective. Following a major reform in the new court system, which was established in the 1860s (the Nizamiye courts), the judicial authorities used the trial in question for transmitting the commitment of the modernizing state to the rule of law, exhibited by the principle of officials' accountability. Features of the reformed judicial system and its distinctive legal culture are demonstrated in this article by unfolding the judicial aspects of this episode and by discussing connections between them and the immediate socio-political and socio-legal contexts of the trial.<br>

Author(s): Longhi Julien<br>
Abstract: We analyse the French noun livre « book » according to an argumentative conception of language. A summary is presented of the theories of Anscombre (Theory of stereotypes) and of Carel and Ducrot (Theory of semantic blocks), which are used to reveal the argumentative dimensions of livre. Argumentation is argued to derive from a common sense system (Sarfati) leading to the ascription of doxa in language governed by a topohbased device, which corresponds to discursive object. Semiotisation is supported by phenomenological processes: the Indexicality of meaning (Lebas 1999, Cadiot and Visetti 2001) is concerned at the Linguistic level with the construction of semantic forms along three dimensions of meaning, known in the Theory of semantic forms as motifs, profiles, and themes. The contributions of the discursive levels to the constitution of a semantic form are raised in view of the phenomenon of lexical anticipation. What we call "inserted motifs" reveals the genericity of Discursive Formations. In the course of "profiling", these motifs constitute a pre-syntactic zone of stabilisation. The "doxic profiles" allows the construction of topoï by thematisation.<br>

Abstract: Kant's progressive philosophy of history is an integral aspect of his critical system, yet it is often ignored or even treated as an embarrassment by contemporary scholars. In this article, I defend Kant and argue for the continuing relevance of his regulative assumption of historical progress. I suggest, furthermore, that the first-person stance of practical belief exemplified in Kant's conception of hope offers new resources for thinking about the relationship between the ideal and the real in political theory.<br>

Abstract: À La Réunion, l'école de la Troisième République s'est investie dans un processus d'acculturation nationale où les valeurs patriotiques et civiques ont été mises à l'honneur. L'affermissement du sentiment d'appartenance nationale s'est donc inscrit progressivement dans un patrio-bellicisme et dans une reconnaissance des bienfaits de la Nation pour les jeunes élèves de la colonie. Le lycée de Saint-Denis, établissement modèle accueillant les élites réunionnaises, a été l'objet à cet égard d'une attention particulière de la part des autorités coloniales. Durant la remise des prix effectuée chaque année avant les vacances scolaires, les élèves recevaient ainsi une dernière leçon édifiante d'instruction civique rappelant les fondements de la Nation et les devoirs inhérents au patriotisme. In Reunion Island, the School system of the Third Republic initiated a process of national cultural integration in which patriotic and civic values were promoted. As a result, the strengthened feeling of national belonging gradually developed into a patriotic/warmongering spirit and the recognition of the benefits brought by the nation in the minds of the young students of the colony. The Saint-Denis upper secondary school, a model school in which the colony elite studied, was therefore the object of particular attention from colonial authorities. Thus, during the prize ceremony held each year before the holiday break, pupils were taught a final lesson of civic responsibility with a reminder of the foundations of the nation and the duties inherent to patriotism. Auf der Insel Réunion, hat die Schule der Dritten Republik ein nationaler Akkulturationsprozess entwickelt, der die staatlich-patriotischen Werte in den Vordergrund brach. Die Befestigung des nationalen Zugehörigkeitsgefühls fällt dadurch schrittweise in einen kriegerischen Patriotismus und in die Erkennung der Wohltaten der Nation zugunsten der jungen Schüler der Kolonie.

Abstract: Depuis le Sakuteiki (Notes sur l'arrangement des jardins, XIe siècle) jusqu'aux jardins de daïmyôs de l'époque d'Edo (1603-1867), le jardin japonais est empreint d'une tendance marquée à référer les formes de ses constituants à des sites et à des paysages modèles dénommés « sites de renom » (meisho). Ce système de référence est appelé mitate, ce qui signifie littéralement « instituer par le regard ». Cela se rapporte, d'une part, au principe de la métaphore, et, d'autre part, au dynamisme fondamental des localisations dans l'écoumène, tel que l'illustrent le couple topos/chôra dans le Timée et la distinction que fait Nishida entre logique d'identité du sujet et logique d'identité du prédicat. Fron the Sakuteiki (Notes on the making of gardens, XIth c.) to daimyos gardens of the Edo period (1603-1867), the Japanese gardens display a prominent tendency to refer its material forms to paradigmatic places and landscapes, called « places with a name » (meisho). This system of reference was called mitate, which literaly means « instituting by seeing ». It is here related, on the one hand, to the principle of metaphor, and on the other hand to the fundamental dynamics of place in the ecumene, as illustrated by the couple topos/chôra in the Timaios and by Nishida's dictinstion between a logic of the identity of the subject and a logic of the identity of the predicate (or logic of place).<br>

Abstract: The article is intended to indicate how the study of written and cultural texts may be used to approach the problem of identifying the system of thought characteristic of particular groups. Certain premises of what may be called an “interpretative paradigm” have been selected to create a theoretical starting-point, and in this context the most suggestive appear to be the concept of culture developed by symbolic anthropology, the cultural-semiotic concept of text and the multi-dimensional hermeneutic approach to textual intepretation. The author therefore seeks to bring together, in addition to the general features ofinterpetative ethnology, certain theoretical and methodological starting-points derived from the three approaches mentioned. One may approach the problem of understanding of a foreign testimony via “adequate interpretation”. Here, to understand means to adopt the cultural “language” of a message as one's own, and to interpret and so transfer the unknown into an accessible code, most often one's own code. The process of interpretation is understood as the discovery of the hidden content behind the apparent stirface, and in this activity the understanding of culturally remote testimony is axiomatically taken to bepossible and communicable. In a broader epistemological context we can see in adequate intepretation one of the means to the never-ending process of correction of our pre-judged knowledge. In a spirit of critical rationalism we could deflne such interpretation as the working hypothesis that may be falsified by further Scientific activity and then replaced by a better theory. Such conclusions on the methodological range of the interpretative approach indicate only one of the possible syntheses of various epistemological paradigms, for the theoretical use and application of which ethnology seems especially suited.<br>

Abstract: Bohumil Nuska points out the predominant limited conception of rhythm, which is usually linked only with acoustically symbolized and aurally perceived rhythms, while the rhythms that are optically symbolized and visually perceived are utterly ignored. In lyric verse, the double, parallel mental construction, which stems from the opposition of syllable and morpheme as constituents of a higher construct of the word, creates parallel Iines of mixed mental spaces of linear and non-linear rhythms (the rhythm of verse, the rhythm of the situation; the atmosphere of the verse, and the atmosphere of the situation). Shared abstract structures in generic spaces within individual mixed spaces of lyric rhythm are shared axiological structures, represented at the highest level of abstraction by tension and relaxation (detension). The dynamic nature of these structures stems from the asymmetric distribution of tension and relaxation with regard to the dualistic symmetrical model of the axiological system. And thus deviations from its axial scheme emerge, creating these four parallel rhythmicized lyric structures (in terms of form). Similarity amongst the individual mixed mental spaces is only possible in a fractal dimension. In this theory, presented as a working hypothesis, it is assumed that the forms of the rhythm of the verse, the rhythm of the situation, the atmosphere of the verse, and the atmosphere of the situation, will be similar to each other, and their fractal mutual similarity emerges from the text.<br>

Abstract: In July 2004, a young woman claimed that she had been attacked on the Paris urban railway system by four Maghrebins and two Africans and that the discovery that she might be Jewish had intensified the character of the attack. For a number of days, the French media were dominated by the case and leading politicians condemned it. The events drew attention to a number of issues concerning culture and identity in contemporary France and the role played in constituting this identity of history and memory. However, it also displayed how the constitution of identity is a selective process in which different elements may be dealt with, either in different ways or omitted altogether. This article explores how in attempting to come to terms with the legacies of anti-Semitism, other areas of history and memory have been neglected, including the legacy of France's colonial empire, and, in particular, her relationship with Algeria.<br>

Article Title: The Semiotics of Fictional Time: Three Metaphors in the Study of Temporality in Fiction<br>
Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>

Abstract: Temporal concepts such as "order," "chronology," "narrative present," and "exposition" are extensively used in narrative theory. Accepted notions of time can contribute to our understanding of these concepts and can allow us to question their "temporal" meaning in the context of fictional narrative. Fictional time may be thought of as a system of relations unique to the fictional world after real time. Theories of narrative tend to adopt an essentialist interpretation of temporal concepts and to ignore the ontological divergence between time in fiction and time in reality. As a result, concepts such as "exposition" or "present" appear which appear to carry a direct "temporal" meaning, actually function in a way that indicates the nature of time in fiction. In fiction, temporal divisions and time segmentations do not just construct a temporal structure; they also mark degrees of factuality in the fictional world.<br>

Abstract: Narratology may be thought of as a complicated system of conceptual filters that enact a severe formalist reduction upon the corpus of what may be thought and said about storytelling. According to Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, this reductiveness needs to be expanded in order to attend more to language. One way of answering to her reformist prescription is a turn to the study of linguistic surface structure organized as a meditation on the metaphor of the filter. For Seymour Chatman this metaphor designates a character through whom a narrator elects to tell a story. For Max Black, "filter" is a trope for metaphoric process. Examining these senses of the filter in Henry James's short story "The Beast in the Jungle" leads to emphasis upon negations and belief qualifiers. In James's story, both turn out to be invaded by the logic of Freudian negation, itself a type of intrapsychic filtration.<br>

Article Title: A New Model for Metaphor<br>
Publisher: Blackwell-Wiley Publishing<br>

Author(s): Maloney J. Christopher<br>
Abstract: Metaphors are expressions in artificial, contrived, alien languages, and we understand metaphors by constructing translation schemes linking our natural, literal languages to these theoretically contrived metaphorical languages. The relation between a literal natural language and a metaphorical contrived language is like the relationship between a natively known language and a system of subsequently acquired languages etymologically emerging from that basic natural language. This model for understanding metaphorically contrived language is kin to the familiar model explaining how speakers of a language such as Latin may come to decipher a language like Spanish through projecting to Spanish what they know of Latin without the aid of a translation manual. A metaphor is, thus, seen as a sentence in a nonnatural language, itself derived from and at least partially translatable with the natural, literal language of the metaphor's author or audience. Les métaphores sont des expressions relevant de langues artificielles, construites, étrangères et nous les comprenons en construisant des schémas de traduction reliant notre langue naturelle littérale à ces langues métaphoriques théoriquement construites. La relation entre une langue naturelle littérale et une langue métaphorique construite est analogue à la relation entre une langue acquise primitivement et un système de langues apprises ensuite et qui dérivent étymologiquement de cette langue de base. Ce modèle, qui permet de comprendre un langage métaphorique construit, est apparenté au modèle familier expliquant comment les gens qui possèdent une langue telle que le latin arrivent à déchiffrer une langue telle que l'espagnol en projetant sur l'espagnol ce qu'ils savent du latin sans recourir à un dictionnaire. Une métaphore est donc considérée comme une phrase d'une langue non naturelle, dérivée elle-même de et au moins en partie traductible dans la langue naturelle littérale de l'auteur de la métaphore ou de ses lecteurs~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell-Wiley Publishing<br>
Issue: i40115211<br>
Date: 1 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Paul<br>
Abstract: Beginning with the paradoxical fact of the plurality of philosophical systems, the irrationality of this situation is examined, first, from the point of view of two solutions — the Hegelian solution and that which dissolves the paradox by denying that systems are exclusive of one another — judged to be inadequate; and then from the viewpoint of the contrast between the claims of genuine philosophy and its actual historical practice. The idea of system is examined from the perspective of Spinoza's Ethics and, finally, M. Gueroult's idéalisme intégral serves as a guide in exploring the result of subordinating the historical features of philosophical activity to its systematic features. Partant du fait paradoxal de la pluralité des systèmes philosophiques, l'auteur examine l'irrationalité de cette situation d'abord du point de vue de deux solutions — celle de Hegel et celle qui résoud le paradoxe en niant que les systèmes s'excluent mutuellement — solutions qui sont jugées inadéquates; puis du point de vue du contraste entre la véritable philosophie et sa pratique historique effective. L'idée de système est examinée dans la perspective de l'éthique de Spinoza et, enfin, l'idéalisme intégral de M. Gueroult sert de guide pour explorer les conséquences d'une subordination des aspects historiques de l'activité philosophique à ses aspects systématiques. Angesichts der paradoxen Situation der Pluralität von philosophischen Systemen wird die Irrationalität dieser Situation untersucht: zunächst vom Gesichtspunkt zweier Lösungen — nämlich der Lösung Hegels und derjenigen die darin besteht, die Unvereinbarkeit der Systeme zu leugnen —, die beide als inadäquat verworfen werden; dann von einem Standpunkt aus, der zwischen den Ansprüchen echter Philosophie und deren tatsächlicher historischer Praxis unterscheidet. Der Begriff des Systems wird aus der Perspektive von Spinozas Ethik untersucht und schliesslich wird M. Gueroults integraler Idealismus als Führer verwendet, um das Ergeb~<br>

Abstract: In this paper some claims of Professor Ricoeur are challenged. (1) It is pointed out on historical grounds that counter to Professor Ricoeur's claim, most past philosophies are displaced, or ignored. The surviving canon is small and very selective. There is, therefore, substantial agreement on the large corpus which is rejected. (2) It is also argued that Professor Ricoeur's contrast between philosophy and the sciences is too sharp since in the history of modern sciences there are always conflicting theories existing in parallel. However, it is the case that in philosophy standards of "acceptability" are looser and not the rigorous ones of science. A philosophical theory may be appreciated for the problems it discloses, the richness and subtlety of its arguments, its strategies and the like despite acknowledged failings. Appreciation of incompatible theories is not irrational. (3) The claim is rejected that the seeming irrationality is resolved by viewing each system as wholly autonomous. (4) The apparent restriction of philosophy by Professor Ricoeur to global systems is also questioned. L'auteur conteste quelques affirmations du prof. Ricoeur. (1) Elle montre, sur des bases historiques, que beaucoup de philosophies passées sont écartées ou ignorées. Le canon retenu est petit et très sélectif. Il y a donc un accord substantiel quant au vaste corpus qui est rejeté. (2) Elle montre aussi que le contraste que le professeur Ricoeur établit entre philosophie et sciences est trop abrupt, puisqu'il y a toujours eu, dans l'histoire de la science moderne, des théories opposées qui coexistaient. Toutefois, il est vrai qu'en philosophie, les standards d' «acceptabilité» sont plus lâches et diffèrent de ceux, plus rigoureux, de la science. Une philosophie peut être appréciée pour les problèmes qu'elle pose, pour la richesse et la subtilité de ses arguments, ses stratégies ou d'autres choses semblables et ceci en dépit de ses insuffisances notoires. Il n'est pas irrationnel d'a~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell-Wiley Publishing<br>
Issue: i40115286<br>
Date: 1 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Christoff Daniel<br>
Abstract: La signe comme expression (Husserl) consiste selon F. de Saussure dans le rapport immotivé signifíant-signifíé, sa valeur signifiante étant déterminée par la place du signifiant dans le système réel de la langue tandis que le signifié-concept (de Saussure) est noème, irréel (Husserl). Inerte tant qu'aucun acte d'expression ou de compréhension ne l'anime (ré-anime), il porte, exprime et induit l'intentionnalité de ces actes; il est conscience hors de soi, intentionnalité sans sujet, visée du signifié différenciée par son signifiant (objet d'une science de faits, la linguistique). Aussi les problèmes du «sujet», de l' «origine», de la «suffisance» du signe adéquat, de l'«insuffisance» du signe qui, en son ouverture, exprime au-delà de lui-même, exigent-ils l'élucidation du champ de signification, notamment des figures métonymiques ou métaphoriques qui y apparaissent. According to F. de Saussure a sign or an expression (Husserl) is constituted by the unmotivated relation between the signifier and the signified, the value of the signifier is determined by the position it occupies in the real system of language, while the signified concept (de Saussure) is a noema, i.e. unreal (Husserl). Inactive, as long as there is no act of expression or understanding to (re) activate it, the concept carries the intentionality of these acts, conveys it and leads us to it. It constitutes a consciousness outside of the self, an intentionality without a subject, a target of the signified, as differentiated by the signifier (the object of a science, the linguistics). In this sense the solution to the problems concerning the «subject», the «origin», the «sufficiency» of an adequate sign, the «insufficiency» of a sign, when it signifies things other than itself, requires the clarification of the idea of a field of meaning, especially the meaning of occurring metonymies and metaphors.

Abstract: The analysis of an opera, understood as a dramatic text on which a plurality of texts converge, each generated by a different expressive code (be it verbal, musical, or visual), must first of all define a pertinent criterion by which the significant "actions" as discrete semantic units can be located in the text itself. Such a criterion can be identified within the principle at the basis of the dramatic genre, the interaction of the characters acting on stage and their changing relationships. On this basis, it is possible to read the action in Le Nozze di Figaro as the evolving system of dominance relationships between Count Almaviva and Figaro, and the various ways in which the other characters participate in this conflict. The same principle makes it possible to analyze a specific segment of the action (act II, scene VII-VIII, the second main section of the second finale), which can be broken down into a number of semantic units, along two hierarchically-organized structural levels. Earlier analyses have segmented this scene according to purely musical criteria, without considering its meaning for the overall unfolding of the drama. This new reading shows how the scene presents an important turning point in the plot, a temporary reversal of the relationship between the Count and the Countess. This turning point belongs specifically to the plot of the opera, which draws heavily on the text of the Beaumarchais comedy, but reformulates the syntax of the events; this shows how the "meaning" of a scene does not lie in the characters' dialogue alone, but that this is merely one of the possible devices by which the action is made to advance. As far as the role of the musical text is concerned, an analysis of its various components (form, motivic materials, tonal relationships, etc.) in the scene under consideration reveals that its role is primarily one of demarcation (it helps one to perceive the unity of a specific set of actions and its difference from the next set) a~<br>

Date: 9 1, 1971<br>
Author(s): AUBENQUE Pierre<br>
Abstract: Le structuralisme est défini ici comme le transfert du modèle structural, qui a fait ses preuves en linguistique depuis F. de Saussure, à d'autres domaines de la vie humaine. L'auteur s'interroge moins sur la légitimité d'un tel transfert, qui, dans certaines limites, peut toujours être épistémologiquement justifié, que sur les raisons philosophiques et sociologiques qui ont pu conduire à sa généralisation. Le structuralisme, qui a tendance à ramener les conflits historiques réels à un système d'oppositions signifiantes, n'est pas seulement incompatible avec le marxisme ; forme à peine plus subtile du positivisme, il est à ranger aussi bien parmi les produits idéologiques de la société industrielle avancée que parmi les symptômes de l'oubli de l'être. Structuralism transfers the structural pattern, which has proved successful in Linguistics since F. de Saussure, into other fields of human life. What is questioned here is less the legitimacy of that transfer which, within limits, may always be epistemologically justified, than the philosophical and sociological grounds of such a generalization. Structuralism, prone to reduce real historical conflicts to a system of signifying oppositions, is not only incompatible with Marxism, but, as a slightly more subtile form of positivism, is both an ideological product of advanced industrial society and a symptom of forgiveness of being.<br>

Abstract: Ce double souci s'illustre, semble-t-il, dans la préoccupation constante de Kant de conjuguer les méthodes apagogique et ostensive, d'articuler les textes des Critiques et les écrits sur l'histoire. L'unification d'une genèse idéale et d'une genèse empirique estelle possible ? N'est-elle que le signe d'une exigence théorique impossible à remplir, d'un des derniers rêves de la métaphysique ou d'une conception autre qui s'annoncerait d'une systématique en philosophie ? Even before the « Copernician Revolution » Kant's philosophy aimed at building a system, an architechtonic which would both provide a structural analysis of mental powers and describe their genesis. Is such unification of an ideal genesis and an empirical one possible ? If not, are we faced with the last dream of metaphysics or with a new systematical era in philosophy ?<br>

Abstract: L étude veut montrer que l'individualité n'appartient ni aux êtres inanimés, ni aux espèces biologiques mais qu'elle est une propriété de chaque être vivant au sens du langage courant. L'ontogenèse de l'individu est analysée sous trois aspects: 1. morphogénétique ou formatif, à partir du moment où le nouveau vivant se distingue de ses procréateurs tant chez les organismes à reproduction végétative que chez les organismes à reproduction sexuée ; 2. immunologique, par lequel l'organisme constitue son « soi » et discrimine entre le « soi » et le « non-soi » ; 3. psychologique, où entre en compte toute l'histoire relationnelle du vivant avec le monde extérieur. Chez tout vivant, de l'unicellulaire à l'homme, l'individualité acquise est complémentaire de l'individualité innée, déterminée par le matériel génétique. Mais la racine même de l'individualité doit être cherchée dans la dimension ontologique de l'être vivant qui est à l'origine des propriétés du système biologique : unité, subsistance dynamique, autonomie, indépendance, capacité d'auto-organisation, etc. L'évolution de l'individualité, coextensible à l'évolution de la vie, elle-même coextensible à l'évolution de l'être et de l'unité, témoigne de son caractère analogique. Définir l'individualité comme l'unicité propre à un système biologique nous paraît respecter son caractère analogique et cerner les éléments fondamentaux qui la constituent. The scope of this study is to show that individuality does not belong either to inanimate bodies or to biological species but is an attribute of the « living being » as commonly understood. The ontogenesis of the individual is analyzed with reference to three aspects : 1. morphogenetic or formative, from the time a new living being becomes distinct from its progenitors, in both cases of vegetative and sexual reproduction ; 2. immunologital, from which an organism establishes its « self » and distinguishes between « self » and « non-self » ; 3. psychological, in which the ent~<br>

Abstract: Depuis le célèbre article de Merleau-Ponty, « De Mauss à Claude Lévi-Strauss », la manière dont on évalue le rapport entre ces deux auteurs détermine ou exprime autant d'interprétations historiques du structuralisme et de choix théoriques ou philosophiques quant aux sciences sociales. Cette filiation se voulait une critique: être fidèle à la découverte de Mauss, celle du caractère central de la réciprocité dans la vie sociale, imposait de dépasser la sociologie vers une sémiologie générale. Cet article s'efforce de montrer qu'il ne s'agit pas là, contrairement à l'interprétation subtile qu'en fit Merleau-Ponty, défaire de la réalité sociale un système de points de vue substituables ou de mouvements córreles de subjectivation, mais de montrer que ce sont les « valeurs » qui, du fait de leur nature, de leur ontologie, doivent nécessairement circuler entre plusieurs points de vue exclusifs et complémentaires. Il revisite la célèbre critique de Lévi-Strauss à Mauss sur l'explication de l'obligation de donner par une « force des choses », et replace l'apport de l'anthropologie structurale dans la philosophie de l'esprit contemporaine, là où elle se confronte aux questions ouvertes par la physique sur l'ontologie des objets quantiques. Since Merleau-Ponty's famous paper « De Mauss à Claude Lévi-Strauss », the way the link between these two authors has been construed determine or reveal as many historical interpretations of structuralism as philosophical and theoretical choices about social sciences. We know that this vindicated kinship was supposed to be critical: being faithful to Mauss's discovery, that of the centrality of reciprocity in social life, compelled us to overcome sociology in the direction of a general semiology. This paper, in opposition at Merleau-Ponty's subtle interpretation of this move, tries to show that it was not aimed at a redefinition of social reality as a system of substitutablepoints of view and correlated movements of subjectivation, but at t~<br>

Abstract: A flood of research literature on 1 Corinthians over the last fifteen years suggests an understanding of this epistle and of the ethos of the church in Corinth that resonates closely with issues in our culture today. The ethos of "secular" Corinth still heavily influenced the church in Corinth. It encouraged attitudes that today we associate with consumerism, postmodernism, and social construction, together with an overpreoccupation with autonomy, success, audience-pleasing rhetoric, and a "local" theology. The church sought to choose its own leaders, its own ethics, its own socio-political value-system, and its own criteria of spirituality. However, Paul sets forth a formative understanding of the cross; an understanding of the Church as one, holy, catholic, and apostolic; a Christomorphic re-definition of "spiritual" and of the Holy Spirit; love and respect for "the other"; and the gift-character of grace and resurrection. How does this relate to hermeneutical distance and appropriation?<br>

Abstract: Information retrieval in the arts and humanities differs from that in the sciences because the documents required differ in many respects. Nevertheless, the Institute for Scientific Information® has successfully adapted its basic citation indexing system, first used in the "Science Citation Index"®, to its new "Arts & Humanities Citation Index™". Special adaptations of the system to meet the information needs of humanities scholars are discussed. The potential effects of the new index (and resulting data base) are seen as the promotion of interdisciplinary research, accessibility of bibliographic data for sociological and historical studies of humanities scholarship, and more objective methods for evaluating humanities journals.<br>

Abstract: Depuis une vingtaine d'années, la notion d'identité a été de plus en plus fréquemment utilisée dans des travaux portant sur la musique, sans que le sens qui lui est donné et les fonctions qui lui sont attribuées soient toujours précisément définis. Cet article voudrait contribuer à clarifier les rapports qu'entretiennent musique et configuration identitaire. Sur la base de travaux portant tant sur la théorie des identités que sur les identités en musique, il suggère que les significations sociales, donc identitaires, de la musique doivent être appréhendées dans les relations entre production, réception et matière musicale elle-même. La musique n'étant pas un langage mais un système symbolique aux interprétants infinis, elle est susceptible d'un grand nombre d'interprétations variables selon les situations et les enjeux; son utilisation en politique suppose par conséquent des opérations de façonnage spécifiques. For the past twenty years, studies of music have used more and more frequently the notion of identity. Yet the meanings given to "identity" in these studies, and the functions ascribed to it, have not always been precisely defined. This paper tries to clarify the relationship between music and identity configurations. Based on studies dealing with the theory of identity and with musical identities, it suggests that the social significations of music -identitarian significations included - must be understood as resulting from the intertwining of production, reception and the musical object itself. Music is not a language, but a symbolical system whose interprétants are infinite, it can consequently generate many diverse interpretations, which vary according to situations and stakes, and it needs to be specifically fashioned to be put to political uses.<br>

Abstract: A ideia de máquina ultrapassa as suas concretizações materiais sugerindo um certo tipo de objetividade e autonomia, inerente ao funcionamento de sistemas como o Direito. A conceção do Direito como uma espécie de máquina jurídica é ambivalente, mostrando tanto a imparcialidade do Direito como as suas perversões anti-humanas. A relação entre mente e corpo é central no Direito da responsabilidade, sugerindo, porém, uma máquina humana em que a responsabilidade corresponde apenas a uma técnica de preservação de um sistema. A pessoa, todavia, não tem de ser reduzida a um algoritmo como diz Penrose. É a configuração do objeto do Direito que o reduz a um funcionamento limitado e incapaz de uma justiça criativa. A redefinição do objeto humano no Direito reclama um novo pensamento, associado aos conhecimentos não jurídicos sobre o comportamento humano. The idea of machine exceeds its material embodiments suggesting a certain kind of objectivity and autonomy inherent to the functioning of systems such as Law. The conception of Law as a kind of legal machine is ambivalent, showing both the impartiality of the law as their anti-human perversions. The relationship between mind and body is central to the law of responsibility, even though suggesting a human machine on which liability is merely a technique for preserving a system. The person, however, need not be reduced to an algorithm as Penrose says. It is the configuration of the object of knowledge as a system identical to a machine and the subjects of norms as human machines which reduces it to a limited and incapable of running a creative justice. The redefinition of the human object in Law calls for a new thinking, not necessary associated with the legal knowledge about human behavior.<br>

Abstract: Psychology has uncritically adopted the individual person as its object of study without examining the concept and role of personhood within contemporary society and Western culture more generally. We examine three perspectives that challenge this familiar and unexamined object of our disciplinary inquiry: (1 ) Critical Theory's concept of the bourgeois individual as psychology's subject of ideology; (2) Poststructuralism's challenge to the concept of personhood as an integrated and self-present center of consciousness and action; (3) System Theory's alternative epistemology in which relations rather than entities have primacy. Each perspective introduces a concept of personhood that significantly differs from our present understanding of psychology's subject and that lays the foundation for a new subject of psychological inquiry: a multicentered, multidimensional subject.<br>

Abstract: Desde una perspectiva relacional y a partir de la información contenida en la correspondencia epistolar, este artículo estudia las prácticas mercantiles de los mercaderes vascos establecidos en Buenos Aires durante el período de guerras internacionales de finales del siglo XVIII. Tomando como mirador la Casa de comercio de don Martín de Álzaga, se explorar algunos de los mecanismos que articulaban la integración de los circuitos mercantiles rioplatenses en el sistema de la economía colonial. Entre ellos, las gestiones concretas llevadas a cabo por los «agentes de enlace» organizados por el jefe de la Casa dentro de una conformación familiar de la empresa. A partir d'une analyse en termes de réseaux sociaux et à partir des informations recueillies dans la correspondance, ce travail étudie les pratiques commerciales des commerçants basques installés à Buenos Aires durant la période des guerres internationales de la fin du XVIIIe siècle. Choisissant comme point d'observation la maison de commerce de don Martín de Álzaga il explore quelques-uns des mécanismes qui assuraient l'articulation des circuits commerciaux du Rio de la Plata avec le reste de l'économie coloniale. Parmi eux, le texte souligne l'importance des négociations menées par les « agents de contact » organisés par le chef de la maison commerciale dont la structure restait familiale. From a relational perspective and springing from information gotten form epistolary correspondence, this article studies the business practices of the Bask merchants who settled in Buenos Aires during the international war period towards the end of the eighteenth century. Having as observer Don Martin de Álzaga's business house, we will explore the mechanisms that articulated the integrations of the business circuits of the River Plate area in the colonial economic system. Among them, the concrete deals carried out by the «bond agents» organized by the House's boss within the familiar business constitution.<br>

Abstract: D'un côté, l'Enquête d'Hérodote rapporte les projets de domination qui, de Crésus à Xerxès, constituent la trame des rapports entre Grecs et Barbares, de 561 à 479. Mais, de l'autre, le lecteur ne peut oublier que de larges sections décrivent les coutumes et l'espace de nombreux peuples dès que la conquête les menace. Cette dynamique s'enracine dans les conditions matérielles de création et de lecture au Ve siècle avant J.-C, et dans les héritages narratifs que transforme Hérodote (Vies, Catalogues ...). Or aucun conquérant n'est glorifié ni présenté comme un vainqueur, tandis que les peuples visés opposent la singularité de leur espace et l'étrangeté de leurs coutumes, soit un genre de vie devenu stratégie de résistance, en associant particularisme insulaire et fuite calculée sur le modèle nomade. Les Grecs, de même, tantôt conquérants insatiables mais défaits, tantôt résistants invaincus, contribuent à monter que, chez Hérodote, l'autre a le visage de celui qui résiste plutôt que du Barbare. Il s'agit donc bien d'une autre écriture du passé, qui sauve de l'oubli tous les peuples décrits, non les seuls hauts faits des Rois. Les mêmes images sont employées pour décrire la résistance insulaire des nomades, et pour dire le cheminement de l'écriture, ainsi en relation d'homologie avec son objet. On one hand, Herodotus' Inquiry reports the plan of domination which from Croesus to Xerxes composes the system of the relation between Greeks and Barbarians, from 561 to 479. But on the other hand, the reader cannot forget that large sections describe customs and many people's area when they are threatened by conquest. This discrepancy has its roots in the material conditions of creativity and reading in the fifth century B.C., and to the narrative forms available to Herodotus (Lives, Lists...). However, no conqueror was praised nor spoken of as a victor, while people shown opposed their individual space and their peculiar customs, that is to say a way of life set up as a stra~<br>

Abstract: Metaphor, Vibration and Form identifies a process that underlies all ritual enactments. Whether it is Joseph Campbell's analysis of the Hero's journey, Victor Turner's theoretical and experiential interest in symbols, or Charles Laughlin's cycle of meaning, there is at work a particular kind of behavioral transformation system. It begins with the mind and the meanings provided metaphorically for symbols, then proceeds to an intense focus on symbolic sequences in meditation or in ritual dramas, so that the metaphor is taken into the body as physical experience. From this physical "ownership" of the metaphor, the properties associated with it are encouraged, socially and ritually, to come to the surface and be enacted in the form of everyday behavior. Questions of symbolic appropriation, the redundancy of symbol, and professional responsibility are addressed in the concluding remarks.<br>

Abstract: Rousseau opposed both traditional and modern (empiricist) thinking when he made self-love the cornerstone of his system. Other modes of thought treat self-consciousness as constituted primarily by temporal desire. Rousseau raises love, for him the suspension of desire, to a position of ontological primacy in regard to self-consciousness. Like Pascal, he throws the empirical existence of the self into radical question and finds it to be as insubstantial and empty a concept as the Western tradition has found it-from Ecclesiastes and Socrates on. Rousseau declines the moralistic reproof of the self, however, and emphasizes its insubstantiality as its one strength, although a fictional one. The self exists only in the mode of a hypothesis (the fictional "as if"): it is a failure at being. But to amour (and to pitié) it makes all the difference and is worthy of their support.<br>

Abstract: North Indian Rajput and south Indian Nattati Nadar weddings are compared to find the summary images of the bride in the two subcultures of the more general South Asian marriage system. "Woman as tribute" in contrast to "woman as flower" is revealed by such differences as the roles for relatives in the rituals, the severance and nonseverance of the bride from her kindred, and the cooling versus heating effects of preparatory baths.

Abstract: Heinrich Schenker's system can be read as narrative purveyed in the traditional genres of drama and epic. We begin with a discussion and critique of recent music-narrative studies and then propose a historicist interpretation of Schenker's work that concentrates on its ideological agenda. Finally, we respond to his system by displacing, expanding, and rewriting segments of its conceptual framework to permit multiple readings of a musical text (specifically, a brief fivefinger exercise by Carl Czerny) and to illustrate our contention that the so-called intrinsic value of an artwork has nothing to do with its internal relationships and everything to do with the expertise of the professional interpreter.<br>

Abstract: A conflict is a relational space in crisis in which the antagonists determine, in an interactive dynamic, what is at stake. As the negotiation goes by, ego states his truth line, while alter builds his offensive line based on a truth that becomes reality. Defending one’s truth means also fighting for one’s integrity; in other words, defining my truth is also giving a structure to my integrity, to my own self. If the literature of the I has frequently conflicts in its pages, it is probably because the reading pact is tied up to the truth. But making a narrative of the self out of the configuration system can also get the text in another kind of conflict where the frontiers of the diegetic levels become more and more permeable. Despite everything, the illocutary power in autobiographic literature, seems to change the way the « I » sees himself, and gives him a new ethos that suits him fine.<br>

Abstract: The essay deals the ways in which the «defeated» of the Social Republic have been told in the decades following their defeat. In particular, it analyzes the narrative strategies and the readings of the past through which the heirs of Republican fascism have tried to rebuild their historical legitimacy into a political system that had accepted their presence, but had assigned them – in the name of Anti-Fascism – a completely marginal place.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Citation is particularly potent for bridging. Even as it connects, it always recalls its displaced status. “Quotation is a constant reminder that writing is a form of displacement,” observes Said. “For although quotation can take many forms, in every one the quoted passage symbolizes other writing as encroachment…. As a rhetorical device, quotation can serve to accommodate, to incorporate, to falsify (when wrongly or even rightly paraphrased), to accumulate, to defend, or to conquer—but always, even when in the form of a passing allusion, it is a reminder that other writing serves to displace present writing.”
         
               Quotation is a “vigorous mechanism of displacement,” Antoine Compagnon agrees. “It's even more powerful than surgery.”75
            
               Contemporary descriptions of citation and the displacement it effects in experimental poetry are vivid and dynamic. In addition to the aforementioned uncreative writing (Goldsmith), there is Tan Lin's “plagiarism,” Sergio Waisman's “creative plagiarism,”76
            
               Haryette Mullen's “recyclopedia,”77
            
               and various critical descriptions of “syncretic poetics,”78
            
               “fragmentary collages that channel surf,”79
            
               and the “apotheosis of ‘contaminated language.’”80
            
               Some definitions stress the racial, political dimensions of self-fashioning and the “hunger for new forms,” as Kevin Young calls it. Young writes of “counterfeit culture,” which he defines as “the ways in which black writers create their own authority in order to craft their own, alternative system of literary currency and value, so to speak, functioning both within and without the dominant, supposed gold-standard system of American culture…. For the black author, and even the ex-slave narrator, creativity has often lain with the lie—81
            forgingan identity, ‘making’ one, but ‘lying’ about one too.”

Abstract: Recently, abolitionists have turned to what they say is their most powerful argument against the death penalty, namely, the execution of an innocent man, Troy Davis, in Georgia in September 2011. Davis was found guilty of killing a police officer while attempting to escape the scene of a robbery. The argument that the criminal justice system can make mistakes, however, is not an argument against the
      principleof the death penalty. Neither is the argument that lethal injection is cruel and unusual. Rather, these arguments allow that although the practice is flawed, the principle may be sound; if only we improve and perfect the practice, then we authorize the principle. The fantasy of humane painless instant death, technologically administered, contributes not only to the idea of the perfection of the means of death in order to justify the principle of the death penalty but also to the fantasy of death itself as anabsolute, in this case, the absolute end of suffering and pain.<br>

Abstract: A second strategy is Grosz's desubjectivation of memory: “Matter and life are thus not opposites, binary pairs (plus or minus vital force), but intimately implicated in each other, different degrees of one and the same force. Life is matter extended into the virtual; matter is life compressed into dormancy. Life erupts from (and transforms) the material conditions that enable matter to ‘remember’” (2011, 20). Focusing on memory as material event, I place Grosz's work alongside that of Paul Cilliers, author of the 1998 book
         Complexity and Postmodernism. Cilliers defines “memory” as a “physical condition of the brain: which pathways are breached (‘facilitated’) and which are not. Memory is not a cognitive function performed by a conscious subject, but an unconscious characteristic of the brain (which is an organ, part of the body). Memory is the substrate that sets up the conditions for all the functions of the brain” (1998, 45–46). Memory is a distributed pattern of valences across a complex system. It is an essential aspect of complex systems open to their environments, Cilliers maintains, because it offers resistance to environmental changes. Repeated patterns of distribution strengthen the connectedness of various nodes or elements involved in a given systemic pattern; repetition intensifies some networks at the expense of others. Without these transformations, an open system would simply mirror its environment (Cilliers1998, 92). However, such systems do not simply project immediate environmental inputs or conditions. Rather, in some configurations, matter retains or repeats patterns resulting from past stimulation; in some configurations, matterremembers. When it does, it differs from its environment while remaining fully within the impact and draw of whatever surrounds it. This differing is what enables a material system to organize itself, differing further from but responding constantly to its environment. Memory is not representation; Cilliers write~<br>

Abstract: Or take an example from ancient physics (2400 B.P.), Democritean atoms. Democritus theorized bits of matter so small
            in factbut alsoin principleto be too small to be humanly perceived. Yet he went on to hypothesize that their shapes werecausesof our perceptions. Thus smooth round shapes caused sweet tastes, while barbed ones caused bitter. From today's technologically embodied science we have now overcome his limitations with scanning, tunneling electronic microscopes and now know, recently, that two-atom-thick carbon films can be arranged into thirteen different multistable forms through imaging of the atoms. Thus, using the vocabulary of modernist realism, we could conclude that Democritean atoms never existed, or using the vocabulary of social constructionism, we could say that the ancient “scientific objects—Democritus's atoms” have disappeared to be replaced in the nineteenth century by Rutherfordian mini–solar system atoms and today again replaced by quantum structures. Or we could turn postphenomenological and note that through improved new instrumental technologies, we can now mediatedly “see” the carbon structures noted. What has changed with both Democritus and Rutherford are lifeworlds in which objects, knowledge production, and human–world interrelationships have been superseded.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Derrida is specifically addressing the role of hyperbole within his thought, but his argument is also driven by the hyperbolic through a practice of excess. He exaggerates the lie of exceeding the totality in order to “announce” the opening of the possibility, which paradoxically precipitates the structure of deferral it attempts to escape but is always entrenched within. Demonic, duplicitous hyperbole will always reach beyond its own economy of signification, but it will never succeed in exceeding because the heights of hyperbole always descend back into reeconomization, a point Derrida also makes in his discussion of hyperbole and negative theology. This highlights two characteristics of “demonic hyperbole” for Derrida that further reveal its errant structure: 1) its infinite deferral within a system it attempts to exceed and 2) its necessary force of repetition.<br>

Peters imagines Shaw's “dazzling display of partial truths [isolating] him in a moated tower from which he staged offensive forays against the medical world.”
      
            If his vehement rejection of germ theory and his sartorial preferences have proven as misguided as his beliefs on authoritarianism and eugenics, other commitments have fared better. Vegetarianism, for instance, is a common lifestyle choice nowadays, and Shaw enjoys a certain prominence in the history of the practice as well as on websites and blogs devoted to it. Characterizing the Edwardian medical system in the preface to26
         Doctor's Dilemmaas a “murderous absurdity,” he lived long enough to see the institution of the National Health Service in 1948, although still argued for a greater lay presence within its administration of physician licensing and training. In the twenty-first century, amid protracted health care debate in both the United States and the United Kingdom, proposed government regulation of medical apps on smartphones and tablets, and alarming physiological trends including skyrocketing obesity rates, many of Shaw's observations and positions speak almost as urgently to our time as they did to his.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, the astute logician in Shaw sees the newborn child as a commissioned envoy of divinity, whether that divinity is understood as the Judeo-Christian God, the Shavian Life Force, or the equivalent in some other belief system. Using the Christian sacrament of Baptism as a dispositive case in point, Shaw, always the cogent syllogist, argues that “if God is the Father of all men, and if the child is the father to man, it follows then that the true representative of God at the christening is the child itself.”
         
               Hence, from Shaw's considered viewpoint, if we seek the Kingdom of Heaven, we need not scour the galaxy frenetically. Instead, we should look no further than ourselves, for in each of us dwell effervescent particles of the same numen that breathes life into inert matter. In sum, for Shaw, every conception is immaculate,42
            
               and every child is a living incarnation of the primeval goodness that bathes the universe.43<br>

Abstract: To challenge an unexamined critical alignment with Ishmael's limited epistemology in Herman Melville's
         Moby-Dickshows how the placing of confidence in Ishmael as witness to Ahab's monomania leads to a misreading ofMoby-Dick. Ahab lies at the center of a highly developed epistemology that competes with and eludes the narrator's comprehension. The various trophies that appear throughout the text are manifest examples of this other-than-interpretive system of knowing, and Melville uses the act of possessing trophies, particularly the act of eating trophies, to show graphically how such a system works. In other words, Melville has developed a complex epistemological system of ingestion around Ahab to model how language can be materially invested with meaning and how that meaning is performed.<br>

Article Title: “The Literary Criticism of D. H. Lawrence.”<br>
Publisher: U of Wisconsin P<br>
Issue: style.34.issue-1<br>
Date: September 1, 1983<br>
Author(s): Peters Joan Douglas<br>
Abstract: It has been over ten years since anything significant has been published on D. H. Lawrence's critical prose, and nothing of note has ever been written on the subject of the short essays—“The Novel,” “Surgery for the novel—Or a Bomb,” “Morality and the Novel,” and “Why the novel Matters”—containing his theory of the novel. The rhetorical style Lawrence adopts is so informal, so comical, and often so bizarre that the impulse of critics, when they do refer to these essays, is to ignore the rhetoric and somehow extract a system of logocentric doctrine, a doctrine that does not bear scrutiny. To appreciate Lawrence's genre theory, one cannot ignore the style in which it is written but must instead focus on the dynamics of discourse comprising the rhetorical text. Grounding my reading in Bakhtin's
         carnival, I argue that Lawrence celebrates the novel in terms of its “joyful relativity” (Bakhtin's term), a theory that articulates itself performatively in different ways through its own deconstruction. Read deconstructively, Lawrence's genre theory offers an important contribution to modernist concepts of language, an area from which Lawrence has traditionally been entirely excluded.<br>

Abstract: There was a time when men wandered at large in the fields like animals and lived on wild fare; they did nothing by the guidance of reason, but relied chiefly on physical strength; there was as yet no ordered system of religious worship nor of social duties; no one had seen legitimate marriage nor had anyone looked upon children whom he knew to be his own; nor had they learned the advantage of an equitable code of law…. At this juncture a man—great and wise I am sure—became aware of the power offered by his mind for great achievements if one could develop and improve it by instruction. Men were scattered in the fields and hidden in sylvan retreats when he assembled and gathered them in accordance with a plan; he introduced them to every useful and honorable occupation, though they cried out against it at first because of its novelty, and then when through reason and eloquence they had listened with greater attention, he transformed them from wild savages into a kind and gentle folk.

Abstract: Joyce's world constantly undermines its own foundations. In this respect its aesthetic system resembles the perspective of Samuel Butler's Erewhonians: “when they profess themselves to be quite certain about any matter, and avow it as a base on which they are to build a system of practice, they seldom quite believe in it”—“they very often do not believe or mean things which they profess to regard as indisputable.”
         
               Thus Stephen Dedalus in107
            Ulysses(and in the National Library), having elaborated at some length his extraordinary biographical exegesis of the works of William Shakespeare, is asked whether he believes his own theory and replies that he does not.<br>

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: It is also worth noting that Bristol's assertion that architects are relatively powerless in determining the outcome, or consequences, of their works unfortunately encourages the view that architects thus need not take any responsibility for what they do. Such resignation would also seem to confirm the pointlessness of Utopia: if architecture is impotent in effecting “social change” because architects are “implicated” in the “structures and practices” of the system within which they operate, then their ability to plan a Utopia must be null. As bleakly attractive as this proposition might be, accepting it ignores the persisting existence of possibilities for subverting systems from within, even by architects entrapped by the forces of speculation that define the building industry. Unfortunately, it appears that this prospect is alien to Vidler, for example, who believes that “the fall of the Berlin Wall, the proclaimed death of communism and Marx, finished utopian thought very quickly. Perhaps one might say that utopian thought killed the possibility of utopian thought?”

Journal Title: Science Fiction Studies<br>
Article Title: Material Entanglements: Steven Hall’s<br>
Publisher: SF-TH Inc.<br>
Issue: sciefictstud.38.issue-1<br>
Date: 3 1, 2011<br>
Abstract: Characterizing the slipstream genre, Bruce Sterling locates it between mainstream and science fiction; it “sets its face against consensus reality” and makes us feel “very strange.” A strong slipstream candidate is Steven Hall’s
         The Raw Shark Texts(2007). Manifesting as a distributed literary system, the text has as its core a print novel, but other internet and real world sites also contain fragments or “negatives.” One of the text’s two villains, Mycroft Ward, has transformed into an online database; a posthuman subjectivity, he appropriates “node bodies” that upload their information and download new instructions. This separation of content (online database) from form (node body) is, according to Alan Liu, one of the primary characteristics of postindustrial knowledge work. To this extent, Hall positions his narrative not only against databases but also against knowledge that is, in Liu’s terms, autonomously mobile, transformable, and automated, having lost its material instantiation and been pulverized into atomized bits of information. The text’s second villain—a “conceptual shark,” the Ludovician—represents the complete fusion of form and content; the typographical symbols used to describe the shark also comprise its flesh in verbal and graphic representations. The text thus positions its protagonist, Eric Sanderson, as caught between twenty-first-century forms of knowledge and the implosion of signifier into signified. In this sense, the novel functions as a parable for the contemporary human condition, looking toward a posthuman future but incarnated within an ancient biological heritage.<br>
