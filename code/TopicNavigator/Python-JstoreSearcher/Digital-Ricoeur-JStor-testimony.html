  Abstract: In 1919, Raymond Crist, the director of citizenship in the Bureau of Naturalization, appeared before a House committee hearing on proposed changes to naturalization laws. In his opening statement, Crist suggested that the true import of his testimony was to praise the recent education initiatives of Americanization: “There is, however, a far greater subject which I should like to present to the committee for its most careful consideration. That subject is the all-absorbing, Nation-wide question rather loosely referred to by the term ‘Americanization.’”¹ For Crist, effective Americanization altered the hearts and minds of the unnaturalized. He explained, “Americanization work starts<br>

  Abstract: Traumatic violence has caught Oedipus in an ongoing repetition of mimetic rivalry, rooting him in an eternal present. Compellingly demonstrated not only in
                  Oedipus the Kingbut also inOedipus at Colonus, his trauma is visceral. For Oedipus’s suffering is written on his body: his unsightly face, expressed pain, and profound exhaustion offer graphic testimony.¹ Others reflect back to Oedipus their horror: Oedipusisa polluting presence.² Attentive to Oedipus’s distress, in this chapter I examine the representation of trauma as well as actions that promise to break open constraints on Oedipus, permitting the transformation of Oedipus’s memories.³ InOedipus<br>

  Book Title: Debates in Continental Philosophy: Conversations with Contemporary Thinkers-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: This important book brings together in one volume a collection of illuminating encounters with some of the most important philosophers of our age-by one of its most incisive and innovative critics.For more than twenty years, Richard Kearney has been in conversation with leading philosophers, literary theorists, anthropologists, and religious scholars. His gift is eliciting memorably clear statements about their work from thinkers whose writings can often be challenging in their complexity. Here, he brings together twenty-one originally published extraordinary conversations-his 1984 collection Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, his 1992 Visions of Europe: Conversations on the Legacy and Future of Europe, and his 1995 States of Mind: Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers. Featured interviewees include Stanislas Breton, Umberto Eco, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Herbert Marcus, George Steiner, Julia Kristeva, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard. To this classic core, he adds recent interviews, previously unpublished, with Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Jacques Derrida, and George DumZzil, as well as six colloquies about his own work.Wide-ranging and accessible, these interviews provide a fascinating guide to the ideas, concerns, and personalities of thinkers who have shaped modern intellec-tual life. This book will be an essential point of entry for students, teachers, scholars, and anyone seeking to understand contemporary culture.ContentsPrefacePart One: Recent DebatesJacques Derrida: Terror, Religion, and the New PoliticsJean-Luc Marion: The Hermeneutics of RevelationPaul Ricour: (a) On Life Stories (b) On The Crisis of Authority (c) The Power of the Possible (d) Imagination, Testimony, and TrustGeorges Dumzil: Myth, Ideology, SovereigntyPart Two: From Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, 1984Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics of the InfiniteHerbert Marcuse: The Philosophy of Art and PoliticsPaul Ricour: (a) The Creativity of Language (b) Myth as the Bearer of Possib~<br>

It appeared against the horizon of the two great historical catastrophes that left their mark upon that century, the First World War, in the case of Rosenzweig, and in that of Levinas, the Second World War and the massive extermination of the Jews by Nazi Germany.

  Abstract: Truth and reconciliation commissions are often claimed to be more victim-friendly than criminal trials. Indeed, being cross-examined by Slobodan Milosovic or simply being exposed to the intrinsic harshness of the adversarial criminal justice process is not likely to be “healing” to participating victims. In criminal courts, victims’ testimony is constantly cut short, and they are asked to focus on the forensic details. Indeed, the main reason for their presence in court is not to tell their story and have it validated publicly, but rather to provide a piece of the evidence in relation to which the question of the guilt<br>

  Abstract: The influence of classical rhetoric on the writing of history in the Middle Ages centred on the relationship between the depiction of character (attributes of person) and the description of deeds (attributes of events), on the invention of arguments (causation, testimony and proof), and on the construction of a brief, lucid and, above all, verisimilar narrative. This does not mean, of course, that all the principles involved in each one of these areas were applied either simultaneously or consistently across the broad range of writings which the single term

Behind this puzzle lies another. Is her text also primarily a testimony to her father’s intellectual legacy? In taking up her pen, is the daughter merely confirming the law of the father?

  Author(s) Schuchard Bruce G.<br>
  Abstract: John 8:12–20 depicts Jesus engaged in a debate with the Pharisees over the validity of his self-testimony. After Jesus claims to be the “light of the world” (8:12), the Pharisees reply that Jesus testifies to himself, which automatically invalidates the content of his testimony (8:13). Jesus counters their concern with a concession: “even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, because I know where I came from and where I go; but you do not know where I come from or where I go” (8:14).

  Book Title: Memory, Narrative and the Great War-Rifleman Patrick MacGill and the Construction of Wartime Experience<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Taylor David<br>
  Abstract: Memory, Narrative and the Great War provides a detailed examination of the varied and complex war writings of a relatively marginal figure, Patrick MacGill, within a general framework of our current pre-occupation with blood, mud and suffering. In particular, it seeks to explain how his interpretation of war shifted from the heroic wartime autobiographical trilogy, with its emphasis on 'the romance of the rifleman' to the pessimistic and guilt-ridden interpretations in his post-war novel, Fear!, and play, Suspense. Through an exploration of the way in which war-time experiences were remembered (and re-remembered) and retold in strikingly different narratives, and using insights from cognitive psychology, it is argued that there is no contradiction between these two seemingly opposing views. Instead it is argued that, given the present orientation and problem-solving nature of both memory and narrative, the different interpretations are both 'true' in the sense that they throw light on the ongoing way in which MacGill came to terms with his experiences of war. This in turn has implications for broader interpretations of the Great War, which has increasingly be seen in terms of futile suffering, not least because of the eloquent testimony of ex-Great War soldiers, reflecting on their experiences many years after the event. Without suggesting that such testimony is invalid, it is argued that this is one view but not the only view of the war. Rather wartime memory and narrative is more akin to an ever-changing kaleidoscope, in which pieces of memory take on different (but equally valid) shapes as they are shaken with the passing of time.<br>

  Abstract: Europe witnessed a revolution in memory during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By the eighteenth century, the ancient “arts of memory” were archaic. The explosive power of print had made it possible both to archive and to multiply knowledge cheaply and efficiently in books. Oral testimony was increasingly displaced by written records. New bureaucratic structures designed to record information on evergreater numbers of individuals abounded. Scientific discoveries forced a reappraisal of the very nature of the universe, including time as well as space.

The concept for this book began with the panel discussion "Preaching and the Personal: Prophecy, Witness and Testimony" at the 2010 meeting in Atlanta.

For some this means that their testimony might be considered to be more reliable than accounts in ordinary criminal cases because events would be fixed more firmly, more definitely, and, so the argument goes, more accurately, in their minds. On the other hand, trauma can adversely affect cognition. Memories can be fixed that do not necessarily coincide with physical reality. This does not mean that eyewitnesses are acting<br>

  Book Title: Dynastic Crisis and Cultural Innovation-From the Late Ming to the Late Qing and Beyond<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Wei Shang<br>
  Abstract: This volume addresses cultural and literary transformation in the late Ming (1550–1644) and late Qing (1851–1911) eras. Although conventionally associated with a devastating sociopolitical crisis, each of these periods was also a time when Chinese culture was rejuvenated. Focusing on the twin themes of crisis and innovation, the seventeen chapters in this book aim to illuminate the late Ming and late Qing as eras of literary-cultural innovation during periods of imperial disintegration; to analyze linkages between the two periods and the radical heritage they bequeathed to the modern imagination; and to rethink the “premodernity" of the late Ming and late Qing in the context of the end of the age of modernism. The chapters touch on a remarkably wide spectrum of works, some never before discussed in English, such as poetry, drama, full-length novels, short stories, tanci narratives, newspaper articles, miscellanies, sketches, familiar essays, and public and private historical accounts. More important, they intersect on issues ranging from testimony about dynastic decline to the negotiation of authorial subjectivity, from the introduction of cultural technology to the renewal of literary convention.<br>

  Book Title: Desi Divas-Political Activism in South Asian American Cultural Performances<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Mississippi<br>
  Author(s): Garlough Christine L.<br>
  Abstract: Case study chapters address the relatively unknown history of South Asian American rhetorical performances from the early 1800s to the present. Avant-garde feminist performances by the Post Natyam dance collective appropriate women's folk practices and Hindu goddess figures make rhetorical claims about hate crimes against South Asian Americans after 9/11. In
      Yoni ki Bat(a South Asian American version ofThe Vagina Monologues) a progressive performer transforms aspects of the Mahabharata narrative to address issues of sexual violence, such as incest and rape. Throughout the volume, Garlough argues that these performers rely on calls for acknowledgment that intertwine calls for justice and care. That is, they embed their testimony in traditional cultural forms to invite interest, reflection, and connection.<br>

  Abstract: Bearing witness is an ethical act. Whether a person bears truthful witness or false witness, the act involves moral agency. Choosing to testify to an experience or event that others, or the established narrative of a culture, may contest may alter the rest of a person’s life. Witnessing is not without cost to both the agent bearing witness and also possibly to the audiences, the secondary witnesses hearing or observing the testimony. Therefore, deciding to bear or not bear witness has moral and cultural significance. Consider the example of two British journalists working in Soviet Russia and the moral and<br>

  Book Title: Colombia’s Forgotten Frontier-A Literary Geography of the Putumayo<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): WYLIE LESLEY<br>
  Abstract: Coming to prominence during the tropical booms of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Putumayo has long been a site of mass immigration and exile, of subjugation and insurgency, and of violence. By way of a study of literature of and on the Putumayo by Latin American as well as US and European writers, Colombia’s Forgotten Frontier explores the history and enduring significance of this Amazonian border zone, which has been visited both physically and imaginatively by figures such as Roger Casement, José Eustasio Rivera, and William Burroughs. Travel writing, testimony, diaries, letters, journalism, oral history, songs, photographs, and ‘pulp’ fiction are all considered alongside more conventional forms such as the novel. Whilst geographically peripheral, the Putumayo has played a central role in Colombia and beyond, both historically and, crucial to this study, culturally, producing a literature of extreme experience, marginality, and conflict.<br>

Cornutus, Heraclitus the Allegorist, and Pseudo-Plutarch (the

From a phenomenological viewpoint, in the photograph, the power of authentication exceeds the power of representation’ (Barthes 1984: 88–9).

  Abstract: Drawing on a vast and diverse archive in theory, testimony, and image and on such thinkers as Karl Marx, Walter Benjamin, Theodor W.

Yet hidden within this melancholic tradition are the resources for a renewed challenge to prevailing regimes of historicity, a passion that has the power to reignite the dialectic of revolutionary thought.<br>

  Abstract: The short testimony I want to contribute to this colloquium about René Girard may very well start with this quotation from 
                     Things Hidden. My purpose is to show how the work of Girard has helped me to “complete” Heidegger, to clarify the meaning of his thought and eventually to reopen communication between (some part of) contemporary postmetaphysical philosophy and the Judeo-Christian tradition. This testimony is also meant as a thanks offering to Girard for all that I believe I have learned from him, although in doing so I may well have committed misunderstandings or distortions of his original intentions.<br>

  Book Title: El documental cinematográfico y televisivo contemporáneo-Memoria, sujeto y formación de la identidad democrática española<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): ESTRADA ISABEL M.<br>
  Abstract: Este libro evalúa la aportación del documental cinematográfico y televisivo producido en España a partir de los años 90 al debate en torno a la memoria de la represión franquista, por un lado, así como a la construcción de la identidad democrática, en términos más generales. Propongo que tanto los documentales con un enfoque histórico explícito como aquellos cuya mirada retrospectiva se realiza sin referentes tan concretos cuestionan el proyecto político teleológico concebido durante la Transición. La primera parte de mi estudio trata de la memoria histórica de la guerra civil específicamente y, la segunda, de la memoria en un sentido socioeconómico para apuntar el déficit de agencia del sujeto en la democracia neoliberal. En última instancia se reivindica la marginalidad social de la víctima a la vez que se deja al descubierto su obliteración de los procesos democráticos. Isabel M. Estrada is Visiting Assistant Professor, Franklin & Marshall College. ENGLISH VERSION This book examines how a selected group of documentaries made since 1995 for both film and television inform the debate centered on the so-called "recuperation of memory" of the Spanish Civil War and dictatorship. Estrada contends that these documentaries modify Spanish identity as it was conceived by the teleological historical project of the transition. The narrative of mass media should be examined in order to comprehend the process of the "recovery of memory" that culminated in the Law of Historical Memory (2007). She carries out a comparative analysis of the visual discourse of the documentary and the narrative discourses of history and testimony, paying special attention to the relations of power among them. Using theoretical frameworks provided by Badiou, Adorno, Renov, and Ricoeur, this study ultimately sheds light on the status of the victim in the context of Spain's neoliberal democracy. Isabel M.

  Abstract: As he grew up as the son of a Greek and Swiss mother and a Cherokee father, Thomas King’s childhood “involved a continual movement between communities and across various racial and cultural boundaries” (Davidson, Walton, and Andrews 2003, 4). The crossing of these borders equipped him with an acute understanding of how potentially harmful a dominant culture’s narratives may be for the members of a minority group (Andrews and Walton 2006, 603). In

Abstract: “On ne se détache pas du merveilleux, quand une fois on lui a donné sa créance, et pendant longtemps on s’acharne à rationaliser la merveille plutôt qu’à la réduire.”
         122Gaston Bachelard’s astute observation on the difficulty of dissolving wonder may sum up the history of attempts at naturalizing the resurrection. Yet the raising of the dead is a special case. It may be, if it ever happens, the wonder of wonders, but it also stands apart from the natural and preternatural marvels the Enlightenment sought to discredit and domesticate.123The criteria of testimony used to judge miracles or extraordinary phenomena can apply only indirectly to an event supposed to be outside time and space and one supposed to signal the end of nature and the universe. Although the intrinsic plausibility of resurrection could be questioned, belief in its probability or certainty did not count as the superstitious or “enthusiastic” product of a diseased imagination. The Enlightenment contributed to make the miraculous less prominent in theology and faith and to leave it behind as a silent and unsettled question on the edges of culture, ignored, like marvels, rather than debunked. In the process, the body was lost.<br>

Abstract: One of these Dissenting youths of the present day that Toulmin was anxious to reach was William Hazlitt. Born in 1778, the son of a Dissenting minister, he was educated at a Dissenting academy in the 1790s and sat briefly at the feet of Joseph Priestley in London after the Birmingham riots of 1791. Hazlitt later testified to the impact that Dissenting history had on him. In one of his brilliant political essays of 1819 he recalled with powerful nostalgia the political culture and bloody‐minded refusals of the eighteenth‐century Dissenters among whom he was raised. They “lived in thought,” as Hazlitt puts it, “with those who had borne testimony of a good conscience” and looked back to the Protestant martyrs of the Reformation. The canonical texts of this Dissenting tradition recalled by Hazlitt included, alongside the bible and Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, both Neal and Calamy: “they had Neal’s History of the Puritans by heart, and Calamy’s Account of the Two Thousand Ejected Ministers, and gave it to their children to read, with the pictures of the polemical Baxter, the silver‐tongued Bates, the mild‐looking Calamy, and old honest Howe.”
      65A few years later, in the chapter on Coleridge inThe Spirit of the Age,Hazlitt recounted how the radical young poet fell into the world of Dissent in the 1790s and was drawn into its historical narratives of Protestant martyrdom and “so dwelt for a while in the spirit with John Huss and Jerome of Prague and Socinus and old John Zisca, and ran through Neal’s History of the Puritans and Calamy’s Non‐Conformist’s Memorial, having like thoughts and passions with them.”66<br>

Abstract: To glean a better understanding of this key term, it will be useful to consider the use of the term
      documentumin Christian tradition. InBenjamin Major, Richard of St. Victor uses the termdocumentumin his analysis of the two highest forms of contemplation: above reason (fifth form) and beyond reason (sixth form). Recalling Exod. 25:18–20, where God orders Moses to build a sanctuary and, at both sides of the oracle, to place two cherubim facing each other, their faces turned toward the propitiatory, Richard recommends that we “hammer out the form of angelic similitude in ourselves,” since “cherub” stands for “fullness of knowledge.”31Respectful of this divine “pattern” (documentum) and “testimony” (documentum), we should “spread out the wings of our cherubim” and long “to meet the grace of a showing.”32
         Documentois thus both inner nourishment and the ritual leading to that spiritual nourishment (God himself explains how the two cherubim must look at each other but also face toward the propitiatory). Let us remember that the worddocumentumderives from the Latindocere(to teach) andmens(intellect). As spiritual food,documentoevokes the Eucharist, as Thomas writes in the hymnPange lingua: “let the old law yield to the new rite” (antiquum documentum novo cedat ritui).33<br>

Abstract: To this I would add that information exchange that consists mainly of mutual witnessing, plus supplementary information to put such testimony in a proper context, occurs from two participant perspectives: those of the self and of the other. After all, the two parties are informing each other, each from its own religious tradition, about the beliefs, values, norms, rituals, and customs they hold dear and what these mean to them. Put differently: it is not a case of communicating religio‐scientific, but theological, insights.<br>

Article Title: Translating Time: The Nature and Function of Joseph Smith’s Narrative Canon<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Though occupied with an ancient figure, the Enoch narrative directs faithful readers of the JST to a future project: the return of Zion in fulfillment of God’s promise to Enoch and, through Enoch, to all the posterity of Noah. In the “last days,” there would be “great tribulations … but my people will I preserve,” God promised. Specifically, “righteousness will I send down out of heaven, and truth will I send forth out of the earth, to bear testimony of mine Only Begotten.”
         88To Latter‐day Saints, this is nothing less than the heavenly messengers sent to Smith and the unearthing the Book of Mormon’s “golden plates,” which constituted a second witness of Christ by restoring “many plain and precious things” lost from the Bible.89Smith’s narratives weave Mormonism into biblical history, but not as an aspiration to “live ancient lives” so definitive of the Latter‐day Saints' Puritan progenitors. Smith’s followers did not believe their “commonwealth should subside into the routine of the communal covenant: a rhythm of declension and return with a basically static religious and social framework” modeled on a biblical past.90Rather, the Latter‐day Saints aspired to become Enochs in their own right: walking and talking with God and exercising their own powers within a new Zion wherein God would make his millennial abode. In 1836, the Latter‐day Saints’ dedicated their first temple with a song that included the lyric:
               The Latter‐day Saints understood themselves both as beneficiaries of God’s grace and as God’s agents for overcoming of the effects of the fall. The full eschatology of Smith’s Adamic myth is found in the promise made to Enoch, like the promise made to Abraham “that his people would have a salvific relation with God is an inexhaustible promise … as such it opens up a history in which this promise can be repeated and reinterpreted over and over again.”The latter day glory begins to come forth;The visions and blessings of old are returning;~<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Rather than simply reading Ricoeur’s work in chronological sequence to make this case, Hall aims for what he calls a “critical constructive interpretation” that will yield something like a “situated reading” of Ricoeur’s thought (4), one that will better demonstrate this thesis than Ricoeur’s own words do. Basically, the structure of the argument Hall proposes begins from what Ricoeur has to say about the idea of agency in relation to the understanding of selfhood. Hall then moves on to consider the narrative configuration of a meaningful existence that follows from this understanding. He then takes up questions that can arise regarding our practical experience and moral concerns from this perspective. It is the testimony of conscience that comes in at this latter level that brings in the theological perspective. It does so through a discussion of what Ricoeur has to say about the Golden Rule in relation to the love commandment and in relation to what Ricoeur calls a logic of superabundance, one that goes beyond any logic of equivalence. It is this idea of a possible logic of superabundance that leads in turn to a discussion of what Hall calls the economy of the gift and the poetic imperative that Hall sees in Ricoeur’s concept of a theonomy that stands over against Kant’s call for an autonomy that all too easily isolates people from one another. It is love that drives this poetic imperative, and what love calls for is something more than, not less than, justice.<br>

Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: Recall that the great insight of the Hellenistic and early Christian humanists, as Werner Jaeger recounted it, was to think through the opposition. As he noted, “Theology was intended from the very beginning to transcend humanism but at the same time it was the true fulfillment of the task which humanism had formulated.”
         38A “theology” implied apaideiaor a form of education that provided orientation to individuals and societies. Further, the biblical religions and the modern critics of religion advanced the insight that life, the flourishing of existence, and not death can and must orient human action. The task is to overcome the alienation of life from itself. More provocatively, I contend that the call of conscience to that task arises through the tensions among remembrance and love and is itself testimony to the life of our life, a vitality construed theologically as the “God” who communicates life and invigorates freedom and responsibility for new life. The remembrance of death is indeed at the origins of the sense of responsibility. I am bound to orient my power responsibly rooted in the vulnerability of mortal being—my own and that of others—to violence. Yet when one interrogates the complexity of religious symbols and practices along with the dynamics of mortal experience inscribed in the love of life, one can come to see, I submit, that the purpose of responsibility is to respect and enhance the integrity of life. Power ought to serve the integrity of life; responsibility is power so oriented and exercised.<br>

Abstract: Henry Turner's essay returns us to the very notion of “form” to underscore once again this key commonality that ties together literature and science, the literary scholar, the historian of science, and the scientist. In so doing, he works to dispel the text/action dichotomy, in part by noting that the “category of form” itself embraces “meaningful artifacts” of the sort that constitute the very material tools of the trade of the practices through which scientists make scientific knowledge: for example, “physical specimens, instrument readings, photographs, models.” Citing a range of examples that include Francis Bacon and Galileo, Turner importantly insists that form, while critical to making knowledge, is “never simply a tool of knowledge” but, rather, is always about the constitution of things, about “ontology.” Thus the forms utilized by scientists, whatever their particularity as “meaningful artifacts” may be in a given instance, also serve to gather together, to relate and draw into relation with one another, features of an experienced world that form associations as objects and as “enduring network[s]” of things. The final essay, by Colin Milburn, also highlights the dynamic nature of texts, particularly by drawing attention to their ability to constitute themselves as, and hence actively create, “assemblages.” His discussion of the relation of science to science fiction through processes collectively termed “modding” (processes of “reworking and transforming”) points to just this generative and dynamic property of texts that once again underscores the creative and pragmatic conjoining of text and action. By analyzing the specific forms that “mods” take in translating science fiction among “scientists as cultural consumers” into the work of the laboratory, Milburn provides testimony for one possible site where we may witness the continuing role that the fictive might play in science.<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D.<br>
Abstract: The value of Popkin's approach becomes clear in his chapter on two historians whose autobiographies have been included in the literary canon for many years: Edward Gibbon and Henry Adams. By reading them as historians, Popkin offers new insights to an already great body of literature on these authors, for instance by showing that both Gibbon and Adams believed that their personal experiences helped them in understanding the past. Not all 327 autobiographers listed in the bibliography are discussed in depth, and in chapters on vocation and career their works serve to sketch an impression of the historical profession in the twentieth century. Bookish children from middle‐class backgrounds, as most historians have been, often picked up their vocation from parents or teachers. They were also often inspired by children's books like those by Jules Verne and Karl May, which is interesting, because despite these literary models they chose to write nonfiction. For Popkin this is a telling detail, as he concludes that historians are obviously motivated by a wish to tell stories. With few exceptions historians are reluctant to write about their careers. Most are silent about their academic successes, failures, and frustrations, and few pages are spent on the daily life of teaching courses and doing administrative work. On the contrary, most authors want to show that they had another life besides their profession. Therefore they often describe their own lives against the background of great events. Since Jean‐Jacques Rousseau's
      Confessions, autobiography has been seen as a genre that should focus on the innermost experience and not world events, but many historians simply could not cast off their professional background. Often only those historians who were involved in politics became aware of how little an individual could accomplish, or lost faith in the ideas they once had believed. Holocaust memoirs are discussed in a separate chapter, in which Popkin concludes that t~<br>

Abstract: The process by which a neophyte approaches a religious group has a particular interest. The importance of the relation between leader and followers is thus revealed. The symbolic manipulation of charisms is the fundamental instrument allowing to maintain leadership. The steps of conversion, testimony and prophecy are decisive. Thus the deep link between charism and word is unveiled: the talk involves different modalities in the use of the word, the final interpretation of whic is always given by the charismatic leader.<br>

Author(s): Latourelle René<br>
Abstract: The author studies systematically the internal criteria which he considers most valid, in so far as they are critically established, for providing access through the gospels to Jesus and for guaranteeing the historical authenticity of his life and message. After placing the problem of establishing valid criteria (la critériologie) in the context of the current critical study of the gospels and offering a number of critical observations designed to avoid confusions (especially the distinction between pure data, criteria and proof; between literary and historical criteria; between criteria and the intellectual attitudes that thereby follow), the author presents and discusses seven criteria which he groups under three headings: basic criteria (critères fondamentaux), dependent criteria (critères dérivés), and composite criteria (critères mixtes). Among the basic criteria he discusses: 1. the criterion of multiple testimony, together with the principal objection which can be raised against it, i.e. the extent to which one can speak of independent sources with regard to the gospels since all derive from oral tradition; 2. the criterion of discontinuity, considered on the levels of form and content; 3. the criterion of conformity (or of continuity or coherence), including the different formulations which contemporary exegetes propose, as well as its connections with the criterion of discontinuity; 4. the criterion of required explanation (explication nécessaire) or of sufficient reason for a group of convergent and well-attested facts. As an example of a dependent criterion called such since it is established in relation to the basic criteria, the author proposes the living, personal style of Jesus as distinguished from the gospels' literary style. Finally, among the composite criteria, that is to say the cases where an important literary characteristic is linked with one or several historical criteria, he mentions: the internal intelligibility of an account or of a group~<br>

Abstract: Abordaremos a autobiografia de Malcolm X (1925-1965) sob o prisma de uma hermenêutica do testemunho: ao aplicar a hermenêutica do testemunho na referida autobiografia, identificaremos as duas profundas transformações psicológicas e espirituais sofridas por Malcolm X, transformações indissociáveis de uma mudança na sua relação com a transcendência, o Islamismo e a comunidade afro-americana do seu tempo. Trata-se, em última análise, de percorrer a evolução de uma consciência humana que se cumpre e se manifesta na religiosidade (não-violência) e no testemunho. Neste estudo, o rito aparecerá como "passagem" no contexto da (re-)integração e (re)educação segundo o modelo da adoração (Mestre/discípulo), mediada pelo desejo mimético, cuja função é purgativa e fundacional porque reorientadora da existência do discípulo. O rito será visto ainda como "sinal da aceitação do testemunho". No contexto de testemunho, extrairemos ainda uma noção de coragem, integrante de noções contemporâneas. We will approach the autobiography of Malcolm X (1925-1965) from the point of view of a hermeneutics of testimony: on applying the hermeneutics of testimony in the said autobiography, we will identify the two deep psychological and spiritual transformations suffered by Malcolm X, transformations that can't be separated from a change in his relationship with the transcendence; the Islamism and the African American community of his time, being, ultimately, the go through of the evolution of human consciousness that meets and manifests itself in religion (non-violence) and witness. In this study, the rite will appear as "passage" in the context of (re-) integration and (re-)education according to the model of worship (master/disciple), taking part in the mimetic desire, whose function is purgative and functional because reorienting the existence of the disciple, the rite is still seen as "a sign of acceptance of the witness." Even in the context of testimony, we will demonstrate a sense of courag~<br>

Abstract: O filme Diamante de Sangue [Blood Diamond] de Edward Zwick oferece a possibilidade de uma reflexão à volta de três aspetos da noção de testemunho no âmbito da Filosofia da Religião: 1) a ideia de que o testemunho (absoluto), enquanto matriz das culturas humanas, sustenta a atividade jornalística e a sociedade da informação possibilitando não apenas a sua desconstrução como também a (re-)atualização de uma dimensão testemunhal do jornalismo; 2) as condições de possibilidade da conversão da consciência, isto é, da rutura com o estado de má-fé (auto-engano) necessária à consciência testemunhal e religiosa; 3) a indissociabilidade da experiência testemunhal e da doação, correlativas da experiência religiosa entendida como "fundação mútua" do divino e da testemunha (constituinte), experiência religiosa da qual surge o testemunho. Acrescentaremos ainda a ideia de que a experiência testemunhal ganha sentido à luz da metafísica do tempo do projeto. The film Blood Diamond from Edward Zwick offers the possibility of a reflection concerning three aspects of the concept of testimony within the Philosophy of Religion: 1) the idea that the testimony (absolute), while source of human cultures, supports the journalistic activity and gives information to the society; not only in its deconstruction but also in (re-)updating the testimonial dimension of journalism, 2) the conditions of possibility of the consciousness conversion, meaning, the rupture with the state of bad faith (self-deception) will required to the testimonial and religious consciousness, 3) the inseparability of the testimonial experience and donation, correlates in the religious experience, understood as “mutual foundation” of the divine and the witness (constituent), religious experience from which comes the testimony. We add further the idea that the testimonial experience makes sense in light of the metaphysics of time of project.<br>

Abstract: Matter, p. 61: "It is likely that these materials were copied and collected as part of an
unsuccessful attempt to canonize Maria Domitilla. But the very content of Maria Domitilla's
testimony of self is carefully, and I would argue, consciously, cast in hagiographical form". Più di
una volta, nella Vita è ribadita l'appassionata proiezione - identificazione con le vicende cristiche,
sviluppatasi fin dalla primissima infanzia: "[A] circa sei anni cominciai a sentirmi crescer il
desiderio di servir al Signore, quai mi pareva amar grandemente piü de' miei genitori e piü d'ogni
altra cosa. Onde cercavo [di] intendere da mia madre chi era il Signore e la pregavo che mi
raccontasse che cosa elli aveva fatto per nostro amore.... E quando sentivo o raccontavo tali
cose, sentivo un giubilo nel cuore... grandissimo; ma, alii misteri della Santissima Passione, mi
sentivo riempir di compassione e mi cadevano le lacrime dalli occhi" (cc.13 v., 14 r. e v.). Nella
comice dell'agiografia è pure collocabile il seguente brano in cui, al momento dell'accettazione in
convento il medico del Santissimo Sacramento prevedendo "gran cose" nel futuro di Domitilla:.
. disse [alle monache] che non badassero ad accettarmi, perché aveva visto in me un non so che
[di] divino e che avevo presto a diventar santa" (c. 96 r.)<br>

Abstract: Este artículo está orientado a precisar las relaciones entre experiencia corporal de las mujeres y testimonio. Un largo hábito de subalternidad ha expropiado a las mujeres de la posibilidad de tomar la palabra sobre sus experiencias corporales. Es por ello la importancia que tiene la singularidad de sus testimonios, que implica tomar la palabra en una situación de imposibilidad del lenguaje; es siempre el relato de un acontecimiento traumático del que se habla, pero del que también podría no hablarse. El sujeto/a que toma la palabra da cuenta de un conocimiento que - si bien es precario - constituye un saber del que antes no se tenía registro. Es que el testimonio pone en juego la relación entre la lengua y el archivo. Exige una subjetividad que atestigüe sobre la posibilidad misma de hablar, un/a sujeto capaz de pronunciar lo "inaudito", produciendo con su palabra una intervención ética. La autoridad del testimonio depende de una relación inmemorial entre lo indecible y lo decible, produce una palabra que nombra una experiencia singular. Las palabras de las mujeres que relatan experiencias corporales nombran una dimensión fundamental de nuestra experiencia, la de la diferencia sexual produciendo un dislocamiento en la presunta neutralidad de la lengua. Se trata de una reflexión que abre la posibilidad de poner palabras a lo innombrable. The aim of this article is to specify the relationships between corporal experiences of women and testimony. A long habit of subordination has expropriated the women of the possibility of speaking of their bodily experiences. Thus, the importance of the singularity of their testimonies, which implies beginning to speak in a situation of impossibility of the language. This is always the account of a traumatic event, but which could also not be spoken about. The individual who speaks shows an awareness that, even though insufficient, constitutes a knowledge that has not been registered before. The testimony brings into play the link b~<br>

Abstract: The present article argues that Hélène Berr's Journal goes well beyond mere testimony to provide an astute analysis not only of the persecutory measures, arrests, camps, and deportations but also of the various attempts to camouflage the violence and even of the wider implications of what she ultimately recognized to be a systematic extermination. Hélène Berr thus presents an extraordinary case of a young French Jewish student at the Sorbonne who, steeped in literature but untrained in history, nevertheless achieved a degree of historical lucidity that, in view of the confused, limited, and often unreliable information available to her in Nazi-occupied Paris, we can only consider as remarkable. Above all, Hélène Berr's very personal confrontation with history, as it unfolded in all the sinister complexity of what we now know as the Holocaust, enables us to better understand these events in the human terms in which they were experienced and with the ethical dimensions that they take on for us today.<br>

Abstract: The representation of history continues to evolve in the domain of museum exhibitions. This evolution is informed in part by the creation of new display methods-many of which depart from the traditional conventions used to achieve the "museum effect"-in part by an increased attention to the museum-visitor relationship. In this context the ethical force of bearing witness, at times a crucial aspect of the museum experience, has emerged as a particularly compelling issue. In seeking to represent and address atrocity, injustice, and the abrogation of human rights, museums have the potential to become "sites of conscience" and to encourage "historical consciousness." Through a series of three exhibitions devoted to slavery, the New-York Historical Society demonstrated how such sites can be constructed and how objects can be deployed to represent extreme or "limit cases." In this review/essay I investigate and interrogate these exhibitions, looking closely at the use of objects as a source of "indirect testimony" (Marc Bloch) and at the "dialogical situation" (Paul Ricoeur) that might arise in an encounter among objects, exhibit narratives, and visitors. Thinking in terms of point of view, I look at the variety of rhetorical platforms from which objects speak in these exhibitions; thinking in terms of syntax, I look at the effects of ordering and of the radical juxtaposition of objects; thinking in terms of irony, I look at the provocations of double-voiced narratives and at how objects are used to support those historical sentences.<br>

Abstract: The trial of Adolf Eichmann, in 1961, is generally considered a turning point in the history of Holocaust memory because it brought the Holocaust into the public sphere for the first time as a discrete event on an international scale. In the same year, Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin's film Chronicle of a Summer appeared in France. While absent from scholarship on memory of the Nazi genocide for over forty years, Chronicle of a Summer contains a scene of Holocaust testimony that suggests the need to look beyond the Eichmann trial for alternative articulations of public Holocaust remembrance. This essay considers the juxtaposition in Chronicle of a Summer of Holocaust memory and the history of decolonization in order to rethink the "unique" place that the Holocaust has come to hold in discourses on extreme violence. The essay argues that a discourse of truth and testimony arose in French resistance to the Algerian war that shaped and was shaped by memory of the Nazi genocide.<br>

Abstract: El artículo analiza las condiciones de validez del testimonio en ciencias sociales. Sus potencialidades centrales son el constituir un campo de exploración e investigación de acercamiento a la subjetividad, especialmente a la de los sectores populares. Ello ha permitido incorporar sus discursos y representaciones en las ciencias sociales. Sin embargo, dicha incorporación se ha realizado bajo una perspectiva empirista, según la cual el testimonio es una representación inmediata, directa de los sujetos, lo que oculta la mediación del testimonio a través del cientista social, particularmente mediante la entrevista. Por ende, la idea del testimonio como una "voz de los sin voz" oculta el diálogo entre investigador-sujetos, que podría ser potenciado en un tipo de investigación hermeneútica en la que el investigador ya no ostentaría el monopolio de la interpretación. This article analises the validity conditions of "testimony" as a methodological tool in the social sciences. The principal advantage of testimony is that it enables the construction of research and analysis of subjectivity, particularly with popular sectors. This has facilitated the incorporation of their discourses and representations into the social sciences. Notwithstanding, this incorporation has occurred within a highly empiricist perspective, whereby testimony is an immediate representation of the individual. The mediation of the social scientist, which is particularly significant in interviews, remains hidden. The concept of testimony, therefore, as the "voice of the voiceless" disguises the dialogue between the researcher and the individual. This dialogue could be further developed as an instrument of hermeneutical research, whereby the researcher no longer monopolises interpretations.<br>

Abstract: Ce sont quelques temps forts du parcours scientifique de l'historien Carlo Ginzburg qui sont abordés dans cet entretien. Évoquant les rencontres et les lectures qui ont déterminé sa formation d'historien, évaluant l'aventure de la microhistoire, C. Ginzburg aborde également les caractéristiques majeures de sa démarche, et revient sur les principaux débats auxquels il a pris part, ainsi que les questions que ne manquent pas de soulever ses travaux: le statut des témoignages figurés en histoire, les rapports entre morphologie et histoire, les modalités de la connaissance en histoire. The highlights of the scientific career of the historian Carlo Ginzburg are discussed in this interview. C. Ginzburg discusses the encounters and readings that had a decisive effect on his training as an historian and evaluates the adventure of micro-history. He also discusses the main features of his approach and comes back to the principal debates in which he has taken part, as well as the questions inevitably raised by his work: the status of figurative testimony in history, the relationship between morphology and history and the methods of historical knowledge.<br>

Publisher: Leo S. Olschki<br>
Issue: e26230922<br>
Date: 8 1, 2008<br>
Abstract: In 2008, as a follow-up to the initiative taken the previous year, ISRE – Istituto Superiore Regionale Etnografico
         [Superior Regional Ethnographic Institute]organized the seminarGramsci ritrovato, tra Cirese e i Cultural Studies(Nuoro, October 24th- 25th, 2008)[Gramsci rediscovered: between Cirese and the Cultural Studies]. The seminar focused on another ‘find’: the readings of Gramsci’s works on folklore that Cirese had elaborated thirty-eight years before. The idea came from Giorgio Baratta, who – in hisGramsci in contrappunto [Gramsci in counterpoint](Carocci 2008) – has given special attention to an analysis of Cirese’s essayConcezioni del mondo, filosofia spontanea e istinto di classe nelle “Osservazioni sul folklore” di Antonio Gramsci [World Views, Spontaneous Philosophy and Class Instinct in the “Observations On Folklore” by Antonio Gramsci](1970). Giulio Angioni’s and Pietro Clemente’s contributions – coming, in part, from an intellectual autobiography standpoint (they both have been Cirese’s students at first, and his colleagues later) – helped elucidate the method and the contents of Cirese’s work. They also dealt with Gramsci, in order to theoretically reconstruct the foundations of Italian folklore studies between the Sixties and the Seventies of XX Century. Baratta’s renewed reading, a part of which we here republish, together with Brigitte Wagner’s contribution (dedicated to the issue of the feasibility of translations of languages and cultures), give evidence to the prospect of a vitality of Cirese’s critical work outside the usual context of Italian folklore studies. Prospect and vitality that have been demonstrated by Cirese himself, who, during the 2008 seminar in Nuoro, was a protagonist of the dialogue with other scholars as well as with the public that intervened in the debate. He was a generous testimony of the large spectrum of his interests, mostly methodological, and he very carefully underlined, with respect to Gramsci, two aspect~<br>

Abstract: Le problème de la représentation du passé ne commence pas avec l'histoire mais avec la mémoire qui a le privilège de la reconnaissance intuitive et directe des images gardées de l'impression en nous de la marque du passé, avec toutes les difficultés liées à la fiabilité relative de la mémoire. Le problème chemine à travers tous les stades de l'opération historiographique: témoignage et archive, — explication/compréhension —, représentation narrative et rhétorique au niveau du texte final de l'historien. Entre la mémoire et l'histoire, l'ordre de priorité reste indécidable. /// The problem of the representation of the past does not begin with history, but with memory. Memory has the capacity to recognize intuitively and directly the images we keep of the impression the past makes on us, with all the uncertainties stemming from its questionable reliability. This problem concerns all stages of the historiographic process: testimony and archives — explanation/comprehension — narrative and rhetorical representation during the writing of the historian's final text. But one thing remains certain, it is impossible to give priority to either memory or history.<br>

Abstract: Dans ce plaidoyer argumenté en faveur de l'histoire du temps présent, François Bédarida lève une à une les objections faites à ce champ historiographique regardé, quelquefois encore, avec suspicion. Cette notion de temps présent est définie dans une mise en perspective avec le passé et l'avenir. En définitive, l'historien, confronté à la mémoire immédiate des témoins, trouve dans le temps proche un terrain à la fois fragile et fécond. Depuis une vingtaine d'années, l'histoire du temps présent contribue au renouvellement du champ historiographique, tant par le regard qu'elle permet d'offrir sur la notion d'historicité que par la mise en œuvre de pratiques particulières. Les objections formulées à son égard sont cependant nombreuses: absence de recul, manque ou, au contraire, surabondance des sources, incomplétude de l'objet, flou sur la définition même du champ d'études. Or l'intérêt de l'étude du très contemporain réside justement dans la complexité des liens que le présent entretient avec le passé et l'avenir: un temps présent qui fait figure de trait d'union entre ces différentes temporalités à l'image d'un passeur ou d'un traducteur. Mais bâtir une histoire du temps récent ne consiste pas à faire œuvre de mémoire: si l'historien se nourrit des témoignages de ses contemporains, il exerce son regard critique sur eux et, tâche tout à fait inconfortable, fait œuvre d'explication en fonction d'un présent dont il est à la fois l'acteur et l'interprète. /// Over the last twenty years, the history of the present has renewed historiography through the vision it provides on the notion of historicity as well as by the implementation of particular practices. But there are many objections to it: a lack of distance; either a lack of or too many sources; the lack of completion of the object, blurriness about the very definition of the field of study. Nevertheless, the author suggests that the interest in the study of the contemporary dwells in the complexity of the links the pr~<br>

Author(s): Nauta Rein<br>
Abstract: Augustine's conversion is considered exemplary for its Christian testimony. However, the psychological aspects are also relevant, for Augustine's conversion to Christianity was as much inspired by personal and cultural ambitions as by religious convictions. For Augustine, the conversion to the Christian faith spelled a life of asceticism— a life of celibacy, a virtuous and chaste existence, which also offered him a means of escape from the threatening ambiguity of parental relations and a chance to realize the cultural ideal of the civilized philosopher who has subjugated the passions of the flesh. In this paper we explore the psychological dynamics of the absent father, the suffering mother and the prodigal son and the role they played in Augustine's conversion to Christianity.<br>

Abstract: The impact of modernity, the recognition of which was central to ethnographic testimony, has been challenged by self-referential cultural criticism. A growing awareness of cultural representations has been advocated within the frame of narrative ethnology. This shift towards understanding and interpretation is pointing not only to an ethnographic dialogue, as it has been suggested, but also to cultural relativism. Furthermore, as a result of conflicting interpretations, there has been a tendency to overemphasize the diversity of cultural identities. Instead of hallowing relativistic claims for "readability," more realistic attempts have to be made towards complex situations facing the intricacies of contemporean modern life.<br>

Publisher: Oral History Society<br>
Issue: i40028140<br>

Author(s): Gildea Robert<br>
Abstract: This paper is the text of an inaugural lecture given as Professor of Modern History in the University of Oxford on 7 November 2008. It arises from a research project entitled Around 1968: Activism, Networks, Trajectories', which involves a team of historians examining samples of activist networks in fourteen European countries, in order to understand ways of becoming an activist, being an activist and making sense of activism. The key terms of this project are transnationalism – tracing resonances and interactions between activists and activist networks across frontiers – and subjectivity – using oral testimony to understand the phenomenon of activism. The framing and presentation of the project incited a rethink of the methods of oral history, not least because the project originated in Oxford, where scepticism persists about the credibility of oral history as a discipline. To persuade this audience of the power of oral history, the approach was taken to locate it at the confluence of three recent developments which have impacted on the study of history as a whole: the linguistic turn, memory studies, and interest in subjectivity, intersubjectivity and the unconscious. These reflections are then used to illuminate evidence drawn from French activists interviewed in the course of 2007 and 2008.<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'interroge sur le statut à la fois épistémologique et ontologique d'un passé qui « a été » et dont les individus comme les sociétés retiennent le souvenir, mais qui, comme le langage ordinaire l'exprime, « n'est plus » . Toute une tradition de réflexion sur la conservation du passé par la mémoire depuis Platon et Aristote a voulu ramener la mémoire à la métaphore de l'empreinte. En revanche, cet article tente de montrer que la mémoire à plusieurs dont dépend la connaissance historique n'est pas simplement assimilable à ce topos traditionnel. Ce qui caractérise la mémoire plurielle et publique qui alimente le travail de l'historien, c'est le statut privilégié du témoignage, la possibilité de confronter différents témoignages les uns aux autres, dont dépend la crédibilité du récit historique. C'est ainsi moins la problématique d'une ressemblance entre récit et événements racontés — problématique de la trace, héritée d'une tendance traditionnelle à identifier la mémoire avec l'empreinte — que la confrontation de témoignages dans leurs différents degrés de fiabilité qui nous fait assister à l'événement raconté. Cette réflexion sur le décalage entre mémoire et histoire ouvre, dans la deuxième partie de cet article, à une analyse approfondie de la temporalité propre au passé qui fait l'objet du souvenir et conduit à une confrontation avec privilège accordé, dans la synthèse des trois modes du temps, chez saint Augustin au présent et, chez Heidegger, au futur. De cette manière, l'article tente de rééquilibrer la synthèse des temps en lui restituant un autre rapport au passé, que l'on ne saurait atteindre à partir d'Augustin ou de Heidegger. Libérer l'histoire du paradigme de la trace, de la métaphore de la mémoire comme empreinte, revient précisément à la restitution de ce mode de temporalisation du passé jusqu'ici esquivé : cet autre rapport au passé vise, conjointement à la mise en évidence du témoignage propre au travail de l'historien, à souligner la dette~<br>

Author(s): Zizek Tyler<br>
Abstract: "Always historicize": Frederic Jameson's imperative today exerts a powerful influence on the study of religion. It informs a wide range of methods and, perhaps more important, it shapes influential definitions of religion and religious subjectivity and agency. This article examines this influence and argues for the necessity of thinking the limits of historicism. Building on Robert Orsi's efforts to identify a space for academic exploration in-between religious testimony/narrative and social-scientific diagnosis/ explanation, I turn to recent efforts by Eric Santner and Slavoj Zizek to articulate a concept of subjectivity-tied closely to Franz Rosenzweig's concept of "revelation"-in "excess" of history and ideology. Santner and Zizek do not argue for a new, extra-historical foundation for agency and for religious claims but rather theorize and intervene in the "syntax" by which we are bound to history and society. This approach to historicism allows the scholar of religion to enrich accounts of creative religious agency at the same time that it forces them to rethink their relation to religious phenomena and religious subjects in terms of what the anthropologist Michael Jackson calls "encounter."<br>

Abstract: Dans cet article, nous évoquerons la question des témoignages de la Shoah et des circonstances de leur énonciation. A cet effet, nous décrirons cet objet sociodiscursif particulier qu'est le témoignage, en détaillant ses composantes définitoires (certification autobiographique, pacte de référentialité, portée collective, etc.), en réfléchissant sur les conditions de son accréditation et en le comparant aux autres modalités et stratégies discursives (discours de l'historien, récit littéraire, etc.) utilisées pour transmettre cette réalité extrême et non partagée de la déportation et de l'expérience concentrationnaire. In this paper, I focus on the question of the testimonies of the Shoah and the circumstances of their creation. The testimony, a specific sociodiscursive object, is described by detailling its defining elements (autobiographical certification, referentiality pact, collective thrust, etc.), by reflecting on the conditions of its accreditation and by comparing it to the other discursive modalities and strategies (the discourse of the historian, literary accounts, etc.) used to convey the extreme and unshared reality of deportation and the experience of concentration camps.<br>

Article Title: THE DIALECTICS OF JAMESON'S DIALECTICS<br>
Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>
Issue: i40063720<br>
Date: 2 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Jameson Fredric<br>
Abstract: This review essay attempts to understand the book under review against the background of Jameson's previous writings. Failing to do so would invite misunderstanding since there are few contemporary theorists whose writing forms so much of a unity. Jameson's book can be divided into three parts. The first and most important part deals with dialectics, the second with politics, and the third with philosophy of history. In the first part Jameson argues that dialectics best captures our relationship to the sociocultural and historical world we are living in. The second part makes clear that Jameson is not prepared to water down his own Marxist politics in order to spare the liberal sensibilities of his political opponents. In the third part Jameson develops his own philosophy of history, mainly in a dialogue with Ricoeur. Dialectics is his main weapon in his discussion with Ricoeur, and it becomes clear that the Spinozism of dialectics allows for a better understanding of history and of historical writing than does Ricoeur's phenomenological approach. The book is an impressive testimony to the powers of dialectical thought and to its indispensability for a proper grasp of historical writing.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo analiza la disputa sobre cuál sería la representación literaria más eficaz que José María Arguedas establece con los autores del llamado boom latinoamericano en los Diarios de El zorro de arriba y el zorro de abajo. En una argumentación que desarrolla ideas semejantes a las propuestas por Walter Benjamin en su ensayo "El narrador", Arguedas destaca el valor de una narradora oral como Carmen Taripha sobre los logros literarios del más significativo escritor del boom, Gabriel García Márquez. Lo importante para la representación literaria en Arguedas será la transmisión de experiencia, algo que su última novela logrará bajo la forma del testimonio de su propia muerte. This article examines the dispute regarding what would be the most effective literary representation that José María Arguedas established with the authors of the so-called Latin American boom, in the Diaries of The Fox from Up Above and the Fox from Down Below. In an argument that develops ideas similar to those proposed by Walter Benjamin in his essay "The Storyteller," Arguedas stresses the value of the storyteller Carmen Taripha over the literary achievements of the most significant writer of the boom, Gabriel García Márquez. What is important for the literary representation in Arguedas is the transmission of experience, something that his latest novel achieved in the form of the testimony of his own death.<br>

Abstract: Fazendo emergir elementos susceptíveis de desconstruir o filme Vertigo de Alfred Hitchcock e, assim, operar uma hermenêutica do testemunho, procuraremos demonstrar como a metafísica do "tempo do projecto" e a atitude filosófica do "catastrofismo esclarecido" propostas por Jean-Pierre Dupuy, integram-se e sustentam-se na lógica do testemunho. Este trabalho apresenta-se como um triplo pretexto: num primeiro momento, a insustentabilidade do niilismo uma vez que, se o desejo mimético pode ser "niilizante", ele também é condição da possibilidade do luto e, portanto, de (re-)criação e do testemunho; num segundo momento, o de mostrar a compatibilidade da desconstrução de Jacques Derrida com a hermenêutica do testemunho esboçada por Paul Ricœur, podendo ser a primeira o momento da conversão impulsionador da (re-)criação do sentido, necessário à concretização da segunda; num terceiro momento, o de considerarmos a hipótese do tempo do projecto e do testemunho, enquanto excedente do tempo da catástrofe e do niilismo, serem uma brecha para entrevermos o recuo, o adiar, a economia do desvio diferencial da crueldade humana e da violência. Making emerge elements that can help us deconstruct the film Vertigo of Alfred Hitchcock and, therefore, operate a hermeneutic of testimony, we will try to demonstrate how the metaphysics of the "Time of Project" and the philosophical attitude of the "enlightened catastrophism" proposed by Jean-Pierre Dupuy can be integrated and sustained in the logic of testimony. This work presents itself as a triple pretext: in a first moment, the unsustainability of the nihilism, once that, if the mimetic desire may be "nihilist", it is also a condition for the possibility of mourning and, therefore, for the possibility of (re-)creation and testimony; in a second moment, to show the compatibility of deconstruction of Jacques Derrida with the hermeneutics of testimony outlined by Paul Ricœur, being the first probably the moment of the catalyst conversion of (~<br>

Abstract: En su autobiografia, Rigoberta, la nieta de los mayas, Menchú recobra la dolorosa memoria de sus antepasados mayas y articula su trauma personal, que habiamos visto en su testimonio Me llamo Rigoberta Menchú y asi me nació la conciencia. A través de la postmemoria, la activista guatemalteca se conecta con la herencia transgeneracional de su comunidad, así como narra su propio pasado por la recuperación imaginativa de la memoria. Se confirma de esta manera que la memoria y la postmemoria como esfuerzo de creación son elementos vitales en la reconstrucción del pasado. In her autobiography, Crossing Borders, Rigoberta Menchu revisits the painful memory of her Mayan ancestors as well as articulates her own personal trauma as seen in her testimony I, Rigoberta Menchu: An Indian Woman in Guatemala. Through postmemory the Guatemalan activist is able to connect with the transgenerational legacy of her community as well as narrate her own past through the imaginative recovery of memory. In this way, she confirms that memory and postmemory as a creative endeavor are vital components of the reconstruction of the past.<br>

Article Title: Testifying Absence in the Era of Forensic Testimony<br>
Publisher: Springer Science+Business Media<br>
Issue: i40098288<br>

Author(s): Cyr Rachel E.<br>
Abstract: Commenting on the significance of his work at a mass grave in Vukovar, Croatia, 1993—1995, anthropologist Clyde Snow predicted that the application of forensic scientific methods in the documentation of mass atrocity would help prevent the future denial of atrocities. A couple of years later in nearby Kosovo, others would follow forensic scientific investigators only to report what they never saw or never found leading many commentators and tertiary witnesses to doubt that atrocities had occurred. As absence and lack arise against the backdrop of forensic discourse, we are called upon to weigh the stakes of negative evidence witnessing and its implications for cultural memory. This article contends that the semiotic and positional peculiarity of negative evidence in an era of forensic testimony has its analogue in the paschal figure of Jesus' empty tomb. Analyzing the rhetoric of denial that accompanied the forensic investigations of Kosovo in the late 1990s, the author suggests that the empty tomb is a paradigm that renders intelligible the interdiction implicitly placed on the forensic presencing of the body as well as the problematic with which memory is met in a world where forensic scientific testimony grows in importance.<br>

Abstract: The article is intended to indicate how the study of written and cultural texts may be used to approach the problem of identifying the system of thought characteristic of particular groups. Certain premises of what may be called an “interpretative paradigm” have been selected to create a theoretical starting-point, and in this context the most suggestive appear to be the concept of culture developed by symbolic anthropology, the cultural-semiotic concept of text and the multi-dimensional hermeneutic approach to textual intepretation. The author therefore seeks to bring together, in addition to the general features ofinterpetative ethnology, certain theoretical and methodological starting-points derived from the three approaches mentioned. One may approach the problem of understanding of a foreign testimony via “adequate interpretation”. Here, to understand means to adopt the cultural “language” of a message as one's own, and to interpret and so transfer the unknown into an accessible code, most often one's own code. The process of interpretation is understood as the discovery of the hidden content behind the apparent stirface, and in this activity the understanding of culturally remote testimony is axiomatically taken to bepossible and communicable. In a broader epistemological context we can see in adequate intepretation one of the means to the never-ending process of correction of our pre-judged knowledge. In a spirit of critical rationalism we could deflne such interpretation as the working hypothesis that may be falsified by further Scientific activity and then replaced by a better theory. Such conclusions on the methodological range of the interpretative approach indicate only one of the possible syntheses of various epistemological paradigms, for the theoretical use and application of which ethnology seems especially suited.<br>

La subjectivité est pensée à partir des restes de l'analyse structurale comme un témoignage de sociétés en voie de recomposition. This article presents a reading of the major texts of Claude Lévi-Strauss, from Tristes Tropiques to Mythologies through The savage mind, linking the theme of the dissolution of the subject with the horizon of an ecological catastrophe that orients its development.

Abstract: Les limites du rapport fertile entre Foi et Raison sont celles qui cernent les identités respectives de chacun des trois auteurs abordés. Témoignant de leur « air de famille » ils se rejoignent par une profonde valorisation personnelle et éclairent l'intellectualisme optimiste qui caractérise une certaine conscience occidentale. The limits of the fruitful relationship between Faith and Reason are those which define the identities of each of the three Authors concerned here. Giving testimony to their "family likeness", they share a strong self-actualisation, and shed light on the optimistic intellectualism that is typical of a certain Western consciousness.<br>

Author(s): Thompson Ellen B.<br>
Abstract: Kalapalo warrior biographies are concerned with dialogical processes of challenge, resistance, debate, and the negotiation of meaning - with the struggles that take place as people try to understand and experience anew. Although warriors were trained to aggressively defend their communities against enemies, these narratives describe how they attempted to refashion ideological forms connected with ethnic allegiance and moral community. The personalities of warriors, closely connected to the training they underwent in adolescence, are particularly important in this regard. While biographies are often understood as texts in which history is merely a context surrounding the progress of individuals, descriptions of personal development are shown here to constitute testimony about historical processes themselves, in this case the experiences of refugees fleeing from centers of European expansion in lowland South America.<br>

Abstract: But just the other day I got a kind of Rip van Winkle testimony from my friend Dick Howard, of Stony Brook, who apparently hasn't attended SPEP since the twenty-fifth anniversary meeting in Toronto. He's here for a panel tomorrow, and he sent me an e-mail, from which I quote, in part, with permission: “Just have been looking at SPEP program—it's extraordinary how it's grown and the diversity of things going on there. A ‘victory’ that at the same time comes with a diversification that perhaps gives more breath than depth? History will judge.” So there you have it! The judgment of history! SPEP flourishes today, a major force in American philosophy, and its “victory” seems to justify and redeem in retrospect all those early struggles, the slaughter bench of the early days, the courage and prescience of that small band of outsiders and oddballs. It makes a good story, as history always should: the triumph of the little guys over enormous odds. In Hegelian terms, reason exercised its cunning and brought about results unforeseeable, almost unimaginable, in those far-off days of 1962—or was it 1961? In philosophical terms, history has rendered its judgment.<br>

Abstract: The three-drug protocol is designed to circumvent the very possibility of establishing whether or not the condemned person is suffering or in pain, whether or not he or she is conscious at the moment of death, and therefore whether or not the punishment is cruel and unusual as defined by the Court. Furthermore, this fabulous fantasy of painless death disavows the reality that we don't know how to define what constitutes consciousness of death because firsthand testimony is impossible. As long as Lawrence Brewer, recently executed in Texas, goes out snoring as if in a sound sleep (which he apparently did), at some level we can reassure ourselves that his death is the least cruel, most usual, and perhaps even the most desired, namely, dying in his sleep.<br>

Abstract: For Ricoeur, there is something more originary than evil is radical, and that something is the goodness of creation, as attested to by the Genesis narrative at 1:31: “And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.”
         
               While Ricoeur refrains from interpreting the Bible literally, he does discern in the symbolic story of creation a bedrock affirmation of the human capability for the good that precedes metaphysics and history and resides at the uppermost limit of rational thought. And this attestation is expressly the testimony he chooses to stake his life and work on, even if it cannot be verified empirically. Without such a leap into the Kantian unknowable, without this wager on the elemental goodness of being, faith, hope, and meaning itself, Ricoeur maintains, would eternally elude the grasp of humankind. Hence, Ricoeur can agree that evil is primordial and still believe that something—the good—is even more primordial. In other words, Ricoeur starts from the premise that we are predisposed toward the good but have a propensity toward evil. This means, in effect, that the will, although corruptible, is not fundamentally corrupt. It has to be seduced, led astray, before it falls victim to evil. Thus, for Ricoeur, we do not come into the world as damaged goods; rather, we damage our intrinsic goodness through the imprudent deeds we later enact. To put Ricoeur's point another way, that we have fallen implies that we fell from somewhere, and that somewhere is just our original, untainted state of goodness. Moreover, the fact that we have fallen also intimates to Ricoeur that with effort we might be able to get up, that with exertion we might become upright once again in the ontological sense of reclaiming something approaching our initial moral wholesomeness.37<br>
