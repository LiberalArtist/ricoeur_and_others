  Book Title: Mimetic Theory and World Religions-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schenk Richard<br>
  Abstract: Those who anticipated the demise of religion and the advent of a peaceful, secularized global village have seen the last two decades confound their predictions. René Girard's mimetic theory is a key to understanding the new challenges posed by our world of resurgent violence and pluralistic cultures and traditions. Girard sought to explain how the Judeo-Christian narrative exposes a founding murder at the origin of human civilization and demystifies the bloody sacrifices of archaic religions. Meanwhile, his book
      Sacrifice, a reading of conflict and sacrificial resolution in the Vedic Brahmanas, suggests that mimetic theory's insights also resonate with several non-Western religious and spiritual traditions. This volume collects engagements with Girard by scholars of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism and situates them within contemporary theology, philosophy, and religious studies.<br>

  Abstract: If the devil is in the details, then God is in the prepositions, and I want today to look at one such preposition: the little word “for.” I think this to be the most diffi cult and delicate word to parse in the whole of theology. Let me explain why. As St. Th omas Aquinas taught us, we cannot say of God what God is, only what God is not. Th is very properly negative approach to God is vital if we are to avoid idolatry.

  Abstract: There were surely several circumstances in my life that prepared me to become interested in mimetic theory while I was studying theology at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. First, I have maintained a long ongoing interest in anthropology. During my time in high school, I was already starting to read books about foreign cultures (both modern and premodern) and even seriously thinking about becoming an anthropologist. Second, I was also very much in love with literature and therefore starting to study German language and literature, in addition to theology.

  Book Title: Studying Global Pentecostalism-Theories and Methods<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): van der Laan Cornelis<br>
  Abstract: With its remarkable ability to adapt to many different cultures, Pentecostalism has become the world’s fastest growing religious movement. More than five hundred million adherents worldwide have reshaped Christianity itself. Yet some fundamental questions in the study of global Pentecostalism, and even in what we call “Pentecostalism,” remain largely unaddressed. Bringing together leading scholars in the social sciences, history, and theology, this unique volume explores these questions for this rapidly growing, multidisciplinary field of study. A valuable resource for anyone studying new forms of Christianity, it offers insights and guidance on both theoretical and methodological issues. The first section of the book examines such topics as definitions, essentialism, postcolonialism, gender, conversion, and globalization. The second section features contributions from those working in psychology, anthropology, sociology, and history. The third section traces the boundaries of theology from the perspectives of pneumatology, ecumenical studies, inter-religious relations, and empirical theology.<br>

  Abstract: The discipline of practical theology is one that appears to be in constant redefinition in recent times, although there might at last be some consensus emerging.

  Abstract: Since its inauguration as an academic discipline after the July Revolution, in the 1830s, sociology has had a lasting ambivalent relationship to the humanities. On the one hand, Auguste Comte, who in 1838 had coined the word ‘sociology’ in a footnote to the 47
                  thlesson of hisCourse in Positive Philosophy(1830-1842), introduced the new science as a type of physics, ‘social physics’, patterned on the model of Newtonian physics.

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity. Joining the recent call to theological interpretation of Scripture, Putman provides a constructive model that forwards a descriptive and normative pattern for reading Scripture and theological tradition together.<br>

  Abstract: While the Lord tarries, doctrine develops. The progress and growth of ideas is an inevitable historical reality, even in religious traditions purportedly rooted in divine revelation. In post-critical Christian theology, attitudes toward this phenomenon are undergoing considerable change. Once met with contempt and anxiety from Protestants and Roman Catholics alike, the idea of postcanonical doctrinal development nowadays meets with a far more favorable, even enthusiastic consent in both circles. Evangelicals, however, meet with the prospect of doctrinal development in the tension between two poles: an unwavering commitment to the supreme authority of God’s unchanging word (

  Book Title: The Mission of Demythologizing-Rudolf Bultmann's Dialectical Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Congdon David W.<br>
  Abstract: Since 1941, Rudolf Bultmann’s program of demythologizing has been the subject of constant debate, widely held to indicate Bultmann’s departure from the dialectical theology he once shared with Karl Barth. In the 1950s, Barth referred to their relationship as that of a whale and an elephant: incapable of meaningful communication. This study proposes a contrary reading of demythologizing as the hermeneutical fulfillment of dialectical theology on the basis of a reinterpretation of Barth’s theological project. As such, the volume argues that dialectical theology is fundamentally governed by a missionary logic. Bultmann’s hermeneutical theology extends this dialectical, missionary theology into the field of interpretation. Contrary to many critics, the message of God’s saving work in Christ, and not modern science, funds Bultmann’s hermeneutical program. Like Barth’s own revolution, Bultmann’s program addresses a false relation between gospel and culture. Negatively, demythologizing is a program of deconstantinizing, opposing the objectifying conflation of kerygma and culture that he calls “myth.” Positively, demythologizing is a form of intercultural hermeneutics, composed of preunderstanding and self-understanding. Demythologizing is therefore a missionary hermeneutic of intercultural translation.<br>

  Abstract: The terms

In biblical studies, serious interest in myth typically falls under the domain of the secular academy, whereas serious interest in “Scripture” has typically been the concern for communities of faith and the academic institutions they support.

  Book Title: God--The World's Future-Systematic Theology for a New Era<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Peters Ted<br>
  Abstract: God—The World’s Future has been a proven and comprehensive textbook in systematic theology for over twenty years. Explicitly crafted to address our postmodern context, Peters explains the whole body of Christian historical doctrine from within a “proleptic” framework, “whereby the gospel is understood as announcing the pre-actualization of the future consummation of all things in Jesus Christ.” Peters skillfully deploys this concept not only to organize the various theological areas or loci but also to rethink doctrines in light of key postmodern challenges from ecumenism, critical historical thinking, contemporary science, and gender and sexuality issues. The Third Edition is thoroughly revised with updated chapters, additional chapters, updated annotations and bibliographies, and further elaborations in light of recent developments in method and theological reflection. This classic text opens up systematic theology in new dimensions, retrieving traditional categories and topics for a new generation of students and learners to give a fresh reading of Christian theology and articulation of the liberating message of the gospel of God’s grace for the future of the world.<br>

  Abstract: Every faith community knows the challenges of inviting new members and the next generation into its shared life without falling into an arid traditionalism or a shallow relativism. Renowned scholar Walter Brueggemann finds a framework for education in the structure of the Hebrew Bible canon, with its assertion of center and limit (in the Torah), of challenge (in the Prophets), and of inquiry (in the Writings). Incorporating the best insights from his own career and from the fields of canonical criticism, Old Testament theology, and pedagogical theory, Brueggemann offers a vision of how the community can draw on the shape of Scripture to educate its members. First published in 1982, The Creative Word is now updated and introduced with a foreword by Amy Erickson of Iliff School of Theology.<br>

  Book Title: Tastes of the Divine: Hindu and Christian Theologies of Emotion-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS MICHELLE VOSS<br>
  Abstract: The intensity and meaningfulness of aesthetic experience have often been described in theological terms. By designating basic human emotions as rasa, a word that connotes taste, flavor, or essence, Indian aesthetic theory conceptualizes emotional states as something to be savored. At their core, emotions can be tastes of the divine. In this book, the methods of the emerging discipline of comparative theology enable the author's appreciation of Hindu texts and practices to illuminate her Christian reflections on aesthetics and emotion. Three emotions vie for prominence in the religious sphere: peace, love, and fury. Whereas Indian theorists following Abhinavagupta claim that the aesthetic emotion of peace best approximates the goal of religious experience, devotees of Krishna and medieval Christian readings of the Song of Songs argue that love communicates most powerfully with divinity. In response to the transcendence emphasized in both approaches, the book turns to fury at injustice to attend to emotion's foundations in the material realm. The implications of this constructive theology of emotion for Christian liturgy, pastoral care, and social engagement are manifold.<br>

The cultures of Asia, Africa, and South America, where the majority of Christians now live, offer categories for imagining the life of faith, not only for local or indigenous theologies but for the theological “mainstream” as well. As an aesthetic perspective that relates contextual and bodily aspects of emotion to religious experience,

  Abstract: Theological anthropology is being put to the test: in the face of contemporary developments in the spheres of culture, politics, and science, traditional perspectives on the human person are no longer adequate. Yet can theological anthropology move beyond its previously established categories and renew itself in relation to contemporary insights? The present collection of essays sets out to answer this question. Uniting Roman Catholic theologians from across the globe, it tackles from a theological perspective challenges related to the classical natural law tradition (part 1), to the modern conception of the subject (part 2), and to the postmodern awareness of diversity in a globalizing context (part 3). Its contributors share a fundamental methodological choice of a critical-constructive dialogue with contemporary culture, science, and philosophy. This collection integrates a wider range of approaches than one usually finds in theological volumes, bringing together experts in systematic theology and in theological ethics. Authors come from different American contexts, including Black and Latino, and from a European context that include both French and German. Moreover, the interdisciplinary insights upon which the different contributions draw stem from both the natural sciences (such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and ethology) and the humanities (such as cultural studies, philosophy, and hermeneutics). This volume will be essential reading for anyone seeking a state-of-the-art account of theological anthropology, of the uncertainties it is facing, and of the responses it is in the process of formulating. The shared Roman Catholic background of the authors of this collection makes this volume a helpful complement to recent publications that predominantly represent views from other theological traditions.<br>

  Author(s) Kirchhoffer David G.<br>
  Abstract: Today it is unusual to offer a comprehensive philosophical theory about the nature of human beings, or a theory about the origins of religion, or a theory of human culture in general. The French historian, literary critic, and philosopher René Girard (born 1923) has tried to do all of this with his mimetic theory. Though not a theologian, Girard has dealt in great detail with the biblical tradition—unusual for a secular social scientist. I will present one adoption of his theory into theological research: the “dramatic theology” that originated with the Swiss systematic theologian Raymund Schwager, S.J. (1935–2004),<br>

  Book Title: Overcoming Onto-Theology: Toward a Postmodern Christian Faith-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
  Abstract: Overcoming Onto-theology is a stunning collection of essays by Merold Westphal, one of America's leading continental philosophers of religion, in which Westphal carefully explores the nature and the structure of a postmodern Christian philosophy. Written with characteristic clarity and charm, Westphal offers masterful studies of Heidegger's early lectures on Paul and Augustine, the idea of hermeneutics, Schleiermacher, Hegel, Derrida, and Nietzsche, all in the service of building his argument that postmodern thinking offers an indispensable tool for rethinking Christian faith. A must read for every student and professor of continental philosophy and the philosophy of religion, Overcoming Onto-theology is an invaluable collection that brings together in one place fourteen provocative and lucid essays by one of the most important thinkers working in American philosophy today.<br>

  Abstract: Not every construal of the theological enterprise will be able to entertain the possibility of Nietzsche as a resource, if not exactly an ally. For example, if theology interprets itself onto-theologically, it will be unable to see any ambiguity or irony in his self-designations as immoralist and anti-Christ. They will simply be the literal confessions of a loathed enemy. The possibility of Nietzsche as

  Book Title: Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatter Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Tocqueville suggested that the people reign in the American political world like God over the universe.This intuition anticipates the crisis in the secularization paradigm that has brought theology back as a fundamental part of sociological and political analysis. It has become more difficult to believe that humanity's progress necessarily leads to atheism, or that it is possible to translate all that is good about religion into reasonable terms acceptable in principle by all, believers as well as nonbelievers. And yet, the spread of Enlightenment values, of an independent public sphere, and of alternative projects of modernitycontinues unabated and is by no means the antithesis of the renewed vigor of religious beliefs.The essays in this book shed interdisciplinary and multicultural light on a hypothesis that helps to account for such an unexpected convergence of enlightenment and religion in our times: Religion has reentered the public sphere because it puts into question the relation between God and the concept of political sovereignty.In the first part, Religion and Polity-Building,new perspectives are brought to bear on the tension-ridden connection between theophany and state-building from the perspective of world religions. Globalized, neo-liberal capitalism has been another crucial factor in loosening the bond between God and the state, as the essays in the second part, The End of the Saeculum and Global Capitalism,show.The essays in the third part, Questioning Sovereignty: Law and Justice,are dedicated to a critique of the premises of political theology, starting from the possibility of a prior, perhaps deeper relation between democracy and theocracy. The book concludes with three innovative essays dedicated to examining Tocqueville in order to think the Religion of Democracybeyond the idea of civil religion.<br>

  Abstract: What is the relation of theology to politics? Of revelation to revolution? To approach this question, I want to turn not to the constitution of the subject (Alain Badiou’s preoccupation) or to the constitution of the community (Paul’s preoccupation), because in the end these entities are not sufficient to achieve the robust political ends imagined for them. Instead, I want to turn to the question of justice (the preoccupation of the Hebrew Bible), for the infusion of this ethical concern is vital: political life must be lived under the horizon of justice.

  Book Title: Rethinking God as Gift: Marion, Derrida, and the Limits of Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Horner Robyn<br>
  Abstract: Rethinking God as Gift is situated at the intersection of philosophy, critical theory and theology. The first sustained study of the work of Jean-Luc Marion in English, it offers a unique perspective on contemporary questions and their theological relevance. Taking its point of departure from the problem of the gift as articulated by Jacques Derrida, who argues that the conditions of possibility of the gift are also its conditions of impossibility, Horner pursues a series of questions concerning the nature of thought, the viability of phenomenology, and, most urgently, the possibility of grace. For Marion, phenomenology, as the thought of the given, offers a path for philosophy to proceed without being implicated in metaphysics. His retrieval of several important insights of Edmund Husserl, along with his reading of Martin Heidegger and Emmanuel Lvinas, enables him to work out a phenomenology where even impossiblephenomena such as revelation and the gift might be examined. In this important confrontation between Marion and Derrida issues vital to the negotiation of postmodern concerns in philosophy and theology emerge with vigour. The careful elucidation of those issues in an interdisciplinary context, and the snapshot it provides of the state of contemporary debate, make Rethinking God as Gift an important contribution to theological and philosophical discussion.<br>

  Abstract: The question with which I have been occupied throughout this study is a theological one: how is it possible to speak of God as gift? And the path that has been traveled in response to that question perhaps seems to have had little to do with theology as such. Yet if Anselm’s famous definition of theology as “faith seeking understanding” is in any way valid, then this book has not been far from theology at all, at least in the sense that it is an attempt to understand what it might mean for God to give Godself.

  Abstract: I read Lacan. I ask myself: What is this good for? It is good for nothing. If so, can this be proved? I will try. I will not know, you will not know, if I am successful. In Lacanian terms, if I have succeeded, I have failed; if I fail, I have succeeded.
                     Doch, I shall apply Lacanian techniques to one of Western theology’s most frequently and strenuously examined texts, Anselm’s ontological argument. By remapping the proof, I hope, with Lacanian audacity, to bring forth unforeseen significations and a new approach to the psychoanalytic interpretation of religious texts.<br>

  Book Title: Interstices of the Sublime: Theology and Psychoanalytic Theory-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Interstices of the Sublime represents a powerful theological engagement with psychoanalytic theory in Freud, Lacan, Kristeva and Zizek, as well as major expressions of contemporary Continental philosophy, including Deleuze, Derrida, Marion, and Badiou. Through creative and constructive psycho-theological readings of topics such as sublimation, schizophrenia, God, and creation ex nihilo, this book contributes to a new form of radical theological thinking that is deeply involved in the world. Here the idea of the Kantian sublime is read into Freud and Lacan, and compared with sublimation. The sublime refers to a conflict of the Kantian faculties of reason and imagination, and involves the attempt to represent what is intrinsically unrepresentable. Sublimation, by contrast, involves the expression and partial satisfaction of primal desires in culturally acceptable terms. The sublime is negatively expressed in sublimation, because it is both the sourceof sublimation as well as that which resists being sublimated. That is, the Freudian sublime is related to the process of sublimation, but it also distorts or disrupts sublimation, and invokes what Lacan calls the Real. The effects of the sublime are not just psychoanalytic but, importantly, theological, because the sublime is the main form that Godtakes in the modern world. A radical postmodern theology attends to the workings of the sublime in our thinking and living, and provides resources to understand the complexity of reality. This book is one of the first sustained theological readings of Lacan in English.<br>

  Abstract: The problem of thinking is a problem of sublimation. To have language, meaning, and thereby religion, science, culture, and art, there must be sublimation in a broad sense. This book has traced some of the intricacies of sublimation through psychoanalytic theory as it impresses upon theology. Sublimation means that meaning is not direct and unmediated but consists of a detour. At the same time, my readings of theology, continental philosophy, and psychoanalytic theory suggest that sublimation is not an elevation above a material reality. In chapter 1, I appealed to Deleuze to question the two-level model of reality that sublimation<br>

  Book Title: Saintly Influence: Edith Wyschogrod and the Possibilities of Philosophy of Religion-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAVKA MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Since the publication of her first book, Emmanuel Levinas: The Problem of Ethical Metaphysics, in 1974-the first book about Levinas published in English-Edith Wyschogrod has been at the forefront of the fields of Continental philosophy and philosophy of religion. Her work has crossed many disciplinary boundaries, making peregrinations from phenomenology and moral philosophy to historiography, the history of religions (both Western and non-Western), aesthetics, and the philosophy of biology. In all of these discourses, she has sought to cultivate an awareness of how the self is situated and influenced, as well as the ways in which a self can influence others.In this volume, twelve scholars examine and display the influence of Wyschogrod's work in essays that take up the thematics of influence in a variety of contexts: Christian theology, the saintly behavior of the villagers of Le Chambon sur Lignon, the texts of the medieval Jewish mystic Abraham Abulafia, the philosophies of Levinas, Derrida, and Benjamin, the practice of intellectual history, the cultural memory of the New Testament, and pedagogy.In response, Wyschogrod shows how her interlocutors have brought to light her multiple authorial personae and have thus marked the ambiguity of selfhood, its position at the nexus of being influenced by and influencing others.<br>

  Abstract: Three interrelated features may be said to characterize the work of Edith Wyschogrod. There is first an interdisciplinary drive to rise above institutionally sanctioned boundaries and to retrieve intellectual categories from their disciplinary captivity so as to reconfigure them in novel contexts. It is this desire and the ability to bring widely differing genres, discourses and traditionally separate intellectual orbits into productive coalitions that have increasingly distinguished her writings. This linking of philosophy and theology, psychoanalysis and science, literary criticism and linguistics, architecture and the arts, media studies and above all, ethics, is carried off with a high degree of<br>

  Book Title: Toward a Theology of Eros: Transfiguring Passion at the Limits of Discipline-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLER CATHERINE<br>
  Abstract: What does theology have to say about the place of eroticism in the salvific transformation of men and women, even of the cosmos itself? How, in turn, does eros infuse theological practice and transfigure doctrinal tropes? Avoiding the well-worn path of sexual moralizing while also departing decisively from Anders Nygren's influential insistence that Christian agape must have nothing to do with worldly eros, this book explores what is still largely uncharted territory in the realm of theological erotics. The ascetic, the mystical, the seductive, the ecstatic-these are the places where the divine and the erotic may be seen to converge and love and desire to commingle.Inviting and performing a mutual seduction of disciplines, the volume brings philosophers, historians, biblical scholars, and theologians into a spirited conversation that traverses the limits of conventional orthodoxies, whether doctrinal or disciplinary. It seeks new openings for the emergence of desire, love, and pleasure, while challenging common understandings of these terms. It engages risk at the point where the hope for salvation paradoxically endangers the safety of subjects-in particular, of theological subjects-by opening them to those transgressions of eros in which boundaries, once exceeded, become places of emerging possibility.The eighteen chapters, arranged in thematic clusters, move fluidly among and between premodern and postmodern textual traditions-from Plato to Emerson, Augustine to Kristeva, Mechthild to Mattoso, the Shulammite to Molly Bloom, the Zohar to the Da Vinci Code. In so doing, they link the sublime reaches of theory with the gritty realities of politics, the boundless transcendence of God with the poignant transience of materiality.<br>

  Book Title: Finding God in All Things: Celebrating Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stagaman David<br>
  Abstract: Three of the most influential Catholic theologians of the twentieth century-Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-were all born in 1904, at the height of the Church's most militant rhetoric against all things modern. In this culture of suspicion, Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner grew in faith to join the Society of Jesus and struggled with the burden of antimodernist policies in their formation. By the time of their mature work in the 1950s and 1960s, they had helped to redefine the critical dialogue between modern thought and contemporary Catholic theology. After the dtente of the Second Vatican Council, they brought Catholic tradition into closer relationship to modern philosophy, history, and politics. Written by leading scholars, friends, and family members, these original essays celebrate the legacies of Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner after a century of theological development. Offering a broad range of perspectives on their lives and works, the essays blend personal and anecdotal accounts with incisive critical appraisals. Together, they offer an accessible introduction to the distinctive character of three great thinkers and how their work shapes the way Catholics think and talk about God, Church, and State.<br>

  Book Title: Believing Scholars: Ten Catholic Intellectuals-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burrell David B.<br>
  Abstract: How do Catholic intellectuals draw on faith in their work? And how does their work as scholars influence their lives as people of faith?For more than a generation, the University of Dayton has invited a prominent Catholic intellectual to present the annual Marianist Award Lecture on the general theme of the encounter of faith and profession. Over the years, the lectures have become central to the Catholic conversation about church, culture, and society.In this book, ten leading figures explore the connections in their own lives between the private realms of faith and their public calling as teachers, scholars, and intellectuals.This last decade of Marianist Lectures brings together theologians and philosophers, historians, anthropologists, academic scholars, and lay intellectuals and critics.Here are Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J., on the tensions between faith and theology in his career; Jill Ker Conway on the spiritual dimensions of memory and personal narrative; Mary Ann Glendon on the roots of human rights in Catholic social teaching; Mary Douglas on the fruitful dialogue between religion and anthropology in her own life; Peter Steinfels on what it really means to be a liberal Catholic; and Margaret O'Brien Steinfels on the complicated history of women in today's church. From Charles Taylor and David Tracy on the fractured relationship between Catholicism and modernity to Gustavo Gutirrez on the enduring call of the poor and Marcia Colish on the historic links between the church and intellectual freedom, these essays track a decade of provocative, illuminating, and essential thought. James L. Heft, S.M., is President and Founding Director of the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies and University Professor of Faith and Culture and Chancellor, University of Dayton.

  Book Title: The Experience of God: A Postmodern Response-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: The book provides a series of approaches to the ancient question of whether and how God is a matter of experience,or, alternately, to what extent the notion of experience can be true to itself if it does not include God. On the one hand, it seems impossible to experience God: the deity does not offer Himself to sense experience. On the other hand, there have been mystics who have claimed to have encountered God. The essays in this collection seek to explore the topic again, drawing insights from phenomenology, theology, literature, and feminism. Throughout, this stimulating collection maintains a strong connection with concrete rather than abstract approaches to God.The contributors: Michael F. Andrews, Jeffrey Bloechl, John D.

  Book Title: Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SULLIVAN LAWRENCE E.<br>
  Abstract: What has happened to religion in its present manifestations? In recent years, Enlightenment secularization, as it appeared in the global spread of political structures that relegate the sacred to a private sphere, seems suddenly to have foundered. Unexpectedly, it has discovered its own parochialism-has discovered, indeed, that secularization may never have taken place at all.With the return of the religious,in all aspects of contemporary social, political, and religious life, the question of political theology-of the relation between politicaland religiousdomains-takes on new meaning and new urgency. In this groundbreaking book, distinguished scholars from many disciplines-philosophy, political theory, anthropology, classics, and religious studies-seek to take the full measure of this question in today's world. This book begins with the place of the gods in the Greek polis, then moves through Augustine's two cities and early modern religious debates, to classic statements about political theology by such thinkers as Walter Benjamin and Carl Schmitt. Essays also consider the centrality of tolerance to liberal democracy, the recent French controversy over wearing the Muslim headscarf, and Bush's God talk.The volume includes a historic discussion between Jrgen Habermas and Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, concerningthe prepolitical moral foundations of a republic, and it concludes with explorations of new, more open ways of conceptualizing society.<br>

Were these works of art equal to the sum total of the surrealist interventions in the theological realm, there would be little more to discuss. A less cursory inspection reveals, however, that the presentation of surrealism as a fleeting moment in the artistic history<br>

  Abstract: The four realities referred to in the title of my essay—namely, identity, belonging, diversity, and pluralism in religious matters—when combined together and placed in the North American context, present both challenges and opportunities for the Christian church and its theology. To understand how religious, and more specifically, Christian identity and belonging are shaped in this context, I begin by briefly describing the four realities mentioned and then outline the main challenges as well as the opportunities they present to the process of forming Christian identity.

  Abstract: In at least two registers—one of genre and one of doctrine—Richard Kearney’s philosophical theology appears suddenly and luminously at the forefront of theology itself. In other words, it invokes a “possible God,” and thus a possible theology. Theology has wanted the fully actual, active God, however, not a possible one—and so has generated an impossible one. The possible God suggests a third space, indeed a certain kind of

  Book Title: Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): MACKENDRICK KARMEN<br>
  Abstract: Theology usually appears to us to be dogmatic, judgmental, condescending, maybe therapeutic, or perhaps downright fantastical-but seldom enticing. Divine Enticement takes as its starting point that the meanings of theological concepts are not so much logical, truth-valued propositions-affirmative or negative-as they are provocations and evocations. Thus it argues for the seductiveness of both theology and its subject-for, in fact, infinite seduction and enticement as the very sense of theological query. The divine name is one by which we are drawn toward the limits of thought, language, and flesh. The use of language in such conceptualization calls more than it designates. This is not a flaw or a result of vagueness or imprecision in theological language but rather marks the correspondence of such language to its subject: that which, outside of or at the limit of our thought, draws us as an enticement to desire, not least to intellectual desire. Central to the text is the strange semiotics of divine naming, as a call on that for which there cannot be a standard referent. The entanglement of sign and body, not least in interpretations of the Christian incarnation, both grounds and complicates the theological abstractions. A number of traditional notions in Christian theology are reconceived here as enticements, modes of drawing the desires of both body and mind: faith as "thinking with assent"; sacraments as "visible words" read in community; ethics as responsiveness to beauty; prayer as the language of address; scripture as the story of meaning-making. All of these culminate in a sense of a call to and from the purely possible, the open space into which we can be enticed, within which we can be divinely enticing.<br>

  Book Title: The Reinvention of Religious Music: Olivier Messiaen's Breakthrough Toward the Beyond-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): van Maas Sander<br>
  Abstract: Present-day music studies conspicuously evade the question of religion in contemporary music. Although many composers address the issue in their work, as yet there have been few attempts to think through the structure of religious music as we hear it. On the basis of a careful analysis of Olivier Messiaen's work, this book argues for a renewal of our thinking about religious music. Addressing his notion of a hyper-religiousmusic of sounds and colors, it aims to show that Messiaen has broken new ground. His reinvention of religious music makes us again aware of the fact that religious music, if taken in its proper radical sense, belongs to the foremost of musical adventures.The work of Olivier Messiaen is well known for its inclusion of religious themes and gestures. These alone, however, do not seem enough to account for the religious status of the work. Arguing for a breakthrough toward the beyondon the basis of the synaesthetic experience of music, Messiaen invites a confrontation with contemporary theologians and post-secular thinkers. How to account for a religious breakthrough that is produced by a work of art?Starting from an analysis of his 1960s oratorio La Transfiguration de Notre-Seigneur Jsus-Christ, this book arranges a moderated dialogue between Messiaen and the music theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar, the phenomenology of revelation of Jean-Luc Marion, the rethinking of religion and technics in Jacques Derrida and Bernard Stiegler, and the Augustinian ruminations of Sren Kierkegaard and Jean-Franois Lyotard. Ultimately, this confrontation underscores the challenging yet deeply affirmative nature of Messiaen's music.<br>

  Book Title: Joy and Human Flourishing-Essays on Theology, Culture, and the Good Life<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Volf Miroslav<br>
  Abstract: Joy is crucial to human life and central to God’s relationship to the world, yet it is remarkably absent from contemporary theology and, increasingly, from our own lives! This collection, the result of a series of consultations hosted by the Yale Center of Faith and Culture, remedies this situation by considering the import of joy on human flourishing. These essays—written by experts in systematic and pastoral theology, Christian ethics, and biblical studies—demonstrate the promise of joy to throw open new theological possibilities and cast fresh light on all dimensions of human life. With contributions from Jurgen Moltmann, N. T. Wright, Marianne Meye Thompson, Mary Clark Moschella, Charles Mathewes, and Miroslav Volf, this volume puts joy at the heart of Christian faith and life, exploring joy’s biblical, dogmatic, ecclesiological, and ethical dimensions in concert with close attention to the shifting tides of culture. Convinced of the need to offer to the world a compelling Christian vision of the good life, the authors treat the connections between joy and themes of creation, theodicy, politics, suffering, pastoral practice, eschatology, and more, driven by the conviction that vital relationship with the living God is integral to our fullest flourishing as human creatures.<br>

  Book Title: Foundational Theology-A New Approach to Catholic Fundamental Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Jacobs-Vandegeer Christiaan<br>
  Abstract: Fundamental theology is traditionally viewed as the starting point for the various disciplines within Catholic theology; it is the place where solid foundations are established for the further research and engagement with the vast terrain of historical, systematic, philosophical, and sacramental/liturgical theology. In Foundational Theology, a landmark new study, Neil Ormerod and Christiaan Jacobs-Vandegeer seek to ground foundational theology in the normative drive toward meaning, truth, goodness, and beauty, appropriated by the theologian through religious, moral, intellectual, and psychic conversions. In doing so, the work maps out the implications of those fundamental orientations to the specific questions and topics of the Catholic theological tradition: God, Trinity, revelation, and an array of doctrinal points of investigation. The authors in this work provide a comprehensive approach to theological foundations for theologians while employing a new, groundbreaking approach to the discipline through the application of the insights of Bernard Lonergan, one of the foremost Catholic theologians of the modern era.<br>

Without actually coming to the point of making a judgment, one can argue for the congruence of foundational categories with key doctrines such as Trinity, Incarnation, and Church. Many of the questions about the reasonableness of central doctrines are taken up in traditional fundamental theology, but in the form of apologetics and emphasizing credibility.

  Book Title: Citizenship in Heaven and on Earth-Karl Barth's Ethics<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Massmann Alexander<br>
  Abstract: While Karl Barth is one of the most significant theologians of the twentieth century, his contribution to ethics is less well known and subject to controversy among interpreters. Barth combined his commitment to the church and its particular task in faith and theology with a concern for ethics and politics in wider society. By examining the historical development of Barth’s ethics, this study traces the vital influences and considerable shifts in Barth’s understanding of the ethical task, situating him within his political context. Alexander Massmann provides a comprehensive explication and assessment of the full scope of Barth’s ethics, from the first edition of the Romans commentary to the final volume of the Church Dogmatics. General questions of Barth’s methodology in ethics and case studies in applied ethics are both analyzed in their intricate connection to his dogmatic thought. The study highlights how an ethical approach emerged in which the freedom of the gospel allows for considerable openness to empirical insights from other disciplines. The author reevaluates Barth’s ethics in a constructive vision of the role of the church in the quest for a just society.<br>

  Book Title: The Wisdom and Foolishness of God-First Corinthians 1-2 in Theological Exploration<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Askani Hans-Christoph<br>
  Abstract: The first two chapters of Paul’s first epistle to the Christians of Corinth, written in the fifth decade of the first century, have played a significant role in the history of Christian theology. Interpreting the central event in Christianity, namely the crucifixion of Jesus, Paul reflects on the wisdom and foolishness of God, which he opposes to the world’s wisdom. According to Paul, the “word of the cross," which is “foolishness" to some and “scandal" to others, leads to an upheaval in one’s way of thinking. For two millenia, theology has often turned to these passages in order to sustain its reflection. Many central questions emerge from Paul’s text on the meaning of a crucified Messiah, on God’s omnipotence, weakness, and suffering. This volume hopes to achieve two things by seeking to place exegetes, historians, philosophers, and theologians in conversation: to better understand Paul’s text and its reception and also to examine the ways in which it can nourish our theological reflection today.<br>

  Book Title: The subject of love-Hélène Cixous and the feminine divine<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Renshaw Sal<br>
  Abstract: *The Subject of Love: Hélène Cixous and the Feminine Divine* is about abundant, generous, other-regarding love. In the history of Western ideas of love, such a configuration has been inseparable from our ideas about divinity and the sacred; often reserved only for God; and rarely thought of as a human achievement. This book is a substantial engagement with her philosophies of love, inviting the reader to reflect on the conditions of subjectivity that just might open us to something like a divine love of the other. Renshaw follows this thread in this genealogy of abundant love: the thread that connects the subject of love from 5th century B.C.E. Greece and Plato, to the 20th century protestant theology of agapic love of Anders Nygren, to the late 20th century poetico-philosophy of Hélène Cixous.

  Book Title: Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kempshall Matthew<br>
  Abstract: This book provides an analytical overview of the vast range of historiography which was produced in western Europe over a thousand-year period between c.400 and c.1500. Concentrating on the general principles of classical rhetoric central to the language of this writing, alongside the more familiar traditions of ancient history, biblical exegesis and patristic theology, this survey introduces the conceptual sophistication and semantic rigour with which medieval authors could approach their narratives of past and present events, and the diversity of ends to which this history could then be put. By providing a close reading of some of the historians who put these linguistic principles and strategies into practice (from Augustine and Orosius through Otto of Freising and William of Malmesbury to Machiavelli and Guicciardini), it traces and questions some of the key methodological changes that characterise the function and purpose of the western historiographical tradition in this formative period of its development.<br>

  Author(s): O’Brien Mark A<br>
  Abstract: A leading biblical scholar, Hans Heinrich Schmid, believes that righteousness, or the right order of the world, is 'the fundamental problem of our human existence'. It is a key theme in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament's theology of creation and salvation, along with associated themes such as justice, steadfast love/loyalty, truth/ fidelity, compassion/mercy, sin and disorder/chaos. A number of studies of righteousness have been undertaken but most have tended to focus on Israel's call to be righteous, as voiced in particular in the Prophetic Books and the Psalter. In contrast, this book focuses on divine righteousness as the basis for all other notions of righteousness, as this is outlined in the foundational teaching or revelation of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament— namely, the Torah or Pentateuch. It then undertakes a study of how righteousness in the Prophetic Books, the Psalter and the Book of Job relates to this foundational teaching.<br>

  Abstract: From North to South brings together the interests in Edward Schillebeeckx of eight theologians from Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia. In each chapter, theologians dialogue from a southern context with one of Schillebeeckx’s themes or methods. Themes such as suffering and negative contrast experiences, political holiness, ecclesiology, God and the cross, resurrection and hope, and theology and culture are addressed. Attention to Schillebeeckx’s hermeneutics lies at the heart of several chapters but is generally woven throughout. Contributors bring their particular southern contexts into serious dialogue with Schillebeeckx’s northern thought. The book concludes with a response to the south from North American theologian, Kathleen McManus OP. In short, the book witnesses to the ongoing challenge and stimulation of Edward Schillebeeckx’s theology.<br>

  Abstract: Cavanaugh only alludes to the work of Johannes Metz (b 1928).1 However, it would seem that the political theology of Metz provides a counterpoint to Cavanaugh and an alternative perspective on how the Maritainian dilemma might be addressed. In so doing, it protects against Cavanaugh’s tendency for ‘the political’ to dissolve into ‘the mystical,’ though it does, itself, open to the specter of the very opposite ‘the mystical’ dissolving into ‘the political’ which was, precisely, the Maritainian dilemma.<br>

  Book Title: God's Word and the Church's Council-Vaticann II and Divine Revelation<br>
  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Monaghan Christopher<br>
  Abstract: The publication of the Vatican II document on Divine Revelation (Dei Verbum) was an exciting and challenging moment for the Church. While honouring the tradition, it also marked a quite dramatic development in the Church’s attitude to modern critical analysis of the Bible and encouraged study and reflection on it by all members of the Church. The golden jubilee of its publication is a timely moment for a book such as this. It contains essays on various aspects of Dei Verbum by authors from around the world. They write from the perspective of their respective disciplines of biblical studies, patristics, theology, liturgy, philosophy, and communications media. They situate the document within the Jewish-Christian tradition, assess its reception since Vatican II, and its implications for the future.<br>

  Author(s): Pickard Stephen<br>
  Abstract: In-Between God' explores three important areas for contemporary Christianity: theology, community and discipleship. Part One inquires into the rhythms of faith as it interacts with themes of uncertainty and doubt, the nature of theological discourse, the task of systematic theology, evangelism and the various ways in which theology is done. Part Two discusses the importance of place in relation to the church, and themes of innovation, undecideability and new forms of monastic community. Part Three addresses themes in discipleship: simplicity, mysticism, the passions and pilgrimage. A red thread connecting these essays is the character of the triune God who is the energy and life in between all things.<br>

In this exploration of Marion's philosophy and theology, Christina M. Gschwandtner presents a comprehensive and critical analysis of the ideas of saturated phenomena and the phenomenology of givenness. She claims that these phenomena do not always appear in the excessive mode that Marion describes and suggests instead that we consider degrees of saturation. Gschwandtner covers major themes in Marion's work-the historical event, art, nature, love, gift and sacrifice, prayer, and the Eucharist. She works within the phenomenology of givenness, but suggests that Marion himself has not considered important aspects of his philosophy.<br>

If religion and thus theology have become problematic yet not impossible, then we must expect such possibility to show up within what Cavell terms the ordinary. However, the ordinary does not provide the location for experiences of incontestable divine revelations, nor does it unfailingly offer clear criteria by which we can assess such experiences. Nevertheless, the ordinary must be so inhabited as to provide glimpses, events, or perspectives from which religious orientation can gain a foothold in our form of life<br>

Caputo, God's existence is haunted by "perhaps," which does not signify indecisiveness but an openness to risk, to the unforeseeable. Perhaps constitutes a theology of what is to come and what we cannot see coming. Responding to current critics of continental philosophy, Caputo explores the materiality of perhaps and the promise of the world. He shows how perhaps can become a new theology of the gaps God opens.<br>

  Abstract: The Incarnate Lord, then, considers central themes in Christology from a metaphysical perspective. Particular attention is given to the hypostatic union, the two natures of Christ, the knowledge and obedience of Jesus, the passion and death of Christ, his descent into hell, and resurrection. A central concern of the book is to argue for the perennial importance of ontological principles of Christology inherited from patristic and scholastic authors. However, the book also seeks to advance an interpretation of Thomistic Christology in a modern context. The teaching Aquinas, then, is central to the study, but it is placed in conversation with various modern theologians, such as Karl Barth, Karl Rahner and Hans Urs von Balthasar. Ultimately the goal of the work is to suggest how traditional Catholic theology might thrive under modern conditions, and also develop fruitfully from engaging in contemporary controversies.<br>

  Abstract: Most scholars today concur that the Fourth Gospel includes both history and theology. Even many patristic interpreters, who often harmonized John with the Synoptics (hence apparently stressing history), recognized John as a “spiritual” Gospel, emphasizing its interpretive aspects. The Gospel clearly interprets theologically the eyewitness claim that apparently stands behind it (cf. 21:24); perhaps most conspicuously, in the Fourth Gospel as a whole the eyewitness claim of water and blood from Jesus’ side (19:34–35) is made to climax a motif of water running through the narrative (1:26, 33; 2:7 – 9; 3:5, 23; 4:10, 13 – 14; 5:2; 7:37 – 39; 9:7;<br>

  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hovey Craig R.<br>
  Abstract: In its various forms, speech is absolutely integral to the Christian mission. The gospel is a message, news that must be passed on if it is to be known by others. Nevertheless, the reality of God cannot be exhausted by Christian knowledge and Christian knowledge cannot be exhausted by our words. All the while, the philosophy of modernity has left Christianity an impoverished inheritance within which to think these things. In Speak Thus, Craig Hovey explores the possibilities and limits of Christian speaking. At times ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical, these essays go to the heart of what it means to be the church today. In practice, the Christian life often has a linguistic shape that surprisingly implicates and reveals the commitments of people like those who care for the sick or those who respond as peacemakers in the face of violence. Because learning to speak one way as opposed to another is a skill that must be learned, Christian speakers are also guides who bear witness to the importance of churches for passing on a felicity with Christian ways of speaking. Through constructive engagements with interlocutors like Ludwig Wittgenstein, George Lindbeck, Jeffrey Stout, Stanley Hauerwas, John Howard Yoder, Thomas Aquinas, and the theology of Radical Orthodoxy, Hovey offers a challenging vision of the church'able to speak with a confidence that only comes from a deep attentiveness to its own limitations while able to speak prophetically in a world weary of words.<br>

  Abstract: With the approach of the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther’s inauguration of the Protestant Reformation and the burgeoning dialogue between Catholics and Lutherans opened under Pope Francis, this new edition of Walter Altmann’s Luther and Liberation is timely and relevant. Luther and Liberation recovers the liberating and revolutionary impact of Luther’s theology, read afresh from the perspective of the Latin American context. Altmann provides a much-needed reassessment of Luther’s significance today through a direct engagement of Luther’s historical situation with an eye keenly situated on the deeply contextual situation of the contemporary reader, giving a localized reading from the author’s own experience in Latin America. The work examines with fresh vigor Luther’s central theological commitments, such as his doctrine of God, Christology, justification, hermeneutics, and ecclesiology, and his forays into economics, politics, education, violence, and war. This new edition greatly expands the original text with fresh scholarship and updated sources, footnotes, and bibliography, and contains several additional new chapters on Luther’s doctrine of God, theology of the sacraments, his controversial perspective on the Jews, and a new comparative account with the Latin American liberation theology tradition.<br>

In this sense, Liberation Christianity (as a conceptual term) achieves an articulation of the elements that subsequently composed liberation theology, that is, it refers to a fixed worldview.<br>

  Book Title: Recognizing the Gift-Toward a Renewed Theology of Nature and Grace<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortres<br>
  Author(s): Rober Daniel A.<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the Gift puts twentieth-century Catholic theological conversations on nature and grace, particularly those of Henri de Lubac and Karl Rahner, into dialogue with Continental philosophy, notably the thought of Jean-Luc Marion and Paul Ricoeur. It argues that a renewed theology of nature and grace must build on the accomplishments of the recent past while acknowledging that an engagement with the political is unavoidable for theology. Ultimately, the aim is to revive and broaden discussion of nature and grace by drawing together the insights of contemporary theologians and Continental philosophers. Too often these areas of inquiry remain quite separate, in part due to differing priorities. This work tries to open that conversation, in part by critically pointing out, in dialogue with Ricoeur, the need in Marion’s work for an acknowledgment of recognition, reciprocity, and the political. It thus argues for a theology of nature and grace in terms of recognition of the gift, drawing out the reciprocal and political nature of gift and givenness in opposition to those, including Marion, who would seek to avoid politics and reciprocity as a proper avenue of inquiry for theology.<br>

  Abstract: The importance of Bonhoeffer’s thought for contemporary theology is well attested and does not need to be reiterated here.

The most fruitful appropriation of Bonhoeffer’s eschatology by Jean-Yves Lacoste is to be found in his

  Book Title: Radical Theology-An Essay on Faith and Theology in the Twenty-First Century<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Dalferth Ingolf U.<br>
  Abstract: Ingolf U. Dalferth develops a “radical theology" that unfolds the orienting strength of faith for human life from the event of God’s presence to every present. In a concise and clear manner, Dalferth outlines the theological and philosophical approaches to hermeneutics in the modern era, in order to promote a convincing and defensible theology for the twenty-first century, critically carrying on Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Bultmann, without forgetting Karl Barth. The result of his reconstruction is a “radical theology" that neither glorifies premodern theology in an antimodern attitude nor seeks a mystical deepening of the secular, but argues for a radical change in theological perspective of the possible. In doing so, theology unfolds “limit concepts" that restrict the claims of science and philosophy critically, and develops “ideas of orientation" that illumine the ways in which human life is understood and lived in radically new ways in faith. From here, Dalferth unfolds the reality of revelation and the Christian sense of an unconditional hope that fundamentally transcends all beliefs based on mundane realities and orients the world on something beyond its own temporal horizon—its loving Creator.<br>

  Book Title: Exodus and Resurrection-The God of Israel in the Theology of Robert W. Jenson<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Nicol Andrew W.<br>
  Abstract: Exodus and Resurrection establishes the important place God’s identity as the “God of Israel" has in the systematic theology of Robert W. Jenson. The work demonstrates that the identification of the God of Israel as the agent of Jesus’ resurrection functions as a foundational premise in Jenson’s Trinitarian theology. Andrew W. Nicol argues that a central characteristic of Jenson’s work is not merely his recognition that the same God who rescued Israel from Egypt raised Jesus from the dead, or the related yet distinct step of renovating his theology in a nonsupersessionist fashion, but also his attempt to conceive of the full implications for doing so in Christian theology, in the church’s self-understanding, and in the church’s relation to Israel and continuing Judaism. In this, Exodus and Resurrection provides a clear and critically appreciative account of Robert W. Jenson’s work and offers a new vital architectonic map of Jenson’s systematic vision.<br>

  Book Title: The Holy One in Our Midst-An Essay on the Flesh of Christ<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Gordon James R.<br>
  Abstract: The Holy One in Our Midst: An Essay on the Flesh of Christ aims to defend the doctrine of the extra Calvinisticum—the doctrine that maintains the Son of God was not restricted to the flesh of Christ during the incarnation—by arguing that it is logically coherent, biblically warranted, catholically orthodox, and theologically useful. It shows that none of the standard objections are devastating to the extra, that the doctrine is rooted in the claims of Christian Scripture and not merely a remnant of perfect being philosophical theology, and that the doctrine plays an important role in contemporary theological discussion. In this way, James R. Gordon revives an important Catholic doctrine that has fallen out of favor in contemporary theology. Secondarily, this project aims to integrate biblical, philosophical, and systematic theology by showing that the tools and methods of each distinct discipline can contribute to the goals and aims of the others.<br>

  Book Title: Into the Far Country-Karl Barth and the Modern Subject<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Long D. Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Into the Far Country is an investigation of Karl Barth’s response to modernity as seen through the prism of the subject under judgment. By suggesting that Barth offers a form of theological resistance to the Enlightenment’s construal of human subjectivity as “absolute," this piece offers a way of talking about the formation of human persons as the process of being kenotically laid bare before the cross and resurrection of Christ. It does so by reevaluating the relationship between Barth and modernity, making the case that Barth understands Protestantism to have become the agent of its own demise by capitulating to modernity’s insistence on the axiomatic priority of the isolated Cartesian ego. Conversations are hosted with figures including Fyodor Dostoevsky, Rowan Williams, Gillian Rose and Donald MacKinnon in the service of elucidating an account of the human person liberated from captivity to what Barth names “self-judgment," and freed for creative participation in the super-abundant source of life that is the prayerful movement from the Son to the Father in the Spirit. Therefore, an account of Barth’s theology is offered that is deeply concerned with the triune God’s revelatory presence as that which drives the community into the crucible of difficulty that is the life of kenotic dispossession.<br>

  Book Title: Crossing the Rubicon: The Borderlands of Philosophy and Theology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Shank Reuben<br>
  Abstract: In France today, philosophy--phenomenology in particular--finds itself in a paradoxical relation to theology. Some debate a "theological turn." Others disavow theological arguments as if such arguments would tarnish their philosophical integrity, while nevertheless carrying out theology in other venues. In Crossing the Rubicon, Emmanuel Falque seeks to end this face-off. Convinced that "the more one theologizes, the better one philosophizes," he proposes a counterblow by theology against phenomenology. Instead of another philosophy of "the threshold" or "the leap"--and through a retrospective and forward-looking examination of his own method--he argues that an encounter between the two disciplines will reveal their mutual fruitfulness and their true distinctive borders. Falque shows that he has made the crossing between philosophy and theology and back again with audacity and perhaps a little recklessness, knowing full well that no one thinks without exposing himself to risk.<br>

  Author(s): SYMONS STÉPHANE<br>
  Abstract: In the Arcades Project, Walter Benjamin writes that his work is "related to theology as blotting pad is related to ink. It is saturated with it." For a thinker so decisive to critical literary, cultural, political, and aesthetic writings over the past half-century, Benjamin's relationship to theological matters has been less observed than it should, even despite a variety of attempts over the last four decades to illuminate the theological elements latent within his eclectic and occasional writings. Such attempts, though undeniably crucial to comprehending his thought, remain in need of deepened systematic analysis. In bringing together some of the most renowned experts from both sides of the Atlantic, Walter Benjamin and Theology seeks to establish a new site from which to address both the issue of Benjamin's relationship with theology and all the crucial aspects that Benjamin himself grappled with when addressing the field and operations of theological inquiry.<br>

  Abstract: What do we talk about when we talk about religion? Is it an array of empirical facts about historical human civilizations? Or is religion what is in essence unpredictable-perhaps the very emergence of the new? In what ways are the legacies of religion-its powers, words, things, and gestures-reconfiguring themselves as the elementary forms of life in the twenty-first century?Given the Latin roots of the word religion and its historical Christian uses, what sense, if any, does it make to talk about religionin other traditions? Where might we look for common elements that would enable us to do so? Has religion as an overarching concept lost all its currency, or does it ineluctably return-sometimes in unexpected ways-the moment we attempt to do without it? This book explores the difficulties and double binds that arise when we ask What is religion? Offering a marvelously rich and diverse array of perspectives, it begins the task of rethinking religionand religious studiesin a contemporary world. Opening essays on the question What is religion?are followed by clusters exploring the relationships among religion, theology, and philosophy and the links between religion, politics, and law. Pedagogy is the focus of the following section. Religion is then examined in particular contexts, from classical times to the present Pentacostal revival, leading into an especially rich set of essays on religion, materiality, and mediatization. The final section grapples with the ever-changing forms that religionis taking, such as spirituality movements and responses to the ecological crisis.Featuring the work of leading scholars from a wide array of disciplines, traditions, and cultures, Religion: Beyond a Concept will help set the agenda for religious studies for years to come. It is the first of five volumes in a collection entitled The Future of the Religious Past, the fruit of a major international research initiative funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.<br>

  Book Title: Ascent into Heaven in Luke-Acts-New Explorations of Luke's Narrative Hinge<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Pao David W.<br>
  Abstract: In comparison with other aspects of Jesus’ life and ministry, his ascent into heaven has often been overlooked within the history of the church. However, considering its placement at the end of the Gospel and the beginning of Acts—the only narrative depictions of the event in the New Testament—the importance of Jesus’ ascent into heaven is undeniable for Luke’s two-volume work. While select studies have focused on particular aspects of these accounts for Luke’s story, the importance of the ascension calls for renewed attention to the narratological and theological significance of these accounts within their historical and literary contexts. In this volume, leading scholars discuss the ascension narratives within the ancient contexts of biblical, Second Temple Jewish, and Greco-Roman literature; the literary contours of Luke-Acts; and questions of historical and theological significance in the wider milieu of New Testament theology and early Christian historiography. The volume sets out new positions and directions for the next generations of interpreters regarding one of the most important and unique elements of the Lukan writings.<br>

  Abstract: This book has been a sustained attempt to revise John Howard Yoder’s sociological theology so that it might better avoid charges of reducing theology to sociology, method to ideology, and expansive Christian witness to narrow socio-political perfectionism. Pierre Bourdieu’s relational sociology has been the primary tool of revision, as it enables amendments to Yoder’s social theoretical assumptions that render them more clearly non-reductive. Several of Bourdieu’s key concepts were put into conversation with Yoder’s theology of the principalities and powers, his broader
                  oeuvre, and his critics. This conversation facilitated revisions to Yoder’s thought in several areas: creation, anthropology violence, method,<br>

  Abstract: As we have seen in the discussion of his biography, Satan is a paradoxical figure, showing contradictory characteristics and constantly evading definition. In this section, I explore how different satanic characters in literature represent manifestations of evil, in conjunction with the theological concepts of theodicy and theological discussions of evil. I refer to it as a literary exploration of postmodern or contemporary thoughts on evil in philosophy and theology. We have seen now how Satan is a literary figure and finds his

  Book Title: All Shall be Well-Explorations in Universal Salvation and Christian Theology, from Origen to Moltmann<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Macdonald Gregory<br>
  Abstract: Universalism runs like a slender thread through the history of Christian theology. Over the centuries Christian universalism, in one form or another, has been reinvented time and time again. In this book an international team of scholars explore the diverse universalisms of Christian thinkers from the Origen to Moltmann. In the introduction Gregory MacDonald argues that theologies of universal salvation occupy a space between heresy and dogma. The studies in this collection aim, in the first instance, to hear, understand, and explain the eschatological claims of a range of Christians from the third to the twenty-first centuries. They also offer some constructive, critical engagement with those claims.<br>

All are sinners without distinction, and all will be made righteous without any merit on their part by his grace which has come to pass in Christ Jesus (Rom 3:24).” Christ’s atonement for our sins is truly unlimited. That “God’s Son has died for all,” says Moltmann, “must undermine, remove, and destroy the things which mark men out as elect and non-elect.”²<br>

Other, surprising figures also appear, such as Shakespeare, Washington and Lincoln. How did these figures from history interpret Scripture? What might their diverse approaches teach today’s readers of the Old and New Testaments? What is missing in contemporary biblical interpretation that an awareness of the history of exegesis might complete? Join C.

  Book Title: Lyrical Theology of Charles Wesley - Expanded Edition-A Reader<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Kimbrough S.T.<br>
  Abstract: One of the difficulties in studying the theology of Wesleyan hymns and sacred poems is that it is couched in a literary and liturgical art form that does not fit into the usual intellectual paths defined over the last two centuries for the study of theology, which tends to be a prose endeavour. Charles Wesley composed a number of thematic collections of hymns, such as those based on the Christian year, e.g., Hymns for the Nativity of our Lord, Hymns for our Lord’s Resurrection, Hymns for Ascension-Day, Hymns for Whitsunday, but his lyrics on a plethora of theological themes, such as sanctification, perfection, holiness, etc., are scattered throughout his over 9,000 hymns and poems from a writing and publishing career that spanned almost fifty years. One of the primary purposes of this volume is to bring together a collection of hymns and sacred poems representative of Charles Wesley’s theological thinking. The texts are organized within a theological outline in order to make the study of his theological ideas and concepts more readily accessible, though many of them could be placed in diverse theological categories. This is a welcome addition to Wesleyan scholarship and a book that all those who sing Wesley's hymns will be interested in.<br>

  Book Title: Radical Embodiment-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Nikkel David H.<br>
  Abstract: "Radical embodiment" refers to an anthropology and an epistemology fundamentally rooted in our bodies as always in correlation with our natural and social worlds. All human rationality, meaning, and value arise not only instrumentally but also substantively from this embodiment in the world. Radical embodiment reacts against Enlightenment mind-body dualism, as well as its monistic offshoots, including the physicalism that reduces everything to component matter-energy at the expense of subjectivity and meaning. It also rejects certain forms of postmodernism that reinscribe modern dualisms. David H. Nikkel develops the perspective of "radical embodiment" by examining varieties of modern and postmodern theology, and the nature and role of tradition-in terms of linguistic and non-linguistic experience, the religion and science dialogue on the nature of consciousness, and the immanent and transcendent aspects of God.<br>

No, God does not disappear into the universe a la 1960’ s “death of God” theology or some versions of radical postmodernism. I believe that the embodied panentheistic formulation I have advanced can account for a certain experiential sense of divine absence, while at the same time allowing for the reality and presence of the divine.<br>

  Book Title: Christian Theology and Religious Pluralism-A Critical Evaluation of John Hick<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Nah David S.<br>
  Abstract: The question of religious pluralism is the most significant yet thorniest of issues in theology today, and John Hick (1922–2012) has long been recognized as its most important scholar. However, while much has been written analyzing the philosophical basis of Hick’s pluralism, very little attention has been devoted to the theological foundations of his argument. Filling this gap, this book examines Hick’s theological attempts to systematically deconstruct the church’s traditional incarnational Christology. Special attention is given to evaluating Hick’s foundational theses “that Jesus himself did not teach what was to become the orthodox Christian understanding of him" and “that the dogma of Jesus’ two natures . . . has proved to be incapable of being explicated in any satisfactory way." By elucidating the ways in which Hick’s arguments fail, David Nah demonstrates that Hick was unwarranted in breaking away from the church’s incarnational Christology that has been at the core of Christianity for almost two thousand years.<br>

  Book Title: Sacramental Presence after Heidegger-Onto-theology, Sacraments, and the Mother's Smile<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Sweeney Conor<br>
  Abstract: "Theology after Heidegger must take into account history and language as elements in the pursuit of meaning. Quite often, this prompts a hurried flight from metaphysics to an embrace of an absence at the center of Christian narrativity. Conor Sweeney here explores the “postmodern" critique of presence in the context of sacramental theology, engaging the thought of Louis-Marie Chauvet and Lieven Boeve. Chauvet is an influential postmodern theologian whose critique of the perceived onto-theological constitution of presence in traditional sacramental theology has made big waves, while Boeve is part of a more recent generation of theologians who even more wholeheartedly embrace postmodern consequences for theology. Sweeney considers the extent to which postmodernism à la Heidegger upsets the hermeneutics of sacramentality, asking whether this requires us to renounce the search for a presence that by definition transcends us. Against both the fetishization of presence and absence, Sweeney argues that metaphysics has a properly sacramental basis, and that it is only through this reality that the dialectic of presence and absence can be transcended. The case is made for the full but restless signification of the mother’s smile as the paradigm for genuine sacramental presence."<br>

How should we evaluate Lutheran tradition in today’s Western multicultural and post-Christian society? Is it possible to develop a Lutheran theological position that can be regarded as reasonable in a society that evidences a considerable weakening of the role of Christianity? What are the challenges raised by cultural diversity for a Lutheran theology and ethics? Is it possible to develop a Lutheran identity in a multicultural society, and is there any fruitful Lutheran contribution to the coexistence of diff erent religious and non-religious traditions in the future?<br>

  Book Title: Reading Daniel as a Text in Theological Hermeneutics-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hebbard Aaron B.<br>
  Abstract: Reading Daniel as a Text in Theological Hermeneutics sets out to read the book of Daniel as a narrative textbook in the field of theological hermeneutics. Employing such disciplines as historical criticism, literary criticism, narrative theology, and hermeneutics, this work seeks to maintain an interdisciplinary outlook on the book of Daniel. Two inherently linked perspectives are utilized in this reading of Daniel. First is the perception that the character of Daniel is the paradigm of the good theological hermeneut; theology and hermeneutics are inseparable and converge in the character of Daniel. Readers must recognize in Daniel certain qualities, attitudes, abilities, and convictions well worth emulating. Essentially, readers must aspire to become a Daniel. Second is the standpoint that the book of Daniel on the whole should be read as a hermeneutics textbook. Readers are led through a series of theories and exercises meant to be instilled into their theological, intellectual, and practical lives. Attention to readers is a constant endeavor throughout this thesis. The concern is fundamentally upon contemporary readers and their communities, yet with sensible consideration given to the historical readerly community with which contemporary readers find continuity. Greater concentration is placed on what the book of Daniel means for contemporary readers than on what the book of Daniel meant in its historical setting. In the end, readers are left with difficult challenges, a sobering awareness of the volatility of the business of hermeneutics, and serious implications for readers to implement both theologically and hermeneutically.<br>

The philosophical and critical theory conversation of nihilism and its relative, indeterminism or undecidability, suggests a kind of hope without over-confident claims of knowable hopes for the future. Scriptural and extra-scriptural lament demonstrates a persistent and apparently futile hope that continues into and through death with no sign of God’s response or rescue. Disability theology challenges hopes about<br>

  Book Title: The Fate of Saul's Progeny in the Reign of David-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Longman Tremper<br>
  Abstract: Cephas Tushima provides a thorough analysis of the fate of Saul's heirs, focussing on whether their tragedies were due to continuing divine retribution, coincidence, or Davidic orchestration. He concludes that David was unjust and calculating in his dealings with the Saulides and, like other Near Eastern usurpers, perpetrated heinous injustices against the vanquished house of Saul. Traditionally readers saw Saul as evil and David as a hero; but more recently scholars have written about Saul as a tragic character and David as a villain, turning the book of Samuel into deeply contested interpretive territory. Tushima provides analysis of the critical literature surrounding this contentious issue and contributes his own study that will prove important to the continuing debate. He assesses David's character by analysing how he treats the surviving children of his predecessor, drawing upon the provisions for justice in the covenant community in the book of Deuteronomy. He demonstrates a connection between Samuel and the Torah through themes and motifs, and develops theological conclusions from them on such issues as the impact of human conduct on the environment, marriage, monarchy and Zion theology.<br>

  Book Title: Theology in Language, Rhetoric, and Beyond-Essays in Old and New Testament<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Lundbom Jack R.<br>
  Abstract: Theology in Language, Rhetoric, and Beyond' places before a broad audience of students and general readers theological essays on both the Old and New Testaments. Theology is seen to derive from a number of sources: the biblical language, biblical rhetoric and composition, academic disciplines other than philosophy, and above all a careful exegesis of the biblical text. The essay on Psalm 23 makes use of anthropology and human-development theory; the essay on Deuteronomy incorporates Wisdom themes; the essay called "Jeremiah and the Created Order" looks at ideas not only about God and creation but also about the seldom-considered idea of God and a return to chaos; and the essay on the "Confessions of Jeremiah" examines, not the words that this extraordinary prophet was given by God to preach, but what he himself felt and experienced in the office to which he was called. One essay on "Biblical and theological themes" includes a translation into the African language of Lingala, which weaves together the story of early Christianity with the more recent founding of churches in Africa and Asia. Jack R. Lundbom argues eloquently through these essays that theology is rooted in biblical words, in themselves, in rhetoric and their different contexts.<br>

  Book Title: Biblical Knowing-A Scriptural Epistemology of Error<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Bartholomew Craig G.<br>
  Abstract: The Christian Scriptures could be theologically described as beginning and ending with an epistemological outlook. The first episode of humanity’s activity centers on the knowledge of good and evil. The final stage of humanity is pictured by Jeremiah as a universally prophetic and knowing society: 'And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord', for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord' (Jer 31:34). What happens to knowledge in between? In this work, Dru Johnson reconsiders epistemology with the tool of biblical theology: an approach to knowledge as developed in Genesis 2 and explored throughout the Tanakh (i.e., the Old Testament) and New Testament. By re-examining the neglected idea that Christian Scripture might be developing robust descriptions of knowing that can direct us today, the ambition of this book is to lay the groundwork for a biblical theology of knowledge - how knowledge is broached, described, and how error is rectified within the texts of the Christian canon. Proper knowing as it occurs in the Scriptures means that there are better and worse ways to know. Even more, the epistemology that is found to be advocated in Scripture is not relegated to religious knowing. Johnson argues that scientific epistemology and biblical epistemology make significant points of contact suggesting that they are fundamentally consistent with each other.<br>

  Abstract: In the prior chapter, we were hesitant about appropriating any of the analytic epistemologies surveyed because they appeared incapable of addressing the broad sense of knowing required to do theology. However, there is a burgeoning group of philosophers and theologians who are advocating that theology might benefit from being more like analytic philosophy, at least, more like the analytic method. This most recent effort to encourage Christian theologians toward the analytic method was captured by the anthology

  Book Title: From Faith to Faith-John Wesley’s Covenant Theology and the Way of Salvation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Noble T. A.<br>
  Abstract: The very title of this volume makes a claim and extends an invitation. Simply put, the claim is this: John Wesley was an adherent of covenant theology. Consequently, a proper understanding of his theological thought - and of his soteriology in particular - is impossible apart from accounting for the influence of covenant theology on him. The invitation then, is to investigate Wesley's thought in light of this claim. Having started his research simply as an investigation into a rather curious distinction Wesley made among those to whom he gave spiritual counsel (some people, he said, have "the faith of a servant"; others have "the faith of a son"), Rodes soon realised that covenant theology was an immensely powerful influence on Wesley's thought, and that he was even able to significantly and creatively adapted it to the template of his evangelical Arminianism.<br>

  Abstract: The salvific sufficiency of the various dispensations of the covenant of grace, though variously conceived, is one of the primary soteriological affirmations of covenant theology. The sufficiency of each dispensation rests on the promise of Genesis 3:15, a promise for which the warranty is “the lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” Wesley’s vision of the way of salvation is profoundly shaped by his understanding that this promise and warranty are extended to all of fallen humanity rather than to the elect only, and by his conceiving the salvific sufficiency of the covenant of grace to be concurrent and<br>

  Author(s): Adams Edward<br>
  Abstract: In his work 'Deliverance of God' Douglas Campbell presents what Chris Tilling considers a "complete rereading of Paul’s letters that genuinely offers a way beyond problems associated with old and new perspectives. And his resultant picture of Paul’s theology generally, and the Apostle’s soteriology particularly, is beautiful, liberating, consistent, exegetically rigorous, theologically aware and pastorally compelling. It captures, I think, the best of the old perspective, with its concern to speak energetically about the God who saves, and it takes seriously the concerns of the new perspective on Second Temple Judaism. But in remarkable and jarringly elegant ways, it moves beyond them both." This collection of essays is divided into two sections. Part One analyses key aspects of Campbell’s account of the problem confronting readers of Paul. Part Two analyses key aspects of Campbell’s proposed solution to to the current confused state of Pauline interpretation. This book is essential reading for anyone involved in the study of Paul.<br>

  Book Title: The Dialogical Spirit-Christian Reason and Theological Method in the Third Millennium<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Yong Amos<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary proposals for Christian theology from post-liberalism to Radical Orthodoxy and beyond have espoused their own methodological paradigms. Those who have ventured into this domain of theological method, however, have usually had to stake their claims vis-à-vis trends in what may be called the contemporary "post-al" age, whether of the post-modern, post-Christendom, post-Enlightenment, post-Western, or post-colonial varieties. This volume is unique among offerings in this arena in suggesting a way forward that engages on each of these fronts, and does so from a particularistic Christian perspective without giving up on Christian theology's traditional claims to universality. This is accomplished through the articulation of a distinctive dialogical methodology informed by both Pentecostalism and Evangelicalism, one rooted in the Christian salvation-history narrative of Incarnation and Pentecost that is yet open to the world in its many and various cultural, ethnic, religious, and disciplinary discourses. Amos Yong here engages with twelve different interlocutors representing different ecumenical, religious, and disciplinary perspectives. 'The Dialogical Spirit' thus not only proffers a model for Christian theological method suitable for the twenty-first century global context but also exemplifies this methodological approach through its interactions across the contemporary scholarly, inter-religious, and theological landscape.<br>

The preceding has attempted to do theology dialogically, with twelve conversation partners, in order to exemplify an effective model of Christian theological inquiry at the beginning of the third millennium. I have also shown that such a dialogical approach is theologically funded by a pneumatological imagination as manifest particularly in the Acts narrative. Further, such a pneumatologically inspired dialogical method may be uniquely suited to enable navigation of our postfoundationalist, post-Christendom, postsecular, postmodern, and pluralistic landscape.<br>

His doctrine of justification, theology of the cross, Trinity, law and gospel, eucharistic theology, and two kingdoms theory among others are seen at the point of the death, resurrection and reconciliation of the crucified Christ, the scope and reach of which is of inclusive, universal character allowing and tolerating other ways.

  Book Title: Facing the Other-John Paul II, Levinas, and the Body<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): de Malherbe Brice<br>
  Abstract: What is the significance of the body? What might phenomenology contribute to a theological account of the body? And what is gained by prolonging the overlooked dialogue between St. John Paul II and Emmanuel Levinas? Nigel Zimmermann answers these questions through the agreements and the tensions between two of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century. John Paul II, the Polish pope, philosopher, and theologian, and Emmanuel Levinas, the French-Jewish philosopher of Lithuanian heritage, were provocative thinkers who courageously faced and challenged the assumptions of their age. Both held the human person in high regard and did their thinking with constant reference to God and to theological language. Zimmermann does not shirk from the challenges of each thinker and does not hide their differences. However, he shows how they bequeath a legacy regarding the body that we would overlook at significant ethical peril. We are called, Zimmermann argues, to face the other. In this moment God refuses a banal marginalisation and our call to responsibility for the other person is issued in their disarming vulnerability. In the body, philosophy, theology, and ethics converge to call us to glory, even in the paradox of lowly suffering.<br>

  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Matheny Paul Duane<br>
  Abstract: For centuries, the global understanding of Church has been shaped by Western theological imperatives. Yet today, the decline of institutional religion in the West, and the extraordinary growth of the Church of the global South mean that a radical movement beyond such theologies is required. In this book, Paul Matheny argues that the Church would benefit by becoming more contextualized and less Western. Contextual Theology is an attempt to address that issue and to examine how a reassessment of the relationship of the Gospel to cultural context can advance this critical and necessary development. Through an accessible and critical approach, Matheny considers the historical background to contextual theology. In the same way, he aims to show how to use contextual methods to think theologically and act missiologically in different cultural contexts.<br>

  Book Title: Allegorizing History-The Venerable Bede, Figural Exegesis and Historical Theory<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Furry Timothy J.<br>
  Abstract: What is history? This question can be taken in many ways, including radically skeptical ones, but in 'Allegorizing History' Timothy J. Furry asks the questions not with that axe to grind but because it has become clear to him, through study of Bede and other ancient Christians, that history is not so simple. To be sure, many, if not all scholars, know that thanks to the work of postmodern philosophers and twentieth-century historical theorists like R.G. Collingwood, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Hayden White. In this work, Furry shows that there are competing notions and purposes of historical practice, more specifically between Bede and the scholars who have recently studied him. Moreover, he explaisn why this difference matters and what implications result from such competing notions and practices of history, especially in the exegesis of Scripture as well as how exegesis also influences conceptions of history. Following a tradition of historians and theologians who have sought to blur the lines between theology and other disciplines, Furry explores how, if biblical exegesis was not an isolated discipline for ancient and medieval Christians, then its effects should be seen in other arenas. His argument here is that one of these arenas or disciplines is history.<br>

  Abstract: The twentieth century has been called a "century of horror".

This book demonstrates not only the ways in which the wars of the twentieth century have altered theological engagement and religious practice, but also the degree to which religious ways of thinking have shaped the way we construct historical narratives. Drawing on diverse sources - from the Hebrew Bible to Commonwealth war graves, from Greek tragedy to post-Holocaust theology - Alana M. Vincent probes the intersections between past and present, memory and identity, religion and nationality. The result is a book that defies categorization and offers no easy answers, but instead pursues an agenda of theological realism, holding out continued hope for the restoration of the world.<br>

  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Rampton David<br>
  Abstract: More than fifty years after the publication of
      Anatomy of Criticism, Northrop Frye remains one of Canada's most influential intellectuals. This reappraisal reasserts the relevance of his work to the study of literature and illuminates its fruitful intersection with a variety of other fields, including film, cultural studies, linguistics, and feminism. Many of the contributors draw upon the early essays, correspondence, and diaries recently published as part of theCollected Works of Northrop Fryeseries, in order to explore the development of his extraordinary intellectual range and the implications of his imaginative syntheses. They refute postmodernist arguments that Frye's literary criticism is obsolete and propose his wide-ranging and non-linear ways of thinking as a model for twenty-first century readers searching for innovative ways of understanding literature and its relevance to contiguous disciplines. The volume provides an in-depth examination of Frye's work on a range of literary questions, periods, and genres, as well as a consideration of his contributions to literary theory, philosophy, and theology. The portrait that emerges is that of a writer who still has much to offer those interested in literature and the ways it represents and transforms our world. The book's overall argument is that Frye's case for the centrality of the imagination has never been more important where understanding history, reconciling science and culture, or reconceptualizing social change is concerned.<br>

  Book Title: A Theology for the Earth-The Contributions of Thomas Berry and Bernard Lonergan<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): DALTON ANNE MARIE<br>
  Abstract: While many feel that something must be done, few perceive the state of the ecological crisis as a "profound religious problem." While Thomas Berry sought to fire the imagination and motivate his listener to action, Bernard Lonergan was absorbed by the growing gulf between traditional Christian theology and its relevance to modern problems. This book brings together the work of these dynamic thinkers and examines their mutual contribution to theology for our time and for our planet.<br>

  Abstract: This work originated in a desire to discover the relationship between two urgencies of our times. The first was the ecological crisis and the second, the reform of Christian theology. The preliminary, largely untested insights that moved the project into actuality were that (1) as Thomas Berry had loudly and clearly proclaimed, the ecological crisis was also religious; it had religious roots and it required a religious solution, and (2) a theology that did not serve to increase hope in the possibility of authentically negotiating the major crises of our time had already died. Bernard Lonergan seemed to corroborate this<br>

  Abstract: I shall begin by trying to give some reasonable construal of what political theology might come to. Traditionally, and somewhat ethnocentrically, theology is taken to be that discipline which more or less systematically examines the nature and attributes of God, his relation to creatures (human and otherwise), and to the rest of the universe. Political theology concerns itself with the political and broadly social aspects of this. Theology, as the editors of
                  New Theology 6tell us, “exists — to help people interpret, to inspire them, and to judge their aspirations and methods.”¹ It of course unavoidably does this in a<br>

Sometimes biographers may have had sources unknown to us for information in these scenes; but as we shall observe further below, ancient historians and biographers also could construct scenes based on plausible inferences.<br>

  Book Title: Comparing Faithfully-Insights for Systematic Theological Reflection<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS MICHELLE VOSS<br>
  Abstract: Every generation of theologians must respond to its context by rearticulating the central tenets of the faith. Interreligious comparison has been integral to this process from the start of the Christian tradition and is especially salient today. The emerging field of comparative theology, in which close study of another religious tradition yields new questions and categories for theological reflection in the scholar's home tradition, embodies the ecumenical spirit of this moment. This discipline has the potential to enrich systematic theology and, by extension, theological education, at its foundations. This resource for pastors and theology students reconsiders five central doctrines of the Christian faith in light of focused interreligious investigations. The dialogical format of the book builds conversation about the doctrine of God, theodicy, humanity, Christology, and soteriology. Its comparative essays span examples from Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, Jain, and Confucian traditions, indigenous Aztec theology, and contemporary "spiritual but not religious" thought, to offer exciting new perspectives on Christian doctrine. The essays in this volume demonstrate that engagement with religious diversity need not be an afterthought in the study of Christian systematic theology; rather, it can be a way into systematic theological thinking. Each section invites students to test theological categories, to consider Christian doctrine in relation to specific comparisons, and to take up comparative study in their own contexts.<br>

  Author(s) Rambo Shelly<br>
  Abstract: Leafing through introductory textbooks in Christian systematic theology, you will find discussions of salvation located in multiple places—under the topics of Christology (the nature and work of Christ), the “other” religions, and eschatology, the study of last or final things. Insofar as these primers orient elementary readers into knowledge of Christian faith, they set out the major points for theological discussion and debate. Eschatology often becomes the major landing point for discussions of salvation because the question of salvation is often framed in terms of ultimate ends. Under the doctrine of eschatology, soteriological discussions will circle around Jesus’s saying,<br>

  Book Title: The Wedding Feast of the Lamb-Eros, the Body, and the Eucharist<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hughes George<br>
  Abstract: Emmanuel Falque's The Wedding Feast of the Lamb represents a turning point in his thought. Here, Falque links philosophy and theology in an original fashion that allows us to see the full effect of theology's "backlash" against philosophy. By attending closely to the incarnation and the eucharist, Falque develops a new concept of the body and of love: By avoiding the common mistake of "angelism"--consciousness without body--Falque considers the depths to which our humanity reflects animality, or body without consciousness. He shows the continued relevance of the question "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" (John 6:52), especially to philosophy. We need to question the meaning of "this is my body" in "a way that responds to the needs of our time" (Vatican II). Because of the ways that "Hoc est corpus meum" has shaped our culture and our modernity, this is a problem both for religious belief and for culture.<br>

  Book Title: Analogies of Transcendence-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): FIELDS STEPHEN M.<br>
  Abstract: The problem of nature and grace lies at the heart of Christian theology. No dimension of divine revelation can be addressed without implicitly drawing reference to this issue.Analogies of Transcendence focuses on the central role that the analogies of being and faith play in developing a solution to the problem. These link God, as self-manifesting transcendence, to the human person as both fallen and justified, and to the material cosmos. Although the proposed solution draws on the work of Maréchal, de Lubac, Balthasar, and Rahner, it criticizes their approach for its underdeveloped analogies that diminish nature in grace's engagement with it. In redressing this weakness, Fr. Fields adapts its solution to the intellectual struggle of our time. This volume examines the origins and structure of modernity, which, it asserts, has not been superseded and is therefore critical of'‘postmodernism,' as well as of some ambiguous legacies of Thomism.<br>

  Abstract: The previous three chapters have selectively probed into the last seven hundred years of nature and grace’s relation. Let us take stock of our findings. In the first place, we have seen what blind alleys to avoid. On the one hand, we have concluded that the theory of pure nature, at least as putatively grounded in Thomas, contains two equivocations of the concept of the good. These continue problematically to influence some modern theology, in addition to having contributed to the breakdown of the Baroque synthesis. Perhaps sensitive to this contribution, recent papal thought tends to signal a turn away<br>

  Abstract: In many ways, the possibilities for contemporary philosophical and theological thinking have been determined by Kant. Whether explicitly or implicitly, religion has been thought consistently either within, along, or beyond the limits legislated by classical modern reason. At the same time, its status has remained problematic, because it was left out of the fundamental sources of human knowledge according to Kant’s critique. Although he essentially appended religion onto morality, since that time, religion has flirted with and been skirted by scientific theoretical knowledge, ethics, and aesthetics. In his

  Book Title: The Resounding Soul-Reflections on the Metaphysics and Vivacity of the Human Person<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Kimbriel Samuel<br>
  Abstract: It is surely not coincidental that the term “soul" should mean not only the centre of a creature’s life and consciousness, but also a thing or action characterized by intense vivacity (“that bike’s got soul!"). It also seems far from coincidental that the same contemporary academic discussions that have largely cast aside the language of “soul" in their quest to define the character of human mental life should themselves be so – how to say it? – bloodless, so lacking in soul. This volume arises from the opposite premise, namely that the task of understanding human nature is bound up with and in important respects dependent upon the more critical task of learning to be fully human, of learning to have soul. The papers collected here are derived from a conference in Oxford sponsored by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy and together explore the often surprising landscape that emerges when human consciousness is approached from this angle. Drawing upon literary, philosophical, theological, historical, and musical modes of analysis, the essays of this volume vividly remind the reader of the power of the ancient language of soul over against contemporary impulses to reduce, fragment, and overly determine human selfhood.<br>

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

  Abstract: In recent years, Christian ethics has begun to recover an appreciation for the moral and religious significance of friendship. While much of Christian ethics in the twentieth century tended to regard friendship with a somewhat skeptical eye, important insights in the last twenty years or so have helped us come to a greater appreciation for its positive contribution to the moral life. The recovery of friendship has taken place primarily within Aristotelian and Thomistic circles but also within feminism, Augustinian ethics, Lutheran ethics, narrative theology, phenomenological and personalist ethics, and elsewhere.¹<br>

  Abstract: Having demonstrated how the cosmic conflict motif permeates the OT, we must now consider the much more intense way this motif is reflected in the NT, and especially how it is supremely illustrated in the crucifixion. I will first review the various ways the NT intensifies the OT conviction that our world is engulfed in forces of destruction that must be perpetually held at bay for death and destruction to be averted. For only when we fully appreciate the intensity of this warfare world view can we appreciate the central role the cross plays in it within NT theology. Having<br>

  Book Title: The humanities and the Irish university-Anomalies and opportunities<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Sullivan Michael<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book-length study of the humanities and the Irish university. Ireland was a deeply religious country throughout the twentieth century but the colleges of its National University never established a religion or theology department. The official first language of Ireland is Irish but the vast majority of teaching in the arts and humanities is in English. These are two of the anomalies that long constrained humanities education in Ireland. This book charts a history of responses to humanities education in the Irish context. Reading the work of John Henry Newman, Padraig Pearse, Sean O Tuama, Denis Donoghue, Declan Kiberd, Richard Kearney and others, it looks for an Irish humanities ethos. It compares humanities models in the US, France and Asia with those in Ireland in light of work by Immanuel Kant, Pierre Bourdieu and Jacques Derrida. It should appeal to those interested in Irish education and history.The first book-length study of the humanities and the Irish university<br>

Some philosophers, such as Leibniz and Clarke, responded from within the rationalist tradition.

It is, rather, a hard-won consensus that emerged in a season of scholarship preoccupied with “history,” in which theological interpretation of the Old Testament was dominated by the programmatic slogan “God acts in history.” The connection between wisdom and creation has permitted interpretation to move outside “history” and to challenge the fear of “natural theology” that pertained in Barthian circles of interpretation.

  Book Title: Becoming Human Again-The Theological Life of Gustaf Wingren<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Olson Daniel M.<br>
  Abstract: One of the most influential Swedish theologians of the twentieth century, Gustaf Wingren’s career spanned more than forty years of upheaval both in his field and around the globe. Provocative and challenging, Wingren revelled in a good argument and this attitude set the tone for much of his scholarship. A Swedish Lutheran, he made his name through his research into the theology of Martin Luther, breaking away from both traditional interpretations of Luther and the theology of his famous teachers, Karl Barth and Anders Nygren, before shifting his focus onto systematic theology. In a fresh take, Bengt Kristensson Uggla delves into the influence of Wingren’s second wife, Greta Hofsten, on the direction of his theology. Hofsten, a left-wing political activist who was searching for a new language of faith, wove Wingren’s work together with her own political philosophy to create an unusual kind of Christian socialism. Her thinking had a profound effect on Wingren, causing him to recontextualise his older work entirely. In Becoming Human Again, Uggla examines how Wingren’s combative nature often served him well as a theologian, driving him to engage with innovations in the field and re-examine his older views.<br>

  Book Title: Constructing Constructive Theology-An Introductory Sketch<br>
  Publisher: Fortress Press<br>
  Author(s): Wyman Jason A.<br>
  Abstract: To date, constructive theology hasn’t been viewed or conceptualized as a movement or trend in theology on its own as a whole. Questions arise as to what constructive theology is, where it came from, why it considers itself “constructive," and why constructive is something different from the ways in which theology has been done in the past. This book traces the overall historical arc of constructive theology, from proto-movement through the present. Inklings of constructive theology emerged well before it began to take any formalized shape. At the same time, an important shift occurred when a group of theologians decided to create the Workgroup on Constructive Theology. Further, even as the workgroup continues to work collectively, producing textbooks, statements, and methodologies concerning theology, many theologians who are not part of the workgroup or may not even know it exists have adopted the moniker of “constructive theologian." The book also considers the term “constructive" itself, offering possible reasons and historical contexts that led to this distinction being made in contrast to “systematic" theology and its subcategories. Constructive theology speaks to a very specific, historically situated emergence in the academy generally and in theology’s attempts to engage those shifts specifically.<br>

  Abstract: How To Do Comparative Theology therefore contributes to the maturation of method in the field of comparative theological studies, learning across religious borders, by bringing together essays drawing on different Christian traditions of learning, Judaism and Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism, the wisdom of senior scholars, and also insights from a younger generation of scholars who have studied theology and religion in new ways, and are more attuned to the language of the "spiritual but not religious." The essays in this volume show great diversity in method, and also-over and again and from many angles-coherence in intent, a commitment to one learning from the other, and a confidence that one's home tradition benefits from fair and unhampered learning from other and very different spiritual and religious traditions. It therefore shows the diversity and coherence of comparative theology as an emerging discipline today.<br>

Taking the seminal legacy of Orthodox theologian Alexander Schmemann (1921-1983) as its point of departure, Butcher contributes to the renewal of contemporary Eastern Christian thought and ritual practice by engaging a spectrum of current theological and philosophical conversations.<br>

  Abstract: Inspired by Ricoeur’s well-known aphorism “The symbol gives rise to thought,” this book has engaged the symbolic manifold of the Byzantine Rite, and specifically its Theophany “Great Blessing of Water,” by means of Ricoeur’s own hermeneutical philosophy. It has sought to make a contribution to Orthodox liturgical theology, inspired by the legacy of Schmemann, through whom I first discovered the power of a Weltanschauung grounded in the worship of the Church. While respecting Schmemann, I have sought to go “beyond” him by questioning, at various removes, what it means to “seek in the liturgy the vision implied in its own<br>

  Book Title: Fundamental Theology-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Mansini Guy<br>
  Abstract: Fundamental Theologyexamines the light by which the mysteries of Christ and the Church, the Trinity and the Sacraments, are revealed to us. That light we call "revelation," and fundamental theology examines in the first place what this light shows about itself, and how it is sustained in the world. Or again, fundamental theology considers what the word of God has to say both about itself and what it has to say about where in the world it is to be heard. So, first it is a theology of Revelation (chapter 1), and second, a theology of the transmission of Revelation in Tradition, Scripture, and the Church (chapters 2, 3, and 4). Why must Revelation have the shape it does, and why must it be constituted by both word and event? Why is Tradition prior to Scripture, why must the word of God be written down, and why must Scripture come to us in two testaments? And why must the message conveyed in Tradition and Scripture have a living interpreter in the Church?Since no word is spoken unless it is heard, fundamental theology also investigates the conditions of hearing the word of God, the very hearing itself in the assent of faith, and a necessary consequence of this hearing. The remote conditions of hearing are also what theology calls our ability to come to the knowledge of thepreambula fidei- the things about God than can be known by the natural light (chapter 5). The immediate condition of hearing is the credibility of the word (chapter 6). Hearing is faith (chapter 7). And true hearing gives the hearer to recapitulate what is heard in his own wondering and thankful voice in theology (chapter 8). The introduction to theology in the last chapter is by way of considering the history of Catholic theology in the 20th century.<br>

  Book Title: Reasoning from Faith-Fundamental Theology in Merold Westphal’s Philosophy of Religion<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): SANDS JUSTIN<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal is considered to be one of the preeminent Continental philosophers of religion. His articulation of faith as the task of a lifetime has become a touchstone in contemporary debates concerning faith's relationship to reason. As Justin Sands explores his philosophy, he illuminates how Westphal's concept of faith reveals the pastoral, theological intent behind his thinking. Sands sees Westphal's philosophy as a powerful articulation of Protestant theology, but one that is in ecumenical dialogue with questions concerning apologetics and faith's relationship to ethics and responsibility, a more Catholic point of view. By bringing out these features in Westphal's philosophy, Sands intends to find core philosophical methodologies as well as a passable bridge for philosophers to cross over into theological discourses.<br>

  Book Title: In Praise of Heteronomy-Making Room for Revelation<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the essential heteronomy of postmodern philosophy of religion, Merold Westphal argues against the assumption that human reason is universal, neutral, and devoid of presupposition. Instead, Westphal contends that any philosophy is a matter of faith and the philosophical encounter with theology arises from the very act of thinking. Relying on the work of Spinoza, Kant, and Hegel, Westphal discovers that their theologies render them mutually incompatible and their claims to be the voice of autonomous and universal reason look dubious. Westphal grapples with this plural nature of human thought in the philosophy of religion and he forwards the idea that any appeal to the divine must rest on a historical and phenomenological analysis.<br>

Though these interests do not distinguish him from many of his philosophical peers who were also looking to Hegel to make Marxism more philosophically sophisticated or were trying to reconcile Marxism with progressive theology, the scope of his critique of postwar Internationalism is startlingly original.<br>

  Abstract: The Protestant Reformation restructured the medieval church in ways that had the potential radically to transform Christian understandings of sexuality and gender roles. Since the days of the early church Fathers, theologians had argued that chastity was spiritually superior to marriage. Church vocations such as the priesthood or the various monastic callings were predicated upon celibacy. Moreover, the Fathers—and the medieval theologians who succeeded them—frequently argued that God created woman to enable humanity to procreate. Medieval theology valued celibacy above marriage and contrasted woman’s procreative power with man’s presumed lofty spiritual temperament. It is not hard to understand,<br>

And the delicate relationship between thought and existence, between concept and reality, carries within it the ongoing puzzle about how our (very human) reflections and theoretical constructions could possibly lead us to conclusions about what the world is really like, beyond all appearances.<br>

I have argued that Heidegger’s appropriation of a Lutheran paradigm for the Destruktion of the history of ontology is not theologically neutral; on the contrary, it is theologically motivated.

  Book Title: Aquinas, Feminism, and the Common Good-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): DeCrane Susanne M.<br>
  Abstract: To dismiss the work of philosophers and theologians of the past because of their limited perceptions of the whole of humankind is tantamount to tossing the tot out with the tub water. Such is the case when feminist scholars of religion and ethics confront Thomas Aquinas, whose views of women can only be described as misogynistic. Rather than dispense with him, Susanne DeCrane seeks to engage Aquinas and reflect his otherwise compelling thought through the prism of feminist theology, hermeneutics, and ethics. Focusing on one of Aquinas's great intellectual contributions, the fundamental notion of "the common good"-in short, the human will toward peace and justice-DeCrane demonstrates the currency of that notion through a contemporary social issue: women's health care in the United States and, specifically, black women and breast cancer. In her skillful re-engagement with Aquinas, DeCrane shows that certain aspects of religious traditions heretofore understood as oppressive to women and minority groups can actually be parsed, "retrieved," and used to rectify social ills.
      Aquinas, Feminism, and the Common Goodis a bold and intellectually rigorous feminist retrieval of an important text by a Catholic scholar seeking to remain in the tradition, while demanding that the tradition live up to its emphasis on human equity and justice.<br>

  Abstract: Hermeneutical theology is a distinct approach to theology. Hermeneutics itself is the science of interpretation.¹ Since Christianity is a textually based religion shaped by and oriented around a particular set of symbols, Christian theology needs to reinterpret its significant doctrines, texts,² and symbols for each new generation and within each new culture in which it emerges. Such interpretation is necessary for several reasons: on anthropological grounds, in light of the principle of analogy, because of the nature of foundational documents themselves, and, finally, in light of the hermeneutics of suspicion.³<br>

Each essay in the first six chapters describes how its author has assembled a unique whole from within his or her particular area of academic competence. The last six chapters are more autobiographical, with each author describing what has become central to his or her identity.

  Book Title: Theology and the Boundary Discourse of Human Rights-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): REGAN ETHNA<br>
  Abstract: What are human rights? Can theology acknowledge human rights discourse? Is theological engagement with human rights justified? What place should this discourse occupy within ethics? Ethna Regan seeks to answer these questions about human rights, Christian theology, and philosophical ethics. The main purpose of this book is to justify and explore theological engagement with human rights. Regan illustrates how that engagement is both ecumenical and diverse, citing the emerging engagement with human rights discourse by evangelical theologians in response to the War on Terror. The book examines where the themes and concerns of key modern theologians-Karl Rahner, J. B. Metz, Jon Sobrino, and Ignacio Ellacuría-converge with the themes and concerns of those committed to the advancement of human rights. Regan also critically engages with the "disdain" for rights discourse that is found in the postliberal critiques of John Milbank and Stanley Hauerwas. This interdisciplinary volume will be of interest to students and scholars in the fields of systematic theology, theological ethics, human rights, religion and politics, and political theory.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt5jm">Theology and the Boundary Discourse of Human Rights</a><br>
  Abstract: This book has explored the engagement between theology and the discourse of human rights, a dialectical boundary discourse of human flourishing, positioned in ethics as “protective marginality.” As a dialectical language, human rights holds in tension the universal and the particular, the individual and the community, the religious and the secular, theory and practice. It draws attention to suffering and sets conditions and guidelines for the exercise of responsibility in response to the awareness of suffering.<br>

  Author(s) Curran Charles E.<br>
  Abstract: Throughout this book we have argued that Catholic sexual morality is institutionalized within the confines of marriage and procreation, and we have examined the foundations of two principles that articulate the essence of that Catholic morality. The first principle states that “any human genital act whatsoever may be placed only within the confines of marriage”;¹ the second states that “each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life.”² In contemporary Catholic moral theology, two approaches to understanding these principles demarcate two schools of Catholic moral theology. First, the classicist approach holds the principles as universal, permanent,<br>

  Book Title: Passage to Modernity-An Essay on the Hermeneutics of Nature and Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dupré Louis<br>
  Abstract: Did modernity begin with the Renaissance and end with post-modernity? In this book a distinguished scholar challenges both these assumptions. Louis Dupré discusses the roots, development, and impact of modern thought, tracing the fundamental principles of modernity to the late fourteenth century and affirming that modernity is still an influential force in contemporary culture.The combination of late medieval theology and early Italian humanism shattered the traditional synthesis that had united cosmic, human, and transcendent components in a comprehensive idea of nature. Early Italian humanism transformed the traditional worldview by its unprecedented emphasis on human creativity. The person emerged as the sole source of meaning while nature was reduced to an object and transcendence withdrew into a "supernatural" realm. Dupré analyzes this fragmentation as well as the writings of those who reacted against it-philosophers like Cusanus and Bruno, humanists like Ficino and Erasmus, theologians like Baius and Jansenius, mystics like Ignatius Loyola and Francis de Sales, and theosophists like Weigel and Boehme.Baroque culture briefly reunited the human, cosmic, and transcendent components, but since that time the disintegrating forces have increased in strength. Despite post-modern criticism, the principles of early modernity continue to dominate the climate of our time.
      Passage to Modernityis not so much a critique as a search for the philosophical meaning of the epochal change achieved by those principles.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I will review three major attempts to overcome the theological dualism modern culture inherited from late medieval thought, namely, those of humanist religion, the early Reformation, and Jansenist theology. According to such Christian humanists as Valla, Erasmus, and Ficino, a universal divine attraction sanctifies the natural order and draws it back to its source. Archaic religion, ancient philosophy, Hebrew and Christian revelation—in an order of increasing intensity—all responded to the same divine impulse. Generally speaking, humanism offered more an alternative than an answer to the questions raised by fifteenth-century School theology. Humanists, even when acquainted<br>

  Book Title: Rhetorical Invention and Religious Inquiry-New Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): OLMSTED WENDY<br>
  Abstract: This exceptional collection of writings offers for the first time a discussion among leading thinkers about the points at which rhetoric and religion illuminate and challenge each other. The contributors to the volume are eminent theorists and critics in rhetoric, theology, and religion, and they address a variety of problems and periods.Together these writings shed light on religion as a human quest and rhetoric as the origin and sustainer of that quest. They show that when pursued with intelligence and sensitivity, rhetorical approaches to religion are capable of revitalizing both language and experience. Rhetorical figures, for example, constitute forms of language that say what cannot be said in any other way, and that move individuals toward religious truths that cannot be known in any other way. When firmly placed within religious, social, and literary history, the convergence of rhetoric and religion brings into focus crucial issues in several fields-including philosophy, psychology, history, and art-and interprets relations among self, language, and world that are central to both past and present cultures.<br>

  Abstract: The revitalization of rhetoric as an integral dimension of religious discourse has paralleled the rediscovery of the role of rhetoric in the social and natural sciences.¹ In Christian theology, discussions about rhetoric never quite ceased, owing to the practice of preaching and theories of homiletics. Current concerns in theology, however, focus on rhetoric in a different fashion. Attention to “what is communicated, how it is communicated, what happens when it is communicated, how to communicate it better,” how to understand the variables that create audiences, and how to assess the truth of communication have become crucial issues in the human<br>

  Book Title: Types of Christian Theology-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Placher William C.<br>
  Abstract: In the book Frei proposes classifying theologians according to whether they see Christian theology primarily as an academic discipline or as an internal activity of Christian communities. He describes fie different variations of these views. the first, represented by Immanuel Kant and Gordon represented, regards theology as a philosophical discipline within the academy. The second, represented by theologians as diverse as represented represented, David Tracy, and Carl Henry, correlates specifically Christian with general cultural structures of meaning. The third type, represetned by represented represented and Paul represented, occupies the middle of the spectrum. The fourth type, represetned by Karl Barth, emphasizes the internal descriptive task of theology but remains open to ad hoc correlations with concerns of the wider culture. the fifth, which includes D. Z. Phillips and other Wittgensteinian fideists, opts for pure self-description though this group defends its position with philosophical arguments that, oddly enough connect it with the other end of the spectrum. Frei argues in favor of the third and fourth options. In his view, theologians like Schleiermacher and, even more, Barth, although often seen as polar opposites, enable theology to remain most faithful to the priority of the ecumenically attested literal sense in biblical interpretation.<br>

  Abstract: Schleiermacher is a controversial case because many writers have consigned him to the second type; Professor Brian Gerrish of Chicago tends in that direction. But Professor Stephen Sykes tends to agree with me. The point here is that Schleiermacher identifies theology in two ways: as a practical discipline whose unity lies in its aim, the training of people in the conceptual skills necessary for ministry in the community defined by specific Christian life and language use; and as a historical and philosophical inquiry into the “essence” of Christianity, that is, as an academic discipline grounded in a unitary theory of<br>

  Author(s): Stanley Christopher D.<br>
  Abstract: This book, which grew out of the Society of Biblical Literature’s Paul and Scripture Seminar, explores some of the methodological problems that have arisen during the last few decades of scholarly research on the apostle Paul’s engagement with his ancestral Scriptures. Essays explore the historical backgrounds of Paul’s interpretive practices, the question of Paul’s “faithfulness" to the context of his biblical references, the presence of Scripture in letters other than the Hauptbriefe, and the role of Scripture in Paul’s theology. All of the essays look at old questions through new lenses in an effort to break through scholarly impasses and advance the debate in new directions. The contributors are Matthew W. Bates, Linda L. Belleville, Roy E. Ciampa, Bruce N. Fisk, Stephen E. Fowl, Leonard Greenspoon, E. Elizabeth Johnson, Mitchell M. Kim, Steve Moyise, Jeremy Punt, Christopher D. Stanley, and Jerry L. Sumney.<br>

  Book Title: Moral Evil-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Flescher Andrew Michael<br>
  Abstract: The idea of moral evil has always held a special place in philosophy and theology because the existence of evil has implications for the dignity of the human and the limits of human action. Andrew M. Flescher proposes four interpretations of evil, drawing on philosophical and theological sources and using them to trace through history the moral traditions that are associated with them.The first model, evil as the presence of badness, offers a traditional dualistic model represented by Manicheanism. The second, evil leading to goodness through suffering, presents a theological interpretation known as theodicy. Absence of badness-that is, evil as a social construction-is the third model. The fourth, evil as the absence of goodness, describes when evil exists in lieu of the good-the "privation" thesis staked out nearly two millennia ago by Christian theologian St. Augustine. Flescher extends this fourth model-evil as privation-into a fifth, which incorporates a virtue ethic. Drawing original connections between Augustine and Aristotle, Flescher's fifth model emphasizes the formation of altruistic habits that can lead us to better moral choices throughout our lives.Flescher eschews the temptation to think of human agents who commit evil as outside the norm of human experience. Instead, through the honing of moral skills and the practice of attending to the needs of others to a greater degree than we currently do, Flescher offers a plausible and hopeful approach to the reality of moral evil.<br>

         Confessions,Parsons places a "mystical theology" at the heart of Augustine's narrative and argues that his mysticism has been misunderstood partly because of the limited nature of the psychological models applied to it. At the same time, he expands Freud's therapeutic legacy to incorporate the contemporary findings of physiology and neuroscience that have been influenced in part by modern spirituality.<br>

  Abstract: With a more informed view of Augustine’s teaching on the nature and conditions of mystical vision at hand, we are in a better position to return to psychoanalytic thought in an attempt to find common ground for dialogue. Lest the project be misunderstood, the aim is not to expand psychoanalytic thought to fully tally with Augustine’s mystical theology. Such a pursuit clearly lies beyond the limits and self-identity of psychoanalytic theory. Rather, the aim is to open up new lines of argument, based on texts and teachings, where the two introspective traditions might have more to talk about than has<br>

  Abstract: Christians began to think systematically about the ethics of land, territory, and boundaries within a specific set of historical circumstances. European claims to dominion in the New World during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries generated a new range of questions in moral theology for Catholics and Protestants alike, theology developed most notably by Cajetan, Vitoria, Soto, Suarez, Molina, Las Casas, Gentili, and Grotius. Yet these authors did not generate normative principles for addressing questions of dominion and boundaries

  Abstract: In his essay “On Love,” Adam Phillips observes that since the language of love borrows its referents from the discourses of theology and epistemology, it is at once relentlessly redemptive and insistently enlightening (40). The lover, like the mystic or the paranoiac, is a reader of signs and wonders: all are terrorized and bewitched by an experience that, in the absence of a transcendental signifier, displaces our contemporary version of the sublime. If this comparison is to provide a useful analogy, then it is possible to concede that we have, in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, enshrined literature<br>

  Book Title: Diasporic Feminist Theology-Asia and Theopolitical Imagination<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Kang Namsoon<br>
  Abstract: How do we navigate the question of identity in the fluid and pluralist conditions of postmodern society? Even more, how do we articulate identity as a defining particularity in the disappearance of borders, boundaries, and spaces in an increasingly globalist world? What constitutes identity and the formation of narratives under such conditions? How do these issues affect not only discursive practices, but theological and ethical construction and practice? This volumes explores these issues in depth. Diasporic Feminist Theology attempts to construct feminist theology by adopting diaspora as a theopolitical and ethical metaphor. Namsoon Kang here revisits and reexamines today’s significant issues such as identity politics, dislocation, postmodernism, postcolonialism, neoempire, Asian values, and constructs diasporic, transethnic, and glocal feminist theological discourses that create spaces of transformation, reconciliation, hospitality, worldliness, solidarity, and border-traversing. This work draws on diverse sources from contemporary critical discourses of diaspora studies, cultural studies, ethnic studies, postmodernism, postcolonialism, and feminism and feminist theology from a transterritorial space. This book is a landmark work, providing a comprehensive discourse for feminist theology today.<br>

  Book Title: The Sense of the Universe-Philosophical Explication of Theological Commitment in Modern Cosmology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Nesteruk Alexei V.<br>
  Abstract: The Sense of the Universe deals with existential and phenomenological reflection upon modern cosmology with the aim to reveal hidden theological commitments in cosmology related to the mystery of human existence. The book proposes a new approach to the dialogue between science and theology based in a thorough philosophical analysis of acting forms of subjectivity involved in the study of the world and in religious experience. The uniqueness of this book is that it uses recent advances in phenomenological philosophy and philosophical theology in order to accentuate the existential meaning of cosmology as the discourse that ultimately explicates the human condition. The objective of the book is not to make a comparative analysis of the cosmological scientific narrative and that of the Bible, or the Fathers of the Church (in what concerns the structure of the universe), but to reveal the presence of a hidden theological dimension in cosmology originating in the God-given ability of humanity to discern and disclose the sense of creation. The book contributes to the synthesis of appropriation and incorporation of modern philosophical ideas in Christian theology, in particular its Eastern Orthodox form.<br>

Correspondingly, it was argued that theology and cosmology are intertwined in the sense that each of them functions in the conditions of the implicit influence of the other. Indeed, for theology to be possible at all one needs theologians, that is, embodied human persons. Hence<br>

  Abstract: This volume contends against a major lacuna in the story of eschatology in the twentieth century by offering a historical and comparative analysis of Edward Schillebeeckx’s prophetic eschatology and Johann Baptist Metz’s apocalyptic eschatology with the goal of identifying relative advantages and limitations of these divergent eschatological frameworks for rendering a Christian account of hope that prompts action in the public arena. Rodenborn provides a fresh angle on eschatologies of hope, bringing to the fore two Catholic theologians whose influences range from Vatican II to Latin American liberation theology. Hope in Action offers an innovative contribution to the theological account of the emergence of European political theologies and the role of eschatology as a practical and destabilizing theological category.<br>

  Book Title: Christian Doctrine and the Grammar of Difference-A Contribution to Feminist Systematic Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): McRandal Janice<br>
  Abstract: Christian Doctrine and the Grammar of Difference argues that the most potent and resourceful theological response to the challenging questions of gender and difference is to be found in a retrieval of a doctrinal framework for feminist theology. In particular, it is suggested that a doctrinal narrative of creation, fall, and redemption—underpinned by the doctrinal grammar of the Trinity—provides resources to resolve the theological impasse of difference in contemporary feminist theology. The divine economy reveals a God who enters into history and destabilizes fixed binaries and oppressive categories. The biblical narrative discloses a subtle yet potent fluidity to the Triune relationships. As created subjects—precisely in our difference—we are sustained, affirmed, and drawn back into the Triune life. The subtleties of divine transgression are already recognized in the patterns of the liturgy, in prayer, and in practices of contemplation. Here, bodies not only encounter the transgressive love of God but are enabled to inhabit their differentiated humanity with distinctiveness and grace. The grammar of Christian faith cannot ultimately be uncovered except in prayer, opened beyond itself to a source of life and giving.<br>

  Book Title: Liturgy as Revelation-Re-Sourcing a Theme in Twentieth-Century Catholic Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Caldwell Philip<br>
  Abstract: A critical issue in modern Catholic theology has been the relationship between the doctrine of revelation and the church’s liturgical and sacramental practice. This volume argues that although in the twentieth century Catholic theology increasingly recognized the centrality of Christology—particularly the person of Christ—as the locus of revelation and drew out the crucial implications of Christ as the revelation of God, it was slow to connect this revelatory dynamic with the encounter that occurs within the sacramental space of the liturgy, most notably the Eucharist. Taking the decline of the neoscholastic enterprise in Catholic theology and the challenges posed by modernism as his point of departure, Philip Caldwell traces the evolution of the Catholic theology of revelation in the twentieth century and the vital role played by the liturgical and sacramental renewal movements in reimagining this pivotal theological category. Examining the specific contributions of René Latourelle, Avery Dulles, Salvatore Marsilli, and Gustave Martelet against a background of pre-conciliar ressourcement theology, this volume provides a comprehensive account of why a Trinitarian and Christological construal of liturgy and sacraments as revelation is key to the vision that informed Vatican II and offers constructive theological and ecclesial possibilities for the future.<br>

  Book Title: Postmodernity and Univocity-A Critical Account of Radical Orthodoxy and John Duns Scotus<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Horan Daniel P.<br>
  Abstract: Nearly twenty-five years ago, John Milbank inaugurated Radical Orthodoxy, one of the most significant and influential theological movements of the last two decades. In Milbank’s Theology and Social Theory, he constructed a sweeping theological genealogy of the origins of modernity and the emergence of the secular, counterposed by a robust retrieval of traditional orthodoxy as the critical philosophical and theological mode of being in the postmodern world. That genealogy turns upon a critical point—the work of John Duns Scotus as the starting point of modernity and progenitor of a raft of philosophical and theological ills that have prevailed since. Milbank’s account has been disseminated proliferously through Radical Orthodoxy and even beyond and is largely uncontested in contemporary theology. The present volume conducts a comprehensive examination and critical analysis of Radical Orthodoxy’s use and interpretation of John Duns Scotus. Daniel P. Horan, OFM, offers a substantial challenge to the narrative of Radical Orthodoxy’s idiosyncratic take on Scotus and his role in ushering in the philosophical age of the modern. This volume not only corrects the received account of Scotus but opens a constructive way forward toward a positive assessment and appropriation of Scotus’s work for contemporary theology.<br>

  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Thurén Lauri<br>
  Abstract: For far too long, Lauri Thurén argues, the parables of Jesus have been read either as allegories encoding Christian theology—including the theological message of one or another Gospel writer—or as tantalizing clues to the authentic voice of Jesus. Thurén proposes instead to read the parables “unplugged” from any assumptions beyond those given in the narrative situation in the text, on the common-sense premise that the very form of the parable works to propose a (sometimes startling) resolution to a particular problem. Thurén applies his method to the parables in Luke with some surprising results involving the Evangelist’s overall narrative purposes and the discrete purposes of individual parables in supporting the authority of Jesus, proclaiming God’s love, exhorting steadfastness, and so on. Eschatological and allegorical readings are equally unlikely, according to Thurén’s results. This study is sure to spark learned discussion among scholars, preachers, and students for years to come.<br>

  Book Title: Walking with the Mud Flower Collective-God's Fierce Whimsy and Dialogic Theological Method<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Jost Stina Busman<br>
  Abstract: Arguing for a retrieval of the landmark work, God’s Fierce Whimsy, Stina Busman Jost establishes the critical importance of this volume for the construction of a dialogic theological method. This is accomplished through a close reading of God’s Fierce Whimsy in which the author identifies key methodological characteristics informing the volume’s formation. Critical importance also is established through interviews with the volume’s authors, the Mud Flower Collective—which included Katie G. Cannon, Beverly W. Harrison, Carter Heyward, Ada María Isasi-Díaz, Bess B. Johnson (Delores Williams), Mary D. Pellauer, and Nancy D. Richardson. Undergirding this endeavor is a recognition of the theoretical importance of difference to the project of theological construction and the vital form of the dialogic as constitutive of theological practice; this is carried forward through engagement with the pivotal theorists Martin Buber and Mikhail Bakhtin, who helped pioneer the philosophical and literary critical importance of otherness, difference, and dialogue.

To take this inquiry in another direction, a concomitant question would behow—how should one make an effort to theologize in this dialogic manner, especially in light of difference and compounding systemic injustices?

  Book Title: The World in the Trinity-Open-Ended Systems in Science and Religion<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Bracken Joseph A.<br>
  Abstract: Joseph A. Bracken argues that the failure of theology and science to generate cohesion is the lack of an integrated system of interpretation of the Christian faith that consciously accords with the insights and discoveries of contemporary science. In The World in the Trinity, Bracken utilizes the language and conceptual structures of systems theory as a philosophical and scientific grammar to show traditional Christian beliefs in a new light that is accessible and rationally plausible to a contemporary, scientifically influenced society. This account opens new possibilities for rethinking the God-world relationship, the Trinity, incarnation, creation, and eschatology within the context of a broader ecological and cosmological system. In re-describing these articles constitutive of Christian belief, the author is conscious of the vital importance of retaining the inherent power and meaning of these concepts. This volume freshly retrieves pivotal themes and concepts constitutive of the Christian tradition in a conscious rapprochement with current scientific understandings of nature.<br>

  Book Title: Consider Leviathan-Narratives of Nature and the Self in Job<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Doak Brian R.<br>
  Abstract: Theologians and philosophers are turning again to questions of the meaning, or non-meaning, of the natural world for human self-understanding. Brian R. Doak observes that the book of Job, more than any other book in the Bible, uses metaphors drawn from the natural world, especially of plants and animals, as raw material for thinking about human suffering. Doak argues that Job should be viewed as an anthropological “ground zero” for the traumatic definition of the post-exilic human self in ancient Israel. Furthermore, the battered shape of the Joban experience should provide a starting point for reconfiguring our thinking about “natural theology” as a category of intellectual history in the ancient world. Doak examines how the development of the human subject is portrayed in the biblical text in either radical continuity or discontinuity with plants and animals. Consider Leviathan explores the text at the intersection of anthropology, theology, and ecology, opening up new possibilities for charting the view of nature in the Hebrew Bible.<br>

  Abstract: The last decades of the twentieth century witnessed a “renaissance of rhetoric” (cf. Plett 1994), or “rhetorical turn” (Simons, ed. 1990), that has affected not only literary studies but also law, theology, aesthetics, philosophy, economics, politics, and even the natural sciences. The idea that cultures are rhetorically constituted is, of course, not new, and there have been various earlier attempts to address the subject—for example, Plato, Nietzsche, Burke, Heidegger, Gadamer, and others. But I think that there still is much to gain by rethinking this time-honored topic, and in this paper I will explore the possibility of a more<br>

  Abstract: Hans-Georg Gadamer's poetics completely overturns the European aesthetic tradition. By concentrating on the experience of meaning, Unfinished Worlds shows how Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics transforms aesthetics into a mode of attentive practice. It has deep implications for all of the humanities, and how we can understand the meaning of poetry, art, literature, history and theology. His emphasis on participation promises an approach that will revolutionise aesthetic and hermeneutic practice, and gives us new ways to think about the cultural productivity and social legitimacy of the humanities.<br>

  Book Title: The Science of the Soul in Colonial New England-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): RIVETT SARAH<br>
  Abstract: The Science of the Soulchallenges long-standing notions of Puritan provincialism as antithetical to the Enlightenment. Sarah Rivett demonstrates that, instead, empiricism and natural philosophy combined with Puritanism to transform the scope of religious activity in colonial New England from the 1630s to the Great Awakening of the 1740s.In an unprecedented move, Puritan ministers from Thomas Shepard and John Eliot to Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards studied the human soul using the same systematic methods that philosophers applied to the study of nature. In particular, they considered the testimonies of tortured adolescent girls at the center of the Salem witch trials, Native American converts, and dying women as a source of material insight into the divine. Conversions and deathbed speeches were thus scrutinized for evidence of grace in a way that bridged the material and the spiritual, the visible and the invisible, the worldly and the divine.In this way, the "science of the soul" was as much a part of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century natural philosophy as it was part of post-Reformation theology. Rivett's account restores the unity of religion and science in the early modern world and highlights the role and importance of both to transatlantic circuits of knowledge formation.<br>

  Author(s): Shaikh Saʿdiyya<br>
  Abstract: Thirteenth-century Sufi poet, mystic, and legal scholar Muhyi al-Din ibn al-'Arabi gave deep and sustained attention to gender as integral to questions of human existence and moral personhood. Reading his works through a critical feminist lens, Sa'diyya Shaikh opens fertile spaces in which new and creative encounters with gender justice in Islam can take place. Grounding her work in Islamic epistemology, Shaikh attends to the ways in which Sufi metaphysics and theology might allow for fundamental shifts in Islamic gender ethics and legal formulations, addressing wide-ranging contemporary challenges including questions of women's rights in marriage and divorce, the politics of veiling, and women's leadership of ritual prayer.Shaikh deftly deconstructs traditional binaries between the spiritual and the political, private conceptions of spiritual development and public notions of social justice, and the realms of inner refinement and those of communal virtue. Drawing on the treasured works of Sufism, Shaikh raises a number of critical questions about the nature of selfhood, subjectivity, spirituality, and society to contribute richly to the prospects of Islamic feminism as well as feminist ethics more broadly.<br>

  Book Title: Race and the Making of the Mormon People-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): MUELLER MAX PERRY<br>
  Abstract: The nineteenth-century history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Max Perry Mueller argues, illuminates the role that religion played in forming the notion of three "original" American races-red, black, and white-for Mormons and others in the early American Republic. Recovering the voices of a handful of black and Native American Mormons who resolutely wrote themselves into the Mormon archive, Mueller threads together historical experience and Mormon scriptural interpretations. He finds that the Book of Mormon is key to understanding how early followers reflected but also departed from antebellum conceptions of race as biblically and biologically predetermined. Mormon theology and policy both challenged and reaffirmed the essentialist nature of the racialized American experience.The Book of Mormon presented its believers with a radical worldview, proclaiming that all schisms within the human family were anathematic to God's design. That said, church founders were not racial egalitarians. They promoted whiteness as an aspirational racial identity that nonwhites could achieve through conversion to Mormonism. Mueller also shows how, on a broader level, scripture and history may become mutually constituted. For the Mormons, that process shaped a religious movement in perpetual tension between its racialist and universalist impulses during an era before the concept of race was secularized.<br>

  Book Title: Broken Tablets-Levinas, Derrida, and the Literary Afterlife of Religion<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): HAMMERSCHLAG SARAH<br>
  Abstract: Over a span of thirty years, twentieth-century French philosophers Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida held a conversation across texts. Sharing a Jewish heritage and a background in phenomenology, both came to situate their work at the margins of philosophy, articulating this placement through religion and literature. Chronicling the interactions between these thinkers, Sarah Hammerschlag argues that the stakes in their respective positions were more than philosophical. They were also political. Levinas's investments were born out in his writings on Judaism and ultimately in an evolving conviction that the young state of Israel held the best possibility for achieving such an ideal. For Derrida, the Jewish question was literary. The stakes of Jewish survival could only be approached through reflections on modern literature's religious legacy, a line of thinking that provided him the means to reconceive democracy. Hammerschlag's reexamination of Derrida and Levinas's textual exchange not only produces a new account of this friendship but also has significant ramifications for debates within Continental philosophy, the study of religion, and political theology.<br>

  Book Title: Religion and the Specter of the West-Sikhism, India, Postcoloniality, and the Politics of Translation<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mandair Arvind-Pal S.<br>
  Abstract: Arguing that intellectual movements, such as deconstruction, postsecular theory, and political theology, have different implications for cultures and societies that live with the debilitating effects of past imperialisms, Arvind Mandair unsettles the politics of knowledge construction in which the category of "religion" continues to be central. Through a case study of Sikhism, he launches an extended critique of religion as a cultural universal. At the same time, he presents a portrait of how certain aspects of Sikh tradition were reinvented as "religion" during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I continue to trace the movement of cultural translation designated by the term “Sikh theology” into the humanities program of the modern Western university, specifically the discourse of the history of religions. To do this it is necessary to determine how the subject of Sikhism, or the Sikh subject, came to be determined as a distinctly “religious” subject. I argue that a certain understanding of violence, or, rather, a set of unexamined assumptions about the relationship between religion and violence, is necessary for the construction and deployment of this subject as “religious” in the modern academic study<br>

He compares a specific Western text and religion to a specific Chinese text and religion. He considers the Divina Commedia in the context of Catholic theology alongside The Journey to the West as it relates to Chinese syncretism, united by the theme of pilgrimage. Yet Yu's focus isn't entirely tied to the classics. He also considers the struggle for human rights in China and how this topic relates to ancient Chinese social thought and modern notions of rights in the West.<br>

  Book Title: A Companion to the Works of Johann Gottfried Herder-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Koepke Wulf<br>
  Abstract: Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) is one of the great names of the classical age of German literature. One of the last universalists, he wrote on aesthetics, literary history and theory, historiography, anthropology, psychology, education, and theology; translated and adapted poetry from ancient Greek, English, Italian, even from Persian and Arabic; collected folk songs from around the world; and pioneered a better understanding of non-European cultures. A student of Kant's, he became Goethe's mentor in Strasbourg, and was a mastermind of the Sturm und Drang and a luminary of classical Weimar. But the wide range of Herder's interests and writings, along with his unorthodox ways of seeing things, seems to have prevented him being fully appreciated for any of them. His image has also been clouded by association with political ideologies, the proponents of which ignored the message of Humanität in his texts. So although Herder is acknowledged by scholars to be one of the great thinkers of European Enlightenment, there is no up-to-date, comprehensive introduction to his works in English, a lacuna this book fills with seventeen new, specially commissioned essays.

  Abstract: Herder’s views on political topics such as liberty and tyranny, sovereignty, the constitutions of states, statecraft, and international relations were largely theoretical, the product of wide-ranging studies in history, theology, philosophy, and the emerging discipline of comparative anthropology. Due to his vocation as a theologian and Protestant clergyman, Herder was virtually precluded from holding political office or commenting frankly on public affairs, except as mediated by the established church. Thus he stands in contrast to Goethe, whose training as a lawyer and long years of service managing the affairs of the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach gave him practical insight into the<br>

  Book Title: A Companion to Julian of Norwich-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): McAvoy Liz Herbert<br>
  Abstract: Julian of Norwich, the fourteenth/early fifteenth-century anchoress and mystic, is one of the most important and best-known figures of the Middle Ages. Her Revelations, intense visions of the divine, have been widely studied and read; the first known writings of an English woman, their influence extends over theology and literature. However, many aspects of both her life and thought remain enigmatic. This exciting new collection offers a comprehensive, accessible coverage of the key aspects of debate surrounding Julian. It places the author within a wide range of contemporary literary, social, historical and religious contexts, and also provides a wealth of new insights into manuscript traditions, perspectives on her writing and ways of interpreting it, building on the work of many of the most active and influential researchers within Julian studies, and including the fruits of the most recent, ground-breaking findings. It will therefore be a vital companion for all of Julian's readers in the twenty-first century.

  Abstract: Devotion to the Trinity was growing in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries: ‘In 1334 Pope John XXII set aside the first Sunday after Pentecost as Trinity Sunday. Increasing devotion to the Trinity can also be seen in the many prayers addressed to the Trinity’.¹ Theology, however, did not necessarily keep pace. In his study of the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, Thomas Marsh has claimed: ‘In spite of the formal, notional acknowledgement of the doctrine, a real understanding of God as Trinity practically disappeared from the Christian consciousness of the Middle Ages’.² This sweeping condemnation, however, ignores the notable contribution<br>

Yet, within this varied environment, there are observable consistencies. This chapter focuses on the closely related themes of marriage and sexuality within the Faust book and the<br>

Its interdisciplinary approach, drawing on sociology, social anthropology, theology, political theory, Balkan historiography, and Serbian folklore, is deployed to provide a powerful and original analysis of how Serbian Orthodoxy has resulted in the sacralisation of the Serbian nation by framing the parameters of its existence. Addresses the following questions: what 'makes' a Serb? Are meaningful assumptions possible by introducing Serbian Orthodoxy as the primal point of reference? Why does religion appear to have an especially strong appeal?<br>

  Book Title: Given World and Time-Temporalities in Context<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Tyrus<br>
  Abstract: The interconnections of time with historical thought and knowledge have come powerfully to the fore since the 1970s. An international group of scholars, from a range of fields including literary theory, history of ideas, cultural anthropology, philosophy, intellectual history and theology, philology, and musicology, address the matter of time and temporalities. The volume’s essays, divided into four main topical groups question critically the key problem of context, connecting it to the problem of time. Contexts, the essays suggest, are not timeless. Time and its contexts are only partly “given” to us: to the primordial donations of time and world correspond our epistemic, moral, and practical modes of receiving what has been granted. The notion of context may have radically different parameters in different historical, cultural, and disciplinary situations. Topics include the deep antiquity, and the timeless time of eternity, as well as formal philosophies of history and the forms of histories implicit in individual and community experience. The medium specific use of time and history are examined with regard to song, image, film, oral narration, and legal discourse.<br>

Abstract: In the seventeenth and eighteenth century, at a time when the idea of eternal punishment loses ground in dogmatic theology, divines insist on keeping it as a tool for the maintenance of moral and social order. See Daniel Pickering Walker,

As Bunyan warned, “he that denyeth the Resurrection of the dead, he setteth open a Floud‐gate to all manner of impiety, he cutteth the throat of a truly holy life, and layeth the Reins upon the neck of the most outragious lusts” (Bunyan,The Resurrection of the Dead,p. 214).<br>

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: Defamiliarization presupposes a severing of the automatic conjunction between the awareness of religious difference and a defensive stance toward the religious other. The demythologization of apologetics that results from the new pluralism at the same time represents the condition for the possibility of the means, namely, defamiliarization, for countering its ill effects. Thanks to its ability to dissociate a concern for religious identity from a defensive attitude toward the religious other, comparative theology is able to modulate between definition, which establishes a sense of communal identity, and defamiliarization, which restores to a tradition the theological ambiance—the reflective space opened up with the relaxation of polemical pressure—needed for its depth and vitality.<br>

Abstract: While sharing the aim of relating philosophy and theology, I do not think the project is best accomplished by thinking ontotheologically (at least, not in its Heideggerian sense). What is needed is to insist on a sharper distinction between ontotheological philosophy and religious theology so that we can better understand how they might relate. And here again, I agree with Robbins for different reasons: Ricoeur, Lévinas, and Marion are key sources in this project, for their work maintains the distinction that it calls into question.<br>

Abstract: Mandry offers a relatively concise and convincing reading of Ricoeur on the ethical self and its relation to ethical aims for the good life and the moral demand for justice. Mandry’s concern is to clarify what is meant by “ethical identity” and how this idea might aid theological ethics. The principle contribution is to show the place of religious conviction (
      Überzeugung) in relation to ethical aims, moral duties, and practical reasoning. Mandry’s contention is that philosophy and theology offer different perspectives on the ethical subject which can fruitfully engage each other. The question then becomes, of course, whether or not the question that provoked the discussion in the first case has simply been pushed back one further step in reflection. What provides the warrant for multiple perspectives on the ethical subject? Is it a philosophical warrant or a theological one?<br>

Author(s): Lee Hyo‐Dong<br>
Abstract: One can find such a coalescence of subaltern religious representations and creation of a politically solidary narrative via intentional hybridization in the works of the Korean
            minjungpoet Kim Chi Ha (1941– ). Kim’s poetry weaves Catholic liberation theology with the antifeudal and anticolonial social vision of the Tonghak religion, which rose as an indigenous religious movement of peasants for democratic revolution in Korea at the turn of the nineteenth century and played a prominent role in the 3.1 Independence Movement of 1919. The Tonghak religion itself was the product of a coalescence of elements of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and indigenous beliefs in the subaltern religious and social imagination of the Korean peasantry. In the unfinished talk poem (ballad)The World of Chang Il Tam, one of the works for which he was imprisoned, tortured, and sentenced to life imprisonment by the dictatorial South Korean regime of Park Chung Hee in 1976, Kim merges the symbols of the Eucharist—the mystical body of the deity that is eaten—with the Tonghak teaching of “human being is heaven [in nae chʾǒn]”: “Food is heaven / As we eat / God enters us / Food is heaven. / Oh, food / Should be shared and eaten by all.” See Kim Chi Ha,The Gold‐Crowned Jesus and Other Writings, ed. Chong Sun Kim and Shelly Killen (Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1978), 13–39. See also hisSaengmyǒng(Seoul: Sol, 1992), 132–49. Kim’s religiously hybrid poetic vision has been one of the mainsprings of inspiration for South Korea’sminjungtheology.

Abstract: Ibid., bk. 14, 16.22, 1053. In book 1 of the
            Institutions, Calvin openly rejects Augustine’s idea that the soul is a mirror of the Trinity, although he frequently uses the metaphor of the mirror in reference to Christ and the scriptures. I have consulted the following edition: Jean Calvin,Institution de la religion chretienne, ed. Jean‐Daniel Benoit, 5 vols. (Paris: Vrin, 1957), vol. 1, bk. 1, chap. 15, 213. On the image of “mirror,” seeInstitution de la religion chretienne, vol. 3, chap. 2, 14. Calvin writes that Christ is the mirror of God’s glory. Later (Institution, vol. 3, chap. 25, 476), Calvin stresses that, every time we speak of the resurrection, we must consider the image of Christ. We carry his mortification in our flesh (sa mortification en notre chair). As far the scriptures as mirror are concerned, seeInstitution, vol. 3, chap. 22, 422. Calvin uses the term “mirror” (miroir) also to elucidate the thorny issue of free election (Institution, vol. 3, chap. 22, 418). On this subject, see the introductory analysis in John Hesselink, “Calvin’s Theology,” inThe Cambridge Companion to John Calvin, ed. Donald K. McKim (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 74–92.<br>

Abstract: As Bill Moyers (
            2005) elucidated, “Theology asserts propositions that need not be proven true, while ideologues hold stoutly to a worldview despite being contradicted by what is generally accepted as reality. The combination can make it impossible for a democracy to fashion real‐world solutions to otherwise intractable challenges.”<br>

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Author(s): Wall,  John<br>
Abstract: Finally, in
      Moral CreativityWall carries out a dialogue with a wide variety of contemporary philosophical and theological voices, including narrative theology, recent Aristotelianisms, feminism, liberation theology, communicative ethics, and others. Often, the intent is to show how the voice captures only one side of the tension between freedom and finitude. Ricoeur, with his passive/active model of selfhood, is presented as the corrective to such one‐sided accounts. In fact, one of the great virtues of the book is the fact that it makes Ricoeur’s voluminous writings available to the debates of contemporary ethics in an accessible way. Wall’s original reflections on contemporary ethical thought are clear‐eyed as well, particularly some of his comments on the status of evil in narrative theology.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Making room for a more poetic function at work between this reading‐and‐writing prophet and his confirming God allows that “truth,” as Ricoeur has said, “no longer means verification, but manifestation. … What shows itself is in each instance a proposed world, a world I may inhabit and wherein I can project my own most possibilities.”
         98This is the power to which Bloom credited Mormonism’s survival: not Smith’s history making but his “myth‐making imagination at work to sustain so astonishing an innovation.”99It is the power to shape reality, not merely describe it. To the extent that self‐consciousness can be ascribed to him, it is probably why Smith abjured theology for mythmaking. Regardless, scholars who would understand the relative longevity and appeal of his project, especially as it has transcended its American milieu, can ill afford to ignore the capacity of Smith’s narratives to make sense of time.<br>

Author(s): Browning,  Don S.<br>
Abstract: While this book will be of great interest to Christian ethicists as well as to religious and moral educators, it should also be read by social scientists, philosophers, and evolutionary psychologists. Browning’s view that nontheological disciplines depend on images of the human that play a guiding role for their research, as well as for the interpretation of their results, points to the continued need for more interdisciplinary work. According to this point of view, theology should play a public role in identifying such prescientific or preempirical images as well as in describing and advancing refined and responsible images based on the Christian tradition. The present volume goes a long way in either direction.<br>

Author(s): Elbourne Elizabeth<br>
Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Reynolds,  Thomas E.<br>
Abstract: Still, the book has significant shortcomings. First, it suffers from a bad case of sprawl. Reynolds attempts to engage the following thinkers at some length: Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Hans‐Georg Gadamer, Jürgen Habermas, Gottfried Herder, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean‐Francois Lyotard, Gabriel Marcel, Paul Ricoeur, Richard Rorty, Friedrich Schleiermacher, Charles Taylor, Paul Tillich, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Dozens more receive passing mention. This, however, is nothing compared to the book’s many arguments. Reynolds forwards vast theses not only in philosophical theology and the theory of religion but also in hermeneutics, epistemology, and ethics. For good measure, we also get a typology of world religions (162) and an interpretation of the Enlightenment (22–41). Sheer breadth, of course, is not necessarily a weakness. It can be an impressive sign of intellectual power and agility. In this case, however, it comes at the expense of nuance. Consequently,
      The Broken Wholesometimes reads more like a term paper for a graduate survey course than a focused monograph.<br>

Article Title: The Place of the Soul in Augustine and Proust: Amorous Memory versus Neuroscience<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 522216<br>
Date: 10 2008<br>
Author(s): Balsamo Gian<br>
Abstract: Whether it manifests itself as purpose, desire, or love, Augustinian attention is a direct expression of the negative or positive thrust of the individual’s quest for his or her optimal self. As a consequence of this consideration, one could say that Augustine promotes a transformative notion of the soul, based on the premise that an individual is not endowed with a permanent soul; more specifically, one could submit that to Augustine an individual’s sense of personal continuity, which derives from the coordinated exercise of memory (
         memoria) of the past, attention (contuitus) to the present, and anticipation (expectatio) of the future (Confessions11.20),20does not punctually correspond with the continuity of an unchangeable soul. Modeled on the trinitarian theology of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, Augustine’s three‐layered rubric of personal continuity is informed, rather, by a principle of perfectibility.21The supreme moral paradigm of the Augustinian soul consists offruendis frui et utendis uti, that is, of purposefully using what is to be used in order to enjoy the fruition of that which is good per se, hence delectable to the soul (se ipsa delectata)—(De Trinitate10.10.13).22The Augustinian soul thereby constantly redefines itself in terms of its more or less virtuousdesiderataand meritorious intentions.<br>

Abstract: Without trying any further to distinguish Bazin from his disciples, or
         Cahiers du cinémafrom other Parisian film groups, or even French film culture from that of other nations, in Florent Kirsch's characterization offilmologiewe can recognize the two nearly irreconcilable attitudes toward cinema and its study that have remained in tension in the academy. A few individuals have managed to bridge this opposition. Bazin should have been one of them, given his ENS education and his evident training in disciplines like geology, geography, entomology, botany, philosophy, rhetoric, theology, and psychology. Yet cinephilia won out in him, or rather films themselves won out as centers of attraction whose existence and value it was the duty and pleasure of the “disciplined” critic to articulate. Other polymaths who could bridge these approaches were Jean Mitry and Edgar Morin, both of whom were more closely allied to university life while always having been avid filmgoers, indeed occasional filmmakers. Mitry had assisted Abel Gance and had run ciné‐clubs in the 1920s and 1930s. He is listed as one of the founders of the Cinémathèque Française in 1935. After the war he taught at the brand new state‐sponsored film school, Institut des hautes études cinématographiques (IDHEC), largely because he had modest experience in production as an editor and assistant director. Later he would manage to teach classes in a university setting. Most tellingly, his massive publications (the two‐volumeEsthétique et psychologie du cinémaand the five‐volumeHistoire du cinéma) were published in the 1960s by Presses Univérsitaires de Paris, just as Cohen‐Séat's book had been. Mitry felt himself a legitimate rival offilmologie, and superior for having lived an entire life in the midst of the medium.24The tables of contents to his theoretical volumes presume the comprehensive and progressive exploration of a genuine discipline, as does the immense bibliography that draws on every sort of scie~<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: Franke’s book has considerable merit, but I have a theoretical and a practical concern with his appropriation of negative theology. First, negative theology is never entirely negative, and while Franke recognizes that poetic language is both deconstructive and open, he nevertheless insists that our various theologies—literary or religious—finally have no positive content. Perhaps this is the postmodernism in his negative theology because this is not entirely consistent with the theological tradition. A good counterexample is Pseudo‐Dionysius, whose mystical theology seeks finally to overcome the limitations of both positive and negative speaking. Dionysius insists that God is love in a way that is both negative and positive. On this, Franke should consider the work of Jean‐Luc Marion and especially his response to Jacques Derrida on the subject of negative theology, and this omission is a considerable oversight. Second, many people of various faiths will never accept that their understanding of the transcendent has no positive content, and if this is a precondition for dialogue, then it is unlikely to occur. On this, the practical dimension of Franke’s study needs more development, as well as more traditional examples of poetic and theological openness from contemporary religious life.<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: D'Holbach's caveat is essential for understanding the implications of his system for the relationship between person and nature, but also between the transcendent and the immanent. If nature is meant to assume the role once assigned to the divine in Christian theology, it does so in an entirely different manner—not as an all-knowing, all-powerful subject, but as a blind and will-less force. At the same time, the human person is both identified with and in large part reduced to an effect of this force. D'Holbach's abandonment of transcendence in his materialist system thus drastically altered the relationship between God and soul as it was understood in orthodox religion. What had been an exchange between two distinct, albeit unequal persons, was reduced to an arrangement between two objects. The meaning of immanence likewise changed. Once mainline Christian theology began to assert the self's inward transcendence vis-à-vis the world as “masters and possessors of nature” (to cite Descartes), atheist philosophes such as d'Holbach reacted by asserting the immanent power of things to dispossess the self in order to repudiate the concept of divinity that stood behind it. However, this was no mere reversion to the world of “enchantment.” While d'Holbach was momentarily willing to anthropomorphize nature for rhetorical effect, he and Spinoza persistently applied the mechanized organization of the universe to human beings as well. In lieu of the semitranscendent, personified objects of the enchanted universe, one was left with the prospect of a world inhabited by wholly immanent, objectified entities.<br>

Author(s): Kitts Margo<br>
Abstract: But the astonishing aspect of this oath is, of course, its binding unto death, joined to an apparent intention to die, when suicide is forbidden in the Quran (e.g., at 4:29). While suicide pledges are legendary in the history of warfare (e.g., the Zealots at Masada, the kamikaze of World War II) and understandably equated with a love greater than love of oneself, noble suicides have never been conventional in Islamic societies and planned deaths were not sanctioned during the society’s golden age.
            50Suicide operations are in fact a relatively new phenomenon in Islam,51with questionable etiologies.52Traditionally, death in battle was graded against a strenuous code that measured purity of fighting intention and determined the slain’s status as a potential martyr.53An implicit code such as this may explain why the bulk of the instructions, and indeed this very one, emphasize purifying oneself, even of the desire for vengeance against those who “fear death and follow Satan.”54Conceivably, only the purest ritual actor, transported onto a ritual stage, may transcend Islamic proscriptions on suicide and give his life as an offering to God. While the ritual actors do not outrightly endorse an oath to die—proscribed in Islamic theology—they certainly knew they would die.55Purification helps to sanctify a mission that, on its face, should be forbidden.<br>

Abstract: But even when the token is received in trust, there is no debt created since the final gift has not yet arrived. One might feel obligation in anticipation of the gift, but such obligation differs from that in which a gift would actually have been received rather than a gift one might receive. Because of the translation of obligation into the future, it opens up a space for exchange without debt. One can take this token in trust and then offer gratitude in return to God without debt, without obligation in freedom. Derrida constructed the pure gift in order to preserve it from exchange and reciprocity. He did not thereby think that the gift so purified would not affect the world of exchange, forever hovering aloft. Rather, his preferred way of describing the gift is as an interruption, a trace, or cinders that would in some oblique or indirect way haunt or challenge the ordinary economy. By contrast, because the giving of the promise indebts God to the one promised in some sense, this token and final gift enters into the already existing exchange of gifts in human culture or the political sphere. Derrida’s gift, in some of its formulations, could silence immanent political criticism. Tillich feared that aphasia in the political was the consequence of dialectical theology when it refused to allow God to interact with the world for fear of tainting God’s wholly otherness. This refusal would prevent the token offered in promise, as well as the one promised, from entering into the give‐and‐take of life with the token in hand or the trust of the word, even though it can radically challenge by its interruption of gift economy.<br>

Abstract: For Bonaventure, following Augustinian prompts, Francis's life was like a return to the
         hortus deliciarumbefore humankind's lapse and separation from nature. In Francis's model relationship to God and nature, according to Bonaventure, God's creatures are brothers and sisters: “When he [Francis] considered the primordial source of all things, he was filled with even more abundant piety, calling creatures no matter how small by the name of brother and sister because he knew they had the same source as himself.”45This position is radically different from the dichotomized man-animal opposition upheld in the philosophical tradition and that has, as Agamben argues, anthropomorphized animals and animalized man.46Because it is rooted in “affective and aesthetic experience,” this Franciscan-inspired theology is never purely intellectual, for it expresses the “sense of union with the being and life of Nature.”47<br>

For a critique of this ethical basis as eliding the potential for monstrosity or inhumanity in the other, see Slavoj Žižek, “Neighbors and Other Monsters: A Plea for Ethical Violence,” in Slavoj Žižek, Eric L. Santner, and Kenneth Reinhard, The Neighbor: Three Inquiries in Political Theology(University of Chicago Press, 2006), 136–90. Žižek does not entirely discard pity as an ethical category, but instead requires that it be supplemented to counterbalance its excess.<br>

Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
Abstract: This observation reveals some divergence between the biblical answer to Babel and the more universal discussion of LaCocque’s analysis. The critique of Babel’s hubris leads to the covenant of Genesis 12, the “great exception, the miraculous ‘otherness’ that is both judgment and relief for ‘all the families of the earth’” (100). But questions remain. For J, the answer to the loss of innocence in Eden and Babel is the covenant, but in LaCocque’s reading, the text affirms rather the indeterminacy and perennial suspicion of structure more characteristic of postmodern thinkers. In his reading, the tower claims a presence, but “deconstructionism shows the absence of such absolute presence” (154). Such a reading is justified in part by the fact that “authorial intent never exhausts the text’s meanings” (93). While there may be little to regret over the deterioration of Babel’s collapse, the same kind of deconstructive move could be made against the theology of J. The understated theologies of J and LaCocque run suggestively through
      The Captivity of Innocence, but much more could be said about them and how they are related.<br>

Abstract: The text covers a lot of ground, delving into many of the touch points between theology and human rights and endeavoring to demonstrate how those points can be sources of mutual enrichment rather than conflict. At times the comprehensive scope of the text, which draws on the insights of so many, makes it a challenging read and leaves the reader wanting more development and illustration of the fruits of the author’s argument. Overall, the text is an important contribution to the constructive engagement between theology and human rights discourse and is a serious challenge to those in either camp who would peremptorily reject the insights of the other.<br>

Abstract: The cultural and social sciences are welcome to examine and critique theology and Christian practice, and theology can profitably learn from these studies, but the studies themselves are not theology. To be theology, even in an interdisciplinary sense, the work must become constructive and speak to the
   religiousthought and practice of specific communities or faith traditions. In any given community, theology can become a displaced language in need of renewal, but theology can also uncover the displaced or implicit religion within the seemingly secular. To do this well, theology must remain in critical tension with the cultural sciences, including literature. The result may well be deconstructive, but such radical critique is necessary for any living tradition.<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: I am grateful to this international group of scholars for accepting the invitation to engage my argument. My main points are that morality is not a cultural system but a modality of action present across all domains of human life, and that an anthropological approach to morality must recognize evil as an existential category. In other words, the article is neither a study of witchcraft for its own sake nor evil in its own right but a commentary on a particular moment in anthropological thinking about morality. Helene Basu recognizes the intent of my neologistic move toward homodicy and ethnodicy as alternatives to theodicy, which is to identify a starting point for anthropology distinct from those of theological anthropology or theology, in the shadow of which anthropology has approached morality obliquely if at all. She aptly identifies the importance of “concrete, situated human actions” and the “practical logic of evil.” To her question of whether this practical logic is discernible in violent encounters framed in terms other than witchcraft, the answer is an emphatic yes. Witchcraft is not the only evil, just as evil does not account for all of morality. Basu’s example of racial hatred in Germany shows morality as a modality of social action generating personal illness, collective suspicion and distrust, and an atmosphere of injustice. This supports my emphasis on the adjectival quality of moral action and moral interpretation rather than on a nominal morality, and on moral experience rather than on the structure of a moral code. Her interpretive polarity between police and immigrants might also be seen as a triangular one, including the violent right-wing xenophobes as moral actors, if there can be a morality of hatred. A practical contribution of evil as an analytic category in such an instance may be to help preserve cultural relativism while avoiding moral relativism.<br>

Author(s): Fisher Cass<br>
Abstract: Despite these caveats,
   Contemplative Nationis highly recommended for scholars of Jewish studies, religious studies, philosophy, and theology. The book is an excellent example of how to apply hermeneutical theories to the study of Judaism, how to bridge the gap between continental philosophy and analytic philosophy, and how to expand the scope of Jewish studies by appreciating the nature of theological discourse. While Judaica scholars could use the book in university-level courses, and rabbis could apply its approach to synagogue life, the claim that “Israel” is a “contemplative nation” will hardly resonate with most Jews today. It is very doubtful that the book could “guide the way for [the] future” of the Jewish people’s survival (226), precisely because Jews today are overwhelmingly secular, and the culture in which Jews live, both in Israel and in the Diaspora, is anti-intellectual and antitheological. Furthermore, if Fisher is so keen on Philo, he should have also reminded his readers of the fate of Philo’s enterprise: it was no coincidence that Philo became one of the Church Fathers and that his exegetical/hermeneutical project was not adopted by the tradition that became normative Judaism. When “Israel” denotes a nation of divine contemplators, “carnal Israel” (namely “Israel” as a historical, cultural, and ethnic entity) is marginalized, denigrated, and persecuted. It is true that Jewish religious life is theological, but being Jewish cannot be reduced to contemplating God.<br>

Abstract: The concept of “focalised universality,” as developed by Liv Mariah Yarrow (“Focalised Universality: Contextualising the Genre,” in
         Historiae Mundi: Studies in Universal History, ed. Peter Liddel and Andrew Fear [London: Duckworth, 2010], 131–47), does acknowledge such a perspectivisation of a universal outlook but is easily conflated (ibid., 133) with a centrist perspective that does not treat a peripheral development as important in its own right and peripheral agents as on equal footing in certain respects. This must imply an evident interest in treating peripheral events. As Peter Van Nuffelen (“Theology versus Genre? The Universalism of Christian Historiography in Late Antiquity,” in Liddel and Fear,Historiae Mundi, 162–75) rightly stresses, Christian historiography does frequently not meet the criteria of universal history despite an implicit universalistic theology of history. For Varro as a Greek scholar, see, e.g., J. G. F. Powell, “Response [to T. Tarver, “Varro, Caesar, and the Roman Calendar: A Study in Late Republican Religion”],” in Sommerstein,Religion and Superstition, 59–64, at 63.<br>

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak in this book also offers continental thinkers an appealing alternative to the theological turn of phenomenology as practiced by Jean-Luc Marion and others. While Peperzak takes seriously the idea that “God cannot be investigated or explained … because God is not given as a describable phenomenon,” this realization does not turn his phenomenology away from the investigation of rational thinking because for Peperzak reason itself has to be rethought in terms of the intersubjective encounters between nonthematizable—human and divine—sayers (121). Consequently, much more than some of the thinkers of the theological turn, Peperzak’s work maintains a broadly humanist sensibility and a conviction that theological thinking and philosophy can be integrated quite well, provided the latter does not close itself off in autarky. In his humanism, Peperzak echoes the best elements in the philosophical style both of his teacher Paul Ricoeur and the philosophical tradition of his own Catholic faith, although he implicitly critiques the former for insisting too vehemently on the autonomy of philosophy (128) and calls out the latter for separating “natural reason” from faith (182–86). For his own part, Peperzak hopes to maintain an open space between faith and reason: “I do not see any valid argument against the integration of philosophical insights into a faith-inspired theology … neither would I protest if an integrated reflection of the Christian community about its faith would call itself
   philosophia” (160). For the many who share similar sentiments today,Thinking about Thinkingwill make a valuable guide to the conversation of philosophy.<br>

Author(s): Gutterman David S.<br>
Abstract: Gutterman pairs Sunday with King, focusing on their sermons and speeches. His readings are sharp and detailed, and his solid historiography sits alongside the work of David Chappell or Clifford Putney. The chapters on PK and CTR are well written but contain misunderstandings of each group's political orientations. Gutterman briefly outlines PK's declension narrative involving the breakdown of the “nuclear family”; but this begs for further comparative work, as he does not engage the 1970s architects of this narrative (e.g. Richard Viguerie), nor does he make sufficient use of literature on gender and religion. He also mishandles some of PK's political complexities, asserting that PK “has a political vision, and proclaims a political theology” (p. 99) even as its members see “no reason for democratic politics” (p. 125). In fact, PK do not dismiss politics altogether; politics are simply seen as serving a different purpose than evangelism. In other words, the relations among oft‐used terms like “politics,” “democratic politics,” and “political theology” are at times imprecisely articulated.<br>

Moving beyond a narrow understanding of the nature of religion as expressed in much of Black Theology, for example, this essay proposes a "thick" and complex depiction of religion in the African American context through a recognition of its relationship to the contact and conquest that marked the modern world.<br>

It is claimed that the Pratyabhijñā system elucidates important features of our past and present deliberations about the role of interpretation in experience and provides us with a sound way of arguing for the reality of God.<br>

Article Title: Is Zoroastrianism Dualistic or Monotheistic?<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263718<br>
Date: 12 1, 1961<br>
Author(s): Zaehner Donald A.<br>
Abstract: The question raised in the title has been much debated by past and present interpreters of Zoroastrianism. In the first two parts of this paper we present some dualistic and monotheistic interpretations of the religion. The interpretations can be labeled as follows: 1. DUALISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks Omnipotence And Omniscience (Dhalla, Henning) 2. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks A Physical Nature (Shaked, Boyce) II. MONOTHEISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The Created Spirits View (Zaehner, Fox, Gershevitch) 2. The Transformationist (Maskhiyya) View 3. The Zurvānite View 4. The View That Good And Evil Are Coeternal Only In A Logical Sense (Moulton, Bode and Nanavutty, Duchesne-Guillemin) We present each of these views and discuss it critically in light of the following criteria: (1) textual evidence; (2) the continuity of the religion throughout its history, including the present time; (3) philosophical cogency; and (4) religious satisfaction. Our conclusion is that each of the above positions, despite its elements of strength, falls seriously short of one or more of these criteria, and hence that there is need for a more adequate interpretation of Zoroastrianism than any of them can offer. Accordingly, we present another interpretation in order to provoke further discussion and, hopefully, to advance the cause of trying to gain a more precise grasp of the teachings of this remarkable religion. In brief, the interpretation we favor is that Zoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique to itself among the major religions of the world. This combination results in a religious outlook which cannot be categorized as either straightforward dualism or straightforward monotheism, meaning that the question in the title of this paper poses a false dichotomy. The dichotomy arises, we contend, from a failure to take seriously enough the central role played by time in Zoroast~<br>

Article Title: Ideology and Alienation: Theses on the Interpretation and Evaluation of Theologies of Liberation<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263710<br>
Date: 12 1, 1966<br>
Author(s): Winter Charles R.<br>
Abstract: Through the provision of a set of theses for the interpretation and evaluation of theologies of liberation, this paper attempts to mediate the existing conflict between academic theologians and theologians of liberation. It seeks to establish the legitimacy of theological discourse focused on the problem of alienation and liberation if carefully executed according to a clear set of guidelines. The paper begins with the argument that all interpretations of theologies of liberation must begin with an analysis of the theological genre within which these works fall. After insisting that theologies of liberation belong neither to the genre of systematic theology nor that of Christian social ethics, the paper develops the second thesis that theologies of liberation are best understood as members of a genre whose distinctive characteristics and functions are analogous to those intrinsic to secular ideologies. This thesis hinges upon a revisionist understanding of ideology drawn from the works of Clifford Geertz et al. and upon a careful specification of the generic similarities between the two forms of discourse. The second part of the paper moves from the level of interpretation to that of evaluation. It argues that theologies of liberation share with ideologies a tendency to occlude self-critical reflection. It suggests that a conscious recognition that theologies of liberation do not exhaust the possibilities of theological discourse but are relative models which select and interpret Christian symbols and doctrines in the light of the central dynamic of alienation and liberation might provide an antidote to this pathology. It maintains with Rosemary Ruether that there is no absolutely adequate model of alienation and liberation and that various models of alienation and liberation must be "interstructured" in order to overcome the perspectival biases of models which focus upon a single root of oppression. To establish relative degrees of adequacy between various theologi~<br>

Article Title: The First Evil Will Must Be Incomprehensible: A Critique of Augustine<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263713<br>

Abstract: The thesis of this paper is that an absolute origin of evil, arising from the free will of a creature, must be incomprehensible. Although Augustine occasionally acknowledges this point, nevertheless in a number of better-known passages (chiefly in The City of God) he attempts to give a causal account of the fall of Adam and/or Satan. Much of the subsequent Christian tradition has unfortunately followed his lead, and major recent commentators routinely ignore or passively approve of his conceptual error. Augustine offers three unacceptable explanations of the fall, which conflict variously with his own doctrines of divine omnipotence, the goodness of creation, and creaturely free will and responsibility, as well as violating the canons of sound argumentation and explanation. First, his contention that free creatures made "out of nothing" inevitably fall makes the fall seem ontologically necessary (unfree) and thereby lays the ultimate responsibility for it on the Creator. Second, the appeal to pride as an explanation is a spurious causal account, for "pride" is only a synonym for "fallenness" itself and not a possible antecedent condition in a being created good and not yet fallen. Finally, his assertion that the first sin is intrinsically comprehensible, but not comprehensible to us because we are fallen, is an obfuscation masquerading as an explanation, for we have no warrant for supposing that this assertion is true or even meaningful. Instead of seeking causal explanation Augustine should have stayed with his own wiser observation that an evil will has no efficient cause. Theology of the Augustinian sort (which comprises much of the Christian tradition) ought to concede that the fall as a work of genuine freedom is an absurd "fact," an incomprehensible given which steadfastly and in principle resists causal explanation. The concluding section of the paper draws upon Ricoeur's insights to tell why the narrative structure of the "Adamic myth" (which has important p~<br>

Publisher: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates<br>
Issue: i20176801<br>
Date: 1 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Miller Keith D.<br>
Abstract: Even though Martin Luther King, Jr. constantly cited the Bible, no one has seriously examined his rhetoric as biblical hermeneutic. Here I argue that in "I Have a Dream," King explodes closed memories of the Exodus by reconceptualizing a hermeneutic of (Second) Isaiah as he interprets African-Americans' experience of oppression and exile in Babylon/America and their hope for a new Exodus. Drawing on African-American political rhetoric, King spotlights biblical writers' dialogue with each other and extends the arc of biblical narrative into the present. He also anticipates certain forms of liberation theology of the 1970s and beyond.<br>

Article Title: The Reunification of Theology and Comparison in the New Comparative Theology<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion, Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i20630137<br>
Date: 9 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between the new comparative theology and the theology of religions in light of their common genealogy in the comparative theology of the late nineteenth century. Noting that the latter's blindness to its considerable biases was sustained by its oppositional relationship with the exclusionary apologetic theology of the day, the paper argues that the new comparative theology risks repeating the same pattern of self-deception when it dichotomizes its relationship with the theology of religions. At the same time, however, the new comparative theology, by openly acknowledging its theological commitments, strips the comparative method of the aura of "science" which has often functioned ideologically to mask bias. In this way, the new comparative theology exemplifies the recent shift in the understanding of comparison from a method of discovery to a critical method for the testing and revision of the categories through which scholars interpret their data.<br>

Abstract: Focusing on the interplay of religion and Utopia in Fredric Jameson's recent Archaeologies of the Future, I identify a tension: on the one hand, the content of religion has been superseded (although not its forms), yet, on the other, Jameson still wishes to make use of a hermeneutics of suspicion and recovery in which even the most retrograde material may be recuperated—religion included. So we find a clash underway in this work. Sometimes Jameson sidelines religion, as one would expect if religion was no longer relevant. At other times, he exercises his dialectical hermeneutics, particularly at two moments: first, a recovery, via Feuerbach, of the role of magic within fantasy literature; second, the partial treatment of apocalyptic, which comes very close to his own argument for Utopia as rupture. From here, I develop the dialectic of ideology and Utopia further by expanding Jameson's comments on the possibilities of medieval theology and the utopian role of religion (both Catholic and Protestant) in More's Utopia.<br>

Abstract: Jacques Derrida's deconstructionism has influenced some American shools of literary criticism which aim at abolishing the distinction between literary and philosophical texts and, at the same time, deconstructing the text from its inherent meaning. If no text has any determined meaning, every interpretation is as correct as any other. This article examines some tenets of Derrida and his followers, especially their definitions of the words understanding, interpretation, and difference. It finds some surprizing affinities between Kant's formalistic esthetics and certain formalistic trends in modern criticism, in particular the concept of autonomy, which implies, in deconstructionism, the uniqueness of every text. However, if so, every reading is inevitably a 'misreading' or 'misinterpretation' thereof. This has led to the paradoxical and unwarranted conclusion that reading is impossible... The article questions some eccentric implications of this paralogism, for example, if no text is readable, does this apply to Derrida's writings as well? The article also calls attention to some interesting concepts of Jewish Kabala and of 'negative theology', which bear a striking resemblance to certain of Derrida's and other deconstructionists' ideas. Without diminishing the importance of Derrida's philosohpical work or the contribution of deconstructionism to modern hermeneutics, this article refutes certain nihilistic claims of the 'deconstructors' regarding philosophical hermeneutics and literary criticism.<br>

Abstract: What is the direction of South African theological ethics as that country moves out of the apartheid era into a new democratic future? Following its struggle against apartheid, how will theology respond to the new challenge of making clear its distinctive stance in a democratic, multi-faith society with a secular constitution? A danger, similar to that previously discussed in the United States, exists in South Africa as theology evolves from a mode of resistance to that of compliance and accommodation, especially under the guise of "nation-building." The essay plots a trajectory by means of a consideration of four works representing nonracial liberationist theology which emerged at key points in the past fifteen years—the Kairos Document (1985), and works by Albert Nolan (1988), Charles Villla-Vicencio (1992), and James Cochrane (1999). For all their contextual sensitivity and strength, these works appear to offer little of a distinctively theological nature, and little of Christian substance to church and society. The way lies open for the development of an African Christian ethics.<br>

Date: 7 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Ross Susan A.<br>
Abstract: IN THIS ESSAY I CONSIDER POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF FEMINIST THEOLogy to theological aesthetics and ethics by comparing the work of Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905—88), the predominant figure in theological aesthetics, with that of Elizabeth Johnson and Sallie McFague. Balthasar's emphasis on contemplation and obedience in response to the unexpected revelation of God's glory contrasts with the practicality, mutuality, and creativity of feminist theological ethics. On the other hand, feminist theology's emphasis on appropriate language and images for God suggests an implicit aesthetics. The artistic work of contemporary African women in crisis situations sheds further light on both Balthasar and feminist theology and brings into relief the relationship of beauty and justice. Although Balthasar's emphasis on the transcendent glory of God may leave him with an undeveloped ethics, feminist theology's agent-oriented approach could benefit from greater attention to contemplation and a transformed understanding of obedience. These conclusions urge greater appreciation and development of the aesthetic and imaginative dimensions of feminist theological ethics.<br>

Abstract: Religious tolerance is a sociopolitical necessity. Social and political pressures alone cannot be expected to nurture a genuine attitude of religious tolerance; in the West, secular and religious documents rely on the concept of conscience for this nurture. In this essay I ask what claims people make on each other as they attempt to live in accordance with what they believe to be true and good. To answer this question, I examine the Pauline concept of conscience and argue that Paul interpreted conscience through an ethic and theology of accommodation.<br>

Abstract: "Teaching" and "science" are notions that cannot be applied univocally to theology. Teaching implies that the mind masters its object scientifically through human methods; but who can master the knowledge which God alone possesses? There is need for God's Word himself to become Teacher (John 1,18). Thus, in the schools the sacra pagina will open itself up to become sacra doctrina. The method of theology is therefore always subordinate to a transcendent knowledge which finally remains inaccessible to any merely human science. Is science thereby degraded or on the contrary enhanced? Thomas Aquinas developed the idea of «subalternation». Blondel spoke of a science based on Christ «verified and realised in us». Today hermeneutics discovers that only the Glory of ultimate reality is capable of giving meaning to all the figures that announce it in human history and knowledge. On the other hand, the avatars of nominalism show that reducing theology and science to univocity results in perverting science as such.<br>

Abstract: On the occasion of the recent publication of a complete translation into French of Sein und Zeit, the author of the article means to approach the work with a "prejudice of innocence." Three philosophical questions are first treated. Reflection on time introduces the theological debate. For Heidegger, theology, as metaphysics on which it depends, is marked by "the forgetfulness of being." But does not the lack in him of a stand on moral conscience reveal a weakness of his thought on otherness? As for his theory of "concern", because it does not go back to its hebrew sources it fails to make "creatureliness" thinkable. The debate would deserve to be resumed starting from a philosophical analysis of the anamnesis.<br>

Abstract: Going beyond the passing theological fashions, the article seeks to show the relevance of "narrative theology". It first illustrates its doctrinal foundation in the many narratives which provide the frame-work for the biblical books, in the narrative of the Creed itself, in the ancient theologies of salvation history, down to the rediscovery of "narrativity" in contemporary theology. It then seeks to throw light on the philosophical foundation of narrative theology relying on Gaston Fessard's reflexion on three histories, natural, human and supernatural, and of Paul Ricoeur on Temps et récit (Time and Narrative), history and narrative, narrative and freedom. It ends up with a pastoral anthropology of narrative which seeks the link and meeting-point between the narrative of salvation and our own stories.<br>

Author(s): Nebel Mathias<br>
Abstract: Cet article cherche à préciser, à partir de la foi, dans quelle mesure le Christ peut être dit Norme de notre vie et de l'Histoire. L'auteur articule sa réponse à partir de la théologie de la grâce de Von Balthasar, de la morale théonome de Tillich et de la réflexion de Ricoeur sur le rapport à autrui. L'auteur soutient qu'il est possible de comprendre l'agapè comme un impératif catégorique non seulement formel, mais également concret. L'acte de la rencontre du Christ, universalisé dans et par l'Esprit, est tout à la fois la forme et le contenu de l'impératif catégorique. Sous cet aspect la norme n'est plus imposition, mais interpellation eschatologique à laquelle le croyant répondra par une configuration de sa vie au Christ. The paper seeks to understand how Christ can be said to be the living Norm of our life and of our History. The author build his reply upon Von Balthasar theology of grace, Tillich's concept of theonomy and Ricoeur's concept of solicitude. He sustain that it is possible to understand the love of agape not only as a formal but also a concrete categorical imperative. The encounter, the very act of meeting Christ, universally broaden by the Spirit, is at the same time the form and the contend of the categorical imperative. Under this view, the norm is not anymore imposed to the believer as an obligation, but urged upon him as an eschatological invitation to love.<br>

Abstract: In 'Anti-Latomus' (1521), Luther defined the concept of metaphor from a Christological viewpoint, thus touching upon the relationship between the word of God and the word of man, theology and aesthetics. In his later work 'Vom Abendmahl Christi. Bekenntnis' (1528) an eschatological frame of reference determines his interpretation of the words of institution as metaphorical but real speech.<br>

Author(s): Körtner Ulrich H. J.<br>
Abstract: Johann Georg Hamann saw the written word of God as the ultimate consequence of his incarnation. The biblical texts as well also carry the death of Christ in their essence as a figure of incarnation. Roland Barthes called the process of putting these texts into writing, by which the text gains autonomy in relation to the author, the "death of the author". In terms of the theology of the Holy Scriptures, this idea can be connected to the way people have been talking about the death of God in the modern age. One must however distinguish between the death of the author and the death of the text. This occurs when exegesis does not want to accept the death of the author. When however during reading there is a new understanding of biblical texts, this means to a certain extent their resurrection.<br>

Author(s): KUBÁLKOVÁ VENDULKA<br>
Abstract: The Anglo-American discipline of International Relations defends its main principles and resists with an almost religious fervor any change to them, although the explanation of world affairs has been eluding it since its inception. The article attempts to draw up possibly the first historiography of the IR scholarship about religion in world affairs since the 90s, showing the heightened interest in the subject from most other social sciences and humanities. The article proposes the use of the term 'International Political Theology' to bridge the multiple literatures as well as to underscore the theological commitment of the IR discipline to its basic creeds and dogmas.<br>

Publisher: Faculty of Education The University of Calgary<br>
Issue: i23761698<br>
Date: 4 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Blumenfeld-Jones Donald S.<br>
Abstract: Classroom discipline systems are considered as patriarchal moral systems focused on hyper-individuality and dependent upon rules, consequences, and principles focused through authoritarian structures. Three example systems (Assertive Discipline, Glasser's Control Theory, and Discipline with Dignity) are critiqued using Noddings' analysis of evil and Welch's liberation theology. As an alternative grounding, freedom of responsibility is proposed, moved foward through Noddings' mediation and care and Welch's dangerous memory and solidarity with oppressed peoples. Les différentes approches à la discipline dans la salle de classe sont considérés comme des systèmes patriarcaux et moraux qui ont pour but de brimer l'individualité. Ces systèmes ont également comme bases des règlements, des conséquences et des principes imposés par des structures autoritaires. A la lumière de l'analyse de Nodding sur le mal et de la théologie de la libération de Welch, nous critiquons trois systèmes de discipline: "Assertive Discipline, Glasser's Control Theory, Discipline with Dignity." Comme alternative nous proposons plutôt une approche dite "liberté responsable" qui s'inspire des concepts de médiation et de soin de Nodding et des concepts de mémoire dangereuse et de solidarité des opprimés de Welch.<br>

Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23918936<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Westerink Herman<br>
Abstract: In this article it is argued that the apparent vagueness and broadness of the concept 'spirituality' and the difficulty in finding an agreeable definition for it are related to the different meanings of the concept within different intellectual and religious contexts and, subsequently, to different valuations of spirituality in relation to religion and lived religiosity. This article also examines the concept spirituality in the context of the psychology of religion's historical entanglement with theology. On the one hand, the psychology of religion has emancipated itself from theological discourse and theological institutions. On the other hand, the psychology of religion is still closely connected to a modernist theological project of founding religiousness in a province of the mind that resists religious critique of traditional contents and institutional structures in a secular era. The author pleas for more differentiation between theistic and non-theistic dimensions of the concept spirituality.<br>

Date: 9 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: This essay outlines an account of 'theological humanism' as a new form of theology of culture. I trace the connection between theological humanism and an ethics of responsibility dedicated to respecting and enhancing the integrity of life. I argue that without a 'theological' humanism we risk the reduction of values to human purposes, and yet without a theological 'humanism' religious conviction is unconstrained by moral purpose. In our age of religious violence and ecological crisis, what is needed in ethics is a renewed vision of the moral vocation of human beings not against but within the wider compass of life on earth.<br>

Issue: i23917924<br>
Date: 9 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Antonaccio Maria<br>
Abstract: This article argues that Iris Murdoch makes a distinctive contribution to the agenda of theological humanism by formulating a revised theology of culture. Specifically, the article claims that Murdoch provides a compelling apologia for religious life in a secular world in two ways: by defending the significance of individual consciousness, and by retrieving an idea of the religious depth of morality. In doing so, Murdoch's work challenges antihumanist currents in modern and postmodern thought, offers an alternative to confessional forms of religious reflection, and revises previous theologies of culture (such as Tillich's) by giving priority to the ethical dimension of human life.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917924<br>
Date: 9 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Whitehouse Glenn<br>
Abstract: This paper addresses the combination of theology and humanism by reflecting on Christian identity. Beginning with Paul Ricoeur's theory of fiction as a laboratory of 'imaginative variations' on the possibilities of ethical selfhood, I ask: if the world projected by the Christian scriptures overturns human possibilities, what happens to the Christian self's ethical responsibility? I analyse the motion pictures Fight Club, Memento, and The Matrix to interpret extreme cases or 'unimaginable variations' on the theme of conversion among broken, fragmented, and manipulated selves. I argue that The Matrix presents a form of conversion most conducive to fulfilling ethical responsibility.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917902<br>
Date: 3 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Cunningham Valentine<br>
Abstract: Bible reading occurs at intersection of perpetually shifting canons—of textual meaning, interpretative strategies, and preferred textual menu for particular contemporary consumption. Such continual up-to-datedness is the Bible's, as it is the classic's, only survival kit. Contemporary reading is the only reading—ever. Post-modernism's biblical reading menu is notable for its post-modernist yields of meaning; but textual post-modernism—aporias, textual unboundedness, canonical on-edgedness, apocryphalism, etcetera—is typical of biblical texts' ur-post-modernism (the Bible living up, of course, to applied post-modernist reading expectations). All such reading is an aestheticisation, a fictionalising process—abusive naturally; constructively abusive, perhaps; but always catachretical, demythologising, a negative theology. But, of course, this is utterly inevitable for now.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23919272<br>
Date: 9 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Anderson Pamela Sue<br>
Abstract: I propose both a critique of canonicity and a feminist defence of the careful re-reading of certain canonical texts. My proposal for a critique of the limits of our thinking about and with texts is informed by a re-reading of the canonical text of Kant. Admittedly Kant himself might be excluded from any possible feminist canon whether in literary theory or theology. However, my qualified defence of the Kantian text is part of a larger concern to rethink texts by men and women. The aim is not to reaffirm a conservative culture, but to provide crucial tools for the judgements and practices of still highly significant forms of critical hermeneutics. In particular, the process of suppression and repression of valuable texts by women and minorities cannot properly be reversed without taking seriously the particular skills of post-Kantian critique. Critical and historical skills will help distinguish when to think merely about a text and when to think with it so that we might come up with a new picture of canon.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23926961<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Ward Graham<br>
Abstract: The correlation of narrative and ethics has a long history in literature, and frequently ethics has been associated with a transcendental notion of truth. The recent attention to narrative and theology has offered more theoretical reflections of both poetic and hermeneutical practices that return us to the earliest literary, philosophical and theological productions. In this essay, I wish to present a different way of examining the correlation of narrative and ethics; one less orientated towards Scripture and less concerned with the Church. The narratives I consider are secular fictions from the modernist period. Through examining these works phenomenologically and the role the imagination plays in the production of beliefs, I argue that all narratives structure emotions, desires and hopes and this structuring continually opens up a transcendent horizon.<br>

Author(s): Hall W. David<br>
Abstract: This essay takes Paul Ricoeur's use of the phrase "economy of the gift" as an opportunity to explore the relationship between theology, ethics, and poetic redescription. A primay focus is Ricoeur's juxtaposition of the golden rule and the love command, the manner in which these two are poetically related by biblical discourse, and what this means for theological ethics. This focus offers the opportunity to explore some of the more radical implications of Ricoeur's claims about the poetic, redescriptive function of religious discourse, implications that were not adequately addressed by Ricoeur himself.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23922202<br>
Date: 9 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Hass Andrew W.<br>
Abstract: The following essay explores the nature of theory within the interdisciplinary space we call literature and theology—or more generally religion and literature—and the role theory has played in that space's collective practice. It argues that theory is natural to the 'binding' of religion with literature and of literature with religion, since both are caught in a dilemma of reading, including the 'reading' of the practices that mark each of their respective disciplines. The discussion then looks at the spectatorial nature of the ancient notion of theory as theoria, before it traces how theory, in moving from theoria to high Theory, has figured in the 25 volumes of Literature and Theology itself. This tracing covers a double assumption of theory and an appropriation of the 'other' as theory. The essay concludes by looking at the dynamic that continues to bind literature and theology, and indeed the readers of a journal such as this one, in a communality of theory, practice, and interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Rav H̱isday Crescas (1340-1410/11), Rabbi of Aragonese Jewry in Christian Spain and a major figure in medieval Jewish philosophy, is unique in positing an all-embracing thesis of Love. This thesis permeates his theories of cosmogony, metaphysics and theology and generates far-reaching didactic implications. This article examines Crescas' rather bold description of Love as a positive Divine attribute, an anthropopathism meant to convey ontological meaning about the Divine Nature via an analogous construct. Themes such as Infinite Goodness, Joy and Kindness enable Rav H̱isday to structure a new conception of the Creator and Providence. After postulating Divine Love as the Cosmic Force sustaining creation, Crescas explains the purpose of Torah and mitzvot in terms of evoking love for God thus drawing the soul to link up to the Divine Overflow of Love. Even spiritual existence after death is explicated in terms of the soul's love for its Divine Source. To understand Crescas' unique theory of Love, we compare it with the views of his predecessors and analyze his use of philosophic sources such as the 5th century BCE pre-Socratic scientist-mystic Empedocles. We examine educational aspects of Crescas' teachings on love and view them in context of the mass conversions to Christianity resulting from the 1391 riots. Finally, Crescas' ideas are read as pedagogical messages relevant to both Jews and conversos in the twenty traumatic years after 1391 when he served as chief rabbi and political leader in Saragossa.<br>

Abstract: The article calls attention to the role and function of exemplary "models", defined as evoking signs that move people to reflect their own values and orientations. It was Albert Bandura who first showed that human learning generally has the form of learning from models. Recent insights of neuroscience confirm and explain Bandura's theories: The human brain as a neuronal network estimates things according to similarities of their entire structure. Thus it can be called a "machine estimating structural connections". These insights can inspire moral theology: A concrete model can show the wide range of possibilities christian faith can open to believers. Christian tradition has always maintained this idea by understanding christian life as imitatio Christi. However, "imitatio" must be understood as the free and creative act of an autonomous subject.<br>

Abstract: The christology of the French Jesuit Joseph Moingt, L'homme qui venait de Dieu (published in 1993), is part of the younger history of narrative theology. Referring to the christology of Rahner and Balthasar, Jüngel and Pannenberg, Moingt is "reconstructing" the history of faith in the horizon of the narrative time of the Gospel. The criterion for this "reconstruction" is the history – of God and men – which follows the path of the Gospel's texts and which has been orientated from the beginning to future. Jesus Christ is "announced as the man who has to come and whom the whole world attended", the man "coming from the future and who is the future of men, because of illuminating for all men the way to the future". Joseph Moingt's "théologie du récit" récit" to the discussion about the foundation of systematic christology. The following article presents the principal idea of Moingt's christology, it is governed by the question of the Christ's preexistence. This is the central point in the discussions about the importance of narrativity in actual dogmatics.<br>

Abstract: Theology can only prove its inner cohesion and unity in the interplay between life and thought in faith and in dialogue with its contemporary culture. Ch. Theobald is a theologian who does not search for this inner unity in a foundation of theological thought unfolding in various tractates but in a style of doing theology that has its analogy in being Christian. This article traces some of the elements in Theobald's style of theology.<br>

Abstract: Encroachments of contemporary social theory on the field of theology are the focal point of this essay. In postmodernity, theology facilitates connections with social theory. In the domain of theology, sociocultural problems are being presented as theological issues. Secularized variants of world theology meet with theologizing postsecular social theory above and beyond sociology. This is facilitated by the constant discourse of ambiguity. In this discourse, "the theological" is a vehicle of indeterminate meanings. Praxis' oriented discourse uses the term "social theory" with its modernist connotative envelope of science and rationality, but with no obligation whatsoever to maintain objectivity of cognition. Sociology doesn't interfere with theological discourse, but may analyze it, leaving the otherworldly outside its perspective on sociocultural phenomena. The sociotheological discourse of ambiguity, however, opposes both religion and the rationality of science.<br>

Abstract: Rapprocher théologie et théâtre permet de comprendre en quoi consiste chez Novarina l'unité d'un drame dont le discours est profondément rhapsodique et l'achèvement à chaque fois mystérieux. En prenant pour fil conducteur ce que Novarina dit de cette cathédrale à ciel ouvert qu'est la théologie et singulièrement de la dernière page du De Trinitate d'Augustin, cette étude fait apparaître le sens eschatologique du théâtre novarinien et le rôle structurel qu'y joue la prière. Bringing together theology and theatre allows us to understand what constitutes, in Novarina's work, the unity of a drama whose discourse is profoundly rhapsodic and whose completion is always mysterious. Taking as a guiding thread Novarina's account of the open-air cathedral of theology, in particular the last page of Augustine's De Trinitate, this study reveals the eschatological meaning of Novarinian theatre and the structural role that prayer plays in this work.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines the ambiguity that attends Paul Klee's characterization of the daemonic element in his work. It does so by analyzing the history of this concept in classical German thought from Wincklemann to Goethe. I note transformations of the concept in writings contemporaneous to Klee in literary theory and theology. These include Lukács, for whom the modern novel articulates the daemonic as an ironic world devoid of transcendental immanence, homeland, or essence; and Otto, for whom the world remained in some sense still not devoid of the numinous. I further consider these issues in brief discussion of Klee's account of the polyphonic construction of the artwork. Finally, attention is given to proximate philosophical treatments of the topic in writers influenced by Klee's work.<br>

Abstract: Steen, despite noting Dooyeweerd's development of "a unique aversion towards citing
proof-texts in his works" as a result of his early confrontations with Reformed theologians,
and despite noting Dooyeweerd's consequent failure to appreciate the rich discovery of
Scripture in recent developments within the exegetical branches of theology, and despite
noting that this may be (ironically) part of the reason for a residuum of nature-grace
influence in his philosophy, nevertheless speaks of "the rich biblical emphasis... always
present in Dooyeweerd." (Structure, pp. 20, 272; cf. p. 127, n. 2)<br>

Abstract: Kearny (2007, 198) refers to the idea of zimzum (tzimtzum) in Jewish kabbalistic
thought. I think this reference takes us closer to (for instance) Levinas than to Desmond. To
pursue this link, see Dalton (2006). For parallel influences, see the 'theology' of the Frankfurt
School: contractio Dei was the topic of Habermas's doctoral dissertation; the theme is also very
much present in Hansjonas's theology: see Valk (2009).<br>

Abstract: Al estudiar los procesos de transmisión dialógica de las memorias sobre la dictadura militar chilena y el rol que en ella tuvo la Iglesia Católica, desde la Corriente Liberadora (Teología de la Liberación), en tanto memoria subalterna, podemos concluir que opera una paradoja. El principal desafío de esta Corriente es defender la forma en que vivieron el cristianismo durante la dictadura, tratando de influir a la propia Iglesia Católica tras su progresivo alineamiento con los sectores más conservadores a partir de la recuperación democrática. Sin embargo, dentro del clero no encuentran herederos o cómplices para esta Corriente, con lo cual se arriesga el olvido de sus experiencias. Sin embargo, los laicos/as han encontrado en otros actores no eclesiales formas en que sus memorias transiten, en tanto recurren al sentido último de la Teología de la Liberación: el compromiso con las nuevas luchas sociales de los actores marginados. Au moment d'étudier les processus de transmission dialogique des mémoires sur la dictature militaire chilienne et le rôle qu'a joué l'Église catholique dans cette dictature auprès du courant libérateur (Théologie de la Libération), en tant que mémoire subalterne, nous pouvons conclure que ce rôle relève du paradoxe. Le principal défi de ce courant est de défendre la façon dont ses partisans ont vécu le christianisme pendant la dictature, en essayant d'influencer l'Église catholique après son alignement progressif sur les secteurs les plus conservateurs, une fois le démocratie revenue. Cependant, le clergé ne trouve pas d'héritiers ou de complices de ce courant parmi ses membres, au risque d'oublier ces expériences. Néanmoins, les laïcs ont trouvé chez d'autres acteurs, non ecclésiaux, des formes par lesquelles leurs mémoires transitent, en ceci qu'ils recourent au sens ultime de la Théologie de la Libération : l'engagement dans les nouvelles luttes sociales des acteurs marginalisés.

Abstract: The last two decades have been fascinating and productive ones for theorists of religion. Recent work has offered a remarkably wide range of theoretical perspectives and possibilities that enrich our field even as they plunge us into vigorous theoretical debates. Amidst this contest-even confusion-some basic principles for guiding future work seem to be asserting themselves. Many think that, after a century of confusion and intermingling between theology and the study of religion, scholars of religion are finally in a position to establish the study of religion on properly academic, theoretical foundations. In this story Eliade's antireductionist discourse of the "sacred" becomes the epitome and, it is hoped, the last gasp of religious studies as a quasi-theological discourse. Yet despite their efforts to guide the study of religion away from Eliade, many remain Eliadan insofar as they accept Eliade's "locative" approach to religion. Yet is it really "theology" that is currently limiting the way we "imagine religion," or might it be instead the refusal to think beyond religion's locative function-a refusal very closely linked to the desire for academic respectability in a historicist age? Mark C. Taylor's After God provocatively disturbs the idea that religion is primarily locative and, in doing so, also disturbs the boundaries between the theological and the theoretical, religion and the study of religion. I consider the significance of this virtual map of religion, by reading After God with and against J. Z. Smith's early reflections or experiments with the ideas of chaos, incongruity, and location. I argue that Taylor's book leads us back to paths from which Smith turned in his early work.<br>

Abstract: In medical anthropological research, the question of suffering has been a topic of salient interest mostly from two theoretical viewpoints: those of endurance and of agency. The concept "suffering" derives its origins from two etymological roots, those of suffering-souffrance-sofferanza and of misery-misère-miseria. According to the first approach, that of "endurance" and founded largely on Judeo-Christian theology, suffering is regarded as an existential experience at the borders of human meaning making. The question then is: how to endure, how to suffer? The latter view, that of "agency," follows the Enlightenment, and later the Marxist view on mundane suffering, misery, and the modern question of how to avoid or diminish it. This article follows the lines of the second approach, but my aim is also to try to build a theoretical bridge between the two. I ask whether agency would be understood as a culturally shared and interpreted modes of enduring, and if so, which conceptual definition of agency applies in this context? I theorize the relationship between suffering and agency using Ernesto de Martino's notion la crisi della presenza. In line with Pierre Bourdieu, I think that in people's lives, there may be sufferings in a plural form, as a variety of sufferings. The article is based on a one-year long fieldwork in Finnish North Karelia.<br>

Abstract: While individual and group psychotherapy are often referred to as forms of secular confession, the relationship of early religious confessional practices to the psychology of contemporary helping group processes needs further exploration. An examination of the theology and form of the Catholic rites of reconciliation indicates that their psychology and structure clearly parallel many of the healing processes at work in group psychotherapy.<br>

Author(s): Lamborn Amy Bentley<br>
Abstract: As the disciplines of psychoanalysis and religion find themselves in a heightened cross-disciplinary context, issues of methodology remain at the forefront. This article constructs an interdisciplinary method based on the image of psychoanalysis and religion as neighbors who border along an "intimate edge"—a space of simultaneously overlapping, yet distinct concern. Using what is termed a "hermeneutic of mischievousness," this method maintains an interpretive location for that which preserves, transgresses, and transcends the disciplinary boundaries. The article concludes with a brief application of the method to the relationship between the "analytic third" and Christian trinitarian theology.<br>

Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i27643230<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Doja Albert<br>
Abstract: The system of beliefs and practices related to Bektashism seems to have corresponded to a kind of liberation theology, whereas the structure of Bektashi groups corresponded more or less to the type of religious organization conventionally known as charismatic groups. It becomes understandable therefore that their spiritual tendency could at times connect with and meet social, cultural and national perspectives. In turn, when members of the previously persecuted religious minority will acquire a degree of religious and political respectability within society at large, the doctrines of heterodoxy and liberation theology fade into the background. In the end, the heirs of the heterodox promoters of spiritual reform and social movement turn into followers and faithful defenders of a legitimate authority. They become the spokespeople for an institutionalized orthodoxy whose support is sought by the political regime.<br>

Article Title: Vision and Voice: Phenomenology and Theology in the Work of Jean-Luc Marion<br>
Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i27646172<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
Abstract: The kind of phenomenology that can be useful to theology will be a hermeneutical phenomenology, one that takes us beyond the Cartesian/Husserlian ideal of presuppositionless intuition. It will also be a phenomenology of inverse intentionality, one in which the constituting subject is constituted by the look and the voice of another. In light of these suggestions, the phenomenology of Jean-Luc Marion is defended against three critiques, namely that it compromises the boundary between phenomenology and theology, that the theology it serves is a bad one to boot, and that it has an inadequate account of the subject. At the heart of this defense is Marion's clear distinction between phenomenology as a description of possible experience, and theology as the claim that a certain kind of experience, namely revelation or epiphany, is not merely actual but veridical. Phenomenology says, If revelation occurs it will be in the form of a saturated phenomenon. Theology says, for example, the burning bush was an epiphany, or Jesus Christ is a revelation. The attentive reader should have no trouble distinguishing Marion's phenomenological analyses, which should be persuasive to believer and unbeliever alike, from his theological claims. Marion's account of the subject falls under the heading of inverse intentionality, and there are hints that vision is aufgehoben in the voice. The seer is first of all the one seen, but above all the one addressed, called forth into response-able being.<br>

Abstract: L'exégèse biblique contemporaine associe une longue tradition herméneutique au développement moderne des sciences philologiques et historiques. Marqué par la séparation des Églises et de l'État ainsi que par la "crise moderniste" au sein du catholicisme, ce domaine savant s'interroge aujourd'hui en France sur son avenir et sur son rôe dans l'espace public. Dans leur diversité universitaire ou ecclésiale, les biblistes français ne participent pas moins au cours international et pluriconfessionnel de recherche. Où la théologie, momentanément séparée de la science positive, sert en fait d'aiguillon à la recherche historique et anthropologique. Et où en définitive, le texte, atelier de l'exégète, s'impose comme un vecteur de dépassement des vieux clivages de la science et de la croyance. /// The contemporary biblical interpretation associates a long hermeneutical tradition with the modern development of philological and historical sciences. Marked by the Separation of Churches and State, also by the "modernistic crisis" within Catholicism, this field of scholarship wonders today in France on its future and its part in the public space. Although connected with University or Church, the French biblical specialists do not take part less in the international and interdenominational research. The theology, temporarily separated from positive science, is finally stirring up historical and anthropological studies. At last for the scholar, Holly Scripture as workshop is used to overstep the old bounds of science and believe. /// La exégesis bíblica contemporánea asocia una larga tradición hermenéutica al desarrollo moderno de las ciencias psicológicas e históricas. Marcado por la separación de las Iglesias y el Estado así como por la "crisis modernista" en el seno del catolicismo, este ámbito de saberes se pregunta hoy en Francia sobre su futuro y sobre su rol en el espacio público. Dentro de su diversidad universitaria o eclesial, los biblistas franceses no dejan de participar~<br>

Abstract: Doniger argues, "The great universalist theories were constructed form the
top down: that is, they assumed certain continuities based about broad concepts such
as... a High God or an Oedipal complex.... The method I am advocating is, by
contrast, constructed from the bottom up. It assumes certain continuities not about
overarching human universals but about particular narrative details concerning the
body, sexual desire, procreation... and death, details which... are at least less
culturally mediated than the broader conceptual categories of the universalists" (The

Abstract: L'étude de l'engagement de "Frères du Monde" contre la guerre du Vietnam (1965-1973) permet de mettre en évidence les tensions existant entre la sphère du religieux et celle du politique, au sein d'un groupe de catholiques engagés, au cours de la décennie marquée par mai 68. Au début de la guerre du Vietnam, en février 1965, cette revue catholique, dirigée par des Franciscains bordelais, prend une position originale dans les milieux chrétiens: elle condamne très rapidement et très fermement l'intervention américaine. Ses rédacteurs "témoignent" en faveur du peuple vietnamien et dénoncent, en termes marxistes-léninistes, l'impérialisme américain. A travers les analyses, les prises de positions et les actions de "Frères du Monde" à propos du Vietnam, c'est le glissement vers le gauchisme d'une fraction minoritaire de la gauche chrétienne que l'on peut observer. Après 1968, le discours de la revue sur la guerre du Vietnam perd toute référence religieuse pour devenir, apparemment, exclusivement politique. Il reflète cependant une évolution théologique qui conduit des Franciscains, destinés à l'origine à la Mission, vers une théologie de la Libération, en gestation, à la même époque, en Amérique latine. L'engagement de "Frères du Monde" contre la guerre du Vietnam prend fin prématurément en septembre 1971. Alors que les combats redoublent de violence, la rédaction de la revue ne s'exprime plus sur cette guerre. En proie à des divisions internes, la revue disparaît au cours de l'année 1973. /// The study of "Frères du Monde's" commitment against the Vietnam War brings to the fore the tensions existing between the religious field and the political one, within a group of politically involved Catholics during the decade around May 1968. At the beginning of the Vietnam War, in February 1965, this Catholic review, published by a Franciscan friary from Bordeaux, takes an original stand among Christian circles: it quickly and firmly comdemns the American military intervention.

Date: 10 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Bernstein John Andrew<br>
Abstract: Shaftesbury's deism, widely representative of eighteenth-century liberal theology, may be profitably viewed as a reaction against Puritanism in particular and Pauline theology in general. Seen from this perspective, it implies, without explicitly asserting, a reduction of moral standards from the infinite conception of moral law characteristic of Protestantism. Shaftesbury showed no appreciation of the need for redemption or forgiveness, and changed the emphasis in religion from devotion to God above all else to a purely anthropocentric morality which God merely supported. But, in spite of the crudity of his theology and the dubious implications of his ethics, Shaftesbury sought to combat some of the harmful psychological effects to which Paulinism might lead when received in the wrong spirit, and manifested genuine religious insight in this effort.<br>

Publisher: University of Notre Dame Press<br>
Issue: i40000764<br>
Date: 4 1, 1983<br>
Author(s): Jung Patricia B.<br>
Abstract: An account of character is developed on the basis of Ricoeur's philosophy of the will. Particular attention is paid to the role of the bodily involuntary in the process of character-formation. This augments the interpretation of the moral meaning of sanctification developed by Hauerwas. When interpreted in light of corporeality, sanctification entails not only a perceptual transformation but also an affective change in the agent's value orientation, the competent retraining of the agent's emotions, and the gracious triggering of an adoptive disposition toward the agent's incarnate situation. Finally, the rootedness of character in embodiment, with the attendant problem of automatism, indicates the limits of the usefulness of an "ethics of character" for moral theology.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000943<br>
Date: 7 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Young Josiah Ulysses<br>
Abstract: This review essay explores Josiah Young's project of developing a liberatory Pan-Africanism that is attuned to cultural diversity and Victor Anderson's advocacy of postmodern cultural criticism in African-American religious thought. After situating African-American religious thought as a branch of Africana thought, the author examines these two religious thinkers' work as an effort to forge a position on African-American religious thought--including its relation to theology--in an age where even theory is treated as a god that is about to die. At the conclusion, secularism emerges as a religious project that normatively undergirds the methodological dimensions of these works..<br>

Issue: i40014491<br>
Date: 9 1, 2001<br>

Abstract: O artigo parte de uma constatação fundamental: a cultura secular mudou radicalmente o problema do mal, libertando-o do imediatismo religioso, exigindo uma resposta nova para um problema novo. Procede segundo dois momentos fundamentais. Primeiro, a ponerología, prévia a toda a adscrição religiosa ou ateia, mostra como a finitude torna o mal algo inevitável: omnis determinatio est negatio (Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel); mostra também até que ponto a ideia de um mundo-finito-sem-mal é algo contraditório, um verdadeiro "círculo-qua-drado". Quebra-se assim o "dilema de Epicuro", pois a alternativa já não é: mundo bom / mundo mau, mas sim: mundo / mundo finito-com-mal (não mundo mau); e instaura-se uma "lógica do apesar de", sem contaminação teleológica. A pisteodicea - o segundo passo - estuda as respostas ("fés" em sentido filosófico ou teológico, crente ou ateu). A teodiceia clássica converte-se, desta forma, em "pisteodiceia cristã", filosoficamente coerente (graças à ponerologia, Deus aparece, apesar do mal, como omnipotente e bom) e teologicamente responsável: a cruz, inevitável, preserva a bondade divina; a ressurreição, transcendente, preserva a omnipotência, respeitando a legalidade mundana. Filosofia e teologia mantêm assim a união na diferença. /// At the outset of this paper is the fundamental realization that the secular culture has radically changed the problem of evil, exempting it from the religious elementariness but rather demanding a new answer to a new problem. It sets two steps. First, the ponerology, previous to any religious or atheistic addition, shows that finitude makes evil inevitable: omnis determinatio est negatio (Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel); a finite-world-without-evil is contradictory, a "square-circle". It breaks, thus, the "Epicurean dilemma", since the alternative is not: good world vs. evil world, but rather world vs. finite-world-with-evil (not evil world): and it establishes a "logic of the in spite of, without the teleological contamination.~<br>

Article Title: Schopenhauer's Interpretation of the Categorical Imperative<br>
Publisher: Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40014512<br>
Date: 12 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Welsen Peter<br>
Abstract: The systematic relevance of the arguments Schopenhauer directs against Kant's categorical imperative has hardly been discussed in detail so far. As the difference between Kant's and Schopenhauer's moral philosophy amounts to the opposition between practical reason and sympathy, it is anything but surprising that it is reflected by Schopenhauer's objections. Schopenhauer tries to show that practical reason - be it in its pure or empirical form - is altogether incapable of furnishing a solid basis for ethics. To assess the import of this thesis, a detailed examination of the aspects of practical reason that provoke Schopenhauer's critique is necessary including: 1) the identification of morality and reason; 2) the moral value of maxims; 3) the categorical imperative; 4) the prescriptive character of Kant's approach; and 5) his ethico-theology. Although some of Schopenhauer's arguments are based on misunderstanding, his interpretation of the categorical imperative as an expression of rational egoism seems convincing. /// A relevância sistemática dos argumentos que Schopenhauer dirige contra a doutrina kantiana do Imperativo Categórico quase não tern sido objecto de discussão. O autor do presente artigo considera que tal como a diferença entre a filosofia moral de Kant e de Schopenhauer se reduz à oposição entre razão e simpatia, não é motivo de surpresa verificar que ela está reflectida nas objecções de Schopenhauer. Este, com efeito, tenta mostrar que a razão prática - seja isso na sua forma pura ou na sua forma empírica - é totalmente incapaz de fornecer uma base sólida para a ética. Em ordem a captar a importância desta tese, o artigo propõe um exame detalhado dos aspectos da razão prática que suscitam a crítica de Schopenhauer, entre os quais se inclui necessariamente: 1) a identificação de moralidade e razão; 2) o valor moral das máximas; 3) o imperativo categórico; 4) o carácter prescriptivo da abordagem kantiana; e 5) a sua teologia ética.

Abstract: Bien que de nombreux auteurs aient fait œuvre à la fois de sociologue et de théologien, il n'existe pas à proprement parler de « sociologie de la théologie ». L'objet de cet article est de proposer une relecture de La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte de Maurice Halbwachs afin de montrer que ce livre offre autant une étude de sociologie de la mémoire qu'une esquisse de sociologie de la théologie. Après avoir précisé en quoi on peut parler d'une étude de la « construction sociale de la pensée chrétienne » chez Halbwachs, on revient plus en détails sur la façon dont il analyse le mécanisme de production de l'orthodoxie théologique, puis sur la spécificité du regard que le sociologue porte sur les questions théologiques. Enfin, la conclusion est l'occasion de souligner ce que pourrait apporter la sociologie de la théologie à la sociologie en elle-même. Even if various authors contributed to sociology as well as to theology, nothing like a "sociology of theology" exists. The aim of this article is to offer a rereading of La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte by Maurice Halbwachs, in order to show that this book is not only a study of sociology of memory but also an outline of a sociology of theology. After having defined in what extent we can find a study of "the social construction of the Christian thought" in Halbwachs' work, we turn to the way he analyses the production process of the theological orthodoxy, and then to the specificity of the sociological point of view on theological questions. Finally, the conclusion gives us the occasion to underline what the sociology of theology could bring to sociology itself. Aunque varios autores han contribuido tanto a la sociología que a la teología, no se puede decir que existe realmente una "sociología de la teología". Este articulo propone una relectura de La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte de Maurice Halbwachs que pretende mostrar que este libro es tanto un estudio~<br>

Issue: i378707<br>

Author(s): Winch Robert A.<br>
Abstract: The ramifications of postmodernism for theology have been discussed voluminously. I want to consider the ramifications of postmodernism for the social scientific study of religion, which above all means for theories of religion. Those ramifications are wholly negative: postmodernism opposes theories, and does so because it opposes generalizations. Objections to generalizations and thereby to theories in the social sciences long antedate the rise of postmodernism, but earlier objections are on modernist grounds. Postmodernism is oblivious to these criticisms and instead assumes that criticism begins with postmodernism itself. Where at least some modernist criticisms are not easily answerable, all post-modern criticisms are easily answerable, for all of them rest on confusions about theorizing.<br>

Abstract: Les études ici réunies visent à explorer la résurgence, dans la philosophie et la théologie contemporaines, du motif de l'impuissance de Dieu. La question n'est plus seulement celle, comme dans la pensée médiévale, de la limitation de la toute-puissance divine, mais bien de son complet abandon. Elle est étroitement liée à l'interrogation sur ce que peut être une théologie d'après la Shoah, et elle préside aussi, chez des penseurs comme Hans Jonas, Gianni Vattimo, ou Giorgio Agamben, au redéploiement des problèmes du mal et de la création, des concepts théologiques de kénose et d'incarnation, ou encore des catégories aristotéliciennes de la puissance. The contributions assembled here explore the resurgence in contemporary philosophy and theology of the notion of a powerless God. What is at stake here is no longer the medieval question of limitations of divine omnipotence, but its radical abandonment. This is closely linked to the question of a new post-Shoah theology. Among thinkers such as Hans Jonas, Gianni Vattimo, or Giorgio Agamben, it presides over a re-examination of the problems of evil and creation, of the theological concepts of kenosis and incarnation or even the Aristotelian categories of potency.<br>

Publisher: University of Nebraska Press<br>
Issue: i40113297<br>
Date: 4 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Holdrege Barbara A.<br>
Abstract: Up until recently the academic study of religion has been dominated by Protestant Christian paradigms of religious tradition, in which precedence is given to such categories as belief, doctrine, and theology, and tradition-identity is rooted in the missionary character of Christian traditions. The essay argues that rabbinic Judaism and brahmanical Hinduism provide alternative paradigms of religious tradition as "embodied communities" in which priority is given to issues of practice, observance, and law, and tradition-identity is embodied in ethnic and cultural categories that reflect the predominantly nonmissionary character of these traditions. The manner in which the rabbinic and brahmanical traditions construct their respective categories of scripture—Torah and Veda—reflects the more fundamental affinities shared by these traditions as representatives of a distinctive paradigm of religious tradition: as elite textual communities that have codified their respective norms in the form of scriptural canons; as ethnocultural systems concerned with issues of family, ethnic and cultural integrity, blood lineages, and the intergenerational transmission of traditions; and as religions of orthopraxy characterized by elaborate legal systems, sacrificial traditions, purity codes, and dietary laws.<br>

Publisher: Beauchesne<br>
Issue: i40117551<br>
Date: 6 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): RAULET Gérard<br>
Abstract: L'interprétation des derniers écrits de Horkheimer a suscité des controverses parfois violentes ; ils semblent en effet traduire la résignation, voire le désespoir, et marquer un retour à la théologie. Leur signification peut cependant être reconsidérée si l'on conçoit l'évolution de Horkheimer à la lumière du statut de la vérité dans la Théorie critique. La résignation, le pessimisme et la théologie provoquent-ils un changement de statut de la vérité qui autoriserait à distinguer deux Théories critiques ou ne peut-on voir dans la permanence de thèmes comme celui d'une vérité utopique et non représentable, de la nostalgie, de la dette envers l'humanité et dans l'usage du pessimisme les signes d'une continuité ? Il se pourrait alors que l'économie interne de la Théorie critique ait changé, mais sans rupture, et que ces thèmes aient constitué dès le départ un ressort essentiel du caractère critique de la Théorie critique. The interpretation of the last essays of Horkheimer has raised controversies and even polemics in so far as hopelesness, resignation and the turn back to religion seem to predominate in them. In order to reconsider this problem, Horkheimer's evolution will be interpreted here in the light of the definition of truth in Critical Theory. Do resignation, pessimism and theology involve a new definition of truth — so that one could speak of a second Critical Theory, or can themes like the utopical, nonrepresentable nature of truth, the nostalgy, the debt to humanity and the use of pessimism be understood as signs of a continuity in which the economy of Critical Theory may have changed but without any rupture between its early phase and the late works of Horkheimer and Adorno ? If this is the case one has then to show how Critical Theory could preserve its critical properties in a changed political and social situation.<br>

Abstract: Durant sa longue et féconde carrière, Austin Farrer, à partir d'une défense volontariste et néo-scolastique de la théologie rationnelle, est allé vers un modèle « post-moderne » de la foi à laquelle Dieu se dévoile dans l'herméneutique des images. A partir de là il a construit, avec l'aide de Gadamer, une théologie narrative non-structuraliste en laquelle nous avançons ensemble grâce à une dialectique de ces images. La route est dégagée par le Bien, non pas par la différence ontologique de Heidegger. Ma compréhension de sa dialectique doit beaucoup à Emmanuel Lévinas. During his long and productive career Austin Farrer moved from a voluntaristic and neo-scholastic defence of rational theology to a « post-modern » dialogical model of faith to which God discloses Himself in the hermeneutic of images. With Gadamer's help he constructs from this a non-structuralist narrative theology in which we are underway together through a dialectic of these images. The way is cleared by the Good, not by Heidegger's ontological difference. My understanding of this dialectic owes a considerable debt to Emmanuel Lévinas.<br>

Abstract: The present-day global culture challenges First-World theologians to coalesce with Third-World theologians. Such an enterprise is conditioned by the identification of commonalities in theological inquiry. Hermeneutics of the Bible, and especially of the New Testament, is an important common ground for 'traditional theology' and 'contextual theology' alike. This paper, however, argues that there is a foundational reason why the historical Jesus and not the canon should be seen as the common ground for the engagement by First-World as well as Third-World theologians. This argument relates to the epistemic status of the canon in liberation theology. The canon originated during the time when the horticultural society shifted to an agrarian one. This shift was accompanied by, among other things, the process of urbanisation and the increase of inequality and of the scarcity of resources. Our memory of the historical Jesus tradition keeps us in touch with Jesus' emancipatory living during these circumstances—an emancipatory living that unmasks the hegemony that could be embedded in the canon.<br>

Abstract: A flood of research literature on 1 Corinthians over the last fifteen years suggests an understanding of this epistle and of the ethos of the church in Corinth that resonates closely with issues in our culture today. The ethos of "secular" Corinth still heavily influenced the church in Corinth. It encouraged attitudes that today we associate with consumerism, postmodernism, and social construction, together with an overpreoccupation with autonomy, success, audience-pleasing rhetoric, and a "local" theology. The church sought to choose its own leaders, its own ethics, its own socio-political value-system, and its own criteria of spirituality. However, Paul sets forth a formative understanding of the cross; an understanding of the Church as one, holy, catholic, and apostolic; a Christomorphic re-definition of "spiritual" and of the Holy Spirit; love and respect for "the other"; and the gift-character of grace and resurrection. How does this relate to hermeneutical distance and appropriation?<br>

Abstract: The present methodological debate about the need for a particular theological perspective when researching on the subject of contemporary church history raises central issues about the question of the validity of theology as a subject for scientific investigations. On the one hand, we should seek to avoid any dualtrack approach which would question the whole notion claimed by theologians to be advancing the cause of truth in a scientific manner. On the other hand, theology is a "thorn in the flesh" for the world of scholarship, since it seeks to guarantee openness as a central maxim in scholarly research, and to oppose any reductionist tendency which would pervert the secular methods of scholarly work by advancing the monopolistic claim of a systematic, ideological atheism. The right of theologians to propose their own special approach to theological questions should not be based on abstract principle, but is better defended-drawing on the researches of Itopper, Ricoeur and Marrou-as being in accordance with man's sinful nature and pragmatically meaningful. Drawing a distinction between the discovery of knowledge and assessment of its meaning can lead to a positive evaluation of experiences and their various connections. Any examination of experience, from a theological or ecclesiastical point of view, should not therefore be dismissed as illegitimate. Rather, it can add a valuable dimension in producing new horizons and perspectives. Of course, any such theological endeavour will still be subject to the rigorous disciplines of interdisciplinary discourse. Church history, as well as contemporary church history, is therefore in some ways competing with other historical disciplines. They are all attempting to make sense out of the welter of events by means of a theoretical ordering of experience. As such they provide a desirable, but by no means an exclusive, method of guiding men and women in their on-going search for insights into the nature of the world, man and Go~<br>

Abstract: La « Fédé » (Fédération française des associations chrétiennes d'étudiants) sort renforcée de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale. Influencé depuis le début des années 30 par la théologie de Karl Barth, le mouvement se tourne davantage après 1945 vers le monde et les problèmes politiques. Les étudiants protestants s'insèrent aussi dans la vie associative universitaire et sont partie prenante du développement de l'UNEF. Dans ces cinq années qui suivent la guerre, on voit poindre un certain nombre de tensions entre la jeunesse « fédérative » et les instances religieuses adultes. At the end of second World War, the "Fède" (French Student Christian Federation) has grown stronger. Influenced since early thirties by Karl Barth's theology, the movement shows after 1945 more interest in world affairs and political problems. The protestant studients also get involved in the university's associative life and take part in the development of the student's trade union, the « UNEF ». During these five years following War some tensions become perceptible between the federative youth and the religious adults' organisations. Mit dem Ende des zweiten Weltkriegs ist die « Fédé » (der französische Verband der christlichen Studentenvereine) noch stärker geworden. Ab 1945 interessiert sich die seit dem Anfang der 30er fahre von K. Barths Theologie beeinfluβte Bewegung immer mehr für die Welt und deren politische Probleme. Die protestantischen Studenten beteiligen sich auch häufig an dem Vereinsleben der Universität und wirken aktiv bei der Entwicklung der UNEF mit. Während der ersten fünf fahre nach Kriegsende treten einige Spannungen zwischen einer fugend, die sich für diese christlichen Vereine interessiert, und den religiösen Behörden der Erwachsenen auf.<br>

Article Title: FREUND UND FEIND — SCHWIERIGKEITEN MIT EINER "BANALITÉ SUPÉRIEURE": Zur neueren Carl Schmitt-Literatur<br>
Publisher: Duncker & Humblot<br>
Issue: i40145734<br>
Date: 1 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Maschke Günter<br>
Abstract: The author uses the term "banalité supérieure" to describe Schmitt's somewhat shocking thesis that the true political distinction is the one between "friend" (Freund) and "enemy" (Feind). To be sure, this perception does not free one from the necessity of continually determining a new the concrete friend-enemy relationship. Using the more recent literature from Italy, France, Spain and Germany, the discussion centers around the question whether Schmitt had several political terms which he himself often used and combined in different ways. The author demonstrates the fruitfulness of the etymological and philosophical study of the words "friend" and "enemy". At the same time, he presents the thesis that "friend" is also a political term and, as such, remains connected to "enemy". Hence, it is not important whether a political theory accentuates the "friend" or the "enemy". The criticism that Schmitt's anthropology is incomplete is rejected. As the classic authors have shown, it is sufficient that a political theory appreciates the value of experience. Experience confirms, however, the existence of danger and evil in human nature. Nevertheless, danger and evil may not be regarded as identical; political theory and' theology must remain separate. In conclusion, the author rebuffs the allegation that Schmitt was interested in the destruction of the Weimar Republic.<br>

Author(s): Carlson Thomas A.<br>
Abstract: En explorant plus avant le projet des ouvrages théologiques précédents, Au lieu de soi ne distingue pas simplement la pensée de la création de l'onto-théologie mais la sépare aussi de son dépassement heideggérien, qui demeure pour Marion aussi idolâtrique que la métaphysique elle-même. L'ouvrage se concentre ici autour de l'interprétation de l'adonné comme créature par excellence, ou créature iconique — dont le privilège tient à sa temporalité et à sa mutabilité. Indispensable à l'interprétation de saint Augustin comme penseur non métaphysique, l'analyse de la temporalité de l'homme iconique, en démontrant la manière dont la pensée de la création reste hors de l'ontothéologie et de la causa et de l'ego, suggère en même temps que saint Augustin n'affirme le devenir de l'homme qu'en lui enlevant toute innocence et, corrélativement, ne trouve pas de bonheur véritable dans l'amour du mortel comme tel. Extending the project of his prior theological works, Au lieu de soi distinguishes the thought of creation not only from onto-theology but also from its Heideggerian overcoming, which remains for Marion as idolatrous as metaphysics itself Along these lines, the work turns on the interpretation of the adonné as creature par excellence, or as an iconic creature - whose privilege stems from its temporality and mutability. Indispensable to the interpretation of Saint Augustine as non-metaphysical thinker, the analysis of iconic man's temporality, while demonstrating rigorously the way in which the thought of creation remains beyond the onto-theology both of the causa and of the ego, suggests at the same time that Augustine affirms the becoming of man only in depriving it of all innocence and, correlatively, finds no true happiness in love of the mortal as such.<br>

Author(s): Falque Emmanuel<br>
Abstract: Au lieu de soi marque un Haut Lieu du soi. Dans cette perspective, la hauteur du sujet s'acquiert par la verticalité (transcendance), et non pas uniquement par l'horizontalité (immanence). Interrogeant l'ambition d'une approche de saint Augustin du point de vue de saint Augustin lui-même, on montrera d'abord le mérite d'un tel renouvellement dans le cadre de la philosophie comme telle : la question de l'homme, le poids du soi, et le statut de l'èros. Une noble « disputatio théologique et phénoménologique » cependant naîtra dans la confrontation avec d'autres ouvrages (en particulier Dieu, la chair et l'autre. D'Irénée à Duns Scot [PUF, « Épiméthée » , 2008]) : doit-on nécessairement « dépasser » la métaphysique dans un tiers ordre, ou ne convient-il pas plutôt de la « transformer de l'intérieur » dans le geste que semble avoir accompli le Docteur d'Hippone lui-même ? Il en va ici du statut de la philosophie dans son rapport ci la métaphysique et à la théologie, mais aussi de la possibilité d'une « nouvelle pratique phénoménologique de la philosophie médiévale », pour aujourd'hui comme pour demain. In Place of the Self marks what we might call a « high point of the self ». From this exalted perspective the measure of the subject is taken in its verticality (transcendence) and not simply its horizontality (immanence). Jean-Luc Marion approaches St. Augustine from the point of view of St. Augustine himself, and in this article I show first the merit of such an approach within a philosophical framework, its relevance to topics such as the question of man, the burden of the self and the status of eros. A significant « theological and phenomenological disputatio » does, however, arise when In Place of the Self is put up against other works (in particular against God, the Flesh and the Other : from Irenaeus to Duns Scotus [PUF, « Épiméthée » , 2008]). Do we have to « overcome » metaphysics by moving to another order of analysis ? Is it not better to work from the inside, i~<br>

Abstract: L'article distingue trois périodes, dans le XXe siecle théologique français: 1893-1943 où l'on est préoccupé de la crise moderniste; 1945-1965 où toutes sortes de renouveaux preparent Vatican II; de 1965 à nos jours, où se fait la réception du Concile en même temps qu'apparaissent de nouveaux défis. Après avoir ajouté aux noms des théologiens les plus connus quelques autres qui méritent attention, il decrit ce qui permet de dire qu'il n'y a pas seulement au XXe siècle des théologiens français, mais une théologie frangaise, essentiellement soucieuse du rapport entre foi et culture. This paper distinguishes three periods of French theology in the Twentieth Century: 1893-1943, when the major concern is the crisis of Modernism; 1945-1965, when a variety of reforms are preparing for Vatican II; and from 1965 till the present day, as the reception of the Council meets new challenges. After supplementing the names of the best-known theologians with some others who deserve attention, the paper proposes that in the Twentieth Century, there are not only French theologians, but in fact a French theology, that is deeply concerned with the relationship between faith and culture.<br>

Publisher: L'école biblique et archéologique française<br>
Issue: i40170775<br>
Date: 1 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Beauchamp Paul<br>
Abstract: Avec quelques ouvertures nouvelles en direction des sciences humaines, et dans la ligne d'ouvrages publiés par l'auteur, surtout L'Un et l'Autre Testament, vol. 1 (1977), vol. 2 (1990) et Le Récit, la Lettre et le Corps (1982), l'accomplissement des Écritures, comme plénitude de l'acte du Christ, est proposé comme fondation d'une théologie, qui ne peut pas ne pas être biblique. Le chemin consiste à chercher la vérité anthropologique de l'accomplissement dans les dimensions humaines de la Parole et du Corps, vécues dans l'échange narratif. Le lieu de cet échange est la figure des noces à ses niveaux divers de réalisation, individuelle, sociale, historique. With some new pointers taken from anthropology and prolonging the inspiration of works previously published by the author (in particular: L'Un el l'Autre Testament, vol. 1, 1977; vol. 2, 1990 and Le Récit, la Lettre et le Corps, 1982), we here find the proposition that the fulfilment of Scriptures, inasmuch as it is the culminating point of the work of Christ, could be the basis for a genuinely and unescapably biblical theology. The method consists in searching for the human anthenticity of fulfilment in the anthropological dimension of Speech and Body understood as life through tales exchanged. The crucial point of that exchange is marriage symbolism on its different levels of experience: personal, social and historical.<br>

Author(s): Kriner Tiffany Eberle<br>
Abstract: This essay redefines the task of the reader in light of Christian hope, unfolding how a theology of hope might ground literary criticism. The resulting approach to literature—hopeful reading—considers texts in light of their future becoming in the Kingdom of God. Rather than considering texts as purveyors of hope or possibility for a readers future, hopeful reading asks critics to non-instrumentally foreground the possibilities in a text's future. The essay explains Christian hope, shows how it might warrant and construct a literary critic's vocation, and offers several extended examples of contemporary critics who seem to be reading hopefully.<br>

Abstract: Se pretende exponer un acercamiento preliminar, mediante las figuras de Aristóteles y Tomás de Aquino, a la metodología que utiliza el crítico literario George Steiner en su lectura asidua de filosofia. Aquino es utilizado como contrapunto del filósofo griego en dos sentidos. Por un lado, se actualiza el potencial estético de su teología bajo el influjo, entre otros, de Gilson y Maritain; mientras que, por otro, el fundamento tomista de la epifania joyceana remite a una conexión entre el Doctor Angélico y Dante Alighieri. El alcance epistemológico de la imitación tomista y las condiciones del acto de la creación poética, incluyendo la relación entre potencia y acto y la procesión entre no-ser y ser, hacen difïcil definir adecuadamente los conceptos en Steiner. El «realismo» steineriano, asociado a su apuesta por la trascendencia del significado, debe ser repensado, desde su dimensión estética, en conflictiva sintonia con una postmodernidad considerada como época epilogal. A preliminary approach to George Steiner's methodology of reading philosophy is attempted through the figures of Aristotle and Thomas of Aquinas. Aquinas is used as the counterpoint of the Greek philosopher in a double way. On the one hand, the aesthetic force of his theology is raised under the influence of Gilson and Maritain, among others; on the other hand, the James Joyces's epiphany is referred to a connection between the Doctor Angelico and Dante Alighieri. The epistemological reach of thomistic imitation and the conditions of the act of the poetical creation, make the concepts in Steiner difficult to be defined accurately. The steinerian «realism», based on the wager on the transcendence of meaning, must be rethought aesthetically, as attuned to a postmodernist epoch of the epilogue.<br>

Abstract: Les Lumières européennes provoquent un double déplacement des coordonnées socio-culturelles dans lesquelles s'inscrit le christianisme : la critique rationnelle de la religion et la privatisation du croire induisent un processus de sécularisation auquel le christianisme doit réagir. Pour ce faire, le protestantisme développe une théorie du christianisme dont Kant, Schleiermacher et Hegel formulent les paradigmes. C'est au gré d'une reprise sélective de ces trois penseurs qu' au cours du XIXe et du XXe siècle le protestantisme allemand se positionnera au sein du monde moderne, s'efforçant d'identifier les sphères socio-culturelles lui permettant de faire valoir le thème où se jouent tant sa vérité théologique que sa pertinence socio-culturelle : la liberté. Ce cadre théorique permet d'expliciter ce qu'il en est de concepts souvent galvaudés : théologie libérale, Kulturprotestantismus, néo-protestantisme. The European enlightenment provoked a double displacement of the social and cultural components of Christianity : rationalist criticism of religion and the privatisation of belief led to a process of secularization to which Christianity had to react. To do so, Protestantism developed a theory of Christianity based on paradigms formulated by Kant, Schleiermacher and Hegel. It was through a selective return to these three thinkers that in the 19th and 20th centuries, German Protestantism took a position in the modern world, trying to identify those social and cultural spheres which would foster a theme essential to both its theological truth and its social-cultural pertinence : the theme of freedom. This theoretical framework allowed it to explain often tarnished concepts such as liberal theology, Kulturprotestantismus, neo-protestantism.<br>

Abstract: Certains travaux récents de Paul Ricœur montrent un déplacement d'accent : au lieu d'une interrogation sur la fragilité humaine comme dans la Philosophie de la volonté, Ricœur se préoccupe davantage aujourd'hui de la vie, de la natalité, du désir d'accomplissement. Cette dette aristotélicienne trahit-elle l'inspiration que le philosophe avait trouvée dans la tradition biblique ? Même si certains thèmes s'articulent de manière inédite, cet article souligne que la thèse reste inchangée : c'est bien le sujet qu'il faut parvenir à saisir, à la fois dans sa capacité et dans sa fragilité. La référence à Aristote invite alors à jeter un nouveau pont entre la philosophie et la théologie. Certain recent works of Paul Ricoeur show a transition: in the place of human frailty, as in the philosophy of will, Ricœur is more and more occupied today by life, birth, and the desire of accomplishment. Does this Aristotelian debt betray an inspiration that the philosopher had found in Biblical tradition? Even if certain themes are articulated in a new way, the article shows that the same thesis remains: it is still the subject which one must grasp, both in its capacity as in its frailty. So the reference to Aristotle is an invitation to see a new bridge between philosophy and theology.<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'attèle à montrer comment les notions principales de l'herméneutique de Ricœur (monde du texte/monde du lecteur, distanciation – appropriation, compréhension de soi trois mimèsis) ont permis de penser de façon systématique la question du statut du texte biblique et de sa traduction dans un mémoire de licence de la Faculté de théologie de Neuchâtel, réalisé en 2006. Après une présentation du mémoire et de son contexte, les apports de la pensée de Ricœur sont énumérés en quatre points : la théorie de la traduction, la notion de lecture non utilisatrice, la notion de canon et celle de «texte inspiré». This article sets out to show how the principal notions of Ricoeur's hermeneutics (the textual world/the reader's world, distantiation - appropriation, self-comprehension, three mimesis) made possible a systematic exposition of the question of the status of biblical text and its translation in a licentiate thesis at the Faculty of Theology of Neuchâtel, in 2006. Once the thesis and its context are presented, the contributions of Ricoeur's ideas are enumerated in four points: translation theory, the notions of nonuser readings, of canonicity, and of «inspired text».<br>

Abstract: Suite à une question initiale du théologien catholique Adrian Holderegger, l'auteur s'interroge sur la question du rôle de la raison en théologie et en éthique théologique. Il présente et discute la critique de la raison sourde proposée par Maurice Bellet. Les relations entre la rationalité athétique, athématique et amodale conduisent à se demander si une conception négative et critique de la rationalité ne serait pas la condition d'un redéploiement positif de la raison de l'être humain singulier comme capacité d'écoute attentive de l'autre, du monde et de Dieu. Following up an initial question raised by the Catholic theologian Adrian Holderegger, the author questions the role of reason in theology and in theological ethics. He presents and discusses the critique of blind reason proposed by Maurice Bellet. The interactions between a-thetic, a-thematic and a-modal rationality leads one to wonder if a negative and critical conception of rationality might not be the condition for a positive redeployment of a single human beings reason as capacity for attentive listening to others, to the world and to God.<br>

Abstract: En réponse aux questions de Philippe Cardon, et indépendamment de remarques de détail, brièvement discutées, l'auteur se réjouit de se voir décerner un certificat de non barthisme. Il s'étonne par contre de la grande naïveté de Philippe Cardon, dont le projet théologique lui semble s'apparenter à un retour massif à Barth, traité de manière littérale et orthodoxe. L'auteur demeure attaché, au contraire, à une reconstruction critique non seulement de la pensée de Barth, mais de l'ensemble de la théologie contemporaine, d'où quelques observations sur les débats actuels au sujet de l'avenir de la théologie académique. Responding to Philippe Cardon, and apart from some detailed remarks briefly discussed, the author is happy to be discerned a certificate of non-Barthianism. However, the great naivety of Philippe Cordon, whose theological project seems like a massive return to Barth, literal and orthodox, surprises him. On the contrary, the author remains attached to a critical reconstruction not only to the thought of Barth, but to the whole of contemporary theology, whence some observations on current debates about the future of academic theology.<br>

Abstract: Comme son sous-titre l'indique, cet article a pour but de développer un contrepoint au livre de Pierre Gisel qui fait l'objet du débat présenté dans ce numéro. En dialogue critique avec cet ouvrage, il tente de formuler une autre manière de concevoir la théologie aujourd'hui. Après avoir explicité les conditions et la base d'accord de ce dialogue, il reprend successivement la question de la définition de la théologie, le problème des rapports entre théologie et sciences des religions et les difficultés liées à la relecture des héritages, pour se terminer par une évaluation globale du projet de Pierre Gisel. As indicated by its sub-title, this article develops an objection to the book of Pierre Gisel, subject of the debate in the present edition. In critical dialogue, it tries to formulate a different way of conceiving theology today. After exposing the conditions and basis for agreement in this debate, it takes up in succession the question of the definition of theology, the problem of the relationships between theology and the science of religions and the difficulties linked to the re-reading of traditions, finishing with a global evaluation of the project of Pierre Gisel.<br>

Abstract: L'épreuve du doute est condition fondamentale du travail du théologien. Mais elle est également condition fondamentale de l'existence des croyantes et croyants. Partant de cette double hypothèse, l'article se donne pour but d'explorer la fécondité du doute, en travaillant pour ce faire sur les deux plans de la théologie et de la foi dont la théologie entreprend de rendre compte. S'inspirant de quelques modèles issus d'époques diverses de l'histoire des idées, l'auteur tente de mettre en lumière la contribution fertile du doute dans le travail théologique en tant que tâche actuelle. Putting doubt to the test is a fundamental condition of the theologian's job. But it is also a fundamental condition in the life of believers. On this double premise, the article tries to explore the fecundity of doubt both in theology and in the domain of faith, of which the task of theology is to render account. Inspired by models from diverse eras in the history of ideas, the author throws light on the fertile contribution of doubt to modern theology.<br>

Author(s): Chalamet Christophe<br>
Abstract: Dans cette leçon inaugurale, l'auteur se penche sur l'Évangile, compris au sens large de «promesse», comme objet et comme source de subversion. Deux textes bibliques illustrent chacun de ces deux aspects : le livre de Job et la parabole matthéenne des ouvriers de la onzième heure (Mt 20, 1-16). Une troisième et dernière partie porte sur la relation entre révélation et mystère. Le style oral a été en partie conservé. In this inaugural lecture, delivered on September 24, 2012 at the Faculty of Theology of the University of Geneva, the author develops the theme of the Gospel — understood broadly as «promise» — as both the object and subject of subversion. Two biblical texts are taken as illustrations of these two aspects: the book of Job and Matthew's parable of the vineyard workers of the eleventh hour (Mt 20:1-16). A third and final part focuses on the relation between revelation and mystery. The original style of the lecture has been partly maintained.<br>

Abstract: Ritual studies is a new discipline within the field of the study of religion. Liturgical theology is, in the West, a recent development within the Held of systematic theology. The article describes each and indicates ways in which they may contribute to the work of the other while retaining their separate identities. The development of methods for describing and analyzing ritual action may enable liturgical theology to construct its own analyses upon a more broadly phenomenological base. At the same time theology's insight into the history of liturgical action may enable ritual studies to overcome an excessively synchronie perspective and to attend to the normative character of ritual gesture.<br>

Abstract: L'article étudie les modifications successives et conjointes des arguments de convenance et des structures du traité de l'Incarnation au long de l'itinéraire de S. Thomas. Il se propose de contester l'habitude de réduire la place du Christ dans la Somme Théologique à la simple causalité rédemptrice. Une lecture attentive de la première question de la Tertia pars de la Somme Théologique établit que l'opposition habituelle entre Incarnation et Rédemption se trouve dépassée dans la découverte du mystère pascal de Jésus comme la manifestation et la réalité de Dieu toujours plus grand. La Christologie est alors tout autre chose qu'un appendice : la consummatio totius theologici negotii, clef de voûte et principe de toute la théologie. The article studies the successive and conjunct modifications of the arguments of convenance and the structures the treatise on the Incarnation throughout St. Thomas' itinerary. It is proposed to contest the habit of reducing the place of Christ in the Summa Theologica to a simple redemptive causality. An attentive reading of the first question of the Tertia Pars of the Summa Theologica establishes that the habitual opposition between Incarnation and Redemption is found to be surpassed in the discovery of the Pascal Mystery of Jesus as the manifestation and reality of the always greater God. The Christology is then quite other than a mere appendix: the consummatio totius theologici negotii, keystone and principle of all theology.<br>

Abstract: L'affirmation selon laquelle le mariage chrétien est le signe efficace de l'union du Christ et de l'Église est une donnée de la Tradition. Elle n'en soulève pas moins, au regard des sciences humaines (ethnologie, psychanalyse), de la philosophie, de la théologie enfin, un certain nombre de difficultés théoriques dont plusieurs sont examinées ici. L'effort ensuite tenté pour les lever aboutit à une présentation nouvelle de la sacramentanté du mariage. Le couple uni et fécond aurait à prophétiser la réconciliation des sexes et des générations. Ainsi témoignerait-il, dans l'Esprit, de ce qui est déjà et qui sera, mieux encore: de Celui qui est et vient: Dieu tout en tous. L'étude se termine en évoquant les pratiques externes et internes du couple qui dérivent logiquement de cette prophétie. Asserting that Christian marriage is an effectual sign of Christ's union with the Church is a datum of the Tradition. It nevertheless raises, as far as human sciences (ethnology, psychoanalysis), philosophy and in fine theology are concerned, a certain number of theoretical difficulties, several of which are here examined. The subsequent effort to overcome them leads to a new presentation of the sacramental character of marriage. The united and fruitful couple should prophecies the reconciliation of sexes and generations. Thus would it testify in the Spirit, what already is and shall be, better still: from Him who is and comes, God, the whole power in all men. The essay is concluded by evoking the external and internal experiences of the couple logically resulting from this prophecy.<br>

Abstract: Appliquée au monothéisme trinitaire, cette étude de théologie spéculative se donne un double fondement Elle reçoit la relation de réciprocité entre Jésus-Christ et l'Esprii Saint, telle qu'elle est élaborée par diverses théologies contemporaines de la Révélation et du Salut Elle confirme une autre relation de réciprocité, entre une vérité de manifestation et une vérité de communication, telle qu'elle a pu être éprouvée à travers une réflexion conduite précédemment sur le langage. De cet entrecroisement suit la détermination de l'Esprii comme le Don incréé-indicible, et du Christ comme l'Icône-Parole incréée. Recueillant le Discours du Calvaire et la Parole de Pâques le dédoublement du nom christologique contribue à distinguer la médiation divine du milieu divin. Si la réciprocité du Christ et de l'Esprit rapporte ainsi le Mystère de Dieu à l'unité du Père et de la Révélation, il conviendra de revenir sur les anciens concepts de relation et d'origine, l'un et l'autre étant désormais respectivement accordés à la communication et à la manifestation. Applied to trinitarian monotheism, this study of speculative theology is based on a double foundation. It takes the relationship of reciprocity between Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit as elaborated by various contemporary theologies of revelation and salvation. It confirms another reciprocal relationship, that which exists between a truth of manifestation and a truth of communication as it has been previously established through a reflection on language. From this it follows that the Holy Spirit is the inexpressible, uncreated Gift while Christ is the uncreated Word-Image. Combining the discourse of Calvary and the Message of Easter, the double christological name helps to distinguish the divine mediation from the divine milieu. If the reciprocity of Christ and the Spirit thus relate the mystery of God to the unity of the Father and revelation, then it would be fitting to go back to the ancient concepts of relation and ori~<br>

Abstract: A quelles conditions la théologie peut-elle se fonder comme théologie interprétative selon le vœu de Claude Geffré (La théologie au risque de l'interprétation) et d'Eberhard, Jüngel (Dieu mystère du monde) ? Réponse: elle doit demander concepts et méthode à une philosophie de l'interprétation. Pour surmonter la « crise de la métaphysique » (Nietzsche, Heidegger) ; ensuite pour fixer les principes de l'interprétation, garantissant l'historicité, la transcendance personnalisée et l'Amour de Dieu. Si une herméneutique (de Dilthey à Gadamer et à Ricœur) n'y suffit point, l'A. renvoie à sa proposition philosophique de « l'Inlégralisme » (cf. J. Granier, Le discours du monde), avec sa théorie de l'Intégral et du transréel, son analytique de la praxis sociale et son anthropologie « égotiste ». Under what kind of conditions can a theology be founded as an interpretative one, as suggested by Claude Geffré (La Théologie au risque de l'interprétation) and Eberhard Jüngel (Dieu mystère du monde) ? Answer: it is obliged to demand concepts and method from a philosophy of the interpretation. In order to overcome the "crisis of metaphysics" (Nietzsche, Heidegger) ; in order to determine the principles of the interpretation, which are able to guarantee the historicity, the personalized transcendency and the Love of God. If a hermeneutics (from Dilthey to Gadamer and Ricœur) is not enough, the author refers to his philosophical proposition of "integralism" (cf. J. Granier, Le discours du mondes), with its theory of the Integral and of Transreal, its analytics of the social praxis and its "egotistic" anthropology.<br>

Abstract: Cette Note présente l'ouvrage de Christian Duquoc, intitulé L'unique Christ. La symphonie différée, en en suivant le déroulement et en se montrant particulièrement attentif à son apport christologique. L'approche ne se limite pas à la question de la médiation unique du Christ. Elle aborde aussi le rapport du Christ à l'histoire et au cosmos, le sens de la mission de l'Église, sa relation au judaïsme, la signification du salut et la façon de l'envisager dans le cadre d'une pluralité des religions. Au long de sa présentation, l'auteur de cette Note montre que la théologie développée dans cet ouvrage se trouvait déjà largement amorcée dans les précédents travaux de Duquoc. This Note introduces the work of Christian Duquoc, entitled L'unique Christ. La symphonie différée, surveying its development and paying particular attention to its Christological contribution. Its approach is not limited to the question of Christ's unique mediation. It takes up as well Christ's relation to history and to the cosmos, the meaning of the Church's mission, its relation to Judaism, its signification of salvation, and the way of envisaging it within the setting of a plurality of religions. During the course of his presentation, the author of this Note shows that the theology developed in this work was largely initiated in Duquoc's earlier works.<br>

Issue: i40185029<br>
Date: 6 1, 2005<br>

Abstract: Alors que le Quatrième Évangile rapportait dialogues et symboles à la communication de la Révélation, la théologie contemporaine les renvoie souvent à une altérité constitutive de toute éthique. Partant de cet écart, irréductible à un simple renversement, l'article cherche à montrer comment le dialogisme et le symbolisme, grâce à leur dissemblance, demeurent aussi essentiels l'un que l'autre à l'accueil de l'Évangile, de la Révélation, du Salut. L'identification du croyant passe aussi bien par un dialogue né d'une séparation que par un symbole ordonné à un rassemblement. Pour parvenir à cette conclusion, l'article doit d'abord définir les conditions requises pour que chacune des deux formations signifiantes ouvre à la fois à un monde et à une communauté : un être et un agir nouveaux. While the Fourth Gospel draws upon dialogues and symbols for the communication of revelation, contemporary theology often relegates them to an otherness constitutive of any ethic. Beginning with this rupture, irreducible to a simple reversal, this paper seeks to show how dialogue and symbolism, thanks to their dissimilarity, remain so essential to each other for the reception of the Gospel, of revelation, of salvation. The identification of the believer passes just as well through a dialogue born of a separation as by a symbol ordered to a gathering. In order to arrive at this conclusion, this paper assumes the task of defining the conditions necessary for each of the two significant formations to open upon a world and a community: a new being and act.<br>

Abstract: Il existe entre ces deux « hommes de l'Église » une multitude d'affinités. Leurs pensées respectives sont dans cette étude mise en regard d'un phénomène qui révèle, par contraste, leur accord intime : le « modernisme ». Les paradoxes du visible et de l'invisible, de la conscience et du dogme, de l'Église et de l'universalité salutaire, de la philosophie enfin par rapport à la théologie sont tour à tour évoqués. En puisant largement dans les œuvres de ces deux maîtres, l'A. entend montrer comment elles donnent accès au Mystère révélé. Si le « modernisme » n'est plus aujourd'hui un drame d'actualité, si le style et parfois le langage de ces deux penseurs n'est plus le nôtre, leur lucidité spirituelle, elle, nous est plus nécessaire que jamais. Between these two "men of the Church" there are many affinities. In the present article their respective ideas are considered in the light of a phenomenon which reveals, by contrast, their intimate accord: "modernism". The paradoxes of the visible and the invisible, of conscience and dogma, of the Church and the universality of salvation, and finally of philosophy in its relationship to theology, are evoked one after the other. By digging widely into the works of these two masters, the author shows how they open the way to the revealed Mystery. If "modernism" is no longer today a contemporary line of thought, and if the style and, at times, the language of these two thinkers are no longer ours, even so their spiritual lucidity is more necessary to us than ever.<br>

Abstract: Cet article passe en revue les ouvrages suivants du neurobiologiste Jean-Pierre Changeux : L'homme neuronal, 1983, Raison et plaisir, 1982, Ce qui nous fait penser (un dialogue avec Paul Ricœur), 1998, L'homme de vérité, 2002. L'auteur y montre les changements dans les thèses de Changeux en les accompagnant de ses commentaires philosophiques et théologiques aussi bien critiques que constructifs. L'homme, ses origines et sa structure, le cerveau humain, la conscience de soi, la matière et sa complexité évolutive, la sensibilité artistique, la morale, la religion, la question d'une lecture intégrale de Darwin et de Spinoza, la signification du discours sur « l'homme de vérité » sont les principaux sujets traités. Le but de l'article est un dialogue interdisciplinaire entre neurosciences et théologie sur la compréhension de l'être humain. This article passes in revue the following works of the neurobiologist J.-P. Changeux : L'homme neuronal, 1983, Raison et plaisir, 1982, Ce qui nous fait penser (a dialogue with Paul Ricœur), 1998, and L'homme de vérité, 2002. The author shows the changes in Changeux's theses, accompanying them with his philosophical and theological commentaries, critical as well as constructive. Man, his origins and structure, the human brain, self consciousness, matter and its progressive complexity, artistic sensibility, morality, religion, the question of an integral reading of Darwin and Spinoza, and the significance of discourse upon « L'homme de vérité » are the principal subjects treated. The goal of the article is an interdisciplinary dialogue between the neurosciences and theology about the understanding of the human being.<br>

Article Title: Milton's God and the Matter of Chaos<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219828<br>
Date: 10 1, 1965<br>
Author(s): Watkins John<br>
Abstract: Milton scholarship has long regarded chaos in Paradise Lost as hostile to God and creation. This judgment identifies Milton with traditional Western attitudes toward matter and material disorder-evident as early as the Babylonian creation epic, the Enuma elish. In contrast to such attitudes, modern science conceives of chaos as dynamically productive of order, and postmodern cultural studies sees chaos as a relevant principle of ironic indeterminacy. Milton anticipates the postmodern endorsement of chaos in his theology of matter and in the symbolic reflections and allegorical representations of chaos in Paradise Lost. Appreciation of chaotic disorder and of indeterminacy and disapproval of the tyrannical suppression of these qualities distinguish Milton's idiosyncratic theology, political theory, and aesthetics. Even Milton's God contains the potency of chaotic matter, a womblike virtue essential to God's creative power.<br>

Abstract: I am indebted for this distinction to colleagues at St Paul’s Limuru, Kenya, who offer an MA in Community Care and HIV/AIDS which delivers actual care and training of carers as an intrinsic part of the qualification. The terms were used by a visiting party from Cote d’Ivoire who were comparing their own theology curriculum with that of the SPL MA which is premised on theology being expressive response to the world as it is held before God. OCMS led the design of this MA.<br>

Journal Title: Comparative Literature Studies<br>
Article Title: Poetry Is Theft<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: According to the arguments put forward by Perloff, Dworkin, Goldsmith, and Reed, the recontextualization of language is a marker of “taste” or aesthetic judgment, and therefore a sign of genius. Perloff writes, “
      According to taste: it is important to remember that the citational or appropriative text, however unoriginal its actual words and phrases, is always the product of choice—and hence of individual taste.”
            In this interpretation, the appropriation of language becomes the reassertion of individuality and authority. Goldsmith terms this “self-expression,” “emotion,” and “authorship” in24
         Uncreative Writing. Perloff argues, “If the new ‘conceptual’ poetry makes no claim to originality—at least not originality in the usual sense—this is not to say thatgeniusisn't in play. It just takes different forms.”
            The rhetoric of Perloff and Goldsmith's claims is fascinating. Viewing the recontextualization of language as a marker of “taste” or aesthetic judgment is a hoary basis for authority. Attributing the act of recontextualizing to “genius” reinforces the fetish of authenticity that reigns in late capitalist society25
         
            and is a clear manifestation of the metaphysics of origin.26
         
            By “metaphysics of origin,” I refer to the central epistemic issue that creates a theology of “the new, the creative, the true” in the West, following Françoise Meltzer's analysis in27
         Hot Property: The Stakes and Claims of Literary Originality. Meltzer shows that the idea of literary originality functions within an economy of displacement: that is, the idea of “origin” itself is continually displaced so as “to clothe its status as invention, or myth.”
            Said has identified a similar phenomenon that he calls the “imperative connection” between the idea of a beginning and the “aboriginal human need to point to or locate a beginning.”28

Journal Title: Journal of Africana Religions<br>
Article Title: What Is Africa to Me?<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jafrireli.1.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 2013<br>
Abstract: At this juncture I should like to revisit the 1971 article that first involved me in the religious meaning of diasporic religions.
         
               In this article I gave prominence to the meaning of Africa in African American religions. It should be noted that I did not equate religion with theology. As a matter of fact, one of my major aims was to make this distinction. I felt that the discourse of black theology might actually prevent serious consideration of the wider range of meaning in religion as a form of life, thought, and action. It was not my intention in this article to give a full-blown description of any African American religion. I wanted to provide the basis for these religions as the temporal/spatial template for an alternate discourse and epistemology in the modern world. From this point of view, my position seems close to that of V. Y. Mudimbe's characterization of gnosis.31<br>

Article Title: Ethics and Religion in Continental Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Interestingly, we have reached a curious state of déjà vu. If SPEP was very much the work of John Wild, and if Wild followed a trajectory from realism to phenomenology, we are today seeing a movement in reverse, from phenomenology back to realism. Furthermore the later theological turn, almost predictable from the implicit theological beginnings of Continental philosophy, has occasioned a turn toward an antireligion, toward a new atheism, a new modernism, and a new materialism, reminiscent of the debates about scientific realism when Wilfrid Sellars presented his views on the manifest image and the scientific image in the early years of SPEP. The new movement has gathered around Quentin Meillassoux's
            After Finitude.
                  Meillassoux, a student of Badiou's, makes two charges. First is “correlationism”: Continental philosophy from Kant to the present is inherently subjectivistic and antirealist and makes nonsense of modern science (the premise that provoked the Alan Sokal ruse).26
               
                  The villain of the piece is Kant's perversion of the Copernican Revolution, wherein Kant reinstated the very anthropocentrism destroyed by Copernicus. Second is “fideism”: when Kant said that he found it necessary to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith, he laid the ground for the theological turn. He invented the God of the gaps. He turned philosophy into a kind of apologetics that delimits the natural sciences and leaves the barn door wide open, through which theology makes an easy escape. Phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction are just so many versions of Kantian idealism under another name, constituting the dark damp soil in which the poisonous mushrooms of theology take root. If the theological turn is where Continental philosophy leads us, the young critics seem to say, that is the last straw, its reductio ad absurdum!27<br>

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: In support of this conjecture, Janicaud takes up Ricoeur's image of the “grafting” of hermeneutics onto phenomenology. This image suggests that their connection is like a patch of skin that covers over a wound that has opened up on the body. By analogy, it would seem that phenomenology opens onto certain limit experiences that stand beyond the limits of what is given in intuition. It is at that point that hermeneutics enters the scene and takes up the task of covering over this opening. But what motivates this desire to graft these two separate discourses together in the first place? Why should one try to form them into a cohesive, unified whole? Janicaud suspects that this is the result of a subtle attempt to reinscribe the ontotheological structure of traditional (think Kantian) metaphysics. On such a view, phenomenology would take the place traditionally held by ontology, while hermeneutics would take over the traditional role of theology.
         
               The fundamental problem here, for Janicaud, is that this paints an all too hierarchical, neat, and unified picture of the relation between these two projects—a picture that is based on deep assumptions about a unified meaning that would undergird them.8

Journal Title: Philosophy & Rhetoric<br>
Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: There are several contemporary theorists who explore and offer significant insight into hyperbole, but they do not fully identify its specific rhetorical functions. They each offer important characteristics of hyperbole but do not demarcate both its global purpose and its figural limits. In this article, I have outlined two specific functions of hyperbole, and I have shown how they operate within discourse. I have also identified the metafunction of hyperbole and revealed that it may operate as a figure of thought beyond its traditional tropological limits. I have not abandoned these limitations but expanded on them by grounding hyperbole as a mode of thought within its specific stylistic formations. As such, hyperbole can be used to delve into the complexities and paradoxes of ethics and theo-philosophical argumentation—the intricacies of negative theology and ascetical theology, the problematic role of subjectivity, and the difficulty of representation. It can also be used discursively to read various philosophical texts—those of Friedrich Nietzsche, Slavoj Zizek, Søren Kierkegaard, Emmanuel Levinas, and Michel Foucault, for example—in ways other than they are typically read or to explicate concepts such as the “event,” the “spectacular,”
