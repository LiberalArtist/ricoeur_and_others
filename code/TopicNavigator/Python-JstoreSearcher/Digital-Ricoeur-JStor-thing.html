  Securing a Vibrant Democracy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt16wd0hf">Invoking the Invisible Hand</a><br>
  Abstract: In a press conference two days after his election to a second term, President Bush assessed the import of his victory: “I earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it.” President Bush interpreted the election results as a clear expression of public opinion. Through their votes, citizens indicated their support for his policy agenda: “After hundreds of speeches and three debates and interviews and the whole process, where you keep basically saying the same thing over and over again, that—when you win, there is a feeling that the people have spoken and embraced<br>

  What Is Rhetoric?<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1d10hh7">Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy</a><br>
  Author(s) Utley Ebony A.<br>
  Abstract: Of all the lessons I have learned from Kenneth Burke, none is more valuable than what he shows and tells about irony. For Burke, irony is not simply a strategy that allows us to say one thing when we mean something else. Instead, irony becomes a point of coalescence between strategy and substance—a way of talking and thinking that simultaneously constructs, engages, and alters our encounters in the social world. Among other things, Burkean irony suggests a way for us to teach rhetoric rhetorically, and that is the issue I want to explore in this paper.<br>

  Author(s) Alison James<br>
  Abstract: When the term
                  sacrificeis used to designate practices common to various world religions and used to designate a historical scapegoat at the founding of a social order, are we referring to the same thing? Perhaps not. Th e sacrifi ce of which the Girard school speaks applies to any social order—whether a political order, an ideological organization, a social movement, or such—not merely to an established religious tradition.¹ So, let us pose the question: What is the value of Girardian theory? Is it to illuminate the religious concept of sacrifice or to illuminate human nature in general?<br>

  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: The realist is right about one thing: Much of the time, international politics boils down to strategy. The calculation of advantage in the game of nations is the first condition, the final necessity, and—not to be underestimated—the continuing attraction for those who presume to be players. Therefore, it is not enough for post-realists to articulate a broader conception of scientific inquiry; if we are to move beyond realism, we shall have to provide decision makers with better instruments for strategic analysis. It may seem that these two objectives are mutually contradictory. For example, the post-realist perspective exemplifies the<br>

  Book Title: Christianity and the Mass Media in America-Toward a Democratic Accommodation<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schultze Quentin J.<br>
  Abstract: The mass media and religious groups in America regularly argue about news bias, sex and violence on television, movie censorship, advertiser boycotts, broadcast and film content rating systems, government regulation of the media, the role of mass evangelism in a democracy, and many other issues. In the United States the major disputes between religion and the media usually have involved Christian churches or parachurch ministries, on the one hand, and the so-called secular media, on the other. Often the Christian Right locks horns with supposedly liberal Eastern media elite and Hollywood entertainment companies. When a major Protestant denomination calls for an economic boycott of Disney, the resulting news reports suggest business as usual in the tensions between faith groups and media empires.Schultze demonstrates how religion and the media in America have borrowed each other's rhetoric. In the process, they have also helped to keep each other honest, pointing out respective foibles and pretensions. Christian media have offered the public as well as religious tribes some of the best media criticism- better than most of the media criticism produced by mainstream media themselves. Meanwhile, mainstream media have rightly taken particular churches to task for misdeeds as well as offered some surprisingly good depictions of religious life.The tension between Christian groups and the media in America ultimately is a good thing that can serve the interest of democratic life. As Alexis de Tocqueville discovered in the 1830s, American Christianity can foster the "habits of the heart" that ward off the antisocial acids of radical individualism. And, as John Dewey argued a century later, the media offer some of our best hopes for maintaining a public life in the face of the religious tribalism that can erode democracy from within. Mainstream media and Christianity will always be at odds in a democracy. That is exactly the way it should be for the good of each one.<br>

  Abstract: As does his very different contemporary Goethe, Blake appears today as one of the first of the new poets to revive in his own work a more-than-literary role as (ʺvisionaryʺ) shaper-of-the-real. (See Vico, above, p. 4.) Of the prevalence of such a mythopoetic mode in a larger human history, he wrote: ʺThe antiquities of every Nation under Heaven, is no less sacred than that of the Jews.

In January 1302 Dante was sentenced in absentia by the Florentine

  Abstract: Those of us who are troubled by the confusion in contemporary education, perhaps especially if we continue to believe in a liberal or general education, are sometimes tempted to look to the past for guidance. But the lessons of history are rarely unambiguous. For one thing, its messages are various. Like Scripture, it can generally be made to support what we want it to support; and in the case of education, the Western cultural tradition incorporates not just one but a whole scries of educational ideals, which rest on quite different assumptions and point in different directions.

  Abstract: I would first like briefly to justify the theme I have chosen, namely: “from word to concept.” The subject matter is a topic belonging both to philosophy and to hermeneutics. In truth, concepts are really one of the distinguishing marks of philosophy. Indeed, philosophy first entered Western culture in this form. For this reason the concept is the first thing I would like to discuss. Of one thing I am sure: the concept, which very often presents itself as something strange and demanding, must begin to speak if it is to be really grasped. For this reason I would first<br>

  Abstract: I WAS TOLD THAT BEING an apostolic is a “full-time thing.” Th is saying picks up on the commitment Shimmer highlighted in his conversion narrative: one cannot be half Christian and half outside. An apostolic should maintain his or her commitment at all times and in all places. The language of commitment is indeed a common feature of the apostolics’ discourse (if not always practice). One of their worries, for example, is the “Sunday Christian”—someone who seems to forget what the Word entails during the rest of the week. The concept of mutemo plays a crucial role in the<br>

  Abstract: One of the most significant lessons of the literary criticism of the last few decades has been that the currently accepted meaning of any text is a product of the interpretive institutions and communities acting upon it. Fredric Jameson suggests that we never really encounter textual meaning “as a thing-in-itself. Rather, texts come before us as the alwaysalready-read; we apprehend them through sedimented layers of previous interpretations, or—if the text is brand-new—through the sedimented reading habits and categories developed by those inherited interpretive traditions.”¹ Stanley Fish further observes that some interpretations, for a variety of reasons, succeed so<br>

  Abstract: Today, the study of sexuality brings together scholars from a wide variety of disciplines – history, politics, literature, religion, the arts, psychology, anthropology, medicine, and biology. At its best, this interdisciplinary work promotes critical self-reflection on disciplinary assumptions about sexuality and the data used to test those assumptions: Is there such a thing as a fixed sexuality and how would one prove its existence? Such questions have arisen ever since the emergence of the concept of ‘sexuality’ at the end of the eighteenth century.

  Abstract: In the American elementary school activity called show-and-tell, children bring something interesting from home to show to their classmates. Attention focuses on the item shown, and the presence of the item serves as the point of departure for the child to speak about it. “This is Santa on a surfboard. It’s something my mom bought in Hawaii when she was a girl. Every Christmas, I get to hang it on our Christmas tree.” Telling can speak about many absent things, but it begins with something present: the shown thing.

  Abstract: Aristotle says that metaphor is ‘the application of a word that belongs to another thing: either from genus to species, species to genus, species to species, or by analogy’.¹ Studies of metaphors in specific texts – such as those considered in the present volume – are, on the whole, served well by the sort of definition Aristotle offers. But that Aristotelian definition, in presupposing that proper names belong to their objects, raises some awkward questions about naming and essence. And those questions become more threatening if the metaphors to be considered are found in fiction. Ken Dowden’s chapter raises the<br>

  Abstract: There is general agreement that the term

This very definition reveals the particular phenomenology of allegory, an artistic or poetic structure in which some “other thing” appears in the “thing appearing” without being the same thing. Allegory can be defined more specifically as “the appearance of one thing in another thing which it is not.” Traditionally understood as a structure of meaning, allegory has a limited range, and critics of this mode are correct that it can be a facile, if at times fascinating, signifying structure.<br>

The question is directed in the first instance at autobiography, as a question concerning its ability to go beyond the representation of the subject to write the encounter with the absolutely other for which Levinas’s ethical philosophy calls. But it is also, in the second instance, a question for Levinas, concerning the potential of autobiography to represent an alterity perhaps not fully accounted for by his philosophy.

Traditionally, a first philosophy provides the cornerstone on which the rest of a thinker’s philosophy is constructed either upward in the architectonics of systematic structures or outward in concentric circles extending from the initial pulse of inspiration at the epicenter. Jankélévitch is fond of citing Henri Bergson, who wrote that a philosopher of value has said only one thing and the rest of his life and work is dedicated to that single point.¹ Or more poignantly, Jankélévitch’s philosophy follows Bergson’s insight that there is “something simple, infinitely simple, so<br>

  Abstract: 1933–2003. Is it legitimate to turn once again to the question of Nazism seventy years after it took power? The answer, I believe, can only be yes: not just because forgetting Nazism would represent an unbearable offense for its victims but also because, despite an ever increasing body of literature, something about Nazism remains in the dark, something that touches us. What might it be? What links us invisibly to what we point to as the most tragic political catastrophe of our time, and perhaps of all time? My own sense is that this thing that both troubles and<br>

  Abstract: According to Aristotle’s
                  Metaphysics, the most distinctly unfunny thing about philosophy is the principle of noncontradiction. Indeed, we are encouraged as philosophers to respect this most serious and fundamental principle, namely, that “the same thing cannot at the same time and in the same respect both belong and not belong to the same object.”¹ Aristotle certainly refuses to take the matter lightly, providing eight different proofs and maintaining that the principle holds as a law with absolute psychological as well as ontological governance. With regard to the psychological application of the law, Aristotle insists that our thought and our actions<br>

Since the 1960s, when the use of the word “ludic” became popular in both Europe and the US to designate playful behavior and artifacts, playfulness has become increasingly a mainstream characteristic of modern and postmodern culture. In the first decade of the 21st century we can even speak of the global “ludification of culture” (Raessens 2006; 2014). Perhaps the first thing that comes to mind in this context is the immense popularity of computer games, which, as far as global sales are concerned, have already outstripped Hollywood movies.

  Abstract: One of the most prominent connections between Nietzsche’s thought and the entire phenomenological enterprise lies in Husserl’s founding postulate that the thing-in-itself is an invalid concept. Although Husserl never formulates it explicitly, the development of phenomenology demonstrates the root of this invalidity: the thing-in-itself is a contradiction insofar as a thing is, by definition and by essence, always an object of perception. This is also, of course, one of Nietzsche’s most explicit, best established, and most consistently repeated claims, and perhaps one that has the greater consequence within the overall economy of his thought.

  Abstract: The question here is no longer the much-exercised question of ‘what is cultural studies?’, but rather, ‘for what?’, ‘for whom?’, ‘in the name of what project?’, ‘what politics?’, what properties, orientations and affiliations does cultural studies have, should it have; what methods, aims, intentions; in what context does it see itself; etc.? Jeremy Gilbert thinks through the schema and the question of ‘Friends and Enemies: Which Side is Cultural Studies On?’, while Julian Wolfreys interrogates the manner in which it is too easy to forget the lessons of deconstruction, and to consider cultural studies ‘as if such a thing existed’.<br>

After all, particularly as it is practiced in the contemporary academy, politics or political science is a discipline famed for its “seriousness”; its social-science predictive ways; its focus on institutions, structures of power, and governance; and its avoidance of the messy stuff of culture, agency, and desire. Could anything be less oddball, less hospitable to the playfulness of hoaxers and hoarders, or the incongruity of dissected fish and Dixie cups?<br>

  Abstract: It may seem an odd thing to think and speak of the influence of Dietrich Bonhoeffer on Karl Barth. Born in 1886, Barth was a half-generation older than Bonhoeffer (born 1906). Bonhoeffer was only twelve years old when Barth published his theological epoch making
                  Romerbrief. Bonhoeffer studied Barth’s work and was influenced by him as a student, such that hisHabilitationsschrift, Act and Being, was written in large part in dialogue with Karl Barth’s work. Even though this work contains critical elements,¹ this criticism should be seen within a shared discourse—a discourse established by Barth into which Bonhoeffer enters.<br>

  Abstract: Incarnation, in the first place, refers to the condition of a being who possesses a body or, more precisely, a flesh. Are the body and the flesh thus the same thing? Like every fundamental question, the question of the body—or of the flesh—points back to a phenomenological foundation on the basis of which it can be elucidated. A phenomenological foundation should be understood as a pure appearing that is presupposed by everything else that appears to us.

  Abstract: Describing feelings is a notoriously difficult thing to do. The problem is enhanced when those who do so use a language that is not their vernacular, and even more so when that language is part of sacred scriptures, which are understood as paradigmatic and as informing or teaching some sublime forms of experience that took place in the glorious past. Caught between the artificiality of the language and the authority of the sacred texts, the dimension of personal experience is often attenuated and sometimes even obliterated. Clichés, models, paragons, rituals, and ideals canonized in the ancient past are powerful obstacles<br>

  Book Title: Writing and Materiality in China-Essays in Honor of Patrick Hanan<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Widmer Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Speaking about Chinese writing entails thinking about how writing speaks through various media. In the guises of the written character and its imprints, traces, or ruins, writing is more than textuality. The goal of this volume is to consider the relationship of writing to materiality in China’s literary history and to ponder the physical aspects of the production and circulation of writing. To speak of the thing-ness of writing is to understand it as a thing in constant motion, transported from one place or time to another, one genre or medium to another, one person or public to another. Thinking about writing as the material product of a culture shifts the emphasis from the author as the creator and ultimate arbiter of a text’s meaning to the editors, publishers, collectors, and readers through whose hands a text is reshaped, disseminated, and given new meanings. By yoking writing and materiality, the contributors to this volume aim to bypass the tendency to oppose form and content, words and things, documents and artifacts, to rethink key issues in the interpretation of Chinese literary and visual culture.<br>

  Abstract: Hermeneutics belongs to multiple histories and so cannot be made into any one thing that begins and ends and suffers conceptual revolutions along the way, although in our effort to make sense of hermeneutics this is very much the sort of story we are apt to be looking for and inevitably come to rely on. Thus in the second part of
                  Truth and MethodGadamer sketches out a history of hermeneutics that begins with the romantic idealism of Hegel, Schleiermacher, and Dilthey, where hermeneutics is defined in terms of a consciousness whose objects are the products of an expressive spirit<br>

  Abstract: A phenomenological description of dialectical criticism? The contradiction is not so great as it might at first glance appear. The peculiar difficulty of dialectical writing lies indeed in its holistic, “totalizing” character: as though you could not say any one thing until you had first said everything; as though with each new idea you were bound to recapitulate the entire system. So it is that the attempt to do justice to the most random observation of Hegel ends up drawing the whole tangled, dripping mass of the Hegelian sequence of forms out into the light with it.

  Book Title: The Resounding Soul-Reflections on the Metaphysics and Vivacity of the Human Person<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Kimbriel Samuel<br>
  Abstract: It is surely not coincidental that the term “soul" should mean not only the centre of a creature’s life and consciousness, but also a thing or action characterized by intense vivacity (“that bike’s got soul!"). It also seems far from coincidental that the same contemporary academic discussions that have largely cast aside the language of “soul" in their quest to define the character of human mental life should themselves be so – how to say it? – bloodless, so lacking in soul. This volume arises from the opposite premise, namely that the task of understanding human nature is bound up with and in important respects dependent upon the more critical task of learning to be fully human, of learning to have soul. The papers collected here are derived from a conference in Oxford sponsored by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy and together explore the often surprising landscape that emerges when human consciousness is approached from this angle. Drawing upon literary, philosophical, theological, historical, and musical modes of analysis, the essays of this volume vividly remind the reader of the power of the ancient language of soul over against contemporary impulses to reduce, fragment, and overly determine human selfhood.<br>

If we accept that “there is no such thing as an authentic origin of memory, since all memory, whether preserved in image, word, or sound, is grounded in representation” (van Dijik 2004, 268), we must accept too that there is no such thing as an authentic<br>

  Book Title: New Romantic Cyborgs-Romanticism, Information Technology, and the End of the Machine<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Coeckelbergh Mark<br>
  Abstract: Romanticism and technology are widely assumed to be opposed to each other. Romanticism -- understood as a reaction against rationalism and objectivity -- is perhaps the last thing users and developers of information and communication technology (ICT) think about when they engage with computer programs and electronic devices. And yet, as Mark Coeckelbergh argues in this book, this way of thinking about technology is itself shaped by romanticism and obscures a better and deeper understanding of our relationship to technology. Coeckelbergh describes the complex relationship between technology and romanticism that links nineteenth-century monsters, automata, and mesmerism with twenty-first-century technology's magic devices and romantic cyborgs.Coeckelbergh argues that current uses of ICT can be interpreted as attempting a marriage of Enlightenment rationalism and romanticism. He describes the "romantic dialectic," when this new kind of material romanticism, particularly in the form of the cyborg as romantic figure, seems to turn into its opposite. He shows that both material romanticism and the objections to it are still part of modern thinking, and part of the romantic dialectic. Reflecting on what he calls "the end of the machine," Coeckelbergh argues that to achieve a more profound critique of contemporary technologies and culture, we need to explore not only different ways of thinking but also different technologies -- and that to accomplish the former we require the latter.<br>

  Abstract: Making a connection between romanticism and technology is not a very obvious thing to do; the two terms do not seem to live together comfortably. The main reason for this has to do with the fact that we are romantics to the bone: most romantics think that there is an unbridgeable gap between both. So what is romanticism, and what does it mean for our relation to technology? In this chapter I outline some key features of Romanticism as a cultural-historical movement (hence the capital

There is not even consensus about whether fascism is a strictly limited historical term, something that happened to Italians (or rather was perpetrated by Italians) between 1922 and 1945, or a universal phenomenon. The disputes surrounding fascism are not just a result of academic nitpicking; they point to what appear to be characteristics of the thing itself.

  Book Title: Agitations-Essays on Life and Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Krystal Arthur<br>
  Abstract: We disagree. From small questions of taste to large questions concerning the nature of existence, intellectual debate takes up much of our time. In this book the respected literary critic Arthur Krystal examines what most commentators ignore: the role of temperament and taste in the forming of aesthetic and ideological opinions. In provocative essays about reading and writing, about the relation between life and literature, about knowledge and certainty, about God and death, and about his own gradual disaffection with the literary scene, Krystal demonstrates that opposing points of view are based more on innate predilections than on disinterested thought or analysis.Not beholden to any fashionable theory or political agenda, Krystal interrogates the usual suspects in the cultural wars from an independent, though not impartial, vantage point. Clearly personal and unabashedly belletrist, his essays ask important questions. What makes culture one thing and not another? What inspires aesthetic values? What drives us to make comparisons? And how does a bias for one kind of evidence as opposed to another contribute to the form and content of intellectual argument?<br>

Lyons was hardly the back of the beyond—it was, in fact, a thriving commercial center in southern Gaul that did a lot of trade with the East, which was why Christianity could slip in so easily.

There is nothing in the world so invisible as a monument.’¹ The suggestion that precisely those images, figures and events that people strive to represent in public should go unheeded provokes numerous questions about the relation of individuals and groups to symbols and their impact as focal points of political communication.

The director continues to produce poignant films that address some of modern society's most important historical movements and events.<br>

  Abstract: Truth is usually considered a topic in epistemology, in a philosophical theory of knowledge. The thirteenth-century theologian Thomas Aquinas recognizes this dimension of truth when he defines it primarily as “the conformity of intellect and thing”
                  (conformitas intellectus et rei).² Moreover, Aquinas held that the intellect is able not only to make true judgments about things, but also to know the conformity of its judgments with things, which is to know their truth. There is also another dimension of truth in Aquinas’s thought, which I will call ontological truth. He considers natural things to be true in relation to the<br>

  Author(s) Gadamer Hans-Georg<br>
  Abstract: The argument between Derrida and Gadamer has made at least one thing clear: the charge brought against the universal search for truth and understanding is universal perspectivism, as Nietzsche inscribed it in philosophical consciousness. What is the point of striving for understanding, when everything is perspectival and historically conditioned? Often Gadamer has himself been viewed as the spokesman for historical relativism, since he had written that we do not understand better, but only differently. What would it mean to talk about the universality of understanding differently? Ultimately, does it not destroy the whole notion of truth?<br>

It can be thought of as consisting of a few established generic forms, such as poem, play, and story, with such debatable genres as the essay and the film lurking on the borders. Most departments of literature function with no better concepts than these, and, as F. E. Sparshott<br>

  Abstract: Not all early Christians thought that speaking about themselves as aliens was a good thing. While numerous texts of the first and second centuries were making exactly this move (as evidenced by our analysis thus far), this was not the only conceptual option available to Christians as they thought about their identity and what its legitimate relationship ought to be to the rhetoric of alienation. Thus there were (perhaps not surprisingly) voices of protest to the increasingly common strategy of constructing the Christian self as other.

In this narrow view, the energy of the local is focused on expelling, demonizing, marginalizing, and even destroying the feral. Generally, the feral can be understood as a state that lies somewhere between domesticated and wild. Ferality is implicitly accepted as a natural process: what happens when a domestic escapes, is released, or is transported into another bioregion; or conversely, what happens when the wild thing shifts or<br>

  Abstract: When studying values empirically, social researchers apply a methodological perspective which differs substantially from that characteristic of philosophers, social anthropologists, or historians of ideas. In empirical research, values are treated as something ‘measurable’, measurable, above all, with the instrument of systematic surveys. This is a persistent source of irritation, and not just among non-sociologists; I shall therefore deal briefly with this methodology by way of introduction. The first thing to bear in mind is that we constantly produce rough-and-ready ‘measurements’ of values in everyday conversation.

Then we have a basis for communicating the findings. The results of the research will rest on our basic understanding and definition of the thing we are investigating.

This is primarily due to developments that occurred during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and which are still inextricably linked to current discussions of the question. From the 1890s onward, a romanticized image of the samurai emerged, motivated by cultural and political currents at the time.

  Abstract: Burns explores the rich narrative structure of the trial, beginning with the lawyers' opening statements, which establish opposing moral frameworks in which to interpret the evidence. In the succession of witnesses, stories compete and are held in tension. At some point during the performance, a sense of the right thing to do arises among the jurors. How this happens is at the core of Burns's investigation, which draws on careful descriptions of what trial lawyers do, the rules governing their actions, interpretations of actual trial material, social science findings, and a broad philosophical and political appreciation of the trial as a unique vehicle of American self-government.<br>

  KANT, NIETZSCHE, AND FREUD from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rrpr">Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher</a><br>
  Abstract: Freud’s thinking about the ego combines several formulations, which begin with early modernist principles. In some sense, he draws an alliance with Descartes’s meditation, “I am a thinking thing,” as the “true” center of his identity. Indeed, the modernist endeavor to define personal identity begins by recognizing that the self cannot be derived, but instead, the Cartesian
                  cogitans—the end point of the skeptic’s query—serves as the starting point of self-consciousness.¹ Accordingly, to the extent that “identity” has a definition in the Freudian universe, it must be that which can be identified; that is, the conscious ego examines and<br>

These statements—sometimes running parallel to, other times diverging from his verbal remarks—might seem to contradict each other. At first glance, the contradictions appear to be profound. However, a closer look does away with them completely. The first thing one notes is the jovial, almost frivolous tone with which Brahms speaks of the “godlessSchnadahüpferln,” the “Schnadahüpferlnof May 7,” or simply the “Schnadahüpferln,” as if it were obvious that he could only be referring, with this term, to the Four<br>

  Abstract: The
         jali--a member of a hereditary group of Mandinka professional performers--is a charismatic but contradictory figure. He is at once the repository of his people's history, the voice of contemporary political authority, the inspiration for African American dreams of an African homeland, and the chief entertainment for the burgeoning transnational tourist industry. Numerous journalists, scholars, politicians, and culture aficionados have tried to pin him down. This book shows how the jali's talents at performance make him a genius at representation--the ideal figure to tell us about the "Africa" that the world imagines, which is always a thing of illusion, magic, and contradiction.<br>

One might argue that the ecstatic poetry of Nietzsche’s enigmatic “gift” is actually a parody of mystical affirmations, or an ironic warning against overexuberant hopes and loves.

  Book Title: Culture and Rhetoric-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Tyler Stephen<br>
  Abstract: While some scholars have said that there is no such thing as culture and have urged to abandon the concept altogether, the contributors to this volume overcome this impasse by understanding cultures and their representations for what they ultimately are - rhetorical constructs. These senior, international scholars explore the complex relationships between culture and rhetoric arguing that just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric. This intersection constitutes the central theme of the first part of the book, while the second is dedicated to the study of figuration as a common ground of rhetoric and anthropology. The book offers a compelling range of theoretical reflections, historical vistas, and empirical investigations, which aim to show how people talk themselves and others into particular modalities of thought and action, and how rhetoric and culture, in this way, are co-emergent. It thus turns a new page in the history of academic discourse by bringing two disciplines - anthropology and rhetoric - together in a way that has never been done before.<br>

  Abstract: If there is one thing that can be said with some certainty about 1 John, it is that interpretation of the document is more thoroughly controverted than almost any other document in the New Testament. It is like a Rorschach test. Scholars see in it all sorts of variations! Since the appearance of Raymond Brown’s masterful commentary, a number of other major commentaries have appeared with astounding differences in their view of what is going on in 1 John.¹<br>

  Abstract: If we are fortunate, at some point while pursuing the answer to one of our explanation-seeking why-questions we will experience a sense of understanding. In other words, we will seem to “grasp” or “see” what it is that accounts for the thing we want to explain, a moment of “grasping” or “seeing” that is often accompanied by a distinctive phenomenology—perhaps even a phenomenology along the lines of the celebrated “aha” experience.<br>

  Abstract: The iconography of Barcelona is bound up with performance. The city has been conceptualized – as the epigraph, from the
                  New York Times, makes clear – around performative paradigms. While all cities, as the director Tim Etchells notes, function in the same mode as theatre, as a model of ‘dynamic relativism … where everything means more than one thing’ (2009, p. xii), in Barcelona performance serves as a mode of conceptualizing self and other, of reinforcing the transformative potential of the city – not insignificant in a city that has re-envisaged its own architectural landscape in the past thirty years.<br>

  Abstract: The Cartesian tradition yields a very definite conception of what
                  value– moral, aesthetic and so on – must be. Or, rather, it yields a specific framework of possibilities for the sort of thing value must be. The view of the mind as essentially an interiority – something located entirely inside the skins of mental subjects – presents us with a stark choice when trying to understand the nature of value. Either value must derive from the inside – from the activities of the mind – or it must exist on the outside, objectively present in the world independently of those activities. Broadly speaking, the former<br>

  Abstract: Is each of us the main character in a story we tell about ourselves, or is this narrative understanding of selfhood misguided and possibly harmful? Are selves and persons the same thing? And what does the possibility of sudden death mean for our ability to understand the narrative of ourselves?For the first time, this collection brings together figures in contemporary philosophy and Kierkegaard studies to explore pressing questions like these in the philosophy of personal identity and moral psychology. These essays will both advance important ongoing discussions of selfhood and expand the light that, 200 years after his birth, Kierkegaard is still able to shed on contemporary problems.<br>

From a phenomenological viewpoint, in the photograph, the power of authentication exceeds the power of representation’ (Barthes 1984: 88–9). This final reflection by Barthes signposts the peculiarity of the photographic system which is made up of two signs, the indexical and the iconic; one belonging to the<br>

It is a thing of the future more than the present, but its future is far from assured. Such democracy as we presently enjoy it is mostly national, rather than transnational, and representative, rather than participatory. It is largely monopolised by elected ‘representatives’, rather than politically active citizens and almost entirely circumscribed by the territoriality of national state borders. The social communities, relations and processes beyond and across state borders that would constitute transnational democracy largely elude democracy’s remit. ‘Globalisation’ and<br>

  Abstract: Friendship, Cicero tells us, ‘is a kaleidoscope and complicated thing’.¹ We might add a fascinating thing; a kind of love perhaps and an enigma to us. Unlike love, which, on some accounts, is regarded as involuntary, friendship maintains an element of freedom of choice. In common with love, it involves a relationship between two beings and so draws us into the mystery of the difficult notion of the individual in himself or herself. The history of the philosophical literature on friendship reveals a changing semantic paradigm in relation to this notion. We are curious about friendship because as social creatures<br>

It is good, certainly, when friends are loyal, lovers faithful, their tears authentic, vows earnest, stories trustworthy. It is generally in our interest to know what’s up and what really happened. Not always, of course, or only: fiction and flattery, artifice and illusion, duplicity and pipe-dreams are also important, sometimes necessary, perhaps even, in their various ways, truthful, indeed sometimes supremely so – or so the poets have told us, though it’s not clear they’re to be trusted<br>

  Abstract: The bulk of Bolaño’s massive oeuvre in prose was written in the last ten years of his life. Javier Cercas has remarked: “it is nothing short of astonishing that he wrote what he wrote between 1996, the year of
                     Distant Star, and 2003, the year of his death.”¹ The astonishing thing is not the sheer volume of his production, which is matched by many authors of commercial fiction, but the combination of high productivity and genuine inventiveness. Commenting on this aspect of the Bolaño anomaly, Nora Catelli has written:<br>

Abstract: They did not worry that their group somehow represented something beyond the immediate interaction, or that one person’s behavior could reflect badly on other group members. There was nothing more important than this mutual individual respect. Behind the scenes, Jody talked to another member about her black son‐in‐law, saying, “It’s a shame he can’t come. … It’s too bad it’s like that. It shouldn’t be like that.” But it was like that, and since her son‐in‐law was not very eager to attend anyway, she did not think of it as a good thing to object to the jokes
               in the group. In a group of the sort Alexander and Smith imagine, members feel mutually responsible for upholding institutional decorum, objecting to objectionable jokes, for instance. But Jody did not imagine that the very fact of participating in the Buffalo Club should somehow reflect upon her (or anyone else) as a person.<br>

Abstract: 3. Did I overlook possible points of continuity across paradigms?The answer to this question relates to criteria for establishing continuity. The use of the same term, for example, does not mean that its meaning (extensionally or intensionally) is the same. Thus, Darnells suggestion that we all share ethnography, for example, is appealing, but I am not sure that ethnography means the same for all of those engaged in it, especially as more and more students are encouraged to work in their own communities and engage in urban (or suburban) fieldwork that often forces them to live the contradictions of an alienated native self or of a privileged fieldworker on the way to acquiring a professional multiplepersonality disorder. CookGumperz and Gumperz mention narrative and narrativity. It is difficult for me to see the narratives recorded by Boas as the same thing as the narratives collected and analyzed by Ochs and Capps (2001). They are both texts, but they were produced, recorded, and analyzed in such different ways that their similarities rapidly vanish as we expand the notion of teller to include the work done by participants in the narrative event. Finally, Spitulnik brings up the socalled SapirWhorf hypothesis as a possible source of continuity across paradigms. This is the most challenging of the three proposals for a thematic link across paradigms because the SapirWhorf hypothesis has almost mythical proportions in the public imagination. Together with the evolution of language (a topic that most linguists tend to avoid), the SapirWhorf hypothesis is a must in anthropology textbooks and in introductory books on language and culture. But the semanticindeterminacy problem is here even more serious than for ethnography and narrative given that, as Spitulnik knows (see her use of the qualifier socalled), there never was a SapirWhorf hypothesis, unless we take for it Hoijers (1954:93) rarely quoted informal and very general definition: The central idea of the SapirWhor~<br>

Abstract: The incomprehensibility of the human being remains. Founded and required by the incomprehensibility of the One whose image and likeness man bears, it is bound up with theology. Nevertheless it does not belong entirely, or even foremost, to theology, because man must comprehend this very incomprehensibility, by opposing it to, and preserving it in front of, every other comprehension that he gains over every other thing—things that can become objects. Let us recall here Paul Ricœur’s brilliant statement: “the claim by knowledge to constitute itself raises the most formidable obstacle to the idea of revelation. In this regard, Husserl’s transcendental idealism potentially contains the very same atheistic outcome as Feuerbach’s idealism of self‐consciousness.”
         46In this sense, which is first of all negative, or rather denegatory, man’s incomprehensibility comes under the domain of philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Beginning in the early 1960s, and punctuated by Foucault’s 1966
         Les mots et les choses(The Order of Things) and his 1969L’archéologie du savoir(The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language), poststructuralist critiques of truth claims and the imperialism of global history, a rethinking of the certainty of words and concepts in an “archeology (that is, a deconstruction) of the social sciences” struck at the heart of long‐standingAnnalisteprinciples.91Whether studying social control, discipline, power, or sexuality, old assumptions were dissected and new agendas initiated. The 1976Il formaggio e i vermi(The Cheese and the Worms) by Carlo Ginzburg and the 1979 launching ofmicrostoriaby Ginzburg, Carlo Poni, and Edoardo Grendi—practiced in France by Le Roy Ladurie in his 1975Montaillouand 1979Carnival in Romans—fostered a new kind of ethnographic history of everyday life that focused on the individual.92“The revival of narrative,” whether from Lawrence Stone’s famous 1979Past and Presentarticle or Paul Ricoeur’s 1983–85Time and Narrative,was to restore the story to history and to return to the event, as Pierre Nora had called for in his 1974 essay inFaire de l’histoire.
            93Pierre Bourdieu’s 1979La distinctionpushed for a reconciliation between events and structure.94By emphasizing that systems of oppositions are not stable structures but are constantly in the process of becoming, being made and remade, Bourdieu’s project to understand how social reality is constructed gets us closer to incorporating practice and perception with objective categories and suggests a way of bridging the gap between the endless details of one thing after another and causal explanation. This list of keyAnnalisteideas and methods derived from theMéditerranée’s problematic could include sharp criticism like that of François Dosse; the constructive response of Jacques Revel on theAnnalesparadigms, the social sciences, and the construction of the social; Pierre N~<br>

Abstract: If the norm of brevity is troubled by the possibility of linguistic poverty, the weedy verbosity springing up alongside our information highways may be a misguided attempt at a remedy. These weeds are, in a way, our flowers of Parnassus. But the roots of verbosity are more complex still because they are intertwined with the other norm governing informational writing, clarity. Again, we must begin by acknowledging the ancient pedigree of clarity, but with the caveat that the concept of clarity did not mean quite the same thing after a theory of communication such as Smith’s challenged the agenda of the old rhetoric. The norm of clarity is in fact extrinsic to the development of information genres, despite the deference it is paid in these genres. It emerged as an ideal of belles lettres in the eighteenth century. For the belles lettrists—the literary critics and grammarians who dominated the public sphere of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries—clarity was the supreme aim for all the genres of discourse, including the literary. Linked more to notions of
            politesseand correct usage than to knowledge or information, the center of gravity for belletrist discourse was not science but literature and journalism (forms of writing seldom distinguished at the time). The norm of clarity arose from thepublicnessof print culture, which presupposed that written communications were addressed ideally to everyone, to the hypothetical general reader. The belles lettrists thus cultivated a strong bias against terms of art, the diction that was specific to professions and crafts. Reinforced by the usual social snobbery, belles lettrist norms were from the beginning at odds with the linguistic needs of the sciences and professions, which required the freedom to devise “technical” lexicons if they were to advance at all.58Such terms of art became indispensable because these terms can be arbitrarily and therefore precisely defined. They can be forcibly removed from a domain ~<br>

Abstract: This displacement of the familiar concepts of religious self‐understanding can be fruitfully understood in terms of the aesthetic concept of “defamiliarization.” According to Victor Shklovsky, the main purpose of art is to counteract the tendency of practical life to make perception automatic and unconscious.
         41The pursuit of a goal encourages an economizing of perceptive effort with respect to the objects serving as means to that goal, so as to prevent an undue preoccupation with the means from interfering with the realization of the goal. Concepts, which function as schematic abbreviations of reality, are the means by which we are able to deal with objects with a minimum of perceptive effort.42A pragmatic attitude, by imparting a dynamic quality to our involvement with the world, promotes and sustains the conceptualization of reality. By deliberately slowing down the perceptual process, art reverses the process whereby concepts are generated from pragmatic intentionality, thus liberating objects from the familiar concepts of what they are.43The defamiliarization of reality through art allows the percipient to experience reality in its full texture; the work of art reveals the qualities of a thing that were suppressed by the concept. In a similar way, the defamiliarization of a religious tradition, by breaking through the polished surface of official doctrine, reveals previously unacknowledged dimensions of religious thought and experience.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur has done considerable work to advance our understanding of the process of interpretation, which he regards as being a contributor to a process of semantic innovation, but Budd’s treatment of this philosopher fails to make the most of this: “Ricoeur acknowledges the complexity of interpretation. For one thing, we have to deal with polysemy; many words have more than one meaning. Further, sentences may be ambiguous. The hazards we come up against are not insurmountable, however. In most instances we can determine which of the polysemic meanings in a word apply from the context of the whole work” [

Abstract: Certainly this sounds like an imperial imposition of a modern European political idea on religious communities that may not share the same cultural horizon—the very thing on account of which the postliberals and neotraditionalists reject the idea of interreligious dialogue. But the Hegelian notion of mutual recognition of free participatory agency is but one among many possible theoretical enunciations of the kind of political practice that must absolutely take place if different religious communities are to live in peace and solidarity. Although the trailblazing efforts made to implement that practice and give it theoretical articulations in the historical experiences of the modern European peoples have all too often been marred by patriarchal, racist, ethnocentric, and class‐based forms of master‐slave relation, that fact does not by itself cancel out the need for a solidary political practice of mutuality and free participation today in order to meet the challenges of the postcolonial‐neocolonial global order. Each religious community would need to go to its scriptures, narratives, myths, symbolisms, rituals, and practices to find motivations and reasons of its own to engage in such a political practice and possibly give its own theoretical account of why it recognizes practices of mutuality and free participation while denying the value of dominating and coercively marginalizing practices.<br>

Abstract: How does the shroud relate to the concept of marvel? What kind of silence and subsequent knowledge does the shroud produce in our inner “mirror,” the intellect, whose primary goal is to reflect the real through metaphorical expressions? As I will clarify in this essay, the shroud of Turin embodies the double nature of written and painted surface, but also of divine “mirror” in which the real is reflected. Tesauro’s metaphor speaks of an act of incarnation, in which a nonvisible idea becomes flesh and blood. The shroud has thus clear Eucharistic connotations, although Tesauro makes no direct allusion to the connection between the shroud and the Eucharist. He emphasizes that the shroud is at once the visualization of a concept (the Word’s incarnation) but also the embodiment of such a visualized concept, given that the shroud is “written” with the Word’s own blood. We could say that the shroud is at once name and thing, signifier and signified, metaphor and its exegesis. Moreover, in his second panegyric (
      Sympathy) Tesauro relates the shroud to St. Maurice, whose relics rested in the same cathedral of Turin. The shroud is “symbol,” and the saint’s body is its “agent,” that is, the saint’s relics actualize the shroud. In letting this image create an ecstatic suspension (Tesauro’s “marvel”), we perceive that the shroud is a mirror reflecting a universal biography. Like the relics of St. Maurice, we harbor an inner shroud, a symbolic image of the Word’s suffering and resurrection. The shroud demands that we become its linguistic “agents,” that is, that we mirror and enact its discourse of salvation.<br>

Abstract: Then there are those in our own day who suggest that both ways of looking at the principles of interpretation are utterly wrong‐headed. These people say we ought not even raise the question of “use,” and that to use the very term meaning is already to be engaged in a kind of unintelligible global speculation. In saying this, they suggest a very curious thing: namely, that the way to understand a text is not by principles of interpretation but by a kind of thick tradition of reading, very much like that of Midrash; that it is not that the text fits into a contextual, nontextual world in which it “means” or does not “mean,” or that it is a text that can be used within such a world, but rather that the world, any “world,” should be understood on the model of “text,” and that reading therefore constitutes a more profound and genuine use of language than speaking in dialogue or communicating in a common world. The best‐known proponent of this view is Jacques Derrida.

Eco invokes the famous example given by Abelard—“nulla rosa est” (there is no rose, such a thing as a rose never existed)—that actually brings to mind the image of a rose. He also brings in the dialectic of contiguity and similarity, according to which “if objectxhas been in some way imagined to be in contact with objecty,or if objectxpresents any sort of homology with objecty,every time objectxis evoked, objectywill be as well” (254).<br>

Abstract: Let us examine, in this light, the ancient biblical mythology of humankind as created “in the image” of its Creator. As claimed in Gen. 1:27, “God created humankind in his image [
         tselem], in the image [tselem] of God he created them; male and female he created them.”14This symbolism has variously been interpreted in Judaism, Christianity, and modernity to suggest human capabilities for such things as rationality, knowledge of God, dominance over other creatures, assistance to God, rest, reflexivity, and self‐transcendence.15Less often, however, is it juxtaposed with the line that immediately follows, a line that gives God’s very first biblical command to humanity: “God blessed them, and God said to them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth’” (Gen. 1:28).<br>

Abstract: The practical and normative ethics of our profession will undoubtedly be accompanied by emotive and affective reactions. After all, human action is motivated by emotion, cognition, reason, and other things. The profession’s desire to identify core values is a product of these multiple motivations. Just as identification of a core value requires an explication of what qualities are attached to a thing that is valued and for whom the thing is valuable and why, so too does discourse ethics in general require such full argumentation. More than just formal argument, though, discourse ethics entails participation broadly; it invites those concerned to have a voice within the communicative endeavor. The voicing, however, follows some norms that are aimed at the outcome of the deliberation—workable and agreed‐upon practices. Habermas says that “discourse ethics, then, stands or falls with two assumptions: (
         a) that normative claims to validity have cognitive meaning and can be treated like claims to truth and (b) that the justification of norms and commands requires that a real discourse be carried out and thus cannot occur in a strictly monological form” [35, p. 68]. Habermas presents an ideal that can suggest a beginning for the furtherance of a practical and normative ethics for librarianship.<br>

Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: Before we elaborate further on Derrida’s response to Patočka in
      The Gift of Death, a brief and very sketchy outline of what this text seeks to achieve is warranted. We should keep in mind Derrida’s observation in the first chapter, “Secrets of European Responsibility,” that what separates Patočka’s interpretation of the motif of the care of the soul from Heidegger’s influence is its essential Christianity. Whereas Heidegger constantly seeks to separate himself from Christianity, “repeating on an ontological level Christian themes and texts that have been de‐Christianized,’” “Patočka makes an inverse yet symmetrical gesture” by ontologizing “the historic themes of Christianity and attribut[ing] to revelation or to themysterium tremendumthe ontological content that Heidegger attempts to remove from it.” Thus, Derrida holds that Patočka’s gesture “amounts to the same thing” as Heidegger’s because it is symmetrical and merely the inverse. He adds that Patočka’s “own heresy [regarding Christianity] intersects with what one might call, a little provocatively, that other heresy, namely, the twisting or diverting by which the Heideggerian repetition, in its own way, affects Christianity” (GD,p. 23).The Gift of Deathis, of course, not limited to the mapping of the similarities and differences between Patočka and Heidegger; it also includes an analysis of Lévinas and, above all, of Kierkegaard’s Protestant interpretation of the Abrahamic story of the sacrifice of Isaac. It is inThe Gift of Deaththat Derrida seeks to establish the matrix, if I may call it that, that at once makes these four undeniably distinct positions on responsibility possible but also limits their range, distinctiveness, radicalism, and even their originality. Indeed, by inquiring into the various modalities of giving (oneself) death and of taking death (upon oneself), Derrida develops an economic model that accounts for the different positions on responsibility, their mutual contamination and passag~<br>

Abstract: Throughout much of the twentieth century there has been a consistent oscillation between an impulse to define the present in terms of the future, leading to what has been called presentism, and attempts to envisage new regimes of qualitative time that would enable a reconsideration of how the past constantly intervenes in the present. But this particular narrative was only preparatory to staging the contest of different, competing futures that fueled cold war ideologies and was removed as a solution to the present when that struggle ended. As Koselleck has reminded us, the modern regime of history appeared at the moment the idea of the exemplar and its imitation disappeared to make place for what now did not repeat itself (see
         FP,pp. 19–38). If at first greater privilege was accorded to the status of the future than the present, the schema was reversed to make way for an endless present (presentism) or a triumphal endism, which often came down to the same thing. The cultural inflection of this presentism was modernism as a broad signifier. Under the imperative of the new time, history made itself the name of the future—the future perfect, with people like Marinetti heralding the new regime of temporalization, announcing that it was now urgently necessary to liberate Italy from the “gangrene of professors, archaeologists, antiquarians.… The splendor of the world enriches itself with a new beauty—the beauty of speed” (quoted inRH,p. 120). Perceptively and presciently, Marinetti envisaged modernity as speed and velocity and anticipated the later enthusiasm of Chinese and Japanese in the 1920s, who fastened onto buzzwords likespeedas the appropriate description of their modernizing experience. Speed seemed to defy time and space and even demanded a new form of their alignment. In this way, the present was made to embody the future by means of accelerated velocity. In time the future eventually ceded its place to the terrain of the present, announcing the advent~<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: One of Smith’s Book of Mormon scribes provided, in his own failed attempt to translate, the occasion for the most direct description of Smith’s method. “You have not understood,” God told Oliver Cowdery through Smith: “you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But … you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right and … you shall feel that it is right. But if it is not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget that thing which is wrong; therefore you cannot write that which is sacred save it be given you from me.”
         35Cowdery appears to have thought he could engage in the “inspired translation” of the Book of Mormon by parroting God’s reading. In contrast, as implied by the above statement, Smith believed it necessary to determine independently how to represent what he read or saw. The appropriate question to God by the prophet‐translator was whether his interpretation was correct, not what God’s interpretation was.<br>

Abstract: Finally, there are two other authors, John M. Budd [
            6] and Luciano Floridi [35], who should be mentioned for their consideration of truth in library and information science. Budd presents perhaps the most comprehensive analysis to date exploring the intersection of philosophy and librarianship. He traces the development of relevant philosophical movements that have contributed to expanding our considerations of librarianship, and he rejects early attempts to link library and information science with positivism. Budd outlines new ways of thinking about the social and ethical actions (praxis) of librarianship by framing contemporary theoretical constructs in terms of hermeneutic phenomenology. Budd critically analyzes the works of Hans‐Georg Gadamer [36], Paul Ricoeur [37
               None–39], Martin Heidegger [40], and others to argue that “the goal of seeking knowledge, achieved through hermeneutic phenomenology, points to one thing quite clearly—that the actions we engage in LIS, including facilitating information seeking, are inseparable from being, especially as conceived by Husserl and Heidegger” [6, p. 291]. Although his work has been criticized for its uneven treatment of certain ideas and for his choice of philosophers to include or omit from the analysis [41], the study provides a broad and comprehensive examination of the ways in which contemporary philosophical movements intersect the praxis of library and information science.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 589491<br>
2008<br>
Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: In conjuring up the conceptual field of such effects, we might turn to set theory and picture a Venn diagram by which narratography is defined as exactly the zone of overlap between narratology and stylistics. Narratography would be shaded in there by the very shadings and incremental gradations of prose in the thick and thin of its own action as linguistic incident. Here emerges, in sum, the heuristic value of a so-called
         Story Left Behindin staging by exaggeration the everyday wake of narrativity in verbal process. Any narrative sentence may have its dramatic prehistory. It need not necessarily be distended or suddenly truncated, not by definition brutal or suppressed or moving or any one thing in particular, and not necessarily longer than the plotted tension of the preceding paragraph or even sentence. But narrative prehistory is manifest as a forward pressure nonetheless. That's why this essay's approach is in fact “narratival” rather than strictly stylistic (whatever that might mean)—and often dialectical as such. And why its instinct for intensive reading comes into sync with the impetus of plotted structure rather than just local representation. And why, further, even in imagining an entire shadow plot, the inflated exception developed in the fictional phase of this essay can still prove the rule of the minuscule. Whole lives, of course, don't usually lie battered, absented, and returned by deformation under the tread of suchfrictionin prose. Broad swaths of plot aside, it is rather in the immediate pace of reading that some aspect or facet of an advancing story is often bent noticeably out of shape. Narratography becomes, in this sense, the tracking of syntax and of the words it marshals for the impinging microplots, one after the other, of their own proximate backstories.<br>

Abstract: In his notion of involuntary memory, Marcel corrects the Aristotelian principle that an object of the imagination that is imprinted in memory cannot coincide with the present experience of the object itself, because “there is no such thing as memory of the present.” Although he espouses the Aristotelian principle that “one can only imagine what is absent,” Marcel sees this principle as invalidated whenever the essential character of a presently experienced sensation coincides with that of a sensation imprinted in memory. In such an instance, one can enjoy the impression of the present sensation to the fullest; thanks to the intensifying “application” of one’s imagination of it, one enjoys, in other words, the impression that a sensation or event from the past is being concretely resuscitated in the here and now. This imaginative appreciation of the present throws one into the bliss of a dimension “emancipated from the order of time” (affranchie de l’ordre du temps) and makes one oblivious of or indifferent to the squalor of one’s “directly felt reality.” Aristotle, “On Memory,” in

Abstract: I want to conclude by seeing how Coleridge’s thinking on prayer might, in being part of the reconceptualization of religious subjectivity found in the nineteenth century, anticipate some of the stakes and terms of Derrida and Marion’s debate. The most obvious thing to note is that Coleridge makes the against‐itself of prayer central. His thought echoes the lesson of Rom. 8:26—“We know not what we should pray for as we ought”—and the strange fold that means we pray for the capacity to pray. Calvin, no less, argues that prayer involves a “twofold pardon”—one for the original transgression and one for the weakness of the prayer.
         62That is not to say that just declaring prayer paradoxical or catachrestic solves the problem (nor should it be taken for the terminal point of his own thinking), but it can help us further determine a distinctive Coleridgean position on the language of prayer. First, we should note that Derrida (like Kant) considers that prayer demands a certain purity of action in order to rigorously conform to its concept—in Derrida’s case, an act of pure address. By contrast, for Coleridge (like Marion and most thinkers in the theological tradition), we have seen that prayer is as much response as act, a position powerfully enunciated by Hans Urs von Balthasar’s view of prayer as hearing: “The better a man learns to pray, the more deeply he finds that all his stammering is only an answer to God’s speaking to him.”63<br>

Abstract: Similar illustrations of immanent dispossession abounded during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. While Fénelon's censure in 1699 appeared to neutralize the threat posed by mysticism, Christian apologists turned from this victory to confront attacks on human agency stemming from Spinozist and materialist circles. A key battle in this polemic was fought over the status of free will as a property of the thinking subject, whether human or divine. Spinoza aimed to demonstrate that God acts
         asnature, notonnature, and out of sheer necessity. Created beings operated under a similar compulsion. The distinction between subject and object, famously associated with Descartes, was thereby dissolved. To cite theEthics(1677): “When we say that the human mind perceives this or that thing, we say nothing else than that God possesses this or that idea.”46In other words, the subject's thoughts are not its own, unique to itself, but are the manifestation of God thinking in the world and through the mind. It followed from this premise that “there is no absolute or free will,” a conclusion that undermined the possibility of transcendence for any being.47Spinoza therefore understood the highest form of wisdom, which he called the “intellectual love of God,” to be the recognition of the determined character of our existence. We are, he asserted, “part of the whole of nature, whose order we follow.”48In consequence, true liberty “is to be and to remain chained by the bonds of [God's] love.”49And this love, Spinoza claimed, was not directed toward the individual human person. It was, on the contrary, “part of the infinite love with which God loves Himself.”50For Spinoza, then, intellectual love is radically self-referential—not to the human subject, but to divine substance. The beatified self exists merely as an effect of God/Nature's immanent presence and totalizing force. At the same time, Spinoza extended dispossession beyond what Fénelon's Christian beliefs would permit~<br>

Abstract: On the other hand, the Quran says that slaughter is an evil thing, but
            fitna—persecution or a betrayal of a basic social bond—is worse (2:191). Military jihad (struggle) could become a sacred duty when it was to defend the community againstfitna. Twentieth‐century revivalists such as Qutb have seenfitnaas occurring wherever God is not recognized as sovereign.83<br>

Abstract: This line of inquiry bears greatly upon our question since it seems that the sovereign’s ability to give to another is barred by the sovereign’s retention of the ability to decide the exception. Does potential, when it gives, divest itself of what it has when it gives actuality to itself? Does the white‐on‐white of pure potency ever bear the marks of other color? Perhaps, the giving of actuality by potency is a kind of surplus that does not diminish what being potency has. This sort of gift does not give in the sense of an ordinary gift, a thing alienable from a donor to recipient. Though potency gives actuality to itself, in Agamben’s formulation, what makes sovereignty aporetic is that it always retains itself as potentiality. The sovereign gives to itself and to no other since any gift of actuality that it gives never gives itself away. Barbarians and aliens are included in the political because they are no real outsider, no exception, because the sovereign neither gives to another nor does it receive. Agamben’s aporia approaches the impossibility of a gift, the impossibility of anything ever being given away at all.<br>

Abstract: Literature for Blanchot is defined by its being a nonplace, a site of erring. It acts by mimicking activity and in this doubling it creates a space of instability where valences are multiplied; nothing is as it seems. For even in its gesture back toward the original object, in its turning, which is effected through the multiplication of images and the animation of language's materiality, what is achieved is not greater clarity or another form of possession—the rendering of presence—but rather an instability that creates ambiguity at every level such that one does not know when language is expressing or representing. “If it is a thing or means that thing . . . obscure because it says too much, opaque because it says nothing” (“L,” p. 329; “LRD,” pp. 341–42).<br>

Abstract: As Ricoeur elaborates it, “metaphor” as a semantic process has the power to transfer sentiments, so that in its poetic function, metaphor stretches the power of the double sense (sign and signified, vehicle and tenor, subject and predicate, or principal subject and modifier) from the cognitive to the affective.
         28Melandri also associates this approach with Max Black, who himself takes inspiration from I. A. Richards, who writes, “When we use a metaphor we have two thoughts of different things active together and supported by a single word, or phrase, whose meaning is a resultant of their interaction.”29He identifies this same conception as more brilliantly developed in Arthur Koestler'sThe Act of Creation, in which the metaphor's “bisociation” brings forth many other composite phenomena than those initially found in the analogy.30Of Dante and the Bible, Ricoeur writes, “Si la métaphore consiste à parler d'une chose dans les termes d'une autre, ne consiste-t-elle pas aussi à percevoir, penser ou sentir, a propos d'une chose, dans les termes d'une autre?” (If metaphor consists in speaking of a thing in the terms of another, does it not consist also in perceiving, thinking or feeling, about one thing in the terms of the other?)31In other words, metaphor offers us this “insight”—to perceive, think, feel, even perhaps be or become like another. It allows us to experience entrance into the other, in a sense capturing a rapturous condition of mankind beyond or before hierarchies, dichotomies, and binaries. Identifying this approach to metaphor with post-Cartesianism and Heidegger, Melandri, like Badiou, calls this the “sympathy” aspect of the hermeneutics of the analogy.32<br>

Author(s): Landy Joshua<br>
Abstract: We may wish to respond by saying that Kaufman merely offers us these scenes ironically, as a satire on Hollywood conventions. Yet this defense exposes Kaufman to a second danger, the danger of sweeping everything away, deep questions and heartfelt responses included, with the undiscriminating broom of irony. It is perhaps unsurprising, albeit unfortunate, that one of the movie's earliest reviewers complained that “
         Adaptationis a movie that eats itself whole and leaves the audience with nothing” (“A”);34the ironic tone of the finale risks casting its echoes over the earlier parts of the film, making the entire thing seem like an exercise in sheer negativity, a wholesale rejection of everything.35So here is the objection: should we not say that in spite of Kaufman's best efforts he has managed only to make yet another Hollywood film, one whose self-irony not only fails to save it—no one ceases being a sellout or a flop merely by acknowledging his or her shortcomings—but risks, like a universal solvent, dissolving everything that might otherwise have been of interest?<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: By characterizing Faustus's magic as efficacious only because his interest in it signified that he was inclined to be damned, Marlowe turned the aesthetic strategies of dramatic forms into instruments that produced effects that seemed to have soteriological consequences. Yet he dramatized the reformers' arguments not because he wrote his play to disciplinary ends (it is hard to imagine Marlowe having an interest in reforming his audience's faith). Rather, Marlowe made the aesthetics of
      Doctor Faustusinstrumental to increase the cultural and material power of his art. He knew full well that immediate, popular, and even naive theatrical experiences motivate the distribution of such power; from an ambitious and brilliantly cunning playwright's point of view, they are the means to that very end. And in writingDoctor Faustus, Marlowe was not just cunning, but fearless. If he argued, as Richard Baines claimed, that “the first beginning of Religion was only to keep men in awe,” it still could not have been an easy thing, when atheism was a felony and religious discourse saturated all of English life, to maintain such a demystifying view of the ideological function of the sacred.40Yet Marlowe used belief in the devil and in God himself as his dramatic instrument to wrench the psychic and social force of religious experience away from its dominant institutional contexts and to place it in the peripheral space of the theater, which he, above all his immediate contemporaries, was creating as a charged, extraordinary, and charismatic social space.<br>

Author(s): Vásquez Manuel A.<br>
Abstract: As is often the case, when a scholar who is trained as a descriptivist (in disciplines such as history, sociology, and ethnography) attempts to take on theoretical issues they become theoretically parochial. They understand what works for their predefined area of expertise. However, theory takes place in constituting the domains for research, prior to the act of description, not in the applying individual concepts to preexistent object-domains. As Paul Ricoeur put it, “to delimit a domain of application is a hermeneutical act,” an act “that calls for reflection in terms of a general theory of interpretation” (
      Figuring the Sacred[Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress Press, 1995] 304). This kind of reflection, in my view as a scholar trained in theory, is completely lacking in Vásquez’s choice of criterion, despite his long sections of exegesis of theoretical texts. Rigorous exegesis is not the same thing as rigorous theoretical thinking. Rather, in Vásquez’s choices we find a predetermined view in search of a theory. The book becomes a justification of his choices, not a critical, reflexive, hermeneutical act. Theory happens before the explication of theory begins, and awareness of this fact is absent from this text.<br>

Abstract: Lear calls attention to the inadequacy of our response when he staggers onstage with Cordelia’s lifeless body. His rebuke indicts the audience as well as the actors/characters at his side:
      
            As Marianne Novy observes, no spectator can respond accordingly, and our inability is profoundly embarrassing. For Novy, this unsettling insufficiency instills within each of us a keen sense of isolation. As we watch on in silence while Lear bursts his lungs and then his heart, we come to feel a sharp separation not only from the characters onstage but also from our fellow spectators. Nevertheless, Novy insists that this feeling of isolation ultimately gives way to a sense of solidarity. I cannot know if you and I are feeling the same thing, and I cannot deny that neither of us is feeling enough, but the simple fact that we are both feeling something (whatever it is) attests to a basic connectedness that, finally, fashions us into a community of care. “The one consolation that [Shakespeare] offers—and in a theater it is a significant one—is that we feel each other’s loss because of our basic connection.” Although our emotional response to Lear’s tragedy will never rise to the height it deserves, it is—at least for Novy—enough to knit us together.

Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: In the cosmos of
         Paradise Lostthere is perhaps no stranger fact than this—that the Son at his greatest moment in the poem says almost exactly the same thing as Adam at his worst. I say “almost” because it is of course the minor differences that make all the difference in Milton’s world. The Son is able to imagine the manner in which Satan might react to the fall of man, but unlike Adam, he refuses to give voice to that possibility. He chooses not to speak for the devil. Adam, however, relishes the opportunity to speak the words of another as his own. As in the cases of Eve and Raphael, the dramatic potential of this moment is too often unrecognized. How does Adam look and sound when he suddenly begins to act in the role of archfiend? Does he exclaim like a Roman orator and make elaborate gestures? Does he extend an index finger toward his chest when he says “Me first / He ruined,” feeling perhaps the thrill of being not entirely himself? But again, if Satan will never be able to say these words, then the “me” Adam points to can in the end be no one but himself. It is hardly surprising that in the very next line he consents to the formal act of sin, telling Eve: “I with thee have fixed my lot” (9.952).<br>

Abstract: Metaphors of pain, however, require special attention due to the multivalent nature of an experience that encompasses physical, cognitive, emotional, and cultural aspects. In many ways, metaphor is suited to the complexity of pain for, as Paul Ricoeur asks, “if metaphor consists in talking about one thing in terms of another, does it not consist also in perceiving, thinking, or sensing one thing in terms of another?” The processes of interpretation instigated by metaphor are themselves diverse, and Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor extends the power of resemblance beyond cognition:
      
            The affective power of metaphor, the fourth aspect vital to its employment in early modern tragedy, is key for playwrights as they draw on physical knowledge of pain to elicit cathartic response to what is portrayed on stage.If metaphor adds nothing to the description of the world, at least it adds to the ways in which we perceive; and this is the poetic function of metaphor. This still rests upon resemblance, but at the level of feelings. In symbolizing one situation by means of another, metaphor “infuses” the feelings attached to the symbolizing situation into the heart of the situation that is symbolized. In this “transference of feelings,” the similarity between feelings is induced by the resemblance of situations. In its poetic function, therefore, metaphor extends the power of double meaning from the cognitive realm to the affective.
         
                  
            18
               
            These playwrights do not primarily use metaphor to convey the sensations of pain that are unfelt by the audience but rather to draw on audience experience of physical pain as a foundation for the construction of the philosophical, metaphysical, or spiritual perspective of the tragedy. The interconnection of ways of knowing—cognitive, physical, affective—is very much in line with early modern “understanding,” described by William N. West as a holistic experience that in~<br>

Abstract: The Ionian cosmogonies of the sixth century b.c.e. explained how an ordered world evolved out of an undifferentiated initial state of “things.” In the fifth century, science became more particularly an inquiry into the ultimate constitution of material substance: the uniform and permanent “nature of things.” The notion of substance derives from tactile sensation. The belief in substantial things outside us reverts to the original detachment of self from the object. With Heraclitus of Ephesus, philosophy focused on knowing the thing, not on that which is known. Thought controls the phenomena as it constitutes the thinker. The problem of understanding nature was taken to a new level. The Milesian school of philosophers had moved it to the realm of the intellect in that they claimed the universe to be an intelligible whole. The manifold was to be understood as deriving from a sustaining principle or first cause, but was to be perceived in the phenomena.<br>

Abstract: Walter Pater's theoretical "come-back" over the past forty years or so has been dominated by the competing claims of the new historicism and deconstruction, both of which discover prescient forerunners of their own, seemingly mutually exclusive, theoretical concerns in Pater's aesthetic criticism and in his historical novel Marius the Epicurean (1885). Yet despite their obvious differences, both critical approaches share one thing in common: the same post-humanist denigration of the trope of metaphor in favor of the seemingly more ethically responsive (because inclusive) trope of metonymy. In this essay I observe how the new historicism's and deconstruction's privilegings of metonymy as the prime trope of difference poses an immediate problem for ethical thought that, largely under the influence of Alain Badiou, has become increasingly cognizant of the need for a workable conception of sameness (or universality), traditionally supplied by metaphor. Accordingly, this close reading of the metaphorical dialectic of one of Pater's surprisingly underread Imaginary Portraits, "Sebastian van Storck" (1887), explores the basic charge against metaphor-namely, that it is an essentially "theological" trope insofar as it invariably pre-posits the "identity" that it modestly claims to have merely discovered. Employing the central figure of Sebastian's idealism- equation-I venture that, once rethought as a relation not of identity but of equivalence, metaphor is capable of shouldering the rhetorical burden of similarity without relinquishing its ethical claim as a primary producer of new differences in the world and is, hence, deserving of a central place in a post-deconstructive ethics.<br>

Abstract: Michael Ermarth summarizes the move as follows: "Particularly after his read-
ing of Husserl, he extended his notion of meaning to include the relation between the sign and the
thing signified and stipulated that what is signified cannot be resolved into experiential components
and configurations. Verstehen is not just simply the "resubjectifying of objectivations in a 'back-
ward' movement from the objective expression to the immanent subjective experiences of the
expresser, but also a 'forward movement' from the sign to its intentional object" (Wilhelm Dilthey:
The Critique of Historical Reason [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978] 274)

Abstract: Catherine Gallagher writes against the critical tendency to foreground
Deronda's Jewishness. As Gallagher points out, "It seems an odd twist...when the
dreadful, shameful veiled core of meaning to which so much in the novel alludes
turns out not to be a loose woman, a public or private concubine, but an artist, the
greatest lyric actress of her time. All through his life, Daniel has thought that he
stood as the sign of his mother's sexual sin...Instead of having been abandoned as
a sign of shameful sex, Daniel was literally traded for an artistic career; he is, in
this sense, the representative of his mother's career because he is the thing that
she exchanged for it" (53).

Abstract: Academia's mathematical metaphysics are briefly explored en route to an elaboration of the qualitatively rigorous requirements underpinning the calibration and unambiguous interpretation of quantitative instrumentation in any science. Of particular interest are Gadamer's emphases on number as the paradigm of the noetic, on the role of play in interpretation, and on Hegel's sense of method as the activity of the thing itself that thought experiences. These point toward and overlap with (1) Latour's study of the metrological social networks through which technological phenomena are brought into language as modes of being that can be understood, and (2) the way that Rasch's models for measurement comprise a potential beginning for metaphysically astute, qualitatively and quantitatively integrated, mathematical methods in the social sciences. The paper closes with observations on the general problem that is philosophy, the need to remain open to multiplicities of meaning even as clear understandings are sought and obtained.<br>

Abstract: Refiriéndose a Jean-Jacques Rousseau en "From/of Blindness to the Supplement", Derrida
ofrece varias aproximaciones a la noción del suplemento tales como: "The supplement adds
itself, it is a surplus, a plenitude enriching another plenitude, the fullest measure of presence.
It cumulates and accumulates presence. It is thus that art, techné, image, representation, con-
vention, etc., come as supplements to nature... But the supplement supplements. It adds only
to replace. It intervenes or insinuates itself in-the-place-of; if it fills, it is as if one fills a void.
If it represents and makes an image, it is by the anterior default of a presence. Compensatory
[suppléant] and victorious, the supplement is an adjunct, a subaltern instance which takes-
(the)-place [tient-lieu]'. As a substitute, it is not simply added to the positivity of a presence,
it produces no relief, its place is assigned in the structure by the mark of an emptiness.
Somewhere, something can be filled up of itself, can accomplish itself, only by allowing itself
to be filled through sign and proxy. The sign is always the supplement of the thing itself.
Derrida, Of Grammatology, pp. 144-45.<br>

Abstract: Concordo sulla modernizzazione acritica di Euripide corne poeta scettico e sulla serie-
tà sostanziale della religiosità delle tragedie; mi sembra invece azzardata l'idea che queste
tragedie avessero la funzione di "rassicurare" il pubblico sull'esistenza di un "ordine e di
un piano" divino per quanto imperscrutabili. Afferma S.I. "The most terrifying thing is a
world that has no meaning, no order, and no plan. Euripidean tragedies show that the world
does have order and meaning, and works on a plan of Zeus" (p. 410). È assai probabile che
gli ultimi venti anni del quinto secolo abbiano rappresentato un periodo di instabilità di
valori e di crisi, tuttavia l'idea di un mondo "senza significato, ordine e finalità" mi sembra
molto moderna, se non post-moderna, e assai difficilmente significante nell'Atene di fine
quinto secolo. Più pertinente è invece l'accento sull'importanza di praticare il culto per
mantenere il rapporto di benevolenza tra uomini e dèi (ibidem).<br>

Abstract: Rethinking, 29, n. 120. I use the phrase in debating the views of Tamar
Chana Reich, "A Battlefield of a Text: Inner Textual Interpretation in the Sanskrit
Mahäbhärata," Ph.D. dissertation, Chicago: University of Chicago, 1998:
"Granted we 'know' the Mbh as a text that 'grew, and became what it is by expan-
sion' (with italics), but not that it took eight 'centuries of textual production.'...
Reich [thinks the Mbh develops through] eight-hundred year[s]... of 'contestatory
discourse' governed by an 'aesthetic of expansion' (citing Reich 51, 32, and 31 suc-
cessively). This aesthetic better befits a short period of controlled, consensual 'con-
testation,' and also shared conventions, which do not last forever" - indeed, my
note goes on to show that "Reich sometimes points in this direction." It is in any
case the first thing I say in the book about conventions (353 [Index]).<br>

Author(s): Seerveld Calvin<br>
Abstract: I am open to David Carroll's considération that American 'deconstructionists' (and
those in art historical circles?) may have oversimplified Derrida's thought into a 'newer
form of new criticism' (in Paraesthetics, Foucault/Lyotard/Derrida ILondon:Methuen,
1987) pp.81-89). Yet even Carroll notes that 'a critical reading of Derrida should have as
one of its goals to make a practical criticism derived from Derrida's work very diflicult, if
not impossible to realize' (p.207 n.3). Possibly Derrida's disciples, like those of Dooye-
weerd or Dewey or Hegel, misrepresent his genius, but Derridean authority is constantly
invoked on the world academie circuit today for its assembly-line scholarship of profes-
sional articles which continue to marginalize both philosophical and literary criticism. So
there is more warrant than chagrin to André Lefevere's sardonic remark: 'To produce
more and more interprétations of texts that have been interpreted for centuries may
appear to be a trifle redundant, except that it is a matter of bread and butter for most
interpreters.... (quoting Vincent Leitch, Deconstructive Criticism, 1983) 'There can never
be <correct> or <objective> readings, only more or less energetic, interesting, careful or
pleasurable misreadings.' Often the same person who writes this kind of thing then goes
home and grades the 'misreadings' of others, so that they, too, can take their place within
the academy, or be denied it, as the case may be.' Lefevere, '"Beyond Interprétation" or
The Business of (Re)Writing,' in Comparative Literature Studies 24 (no. 1, 1987): 18.
William Rowe, however, asks for a patient, 'more internai' critical reading of Derrida's
nomadic no-position. Cf. 'Critical study of [Sander Griffioen'sl The Problem of Progress',
in Philosophia Reformata 55 (no. 1, 1990): 80-83.<br>

Abstract: The word 'ethical' often has a spécifie meaning. In that case it is placed on a level with other
terms having a normative significance such as 'aesthetic', juridical', 'religious' and means
about the same thing as 'moral'. An ethical problem thus regarded is a typical problem of
morality. The word can also have a comprehensive meaning, however, as in the ancient
Greeks. 'Ethical' is in that case more or less identifiable with 'normative'. That is so with the
term 'ethical pluralism'. What is usually meant by it is a pluralist view of moral and other
norms. In this essay I shall also use the term in this way. Yet I prefer to speak of a 'pluralism
of norms and values' (a) because I like to reserve the term 'ethical' for moral normativity and
(b) because in this study I also want to deal with logical and technological normativity, and
in common language these fall in any case outside the concept of 'ethical', even if it is
understood comprehensively.<br>

Abstract: Scheler's position is precariously subtle: the "person" is neither exhausted in his "acts"
nor something subsisting through their temporal succession, but, rather, a supra-temporal
being who acts into time and who "is and experiences himself only as a being that executes
acts"; the "whole person is contained in every fully concrete act, and the whole person 'varies' in
and through every act - without being exhausted in his being in any of these acts, and
without 'changing' like a thing in time" (Formalismus, p. 395f. [English translation, p. 385]; see
above, n. 27, for full references).<br>

Abstract: In the pertinent passage Dooyeweerd's view of the I as a transcendental concentration
point is contrasted with Kierkegaard's comment on the I (or self). Kierkegaard calls the self "a
relation which relates to itself, and in relating to itself relates to something else." This 'some-
thing else' is a power, namely: God. See Kierkegaard (1849, 43) and Glas (1995a, 74-76).<br>

Abstract: I concur with Shah and Farr (2011) vs. Obama. First comes a quote from President
Obama, then their commentary: '"What our deliberative, pluralistic democracy demands is that
the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal, rather than religion-specific,
values." Religious motivation is fine; just don't make your religious views the basis for public
policy. But democracy "demands" no such thing. Democracy is a system that adjudicates
contending claims.'<br>

Abstract: Kearney thus summarizes Kant's "Copernican Revolution": "Being would henceforth
be conceived not as the transcendent origin of meaning, but as a representation of the human
subject—or, more precisely, as a production of the human imagination. This is what Kant had
in mind when he affirmed that 'being is not a real predicate . . . but only the positing of a
thing'" (Wake 157-58<br>

Abstract: Le problème de la représentation du passé ne commence pas avec l'histoire mais avec la mémoire qui a le privilège de la reconnaissance intuitive et directe des images gardées de l'impression en nous de la marque du passé, avec toutes les difficultés liées à la fiabilité relative de la mémoire. Le problème chemine à travers tous les stades de l'opération historiographique: témoignage et archive, — explication/compréhension —, représentation narrative et rhétorique au niveau du texte final de l'historien. Entre la mémoire et l'histoire, l'ordre de priorité reste indécidable. /// The problem of the representation of the past does not begin with history, but with memory. Memory has the capacity to recognize intuitively and directly the images we keep of the impression the past makes on us, with all the uncertainties stemming from its questionable reliability. This problem concerns all stages of the historiographic process: testimony and archives — explanation/comprehension — narrative and rhetorical representation during the writing of the historian's final text. But one thing remains certain, it is impossible to give priority to either memory or history.<br>

Abstract: Mass death resulting from war, starvation, and disease as well as the vicissitudes of extreme poverty and enforced sexual servitude are recognizably pandemic ills of the contemporary world. In light of their magnitude, are repentance, regret for the harms inflicted upon others or oneself, and forgiveness, proferring the erasure of the guilt of those who have inflicted these harms, rendered nugatory? Jacques Derrida claims that forgiveness is intrinsically rather than circumstantially or historically impossible. Forgiveness, trapped in a paradox, is possible only if there is such a thing as the unforgivable. "Thus, forgiveness, if there is such a thing," can only exist as exempt from the law of the possible. Does this claim not open the way for hopelessness and despair? More troubling for Derrida is his concession that forgiveness may be necessary in the realm of the political and juridical. If so, is not the purity of the impossibility of forgiveness so crucial for him, contaminated? In pointing to some of the difficulties in Derrida's position, I shall appeal to Vladimir Jankelevitch's distinction between the unforgivable and the inexcusable. I shall also consider the significance of repentance in the theological ethics of Emmanuel Levinas and Max Scheler. Forgiveness, I conclude, is vacuous without expiation, a position that can be helpfully understood in the context of Judaism's analysis of purification and acquittal in the Day of Atonement liturgy. I argue that what disappears is Derrida's assurance of the impossibility of forgiveness, a disappearance that allows for hope.<br>

Abstract: Clément Rosset explains that the word
cruor, from which crudelis (cruel) and crudus (indigestible) are derived,
designates torn and bloody flesh, that is, the thing itself stripped of all its orna-
ments and ordinary external accoutrements, in this case skin, and thus reduced to
its unique reality.... Thus reality is cruel - and indigestible - as soon as one re-
moves from it everything which is not reality in order to consider it in itself. (76)<br>

Author(s): Felman François<br>
Abstract: Dans ce plaidoyer argumenté en faveur de l'histoire du temps présent, François Bédarida lève une à une les objections faites à ce champ historiographique regardé, quelquefois encore, avec suspicion. Cette notion de temps présent est définie dans une mise en perspective avec le passé et l'avenir. En définitive, l'historien, confronté à la mémoire immédiate des témoins, trouve dans le temps proche un terrain à la fois fragile et fécond. Depuis une vingtaine d'années, l'histoire du temps présent contribue au renouvellement du champ historiographique, tant par le regard qu'elle permet d'offrir sur la notion d'historicité que par la mise en œuvre de pratiques particulières. Les objections formulées à son égard sont cependant nombreuses: absence de recul, manque ou, au contraire, surabondance des sources, incomplétude de l'objet, flou sur la définition même du champ d'études. Or l'intérêt de l'étude du très contemporain réside justement dans la complexité des liens que le présent entretient avec le passé et l'avenir: un temps présent qui fait figure de trait d'union entre ces différentes temporalités à l'image d'un passeur ou d'un traducteur. Mais bâtir une histoire du temps récent ne consiste pas à faire œuvre de mémoire: si l'historien se nourrit des témoignages de ses contemporains, il exerce son regard critique sur eux et, tâche tout à fait inconfortable, fait œuvre d'explication en fonction d'un présent dont il est à la fois l'acteur et l'interprète. /// Over the last twenty years, the history of the present has renewed historiography through the vision it provides on the notion of historicity as well as by the implementation of particular practices. But there are many objections to it: a lack of distance; either a lack of or too many sources; the lack of completion of the object, blurriness about the very definition of the field of study. Nevertheless, the author suggests that the interest in the study of the contemporary dwells in the complexity of the links the pr~<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur Michael<br>
Abstract: The last thirty years have brought about a fundamental revision of historical epistemology. So intense a concentration on the nature of history as a form of inquiry has diminished attention given to the thing that history inquires into: the nature of the past itself. Too readily, that entire domain has turned into a place for dreams, as Hayden White put it: a lost world only available now through the imagination of the author and subject to aesthetic whim. The next thirty years will, I propose, be the period in which ontology returns to the center of historical theory. And nothing short of the reconceptualization of the past-indeed of time itself-must be its objective. It must achieve that objective, moreover, in establishing arguments that are congruent with what revisions of epistemology have taught us about the limits of historical knowledge and the inevitability of textual representation. This paper enters this field by discussing some of the issues involved in rethinking the place of time in historical constructions since Bergson. It demonstrates the confusions inherent in spatial reductions of temporality, which historians have done so much to entrench rather than eradicate, and argues that historians have yet to accommodate the fundamental conceptual shifts inaugurated by Heidegger. It then moves to propose a methodological doctrine to which I have given the name "chronism" and seeks to sketch the utility of such a doctrine for bringing one form of presence-that of authenticity-back into the domain of historical study. Doing so invites a number of conceptual and practical difficulties that the paper will address in its conclusions; these may disturb those who have closed their minds to anything beyond the present. Taking ontology seriously interferes both with structuralist assumptions about the nothingness of time and with some of the styles of historical representation that have become fashionable in the postmodern climate. There may be painful lessons to b~<br>

Abstract: This article aims to explore aspects of the construction by scientific practice of historical-cultural differences. It aims as well to suggest ways to approach ethnic phenomena considering the need to place them historically, and to focus the cultural and political dimensions in new terms; in the challenge that ethnicity represents to today's world. The confrontation with humanity as 'the others' that is talked about, is partial. It is not with all 'humanity' but only with a part of it—substantial indeed—, a 'humanity' with specifities placed in a world divided in ethnocentric and unequal modes. This is the world that Geertz embraces what is 'not properly ours.' We can ask ourselves what is exactly 'properly ours' for those who say it. I add some obvious but forgotten dimensions: the place of the observer, the characteristics of the society where the perceptions and construction of otherness originate and are reproduced. Nowadays the idea of the importance of the 'racial factor', is newly again reinforced. Like in the United States and now in Europe. These differences, more than having a physical or cultural referent, have to do with the dimension of power and with social differences. Ethnicity has never been translated in only one discourse. Therefore, ethnicity should be seen as a process whose meanings can only be understood in context, evolving in the course of history in the specific social circumstances of a given people. Even more, the development of ethnic and class processes in the same social formation adds to the complexity of ethnic processual nature. The articulation of these two processes—ethnicity and class— and their contradictions can only be aprehended by observing the historical dimension in which these take place. By underlining the temporal depth of social processes, the 'ethnographic present' is displaced from this centre of analysis to be come 'a moment' in this processual flow. From this perspective ethnic phenomena are not anymore mere 'acci~<br>

Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which people who work in and use a cancer genetics clinic in the UK talk about the 'gene for cancer'. By conceptualizing such a gene as a boundary object, and using empirical data derived from clinic consultations, observations in a genetics laboratory and interviews with patients, the author seeks to illustrate how the various parties involved adopt different discursive strategies to appropriate, describe and understand what is apparently the 'same' thing. The consequent focus on the ways in which the rhetorical and syntactical features of lay and professional talk interlink and diverge illustrates not merely how our contemporary knowledge of genes and genetics is structured, but also how different publics position themselves with respect to the biochemistry of life.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines reasoning and rhetoric about economic recession in selected newspapers. This is an interesting topic for discourse analysis because it is a site of argumentation. We begin by asking: (1) epistemological questions (e.g. What evidential basis is drawn on in rhetoric about recession?) and then (2) ontological questions (e.g. How is recession pictured? and How is recession coordinated with the social world?). We examine the management of evidence and definitions concerning whether or not there is a recession. We then examine the entities invoked, showing how (a) a range of metaphors depict the recession as either an uncontrollable agent or as a controllable thing; and (b) rhetorical strategies used by both critics and supporters of the government collude in picturing the economy as a realm abstracted from social life.<br>

Abstract: In this essay I argue that Carvers story "A Small, Good Thing" can be read as an illustration of Albert Borgmann's argument that contemporary technological society conceals grace by encouraging the illusion than an individual can exert total control over her environment. The story shows how radical contingency punctures this illusion and offers potential for grace-filled communion with others through humble acts of hospitality. These humble acts—the small, good things of life together—parallel the giving and receiving of grace that takes place during the Eucharist.<br>

Abstract: Le symbole opère en signifiant et signifie en opérant. Pour fonder plus tard ce propos philosophique, il convient de revenir sur trois débats qui ont contribué à résoudre le sens du symbole dans l'éthique : la scission du symbole d'avec le signe, sa reprise dans le langage, son expulsion du sacré. Si l'on est conduit à redéfinir les droits, mais aussi les conditions et les modes d'une ontologie du symbole, on ne saurait négliger ce qui rend celui-ci possible : la culture. Identifiée à la structure signifiante et opérante du symbole, la culture s'entremet entre les capacités de symbolisation du vécu sensible et l'actualisation cognitive et pratique des symboles effectifs. The symbol operates by signifying and signifies by operating. In order to justify this philosophical affirmation, it is convenient to look back at three debates which have contributed to determining the sense of the symbol in ethics: the distinction between the symbol and the sign, the symbol's reintegration in language, and its expulsion from the domain of the sacred. If one is led to redefine not only the rights, but also the conditions and modes of an ontology of the symbol, then one may not neglect the thing which makes this possible: culture. Identified with the significant and operative structure of the symbol, culture places itself between the capacities for symbolisation of sensitive living, and the cognitive and practical actualisation of existing symbols.<br>

Abstract: A properly sociological definition of the concept of discourse does not exist because the notion has never been detached from the linguistic sphere. Not only linguists and semiologists, but also sociologists, use the word primarily as a linguistic category. This article attempts to define the concept of discourse sociologically. It is argued that a sociologically defined notion should be dissociated from the linguistic realm. As a linguistic category, 'discourse' is either used as a synonym for language or text, or is closely associated with one of these notions. 'Discourse' in a sociological sense should refer to a class of texts. This definition confers upon the concept of discourse an intertextual dimension. Defined in this way, the category can not only become an operative sociological concept, but it also becomes autonomous and is no longer reducible to linguistic or paralinguistic conceptual entities, such as text or language. No longer confined to the linguistic realm, the concept can designate a particular entity which possesses its own existence. Discourse can become a thing in itself. The argument is presented in three parts. The first is a critique of the current definitions of the concept 'discourse'. The second proposes, as an alternative, a sociological definition of discourse. Finally the third part applies this new definition in a sociological analysis of journalism.<br>

Abstract: Running through Apter's sometimes stark critique of an “entrepreneurial, bulimic” World Literature (3) is a parallel critique of the field of translation studies, both fields having become “too pluralistic, too ecumenical” while still remaining rooted in Eurocentric approaches and “unable to rework literary history through planetary cartographies” (8). World Literature and translation studies too readily take translation “to be a good thing
      en soi—under the assumption that it is a critical praxis enabling communication across languages, cultures, time periods, and disciplines” (8). Both fields, in Apter's view, have largely been blind to the recurrent realities of translation failure and the challenges of untranslatability, and so their practitioners have generally (even “inevitably”) fallen short of their cosmopolitan project of fostering international communication and understanding (7–8).<br>

Abstract: Gradually these symbols change. Where once they represented love and passion, they will be exchanged for resignation as in the “crushed flowers” and “fruit rinds” (109) at the end of the final party, the flower-laden hearse of Gatsby's funeral, or Gatsby's recollection of them: “He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is” (161). Likewise, now roses recall Robert Herrick's “Gather ye rosebuds while ye may” for Daisy when Gatsby leaves for the war:
         
               In J. S. Westbrook's words, “the world cannot be made to bloom perpetually”; it is as if there is “an over-ripeness, an unnatural plenitude in this new Eden” (81), or a “buried fertility” (83) that carries over into the last symbols of the vanished promises of the New Land.All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the Beale Street Blues while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the gray tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.

Abstract: Contrary to Aristotle's belief, other animals do imitate, and that contributes to their learning process. In Aristotle's understanding, though, humans raise imitation to the level of culture, to a thing that can be made (
         poesis), and that can be orchestrated for leisure and educational purposes. Humans are storytelling animals; the difference in human and animal imitation lies in our ability to re-create actions that can be imitated over and over and performed in multiple forms for our pleasure. This is where Aristotle places tragedy, which he defines as “an imitation of an action that is admirable, complete and possesses magnitude; in language made pleasurable, each of its species separated in different parts, performed by actors, not through narration; effecting through pity and fear the purification of such emotions” (10).<br>

Abstract: Of course, by the time SPEP was founded, the more blockheaded features of the logical empiricists' program were already losing their appeal. Rational reconstruction, the stress on theory verification but never theory discovery, the anachronistic habit of modeling all thinking on nineteenth-century physics, emotivism in ethics and politics—all the famous earmarks of twentieth-century positivism were being challenged. Yet we could see that these specific challenges were no great cause for optimism and certainly no occasion for celebrating anything like the rise of a real revolution in the philosophical mainstream.
      
            For one thing, much of the early opposition to logical empiricism involved criticizing its overt features by means of a silent acceptance of its underlying conception of philosophy itself, and it was this underlying ontological and epistemological sense of what is really real and how to think about it against which we were trying to access a lot of neglected things themselves.7<br>

Abstract: Another way of evoking the sense in which the person as fundamentally, if not adequately, what “I” refers to as a nonsortal reference is to consider the famous examples of teletransportation, as developed first by Derek Parfit but then marvelously elaborated on by Erich Klawonn, where through a glitch one finds oneself facing absolutely identical twins.
         
                  Initially it is a matter of facing the impossibility of distinguishing the ontological twins. Thus one might be convinced that the Leibnizian claim is false—that if we appear to be confronted with two cases of absolutely identical properties, then either we fail to single out the ultimate distinguishing property (where interchangeable places are not regarded as inherent distinguishing properties) or there is but one being there (a position to which Brentano was inclined). In short, one might well disagree that if there are two beings, there must be given distinguishing properties. But it is quite another thing to face, in the first person, one's, for example, James G. Hart's, ontological clone and have the indubitable blazing insight: “Whoever you are, and by whatever equal right you might have to call yourself James G. Hart, I am not you—and I apperceive you to be convinced that you are not me.” Here who one is, is not determined by properties or sortal determinations, which, by way of generously granting the hypothesis of the thought experiment, are identically the same, that is, have the same properties, in the two cases.31<br>

Abstract: I had spent the summer of 1960 studying Greek and working as a laundry truck driver for the Alert Laundry Company, who's cliental lived in the ghetto that surrounded the University of Chicago. That summer, of the thirteen laundry trucks of the Alert Laundry Company, twelve were robbed. Mine wasn't. I got to know everybody, including the robbers, who gave me a pass. That summer marked the beginning of an education that allowed me to see, firsthand, the real injustice of America, which in the course of events led to the civil rights movement, whose northern base was Chicago. Looking back over the events of my life I can say that although I was born in Iowa, I grew up in Chicago. Clearly, the University of Chicago provided me with a dual education: one that made it possible for me to earn academic degrees and another that afforded a set of experiences that transformed my life. As a result of all that, the changing times and the Chicago experience, much to the chagrin of those who hired me at Boston College, I began to teach a number of courses on social phenomenology (Schutz), attempting to do a kind of social philosophy, which, of course, was a very respectable thing, still being done today. Then in 1971 I went to Germany to perfect my German and by accident ended up at the University of Marburg (Phillips Universität Marbug), the most radical university in Germany at the time. There I was appropriately intimidated, mainly by German students, regarding my knowledge of political philosophy as it related to the most celebrated figure of the day, Karl Marx. I returned to Boston at the end of that summer harboring a passion for finding out what Marx was about. After reading several books on Marx I decided that he couldn't be as bad as his representatives portrayed him, and I started reading the man himself. Like many others I was seduced, converted, overwhelmed, transformed by the encounter, which led to a long struggle with the man and his work from which I never fully re~<br>

Abstract: In his later writings Gianni Vattimo's “weak thought” became a “death of God” theology, one that is rooted in a reading of Heidegger and Nietzsche and as such is continuous with what we have been calling “postmodern” theology and Continental philosophy.
            
                  But Badiou and Žižek represent a departure and a discontinuity, holding up the “postmodern” for scorn. They insist on the universality of truth and its clear separation from fiction and on the decisiveness of political action as opposed to “undecidability” and what they mock as an anemic “political correctness.” They advance “strong” metaphysical thinking, and they ridicule what they call a weak and flaccid postmodern play of signifiers. In their wake, a new generation of philosophers say that Continental philosophy has no future, at least not as we know it. They would regard the anniversary meeting as a memorial service, at which we were giving loving eulogies of the late lamented. Not only are the25

Abstract: The account of the aspect in Husserlian phenomenology is well known. With his theory of adumbrations, Husserl described how the perceived object is given in a one-sided, partial manner. The perception of its actual profile or aspect is given against the horizon of a set of potential perceptions of its other sides. Together these actual and potential perceptions are unified to form the sense of the thing that is perceived. For Deleuze, though, Husserl's account operates on the level of aftereffects because it does not ever consider the genesis or coming into being of the aspect itself. It is this event—the genesis of the aspect as such—that Deleuze's work brings to the fore. The Deleuzian aspect is separated from every figure and context. Think of it as being like the smile of the Cheshire Cat, which wanders away from the cat's body. This is not simply an imaginary or hallucinatory appearance; instead it indicates the genesis of a sensation prior to the work of figuration or its placement within a context. Every figure or form is a secondary coagulation or solidification of this primary sensation. To the extent that the aspect disarticulates itself from every position or background field, it can rightly be called an in-visible. This is how a minimal phenomenology approaches the invisible. That is, it approaches this minimal threshold of sense—the threshold that gives rise to sensation and conscious experience.<br>

Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: In a somewhat Nietzschean line of reasoning, the excess of the exaggerated falsehood, the hyperbolic lie, is the lie in/of the “truth,” which forces one into the violence of errant subjective (re)interpretation, the truth(s) in/of the lie. Hyperbole's figural expression exceeds the literal thing expressed, thereby marking the literal (in excess) as figure, and this errancy produces real, contextual change, for example, as “hyperbolic praxis” (Webb
         1993a), by dramatically moving toward a psychological and/or phenomenological transition. The errant formation reveals the instability at the center of what is attempting to be expressed. As Suzanne Guerlac (1990) suggests, hyperbole throws beyond the signified but also renders the signified a signifier, which signifies excess itself. It heightens the literal, exaggerates it, and throws beyond it in order to reveal its errancy and show its figurative nature, thereby allowing for a disruptive hermeneutical mode of thought that offers a transition from one way of perceiving the world to another.<br>

Abstract: For Ricoeur, there is something more originary than evil is radical, and that something is the goodness of creation, as attested to by the Genesis narrative at 1:31: “And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.”
         
               While Ricoeur refrains from interpreting the Bible literally, he does discern in the symbolic story of creation a bedrock affirmation of the human capability for the good that precedes metaphysics and history and resides at the uppermost limit of rational thought. And this attestation is expressly the testimony he chooses to stake his life and work on, even if it cannot be verified empirically. Without such a leap into the Kantian unknowable, without this wager on the elemental goodness of being, faith, hope, and meaning itself, Ricoeur maintains, would eternally elude the grasp of humankind. Hence, Ricoeur can agree that evil is primordial and still believe that something—the good—is even more primordial. In other words, Ricoeur starts from the premise that we are predisposed toward the good but have a propensity toward evil. This means, in effect, that the will, although corruptible, is not fundamentally corrupt. It has to be seduced, led astray, before it falls victim to evil. Thus, for Ricoeur, we do not come into the world as damaged goods; rather, we damage our intrinsic goodness through the imprudent deeds we later enact. To put Ricoeur's point another way, that we have fallen implies that we fell from somewhere, and that somewhere is just our original, untainted state of goodness. Moreover, the fact that we have fallen also intimates to Ricoeur that with effort we might be able to get up, that with exertion we might become upright once again in the ontological sense of reclaiming something approaching our initial moral wholesomeness.37<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>

Abstract: An obvious criticism of Burke's idea of rhetorical transcendence is that it is utopian in the unrealistic sense. It seems so abstract in its focus on generalized terminology and images that it may have no possible concrete object. Burke realized this utopian quality reminiscent of the lack of actualized topos in More's utopian “no-place.” As rhetorician James Zappen explains, “These acts of pure persuasion are devoid of partisan advantage-seeking but also devoid of persuasive purpose. As such, they might not even exist.”
      
               The important thing to take away from Burke's ramblings, though, is the humanistic sense that the search for perfection is inherent in human nature and that understanding this utopian impulse can only help us to live and to seek happiness in a world of competing power and advantage: “Let us observe, all about us, forever goading us, though it be in fragments, the motive that attains its ultimate identification in the thought, not of the universal holocaust, but of the universal order…. [E]ach kind strives toward the perfection of its kind, and so toward the kind next above it, while the strivings of the entire series head in God as the beloved cynosure and ninecure, the end of all desire.”35

            GodBurke means an ultimate ideal transcending all other symbols and fulfilling all desire—the kind of nirvana that would eliminate the need for further utopia-making altogether. This, of course, is not achievable in the course of history, but the mythic experience of it would activate a downward movement in the process, bringing the transcendent ideals back into the pragmatic world of discourse and human affairs. This would be the function of utopia in Burkean terms, and it would result in a habit of mind that would amount to a large-scale educational scheme—dare I say, the education of desires. If the young were informed of the dialectical-rhetorical process of transcendence from the beginning, ~<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>

Abstract: The crossroads of the end of Utopia (apparently ensured by the fall of the Berlin Wall and Soviet Russia), the end of the world (apparently easier to imagine than an alternative to capitalism), and capitalism itself (which is apparently eternal) seems an apt place to turn toward the problem of degenerate Utopia and the city, which, after all, pretty much amount to the same thing in our time. Louis Marin's proposition is that “a degenerate utopia is ideology changed into the form of a myth.”
         
               Arguably, one such myth is capitalism. Another might be modernity or modernism, and a third could be the inevitability of the contemporary city as the concretization of capitalist realism. However, the cities that most of us inhabit could conceivably be construed as Utopias by neoliberals, as constituting the best of all possible worlds for the spread of free markets, or equally so by anti-utopians, who might see in the modern city Utopia realized, that is, dystopia. In any event, and whatever one's preconceived notion of Utopia might be, the contemporary city stands primarily as confirmation “of the impotence of corporate capital to generate a socially cohesive environment.”29
            
               As such, it is also arguably no Utopia, which persists as an open project to be imagined and realized, sometime and somewhere in the future, in the footsteps of present efforts to define Utopia for architecture and the city and to establish its spaces.30<br>
