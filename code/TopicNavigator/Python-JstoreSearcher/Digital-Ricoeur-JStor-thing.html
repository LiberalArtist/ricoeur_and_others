  5  Going Public with Privatization from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt16wd0hf">Invoking the Invisible Hand</a><br>
  Abstract: In a press conference two days after his election to a second term, President Bush assessed the import of his victory: “I earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it.” President Bush interpreted the election results as a clear expression of public opinion. Through their votes, citizens indicated their support for his policy agenda: “After hundreds of speeches and three debates and interviews and the whole process, where you keep basically saying the same thing over and over again, that—when you win, there is a feeling that the people have spoken and embraced<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) COLLIER IVY D.<br>
  Abstract: There are a great many reasons why animals could be found buried that may have nothing to do with a relationship with a person. For example, animals could be buried after a sacrifice (the animal was killed but was left whole); the animal could have died of natural causes (it may have<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) VELDKAMP ELMER<br>
  Abstract: In residential neighborhoods in Korea up until the 1980s, dog buyers would roam the area calling out “Sell your dogs, sell your dogs!,” indicating their willingness to pay for privately kept dogs as a source of meat. For many, the divide between pets and nonpets was not a clear-cut line, and the death of dogs, cats, and other animals was not considered something to mourn for.<br>

  Mourning for Animals: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) FAWCETT ANNE<br>
  Abstract: I always wanted to work with animals, but the euthanasia of our fifteen-year-old cat when I was fourteen catalyzed that ambition. My grief and sense of helplessness were overwhelming. I can still feel tears stinging my cheeks as I walked into school knowing that the cat I grew up with was being taken to the vet to be “put to sleep” and I could do nothing to save her.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1d10hh7">Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy</a><br>
  Abstract: When I first began to study rhetoric, some forty or so years ago, the terms “substance” and “theory” occupied privileged positions in disciplinary consciousness. “Substance” referred to content or subject matter, and in this pre-postdisciplinary scheme of things, scholars were supposed to work within bounded and clearly differentiated domains of inquiry. A discipline, that is, needed to have a proper subject, and since scholarship demanded rationally refined, systematically organized abstract principles that stood above and apart from particulars, the study of an academic subject required the use of “theory.” In the quasi discipline then known as speech (

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1d10hh7">Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy</a><br>
  Abstract: My assignment was to review the articles on rhetorical theory that appeared in the speech communication journals during the years 1976 and 1977. Although the editor provided a list of the relevant journals, I was left to my own devices in selecting the articles that fell under the heading of rhetorical theory. I approached this task with profound reservations, since, as we all know through bitter experience, rhetorical theory is virtually impossible to define. Thus, I was afraid that I would either have to report on everything in the journals or appear to be arbitrary.<br>

  Author(s) Sachs Andrew<br>
  Abstract: Thirty-five years ago, in his classic essay “The Study of Speeches,” Wayland Maxfield Parrish argued that critics ought to isolate and carefully evaluate the “content” of a speech. This “often difficult task” required separating “
                  whatwas said fromhowit was said,” a matter best done “by making a summary or précis of the speaker’s thought which avoids the wording of the original.”¹ Holding consistently to this dualism between wording and content, Parrish regarded style as “another” aspect of persuasion, something to be set off from the rest of the critical apparatus.

  Instrumental and Constitutive Rhetoric in Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail” from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1d10hh7">Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy</a><br>
  Author(s) Utley Ebony A.<br>
  Abstract: Almost thirty years ago, in an essay devoted to the
                  Autobiography of Malcolm X, Thomas Benson commented that rhetoric is, among other things, a way of constituting the self within a scene composed of “exigencies, constraints, others and the self,” and it is also a resource for “exercising control over self, others, and by extension the scene.”¹ Thus, Benson assigns rhetoric a dual function. It is simultaneously generative and instrumental, since it helps to constitute the identity of self, other, and scene, while it also pulls these identities within the orbit of situated interests. Moreover, once this duality is acknowledged,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1d10hh7">Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy</a><br>
  Abstract: I have two purposes in writing this paper. The first and primary objective follows a conventional agenda in historical and critical studies: it is to contribute something to our understanding of Lincoln’s influence on late nineteenth-century American oratory. That influence is so broad and so obvious that it would seem to command attention, but, so far as I know, no one has yet studied the matter in any detail.¹ This paper, then, attempts to help fill a gap in the historical scholarship.<br>

  Kenneth Burke in the Classroom from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1d10hh7">Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy</a><br>
  Abstract: Of all the lessons I have learned from Kenneth Burke, none is more valuable than what he shows and tells about irony. For Burke, irony is not simply a strategy that allows us to say one thing when we mean something else. Instead, irony becomes a point of coalescence between strategy and substance—a way of talking and thinking that simultaneously constructs, engages, and alters our encounters in the social world. Among other things, Burkean irony suggests a way for us to teach rhetoric rhetorically, and that is the issue I want to explore in this paper.<br>

As Jo Sprague said, in her letter attempting to orient today’s speakers, not so long ago we were quite confident that we knew what theory was and how to use it as teachers.

  Abstract: When I first began to study rhetoric, some forty or so years ago, the terms “substance” and “theory” occupied privileged positions in disciplinary consciousness. “Substance” referred to content or subject matter, and in this pre-postdisciplinary scheme of things, scholars were supposed to work within bounded and clearly differentiated domains of inquiry. A discipline, that is, needed to have a proper subject, and since scholarship demanded rationally refined, systematically organized abstract principles that stood above and apart from particulars, the study of an academic subject required the use of “theory.” In the quasi discipline then known as speech (

  Abstract: My assignment was to review the articles on rhetorical theory that appeared in the speech communication journals during the years 1976 and 1977. Although the editor provided a list of the relevant journals, I was left to my own devices in selecting the articles that fell under the heading of rhetorical theory. I approached this task with profound reservations, since, as we all know through bitter experience, rhetorical theory is virtually impossible to define. Thus, I was afraid that I would either have to report on everything in the journals or appear to be arbitrary.<br>

  Author(s) Utley Ebony A.<br>
  Abstract: Almost thirty years ago, in an essay devoted to the
                  Autobiography of Malcolm X, Thomas Benson commented that rhetoric is, among other things, a way of constituting the self within a scene composed of “exigencies, constraints, others and the self,” and it is also a resource for “exercising control over self, others, and by extension the scene.”¹ Thus, Benson assigns rhetoric a dual function. It is simultaneously generative and instrumental, since it helps to constitute the identity of self, other, and scene, while it also pulls these identities within the orbit of situated interests. Moreover, once this duality is acknowledged,<br>

  Kenneth Burke in the Classroom from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1d10hh7">Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy</a><br>
  Abstract: Of all the lessons I have learned from Kenneth Burke, none is more valuable than what he shows and tells about irony. For Burke, irony is not simply a strategy that allows us to say one thing when we mean something else. Instead, irony becomes a point of coalescence between strategy and substance—a way of talking and thinking that simultaneously constructs, engages, and alters our encounters in the social world. Among other things, Burkean irony suggests a way for us to teach rhetoric rhetorically, and that is the issue I want to explore in this paper.<br>

  Abstract: When the term
                  sacrificeis used to designate practices common to various world religions and used to designate a historical scapegoat at the founding of a social order, are we referring to the same thing? Perhaps not. Th e sacrifi ce of which the Girard school speaks applies to any social order—whether a political order, an ideological organization, a social movement, or such—not merely to an established religious tradition.¹ So, let us pose the question: What is the value of Girardian theory? Is it to illuminate the religious concept of sacrifice or to illuminate human nature in general?<br>

  Abstract: Girard’s reflections have led us to recognize sacred violence as the foundation of Western culture. Sacred violence, in turn, has its roots in mimetic conflicts: the rivals are brothers who are both brought closer and divided by something they both desire. I have also argued that mimetic rivalry is the engine that drives all intellectual symbolism. Thus, the “figure” that represents that symbolism better than any other is that of enemy brothers, who are brothers precisely because they are enemies (or made alike by their reciprocal violent rivalry) and enemies precisely because they are brothers (or rivals inasmuch as each<br>

However, beyond a doubt, I know that our early life experiences shape our lives in profound ways.

Hecate’s words are thus paradoxical, unless one is a critic of the security culture itself. Shakespeare and his contemporaries, however, although they had begun to use the word also in something like its modern sense, knew a different meaning based on the word's Latin etymology.Securityderives fromse<br>

  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: The realist is right about one thing: Much of the time, international politics boils down to strategy. The calculation of advantage in the game of nations is the first condition, the final necessity, and—not to be underestimated—the continuing attraction for those who presume to be players. Therefore, it is not enough for post-realists to articulate a broader conception of scientific inquiry; if we are to move beyond realism, we shall have to provide decision makers with better instruments for strategic analysis. It may seem that these two objectives are mutually contradictory. For example, the post-realist perspective exemplifies the<br>

  Book Title: The Genesis of Desire-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Webb Eugene<br>
  Abstract: We seem to be abandoning the codes that told previous generations who they should love. But now that many of us are free to choose whoever we want, nothing is less certain. The proliferation of divorces and separations reveal a dynamic we would rather not see: others sometimes reject us as passionately as we are attracted to them.Our desire makes us sick. The throes of rivalry are at the heart of our attraction to one another. This is the central thesis of Jean-Michel Oughourlian's
      The Genesis of Desire, where the war of the sexes is finally given a scientific explanation. The discovery of mirror neurons corroborates his ideas, clarifying the phenomena of empathy and the mechanisms of violent reciprocity.How can a couple be saved when they have declared war on one another? By helping them realize that desire originates not in the self but in the other. There are strategies that can help, which Dr. Oughourlian has prescribed successfully to his patients. This work, alternating between case studies and more theoretical statements, convincingly defends the possibility that breakups need not be permanent.<br>

  Book Title: Christianity and the Mass Media in America-Toward a Democratic Accommodation<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schultze Quentin J.<br>
  Abstract: The mass media and religious groups in America regularly argue about news bias, sex and violence on television, movie censorship, advertiser boycotts, broadcast and film content rating systems, government regulation of the media, the role of mass evangelism in a democracy, and many other issues. In the United States the major disputes between religion and the media usually have involved Christian churches or parachurch ministries, on the one hand, and the so-called secular media, on the other. Often the Christian Right locks horns with supposedly liberal Eastern media elite and Hollywood entertainment companies. When a major Protestant denomination calls for an economic boycott of Disney, the resulting news reports suggest business as usual in the tensions between faith groups and media empires.Schultze demonstrates how religion and the media in America have borrowed each other's rhetoric. In the process, they have also helped to keep each other honest, pointing out respective foibles and pretensions. Christian media have offered the public as well as religious tribes some of the best media criticism- better than most of the media criticism produced by mainstream media themselves. Meanwhile, mainstream media have rightly taken particular churches to task for misdeeds as well as offered some surprisingly good depictions of religious life.The tension between Christian groups and the media in America ultimately is a good thing that can serve the interest of democratic life. As Alexis de Tocqueville discovered in the 1830s, American Christianity can foster the "habits of the heart" that ward off the antisocial acids of radical individualism. And, as John Dewey argued a century later, the media offer some of our best hopes for maintaining a public life in the face of the religious tribalism that can erode democracy from within. Mainstream media and Christianity will always be at odds in a democracy. That is exactly the way it should be for the good of each one.<br>

  Abstract: In 1995 Americans witnessed a remarkable technological feat as the Hubble space telescope captured images of the planet Mars and broadcast them via satellites and cable to viewers around the world. As the photographs were shown on television and printed in newspapers, journalists began reporting that Americans saw meaningful images in them—like the interpretations of inkblot designs. ʺPictures taken by the … telescope have created a phenomenon of sorts,ʺ said CNN television news anchor Lou Waters, ʺwith folks calling in, saying that they see something in these pictures that perhaps others of us do not see.

  Abstract: AS A MODERN FIELD OF study, Ottoman historiography is unusual, primarily because of its ambivalent relation to that hegemon of hyper-reality, Europe—finding and placing itself both within and without. For much of its existence, the Ottoman Empire was dominated (demographically, economically, politically, ideologically) by its provinces in regions considered now geographically as part of Europe. This is something Ottoman authors oft en remarked upon when discussing the divisions of European geography, which the Well-Protected Domains straddled.<br>

(See Vico, above, p. 4.) Of the prevalence of such a mythopoetic mode in a larger human history, he wrote: ʺThe antiquities of every Nation under Heaven, is no less sacred than that of the Jews.

  Abstract: Durkheim (1858–1917) has exerted a major and continuing influence on contemporary social theory (structural-functionalism, structuralism, etc.) through his investigations of the relation of social to mental structures. In ʺnon-alienatedʺ simple societies, he viewed this relationship as an instance of ʺcollective mindʺ—as when he and Marcel Mauss wrote: ʺLogical relations are in a sense domestic relations … and the unity of knowledge is nothing else than the unity of the collectivity extended to the universeʺ (1963:84). Durkheim brings to the present context an emphasis on thecollectivenature of tribal ritual and art, leading, from our perspective, toward later<br>

The band, of course, acknowledged the fundamental role of improvisation in its music—one could say it was part of the bandʹs DNA. Jerry Garcia said, ʺWe don’t improvise out of choice! We improvise because we donʹt have any choice! Itʹs not as though we could play anything exactly the same as we played it last night because weʹre incapable. So, improvisation, for us, is not an option, itʹs our coloration, itʹs our personality.ʺ²<br>

  Abstract: Dante Alighieri would have known a thing or two about anger. While he was representing the White Guelfs in a diplomatic mission to Pope Boniface VIII, the Black Guelfs seized control of Florence with the pope’s support and set in motion a campaign of revenge against the Whites, who had participated in the previous government. In January 1302 Dante was sentenced in absentia by the Florentine
                  podestàfor “graft, embezzlement, opposition to the pope and Charles of Valois, disturbance of the peace of Florence, and turning over control of Pistoia to the Whites with the resultant expulsion of the Blacks”;<br>

To such readers, the philosophical discussion may appear repetitive of Marco Lombardo’s statements on free will and the soul in Canto XVI; moreover, there is nothing in Canto XVIII to match Marco’s engaging image of the

  Abstract: A concern with time is intrinsic to the internal logic of modernity. “More than anything else,” Zygmunt Bauman writes, modernity is the “history of time: the time when time has history” (“Time and Space Reunited,” 172). Radically breaking with the authority and legitimacy of the past, modernity offers a totalizing vision of progress toward an illimitable future.¹ Its universal narrative of irrepressible global development presupposes a uniform scale of spatial and temporal measurement. In this context the legislative creation of world standard time at the International Prime Meridian Conference of 1884 stands as a signal moment in the history of<br>

  Abstract: This is a book about musical hermeneutics. A generation ago, no one would have wanted to write it. Music by nature seemed to rule it out. Music did not seem to mean the way other things do if it seemed to mean at all. This book tries to show why and how that situation has changed—changed dramatically. Each chapter examines a different concept or practice associated with the deceptively simple phrase
                  interpreting music. Hermeneutics is the art of interpretation. What do we do when we interpret music? What do we learn by doing it? What is at stake? Why<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapter frankly acknowledged the limitations, even the banality, of much of what we say about music, and it defended those qualities for what we can make of them. The give-and-take of speech acts in the imaginary dialogue about Mendelssohn’s concerto helps point the way to something more resonant, but we need to go further in that direction. We want, I assume, to articulate meaning, not just approximate it, as much so with music as with anything else. We need a reason to trust our interpretive statements. On the basis of the last chapter, again, we can surmise that<br>

This object, which is also half a subject, appears now and again in transitional spaces, “the attic, the stairway, the halls, the foyer,” attracting annoyance and affection in equal measure. Its shape, which is no shape, lies somewhere between that of a star and a spool. It is not only equivocal in itself but set equivocally between the banal (a typographical mark; a spindle for the threads that dangle<br>

  [PART THREE Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnncj">Reason to Believe</a><br>
  Abstract: An adequate theory of cultural agency needs both a nonreductionist concept of culture as something that can have an independent impact and a concept of human agency in which people can adopt cultural meanings because they understand these impacts. I have argued that such a theory can be built on the concept of imaginative rationality. In some situations people may certainly create meanings in order to avoid or escape from their problematic experiences, as neo-Marxists would have it. However, the Evangelical men studied here seem to create meanings in order to confront problematic experiences. These decisions to believe are made<br>

  CHAPTER 8  Toward a Relational Pragmatic Theory of Cultural Agency from:

  Abstract: My analysis suggests that the distinctions social scientists make between empowerment and moral order, self-interest and morality, calculation and contemplation need to be rethought. Among Evangelical men in Caracas, religion does not begin with disinterest. It begins with dis-ease that is consciously and rationally addressed through religious practice. And this pragmatic quality does nothing to challenge its viability or its sincerity. The smiles and tears, courage and fear are all real. It would be a mistake to regard this as unique to Latin American Evangelicalism. I suspect any close review of empirical research on contemporary religious and cultural practices around<br>

In the winter of 2009, something akin to Von Hofmannsthal’s “inexplicable condition” afflicted me.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnqs7">The Language of the Gods in the World of Men</a><br>
  Abstract: It is obvious that we cannot analyze the history of vernacularization—the term used here for the literary and political promotion of local language—or even observe it taking place, without knowing precisely what it is we are trying to observe and analyze. If we are concerned with the transition from quasi-universal to more regional ways of being in the spheres of culture and power, we will pay attention to, among other things, the ways people began to produce texts that were local rather than translocal in body and spirit—in their language and spheres of circulation as well as<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnqs7">The Language of the Gods in the World of Men</a><br>
  Abstract: One particular mode of theorizing and explaining culture implicitly rejects, or is entirely indifferent to, both culture’s evolutionary development and its purely instrumental contribution to power. Instead, culture is viewed as something just there, and as ever self-identical. It is considered outside the flux of time, whether natural or political, or else endowed with so deep a history as to appear forever beyond time. And its stance in relationship to power is presumed to be almost one of consanguinity, certainly not that of an object to be deployed at the will of power.<br>

  Abstract: Few things seem as natural as the multiplicity of vernacular languages used for making sense of life through texts—that is, for making literature. And few things seem as unnatural as their gradual disappearance in the present, especially from the pressures exerted by globalizing English. Literary-language loss is in fact often viewed as part of a more general reduction of diversity in a cultural ecosystem, a loss considered as dangerous as the reduction of biological diversity, to which—in another instance of cultural naturalization—it is often compared. Today’s homogenization of culture, of which language loss is one aspect, seems<br>

  Abstract: Where does Plato come into our scheme of things? With him we are dealing with a thinker who carefully worked out a cosmology and eschatology of rebirth. I doubt that he would have done so had he not personally believed in its truth, and, for me, it is senseless to convert figures like the Buddha and Plato into figures of the European Enlightenment or, as some do, into modern and postmodern thinkers. Plato was not interested in conversion, but he addressed his message to those willing to listen, which for the most part meant the members of his academy. Nevertheless,<br>

  Abstract: The story of Jezebel’s violent death belongs among the cold accounts of bloody wars, battles, and massacres in the Old Testament. Despite the frequency of similar stories, there is something especially disturbing about Jezebel’s slaughter by men who then “eat and drink,” thereby treating her murder as a routine task that does not involve emotion. Bloch, who was attracted to the savagery of some Old Testament stories and who, as his opera

  Abstract: The title of this collection is derived from Friedrich Nietzsche’s essay “On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life.”¹ The central argument of this passionate work, judiciously qualified, reflects my own deepest convictions about the value of historical scholarship. Nietzsche opened his essay with a quotation from Goethe: “I hate everything that merely instructs me without augmenting or directly invigorating my activity.” This meant to him that a vital historiography must serve the “life and action” of society. There is, Nietzsche argued, a “natural relationship of an age, a culture, a nation with its history—evoked by hunger, regulated<br>

  Abstract: Central to the great upheavals marking the transition between the medieval and the modern world were profound disagreements about the nature of order, whether in the social and political realm, in the church, in the cosmos, or in the exalted spheres of metaphysics. High medieval culture, broadly speaking, had tended toward a unified and hierarchical conception of order which assigned to all men, experiences, places, things, and ideas their appropriate positions in a vast, graded system of values. Conversely the attack on medieval civilization at its deepest level, operating simultaneously in both the material and ideal realms, was directed at<br>

  Abstract: Since the peculiar mixture of responsibility and presumption in the title of my paper will scarcely have escaped the notice of this distinguished audience, I feel some need to explain at the outset that it represents an assignment on the part of those who planned our meeting. The significance of the problems to which it points is suggested by the great historians who have grappled with it in the past, albeit (a fact that should constitute something of a warning) with somewhat contrary results, among them Michelet, Dilthey, and Troeltsch.¹ Its practical importance lies in the need of most of<br>

  Abstract: Those of us who are troubled by the confusion in contemporary education, perhaps especially if we continue to believe in a liberal or general education, are sometimes tempted to look to the past for guidance. But the lessons of history are rarely unambiguous. For one thing, its messages are various. Like Scripture, it can generally be made to support what we want it to support; and in the case of education, the Western cultural tradition incorporates not just one but a whole scries of educational ideals, which rest on quite different assumptions and point in different directions.

  Abstract: The impression that the humanities are now in special trouble—perhaps even, as we sometimes say, in a “crisis”—is widespread among teachers in the traditional humanistic disciplines, and it is doubtless true that we have immediate grounds for concern. After a period of remarkable expansion and exuberance in higher education, when there were students enough for us all, enrollments are declining; and students, worried about the future, seem to be drifting into programs better designed to prepare them for jobs than anything we have to offer. This essay is directed, however, not to this immediately distressing situation, but to<br>

  Abstract: It is a curious reflection on the historical profession that I have only once been invited to express my views about the teaching of history. There is something distinctly odd about this. Our society, after all, supports us not simply because we are historians, but primarily because we are
                  teachersof history. It does so on the assumption that we are the guardians, not simply of a professional discipline, but of something that, in a deep sense, belongs to society itself, something precious and even essential to its life, with which we have been entrusted not only to preserve and<br>

  Abstract: I would first like briefly to justify the theme I have chosen, namely: “from word to concept.” The subject matter is a topic belonging both to philosophy and to hermeneutics. In truth, concepts are really one of the distinguishing marks of philosophy. Indeed, philosophy first entered Western culture in this form. For this reason the concept is the first thing I would like to discuss. Of one thing I am sure: the concept, which very often presents itself as something strange and demanding, must begin to speak if it is to be really grasped. For this reason I would first<br>

  Abstract: In a book called

It may seem that the so-called “analytic” tradition in philosophy—the tradition that goes back to Frege and Russell and whose most prominent living representatives are Quine, Davidson, Dummett, and Putnam—must return a negative answer. For that tradition is often thought of as a sort of public relations agency for the natural sciences.<br>

  Abstract: My purpose in what follows is to take up the relation of hermeneutics and ethics as it emerges in a post-Heideggerian philosophical context. In terms of proper names this means giving an account of the conceptual symmetries and differences between Gadamer’s philosophical hermeneutics and Emmanuel Levinas’s ethical theory, which is sometimes called an ethics of alterity or of responsibility, in order to contrast it with subject-centered theories that emphasize thinking and acting in accord with rules, principles, duties, codes, beliefs, teachings, communities, theories of the right and the good, and so on, where to be in accord with such things,<br>

  Author(s) MARSHALL DONALD G.<br>
  Abstract: The terms “conversation” and “dialogue” lie at the heart of Hans-Georg Gadamer’s description of understanding. In a phrase that draws together many lines of his thought, he speaks of “the conversation that we ourselves are” (TM378).¹ Although “understanding a text and reaching an understanding in a conversation” appear to be very different (TM378), Gadamer’s analysis enables the insight that describing “the task of hermeneutics as entering into dialogue with the text” is “more than a metaphor” (TM368). To understand something is to reach an understanding with another about it, and that can only be achieved through a conversation that sustains<br>

  Abstract: Ronald Beiner’s contribution to this collection strikes me as particularly far reaching, especially with respect to his argument that Gadamer avoids “the labyrinth of esotericism.” Beiner contends that unlike Nietzsche, Derrida, Heidegger, and even Strauss, Gadamer does not try to “read under or though or behind the text.” That is, he does not assume that “the ‘subtext’ is more meaningful than the text.” For this reason, according to Beiner, Gadamer must be (for better or worse) excluded from the ranks of postmodern thinkers.

  Author(s) Palmer Richard E.<br>
  Abstract: I would first like briefly to justify the theme I have chosen, namely: “from word to concept.” The subject matter is a topic belonging both to philosophy and to hermeneutics. In truth, concepts are really one of the distinguishing marks of philosophy. Indeed, philosophy first entered Western culture in this form. For this reason the concept is the first thing I would like to discuss. Of one thing I am sure: the concept, which very often presents itself as something strange and demanding, must begin to speak if it is to be really grasped. For this reason I would first<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pp75p">Gadamer’s Repercussions</a><br>
  Author(s) RORTY RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: In a book called
                     Reason in the Age of Science,Hans-Georg Gadamer asked the question: Can “philosophy” refer to anything nowadays except the theory of science?¹ His own answer to this question is affirmative. It may seem that the so-called “analytic” tradition in philosophy—the tradition that goes back to Frege and Russell and whose most prominent living representatives are Quine, Davidson, Dummett, and Putnam—must return a negative answer. For that tradition is often thought of as a sort of public relations agency for the natural sciences.<br>

Many churches operating in Zimbabwe, including several independent churches, support the BSZ. Kambarami estimates that since 1980 the BSZ has distributed over three million copies of Scripture, or about one Bible for every four Zimbabweans alive today.

Fredric Jameson suggests that we never really encounter textual meaning “as a thing-in-itself. Rather, texts come before us as the alwaysalready-read; we apprehend them through sedimented layers of previous interpretations, or—if the text is brand-new—through the sedimented reading habits and categories developed by those inherited interpretive traditions.”¹ Stanley Fish further observes that some interpretations, for a variety of reasons, succeed so<br>

The Berlin Wall had fallen in November 1989, but there was already a widespread feeling of frustration concerning the newly conjoined Germanies. Many in both east and west wondered aloud whether things might be better if the wall were still standing. In the former East Germany, and in Berlin in particular, violence against foreigners had increased; there had been murders, and tensions had increased to the point that the federal border police had been called in to provide security on the Berlin subways.

  Abstract: The late historian Albert Hourani once remarked that the Arabs are looking at themselves with eyes given to them by Europe. In a way, this is a study of these “eyes” and the things they saw, failed to see, or chose to ignore. By talking about eyes, Hourani aimed at something more substantial than a mere perspective or view. These eyes were nothing but new categories of knowledge, such as geography, anthropology, sociology, and, the subject of this book, the modern European tradition of making sense of the past. When this European historiography presented itself to the Middle East, it<br>

  Abstract: The tales of the neighborhood that have been the focus of this book tell about the “neighborhood” of the Galilee in the first half of the first millennium of the Common Era. This neighborhood was at the time the birthing-ground for major religious and cultural formations that would prove consequential for many groups and peoples on a number of continents. Our entry into this milieu through the concept of a neighborhood has stressed small-scale processes, such as human relations and everyday life, rather than the major events of the period.

  Abstract: This is a book about Jean-Luc Godard’s late work, in particular the films and videos he has made since the late 1980s. It is also a book about the place of aesthetics in cinema, and about the persistence of modernism, political radicalism, and late nineteenth-century artistic and philosophical concerns into the end of the twentieth century. Last, it is a book about how all these things go together, about the way Godard’s films and videos make use of this inheritance and in so doing transform it in and for the cinema.<br>

  Abstract: The closing moments of

In case we weren’t sure to whom the sequence was referring, Godard includes a black-and-white photograph of his own face, weaving it in and out of the other images before slowly resolving on it. This final sequence suggests an end both to cinema itself and to Godard’s career—and, more than anything else,<br>

  1  Avoiding the Void: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt2jcbw8">The Fate of Place</a><br>
  Abstract: Following Nietzsche’s admonition, in
                  The Genealogy of Morals,that “man would sooner have the void for his purpose than be void of purpose,”¹ there is an area of human experience in which, indeed, the void plays a constitutive and recognized role. This occurs in theories of creation that concern themselves with how things came into being in the first place. “In the first place”: a quite problematic posit. For if there is a cosmic moment in which nothingsyet exist, it would seem thatplacescould not exist at that “time” either. Although places are not things in any<br>

  Abstract: Once we admit that the panic-producing idea of the void is always (in advance) a matter of place—and is thus not reducible to the daunting nothingness, the strict no—place, that occasions the panic—we must face a second major issue. This is the propensity not merely to fill the void as a way of allaying anxiety but, more especially, to
                  masterthe void. To master is not to bring into being in the first place but to control and shape that which has already been brought into existence. It is still a matter of creation, at least in<br>

  Abstract: Part of the perennial appeal of Aristotle’s conception of place as something confining and confined is doubtless the philosophical support it offers to human beings’ longing for cozy quarters—not merely for adequate shelter but for boundaries that embrace, whether these boundaries belong to decorated rooms in the home or to indecorous glades in the forest primeval. But human beings (and doubtless other animals) also long for wide open spaces and thus for lack of containment, perhaps even for limitlessness. The cozy can be

                  the whole world(Le., the physical cosmos as one entity) can move. And if the world moves,in what, into what,does it move? These questions vexed philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages—construing this period as the entire era stretching between A.D. 600 (a date that marks the demise of Hellenistic and Neoplatonic philosophy) and A.D. 1500 (when the Renaissance was fully alive in Italy).

  Abstract: We have just witnessed a revealing vacillation—by no means the first we have encountered—between an absolutist and a relativist conception of space: between the view that space is one vast (and usually empty) arena and the alternative view that it consists entirely in relations between things. Descartes, in attempting to do justice to both conceptions by his distinction between internal and external place, ends by doing justice to neither. His compromise is as unsatisfying as were earlier middle-ground solutions to the problem of the void (e.g., the idea of the world as a finite plenary presence surrounded by<br>

  Abstract: Leibniz displayed a special alertness to the metaphor of

Far from being something merely mechanistic, the organic body of the monad—which we have seen to be intimately tied to place—is a “living being” or “divine machine.”¹ Since every monad is in effect a world filled with monads at increasingly minuscule levels, organicity extends to everything in the end: “There is a world of creatures, living beings, animals, entelechies, souls, in the smallest particle of matter.”² Hence every bit of matter can be compared to a pond filled with<br>

  Abstract: The most effective way to appreciate the importance of place again is not to approach it as a total phenomenon, to compare its virtues en bloc to those of space in a single systematic treatment. Such a totalizing treatment would lead to nothing but vacant generalities. What is needed is a new and quite particular

  Abstract: Australian historical fiction tends to fall into some dominant categories, reflecting perennial themes that are forever being reinterpreted: first settlement, European inland exploration, pastoralism, conflict with Indigenous Australians, patriotism and war are common themes of Australian historical fiction.

  Abstract: Today, the study of sexuality brings together scholars from a wide variety of disciplines – history, politics, literature, religion, the arts, psychology, anthropology, medicine, and biology. At its best, this interdisciplinary work promotes critical self-reflection on disciplinary assumptions about sexuality and the data used to test those assumptions: Is there such a thing as a fixed sexuality and how would one prove its existence? Such questions have arisen ever since the emergence of the concept of ‘sexuality’ at the end of the eighteenth century.

  Abstract: Scholars have spilled a lot of ink criticizing Bultmann’s program of demythologizing on the grounds that it ignores the truths that myths, particularly those associated with Christian faith, are uniquely able to communicate. The truth of myth is played off against demythologizing as if the latter rejects myth
                  simpliciter. One often hears that demythologizing is merely the extrication of the kerygma from the shackles of myth on the assumption that Bultmann views everything associated with the label of myth as primitive falsehood.

  Book Title: Lyric Apocalypse: Milton, Marvell, and the Nature of Events-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Netzley Ryan<br>
  Abstract: What's new about the apocalypse? Revelation does not allow us to look back after the end and enumerate pivotal turning points. It happens in an immediate encounter with the transformatively new. John Milton's and Andrew Marvell's lyrics attempt to render the experience of such an apocalyptic change in the present. In this respect they take seriously the Reformation's insistence that eschatology is a historical phenomenon. Yet these poets are also reacting to the Regicide, and, as a result, their works explore very modern questions about the nature of events, what it means for a significant historical occasion to happen. Lyric Apocalypse argues that Milton's and Marvell's lyrics challenge any retrospective understanding of events, including one built on a theory of revolution. Instead, these poems show that there is no "after" to the apocalypse, that if we are going to talk about change, we should do so in the present, when there is still time to do something about it. For both of these poets, lyric becomes a way to imagine an apocalyptic event that would be both hopeful and new.<br>

This is a particularly pressing question for a poem that promises (and, in its 1645 version, celebrates) the fall of its enemies and a future world of new pastures, all in the process of commemorating a friend’s death.

Modern popular psychology to the contrary, closure and resolution are actually quite easy, insofar as they turn the world into a series of problems to be solved, riddles to be unraveled. Ending is difficult, for humans at least, because it entails stopping something without being recognized for doing so, either with the praise of one’s fellows or the spoils of victory in a strategic contest. The modern discomfort with endings can be encapsulated in one concept: the “postapocalyptic.” The postapocalyptic, no matter how horrific, promises us that the<br>

  Abstract: How can cradling, handling, or rubbing a text be said, ethically, to have made something happen? What, as readers or interpreters, may come off in our hands in as we maculate or mark the books we read? For Adam Zachary Newton, reading is anembodied practice wherein "ethics" becomes a matter of tact in the doubled sense of touch and regard. With the image of the book lying in the hands of its readers as insistent refrain, To Make the Hands Impure cuts a provocative cross-disciplinary swath through classical Jewish texts, modern Jewish philosophy, film and performance, literature, translation, and the material text. Newton explores the ethics of reading through a range of texts, from the Talmud and Midrash to Conrad's Nostromo and Pascal's Le Memorial, from works by Henry Darger and Martin Scorsese to the National September 11 Memorial and a synagogue in Havana, Cuba. In separate chapters, he conducts masterly treatments of Emmanuel Levinas, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Stanley Cavell by emphasizing their performances as readers a trebled orientation to Talmud, novel, and theater/film. To Make the Hands Impure stages the encounter of literary experience and scriptural traditions he difficult and the holy through an ambitious, singular, and innovative approach marked in equal measure by erudition and imaginative daring.<br>

  Book Title: To Make the Hands Impure: Art, Ethical Adventure, the Difficult and the Holy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): NEWTON ADAM ZACHARY<br>
  Abstract: How can cradling, handling, or rubbing a text be said, ethically, to have made something happen? What, as readers or interpreters, may come off in our hands in as we maculate or mark the books we read? For Adam Zachary Newton, reading is anembodied practice wherein "ethics" becomes a matter of tact in the doubled sense of touch and regard. With the image of the book lying in the hands of its readers as insistent refrain, To Make the Hands Impure cuts a provocative cross-disciplinary swath through classical Jewish texts, modern Jewish philosophy, film and performance, literature, translation, and the material text. Newton explores the ethics of reading through a range of texts, from the Talmud and Midrash to Conrad's Nostromo and Pascal's Le Memorial, from works by Henry Darger and Martin Scorsese to the National September 11 Memorial and a synagogue in Havana, Cuba. In separate chapters, he conducts masterly treatments of Emmanuel Levinas, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Stanley Cavell by emphasizing their performances as readers a trebled orientation to Talmud, novel, and theater/film. To Make the Hands Impure stages the encounter of literary experience and scriptural traditions he difficult and the holy through an ambitious, singular, and innovative approach marked in equal measure by erudition and imaginative daring.<br>

  Abstract: Metaphorais a Greek term precipitated from the verbmetapherein, to carry something from one place to another—a sense acknowledged early in the twentieth century when I. A.

  Abstract: Nietzsche is fundamentally concerned with the circuitous and deceptive character of our relations to things, and with the transcendence of actuality to our representations of it at the level of the signifier. But to a semiotician, the distinction between linguistic activity and extralinguistic reality is naive, and so I turn to Umberto Eco’s more doggedly semiotic approach to this distinction in
                  A Theory of Semiotics. Eco divides semiotics into two parts: the theory of codes or signification and the theory of sign-production or language use.Codedesignates the system of rules that “generate signs as concrete occurrences in communicative intercourse.”¹<br>

  Abstract: In contemporary debates the most common charge made against religion—whether by those who seek to abolish or to renew religious faith—is that it tends to generate violence and intolerance.² While religious teachings often emphasize love and tolerance, it is easy enough to recite a litany of genocides, persecutions, and wars pursued in the name of one religion or another. For the new atheists, such as Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, this violent track record is the clearest example of how religion poisons everything and corrupts a humanity that otherwise would stand a better chance of being peaceful.

  Book Title: Ostension-Word Learning and the Embodied Mind<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelland Chad<br>
  Abstract: Ostension is bodily movement that manifests our engagement with things, whether we wish it to or not. Gestures, glances, facial expressions: all betray our interest in something. Ostension enables our first word learning, providing infants with a prelinguistic way to grasp the meaning of words. Ostension is philosophically puzzling; it cuts across domains seemingly unbridgeable -- public--private, inner--outer, mind--body. In this book, Chad Engelland offers a philosophical investigation of ostension and its role in word learning by infants. Engelland discusses ostension (distinguishing it from ostensive definition) in contemporary philosophy, examining accounts by Quine, Davidson, and Gadamer, and he explores relevant empirical findings in psychology, evolutionary anthropology, and neuroscience. He offers original studies of four representative historical thinkers whose work enriches the understanding of ostension: Wittgenstein, Merleau-Ponty, Augustine, and Aristotle. And, building on these philosophical and empirical foundations, Engelland offers a meticulous analysis of the philosophical issues raised by ostension. He examines the phenomenological problem of whether embodied intentions are manifest or inferred; the problem of what concept of mind allows ostensive cues to be intersubjectively available; the epistemological problem of how ostensive cues, notoriously ambiguous, can be correctly understood; and the metaphysical problem of the ultimate status of the key terms in his argument: animate movement, language, and mind. Finally, he argues for the centrality of manifestation in philosophy. Taking ostension seriously, he proposes, has far-reaching implications for thinking about language and the practice of philosophy.<br>

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287hgz">Ostension</a><br>
  Abstract: Plato marked a turning point in the appreciation of language by philosophers. In the
                  Cratylus, he shows that words are thoroughly conventional. Those who coin them do so with only a superficial understanding of the things spoken about. Accordingly, philosophical knowledge comes from inquiring into the natures of things rather than from learning to speak. Despite discovering the conventionality of language, Plato still accords speech a crucial role. Insight into the nature of things occurs by means of a conversation carried out with conventional terms: “For this knowledge is not something that can be put into words like other sciences;<br>

  Abstract: How children learn their first words is a burning issue in contemporary psychology, a topic whose interest is not only ontogenetic but phylogenetic: how children learn their first words might shed light on how humans long ago instituted their first words. This book likewise takes as its point of departure the question of how children learn their first words, but it asks the question in the philosophical, not the psychological voice. That is, it seeks to disclose the prelinguistic resources logically presupposed by first word acquisition, and one of the things logically presupposed is the availability of another’s attention through<br>

  Abstract: In the American elementary school activity called show-and-tell, children bring something interesting from home to show to their classmates. Attention focuses on the item shown, and the presence of the item serves as the point of departure for the child to speak about it. “This is Santa on a surfboard. It’s something my mom bought in Hawaii when she was a girl. Every Christmas, I get to hang it on our Christmas tree.” Telling can speak about many absent things, but it begins with something present: the shown thing. The interplay of showing and speech in this game recalls the<br>

At the same time, it illuminates Heaney’s artistic passage beyond his home,<br>

  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Peters Ted<br>
  Abstract: God—The World’s Future has been a proven and comprehensive textbook in systematic theology for over twenty years. Explicitly crafted to address our postmodern context, Peters explains the whole body of Christian historical doctrine from within a “proleptic” framework, “whereby the gospel is understood as announcing the pre-actualization of the future consummation of all things in Jesus Christ.” Peters skillfully deploys this concept not only to organize the various theological areas or loci but also to rethink doctrines in light of key postmodern challenges from ecumenism, critical historical thinking, contemporary science, and gender and sexuality issues. The Third Edition is thoroughly revised with updated chapters, additional chapters, updated annotations and bibliographies, and further elaborations in light of recent developments in method and theological reflection. This classic text opens up systematic theology in new dimensions, retrieving traditional categories and topics for a new generation of students and learners to give a fresh reading of Christian theology and articulation of the liberating message of the gospel of God’s grace for the future of the world.<br>

  Abstract: The whole of creation history includes, among other things, human history. Perhaps the emerging field of Big History is the closest secular counterpart to the theologian’s creation history. Within the cosmic hsitory of creation, systematic theologians commonly include an anthropology—an explication of what is human—in their explication of Christian doctrine. Sometimes the anthropology appears between expositions of the First and Second Articles of the creeds—that is, between explications of God as Father and God as Son. The sorry state of the human condition explains why the good creation is in need of redemption. So theological anthropology fits<br>

Although it is the thinking discipline whereby faith seeks to understand itself, it is also a part of the church’s ministry. Its peculiar ministry is to provide intellectual leadership. The present work in systematic theology has sought to explicate the significance of the gospel so that what Christians say is intelligible within the context of modern and emerging postmodern consciousness. Thus, a methodological foundation was laid, scriptural symbols explicated, doctrinal content clarified, and hypothetical reconstruction begun. In turning now to<br>

  Abstract: Theology is an ongoing task with which Christians are never finished because something new is always placed on its agenda. Although it is the thinking discipline whereby faith seeks to understand itself, it is also a part of the church’s ministry. Its peculiar ministry is to provide intellectual leadership. The present work in systematic theology has sought to explicate the significance of the gospel so that what Christians say is intelligible within the context of modern and emerging postmodern consciousness. Thus, a methodological foundation was laid, scriptural symbols explicated, doctrinal content clarified, and hypothetical reconstruction begun. In turning now to<br>

  Book Title: God--The World's Future-Systematic Theology for a New Era<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Peters Ted<br>
  Abstract: God—The World’s Future has been a proven and comprehensive textbook in systematic theology for over twenty years. Explicitly crafted to address our postmodern context, Peters explains the whole body of Christian historical doctrine from within a “proleptic” framework, “whereby the gospel is understood as announcing the pre-actualization of the future consummation of all things in Jesus Christ.” Peters skillfully deploys this concept not only to organize the various theological areas or loci but also to rethink doctrines in light of key postmodern challenges from ecumenism, critical historical thinking, contemporary science, and gender and sexuality issues. The Third Edition is thoroughly revised with updated chapters, additional chapters, updated annotations and bibliographies, and further elaborations in light of recent developments in method and theological reflection. This classic text opens up systematic theology in new dimensions, retrieving traditional categories and topics for a new generation of students and learners to give a fresh reading of Christian theology and articulation of the liberating message of the gospel of God’s grace for the future of the world.<br>

  4  God and the Continuing Creation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wwwrr">God--The World's Future</a><br>
  Abstract: To think of the world as a creation implies belief in a creator who is the “maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.” This raises the question: How does God make heaven and earth and everything else? Although no easy answer can be given, explicating the symbols relating to the gospel provides a response. Just as the experience of the gospel with the Son of God led to the understanding of God as Father, so also the experience of new creation in the gospel will have an impact on our understanding of newness regarding the<br>

  Book Title: Aspects of Alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the Contemporary Debate-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Every other is truly other, but no other is wholly other.This is the claim that Aspects of Alterity defends. Taking up the question of otherness that so fascinates contemporary continental philosophy, this book asks what it means for something or someone to be other than the self. Levinas and those influenced by him point out that the philosophical tradition of the West has generally favored the self at the expense of the other. Such a self-centered perspective never encounters the other qua other, however. In response, postmodern thought insists on the absolute otherness of the other, epitomized by the deconstructive claim every other is wholly other.But absolute otherness generates problems and aporias of its own. This has led some thinkers to reevaluate the notion of relative otherness in light of the postmodern critique, arguing for a chiastic account that does justice to both the alterity and the similitude of the other. These latter two positions-absolute otherness and a rehabilitated account of relative otherness-are the main contenders in the contemporary debate.The philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Gabriel Marcel provide the point of embarkation for coming to understand the two positions on this question. Levinas and Marcel were contemporaries whose philosophies exhibit remarkably similar concern for the other but nevertheless remain fundamentally incompatible. Thus, these two thinkers provide a striking illustration of both the proximity of and the unbridgeable gap between two accounts of otherness.Aspects of Alterity delves into this debate, first in order understand the issues at stake in these two positions and second to determine which description better accounts for the experience of encountering the other.After a thorough assessment and critique of otherness in Levinas's and Marcel's work, including a discussion of the relationship of ethical alterity to theological assumptions, Aspects of Alterity traces the transmission and development of these two conceptions of otherness. Levinas's version of otherness can be seen in the work of Jacques Derrida and John D. Caputo, while Marcel's understanding of otherness influences the work of Paul Ricoeur and Richard Kearney.Ultimately, Aspects of Alterity makes a case for a hermeneutic account of otherness. Otherness itself is not absolute, but is a chiasm of alterity and similitude. Properly articulated, such an account is capable of addressing the legitimate ethical and epistemological concerns that lead thinkers to construe otherness in absolute terms, but without the absolute aporiasthat accompany such a characterization.<br>

  Book Title: Tastes of the Divine: Hindu and Christian Theologies of Emotion-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS MICHELLE VOSS<br>
  Abstract: The intensity and meaningfulness of aesthetic experience have often been described in theological terms. By designating basic human emotions as rasa, a word that connotes taste, flavor, or essence, Indian aesthetic theory conceptualizes emotional states as something to be savored. At their core, emotions can be tastes of the divine. In this book, the methods of the emerging discipline of comparative theology enable the author's appreciation of Hindu texts and practices to illuminate her Christian reflections on aesthetics and emotion. Three emotions vie for prominence in the religious sphere: peace, love, and fury. Whereas Indian theorists following Abhinavagupta claim that the aesthetic emotion of peace best approximates the goal of religious experience, devotees of Krishna and medieval Christian readings of the Song of Songs argue that love communicates most powerfully with divinity. In response to the transcendence emphasized in both approaches, the book turns to fury at injustice to attend to emotion's foundations in the material realm. The implications of this constructive theology of emotion for Christian liturgy, pastoral care, and social engagement are manifold.<br>

The wordrasaalso applies to each of the six flavors—sweet, bitter, sour, salty, pungent, and astringent—which impart unique gustatory experiences.¹Rasa’s use as a technical aesthetic term derives from the Indian tradition of dance-drama in Bharata’sNāṭya Śāstra, where it denotes emotional states savored by spectators of the<br>

  Abstract: Jean-Luc Marion’s philosophical project is largely about being true to phenomenology’s supreme principle—the principle that every originary intuition is a legitimizing source of cognition, that everything originarily offered in intuition be accepted as it presents itself.¹ It is by interrogating this “principle of principles,” by unfolding its full consequences, that Marion can posit his “third reduction”—beyond both Husserl and Heidegger—and so unveil the primacy of sheer givenness. In doing so, Marion would claim, any autarchic subjectivity (whether transcendental or existential) is dethroned and dismantled in one and the same act that givenness (

  Author(s) O’Donohue John<br>
  Abstract: Jean-Luc Marion’s philosophy of God has the excitement, clarity, and danger of something that has issued from the source. On the one hand, it has the imaginative warmth of a poetic sensibility that mines the silence in order to overhear the inner echoes of the transcendent and pierces the visual for tracings on the invisible. On the other, his thinking has the urgency of a blade that wants to cut the divine free from the metaphysical netting of conditional, reflexive thought. He wishes to make a clearance for undreamed dimensions of God to appear—free, unfiltered, and unframed by the<br>

  Abstract: Prayer, both private and public, is one of the most common of human activities. All human history records it; its roots probably go back to before recorded history. Yet when we attempt to submit its most common form, that of petition, to philosophical analysis, we run into difficulties. All too often we pray for things, such as victory or gaining a desired position, and forget that there are losers in such competitions. Prayer, here, seems caught in the “mimetic violence” that René Girard describes. According to Girard, our socialization involves our imitating others. It thus leads us to desire what<br>

  Abstract: An attempt to contribute to a “phenomenology of prayer” ought to begin with the recognition that the word “phenomenology” means many different things to many different people. Moreover, it must be recognized that none of these usages has any obvious claim to being the normative one. Given these inescapable facts, it is therefore incumbent on one who would make such a contribution to define just what it is that he or she might mean by “phenomenology.”<br>

  Abstract: In an original analysis of food consumption and exchange in the everyday life of a small hamlet on the southern seaboard of Norway, Runar Døving (2001; 2003) develops some subtle insights into the dynamics of hospitality. Describing the conventions of social visits in the community, he asks what the reactions would be if a guest insisted on not being served anything but a glass of water. Convention dictates that coffee be served on these visits, usually accompanied by a slice of cake or some biscuits.<br>

  Book Title: Bruno Latour in Pieces: An Intellectual Biography-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Custance Gloria<br>
  Abstract: Bruno Latour stirs things up. Latour began as a lover of science and technology, co-founder of actor-network theory, and philosopher of a modernity that had "never been modern." In the meantime he is regarded not just as one of the most intelligent and also popular exponents of science studies but also as a major innovator of the social sciences, an exemplary wanderer who walks the line between the sciences and the humanities. This book provides the first comprehensive overview of the Latourian oeuvre, from his early anthropological studies in Abidjan (Ivory Coast), to influential books like Laboratory Life and Science in Action, and his most recent reflections on an empirical metaphysics of "modes of existence." In the course of this enquiry it becomes clear that the basic problem to which Latour's work responds is that of social tradition, the transmission of experience and knowledge. What this empirical philosopher constantly grapples with is the complex relationship of knowledge, time, and culture.<br>

  Book Title: Structures of Appearing: Allegory and the Work of Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Machosky Brenda<br>
  Abstract: Taking a phenomenological approach to allegory, Structures of Appearing seeks to revise the history of aesthetics, identifying it as an ideology that has long subjugated art to philosophical criteria of judgment. Rather than being a mere signifying device, allegory is the structure by which something appears that cannot otherwise appear. It thus supports the appearance and necessary experience of philosophical ideas that are otherwise impossible to present or represent. Allegory is as central to philosophy as it is to literature. Following suggestions by Walter Benjamin, Machosky argues that allegory itself must appear allegorically and thus cannot be forced into a logos-centric metaphysical system. She builds on the work of Maurice Blanchot and Emmanuel Levinas to argue that the allegorical image is not a likeness to anything, not a subjective reflection, but an absolute otherness that becomes accessible by virtue of its unique structure. Allegory thus makes possible not merely the textual work of literature but the work that literature is. Machosky develops this insight in readings of Prudentius, Dante, Spenser, Hegel, Goethe, and Kafka.<br>

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x00w1">Structures of Appearing: Allegory and the Work of Literature</a><br>
  Abstract: There is general agreement that the term
                  allegoryrefers to a way of saying or showing one thing and meaning another. This very definition reveals the particular phenomenology of allegory, an artistic or poetic structure in which some “other thing” appears in the “thing appearing” without being the same thing. Allegory can be defined more specifically as “the appearance of one thing in another thing which it is not.” Traditionally understood as a structure of meaning, allegory has a limited range, and critics of this mode are correct that it can be a facile, if at times fascinating, signifying structure.<br>

  Abstract: Literary scholars have long been duped by the defensive posture initiated by the ironic Greek philosopher who dismissed poetry from the realm of thought and the ideal Republic. Between the philosopher-guardian and the poet, Plato presents a long list of craftsmen, each providing a specific product for the needs of the community. When he gets to the poet, however, “someone who has the skill to transform himself into all sorts of characters and to represent all sorts of things,” Plato declares that the community will politely send him packing, telling the poet that “he and his kind have no place<br>

  Abstract: In book 10 of
                  The Republic, the philosopher accuses the poet of simply turning a mirror that reflects the empirical world, which is itself a mere reflection of an ideal world. In chapter 1 I argued that it is the philosopher who should stand accused of “knowing nothing but how to imitate, to lay on with words and phrases … in such fashion that others, equally ignorant, who see things only through words, will deem his words most excellent” (Republic599e). The phraseequally ignorantironically suggests Socrates’ position. Over and over again in the dialogues, Socrates claims his own<br>

  Abstract: The work of Levinas attempts to give an account of the uniqueness of the human person, starting from what he believes to be peculiar to persons, the recognition of others as the source of moral obligation. This criterion had already been proposed in the literature of neo-Kantianism, but the formulation it received there had been found wanting. According to Heidegger, the neo-Kantian sees in the ethical a means for transcending human finitude: “There is something in the categorical imperative which exceeds the finite being.”¹ But for Heidegger the concept of the ethical can display itself only in relation to a<br>

                  Viens, all that I have, all that I am, is at your disposal”? Is hospitality, as Levinas writes, “an incessant alienation of the ego … by the guest entrusted to it … being torn from oneself for another in giving to the other the bread from one’s mouth,” a one for the other that fissures the ego, hospitality that does not expect reciprocity and withholds nothing from the guest (OB, 79)?

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0385">Crossover Queries: Dwelling with Negatives, Embodying Philosophy's Others</a><br>
  Abstract: Nominalists argue that everything that is must be particular. D. M. Armstrong contends, “Nominalists deny that there is any objective identity in things which are not identical. Realists, on the other hand, hold that the apparent situation is the real situation. There genuinely is, or can be, something identical. Besides particulars there are universals.”¹ Quine appreciates the difficulties of this position. Because the “quixotic” nominalist “foreswears quantification over universals, for example, classes, altogether,” Quine prefers “conceptualism,” a position that acknowledges that there are universals but holds them to be “manmade.” “Tactically conceptualism is … the strongest position … for the<br>

                     Doch, I shall apply Lacanian techniques to one of Western theology’s most frequently and strenuously examined texts, Anselm’s ontological argument. By remapping the proof, I hope, with Lacanian audacity, to bring forth unforeseen significations and a new approach to the psychoanalytic interpretation of religious texts.<br>

  Abstract: Efforts to develop a phenomenological ethics have until now begun from two altogether different starting points. The first, a tack taken by Max Scheler, Nicolai Hartmann, and others, assumes that values are instantiated in the world and have properties that open them to intuitive grasp. Values are independent in being and accessible to us without being attached to things.¹ The second starts with the embodied existent’s actual encounters with other persons and finds in these transactions an empirical locus for what is prescribed or forbidden in the moral realm. Levinas turns to the experience of the other to develop a<br>

  Abstract: The semiotic possibilities of the Hebrew of Genesis 1:31, “Viyar Elohim et kol asher asa vehinei tov meod [God saw everything that he had made and indeed it was very good],” include cognitive, moral, and aesthetic dimensions. Some traditional interpretations see the text as asserting that the world is well-wrought, that nature’s means, cunningly adapted to its ends, are indications of divine purposiveness, and that obedience to divine ordinances is a manifestation of human goodness. Other accounts focus upon the created order as a vast spectacle that attests nature’s power to arouse awe and rapture, a perspective reflected in the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0385">Crossover Queries: Dwelling with Negatives, Embodying Philosophy's Others</a><br>
  Abstract: The work of Levinas attempts to give an account of the uniqueness of the human person, starting from what he believes to be peculiar to persons, the recognition of others as the source of moral obligation. This criterion had already been proposed in the literature of neo-Kantianism, but the formulation it received there had been found wanting. According to Heidegger, the neo-Kantian sees in the ethical a means for transcending human finitude: “There is something in the categorical imperative which exceeds the finite being.”¹ But for Heidegger the concept of the ethical can display itself only in relation to a<br>

  Abstract: Is hospitality not a solicitation to its addressee, “
                  Viens, all that I have, all that I am, is at your disposal”? Is hospitality, as Levinas writes, “an incessant alienation of the ego … by the guest entrusted to it … being torn from oneself for another in giving to the other the bread from one’s mouth,” a one for the other that fissures the ego, hospitality that does not expect reciprocity and withholds nothing from the guest (OB, 79)? Or is there, as Derrida observes, an ineliminable tension between an unconditional offer to another and the juridical, political, and economic<br>

  31  Soft Nominalism in Quine and the School of Dignāga from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0385">Crossover Queries: Dwelling with Negatives, Embodying Philosophy's Others</a><br>
  Abstract: Nominalists argue that everything that is must be particular. D. M. Armstrong contends, “Nominalists deny that there is any objective identity in things which are not identical. Realists, on the other hand, hold that the apparent situation is the real situation. There genuinely is, or can be, something identical. Besides particulars there are universals.”¹ Quine appreciates the difficulties of this position. Because the “quixotic” nominalist “foreswears quantification over universals, for example, classes, altogether,” Quine prefers “conceptualism,” a position that acknowledges that there are universals but holds them to be “manmade.” “Tactically conceptualism is … the strongest position … for the<br>

  Book Title: Toward a Theology of Eros: Transfiguring Passion at the Limits of Discipline-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLER CATHERINE<br>
  Abstract: What does theology have to say about the place of eroticism in the salvific transformation of men and women, even of the cosmos itself? How, in turn, does eros infuse theological practice and transfigure doctrinal tropes? Avoiding the well-worn path of sexual moralizing while also departing decisively from Anders Nygren's influential insistence that Christian agape must have nothing to do with worldly eros, this book explores what is still largely uncharted territory in the realm of theological erotics. The ascetic, the mystical, the seductive, the ecstatic-these are the places where the divine and the erotic may be seen to converge and love and desire to commingle.Inviting and performing a mutual seduction of disciplines, the volume brings philosophers, historians, biblical scholars, and theologians into a spirited conversation that traverses the limits of conventional orthodoxies, whether doctrinal or disciplinary. It seeks new openings for the emergence of desire, love, and pleasure, while challenging common understandings of these terms. It engages risk at the point where the hope for salvation paradoxically endangers the safety of subjects-in particular, of theological subjects-by opening them to those transgressions of eros in which boundaries, once exceeded, become places of emerging possibility.The eighteen chapters, arranged in thematic clusters, move fluidly among and between premodern and postmodern textual traditions-from Plato to Emerson, Augustine to Kristeva, Mechthild to Mattoso, the Shulammite to Molly Bloom, the Zohar to the Da Vinci Code. In so doing, they link the sublime reaches of theory with the gritty realities of politics, the boundless transcendence of God with the poignant transience of materiality.<br>

  Author(s) SHERWOOD YVONNE<br>
  Abstract: The seductive enigma of the word
                  passion—and the Christian passion to which it is tied—seems to me to lie in the way in which it allows the subject at its center to function as subject and object both at once. Derived from Latinpassioand Greekpathos, it is bound, in its first appearances in anything we would recognize as English, to passivity, suffering, affliction, and “the fact or condition of being acted upon or affected by an external agency” (OED). As if to illustrate this sense of passion as the subjection of the subject, the word was<br>

  Abstract: The statement by T.S.

What would it mean to consider the Song of Songs as poetry? And further, what

  Book Title: Finding God in All Things: Celebrating Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stagaman David<br>
  Abstract: Three of the most influential Catholic theologians of the twentieth century-Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-were all born in 1904, at the height of the Church's most militant rhetoric against all things modern. In this culture of suspicion, Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner grew in faith to join the Society of Jesus and struggled with the burden of antimodernist policies in their formation. By the time of their mature work in the 1950s and 1960s, they had helped to redefine the critical dialogue between modern thought and contemporary Catholic theology. After the dtente of the Second Vatican Council, they brought Catholic tradition into closer relationship to modern philosophy, history, and politics. Written by leading scholars, friends, and family members, these original essays celebrate the legacies of Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner after a century of theological development. Offering a broad range of perspectives on their lives and works, the essays blend personal and anecdotal accounts with incisive critical appraisals. Together, they offer an accessible introduction to the distinctive character of three great thinkers and how their work shapes the way Catholics think and talk about God, Church, and State.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x04wz">Finding God in All Things: Celebrating Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner</a><br>
  Author(s) O’Donovan Leo J.<br>
  Abstract: Having studied with Karl Rahner at the height of his influence, and after teaching and writing about him for many years now, I have come to feel increasingly indebted to him not only as a theologian of stature, but as a pastor of my soul. Difficult as it is to say something meaningful about an author whose bibliography famously includes more than four thousand titles, in this essay I want especially to explain why I think him a vital companion for us all in the coming years of a troubled world. I shall first offer a brief overview of his<br>

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, each of her chapters focuses on a different but related issue and cultural sector. Foci include the basic conditions of linguistic meaning in the early modern period, instantiated by Shakespeare's plays and related to modern theories of metaphor; the role of metaphor in the words of eucharistic institution under Archbishop Cranmer; the play of metaphor and metonymy in the writings of Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin and in John Donne's Devotions; the manipulation of these two tropes in the politics of the controversy over ecclesiastical vestments and in its treatment by John Foxe; the abuse of figuration in the house of Edmund Spenser's Busirane, where catachresis, an extreme form of metaphor, is the trope du jour; the conception of metaphor in the Roman rhetorics and their legacy in the sixteenth century; and the concept of exchange in the economic writing of Gerrard de Malynes, merchant and metaphorist in the reigns of Elizabeth and James. What emerges at the end of this book is a heightened critical sense of the dynamic of metaphor in cultural history.<br>

  Abstract: That a particular outfit or a more general style of clothing should make a ‘‘statement’’ is a familiar enough idea in the twenty-first century.

  Abstract: The first and altogether the most important thing I have to say about preparing my annotated translation of the book of Ruth is that I did not do it alone.¹ I did it with my first-year Hebrew students. Reading Ruth with beginning Hebrew students while I was, for the first time, preparing a translation for publication turned out to be a stroke of holy luck. The translation is substantially different and better because we were beginning together. As it turned out, I needed reading partners for the counterintuitive reason that the Hebrew of Ruth is so easy to read. In<br>

  Abstract: Among the most important questions for biblical interpreters to ask is the question of genre:
                     As whatare we to read this text? In the modern period, it was Hermann Gunkel who brought that question to the fore. As he demonstrated, the issue confronts us as soon as the opening pages of Genesis.¹ Do we read this as history (cum science) or as myth, as something that happened at a certain time—history, or as (citing the description of myth offered by the Roman historian Sallust) “something that happens over and over again”?<br>

  Author(s) Matter E. Ann<br>
  Abstract: The Latin Middle Ages was a period of great Christian interest in the Song of Songs. Judging from the surviving texts, at least twenty Latin line-by-line expositions of Solomon’s love songs were written between the seventh and the eleventh centuries, and over thirty survive from the twelfth century alone.¹ These are curious works of literature in a number of ways. For one thing, they were the product of an intellectual elite made up entirely of celibate men living in religious (usually monastic) communities. For another (and this is the reason that monks could have such an open interest in something<br>

  Abstract: As is true of no other Scripture, I find myself compelled to return to the Song of Songs time and again. A return to a text as rich as this one can only be stimulating, for rereading is its own reward. And yet, coming back to the Song brings me something more—an infusion of joy. In afterlife, the Song has a formidable presence: It lingers in the present, gathering up the past of its origins and thus ensuring its own future. The Song is robustly alive in every rereading.<br>

  Abstract: When I think now of my introduction to the Song of Songs—at Jewish summer camp, at fifteen, when they were looking for volunteers to chant it—I can’t decide whether to emphasize that it was a fluke or one of those moments in life for which we Ashkenazic Jewish reserve the untranslatable Yiddish word
                  beshert, which means a host of untranslatable Yiddish things, including, as I’m using it here: “profoundly and irrevocably predestined.” Perhaps I will reveal a bit too much about myself if I tell you that, for me, they are precisely the same thing—the fluke and<br>

  Abstract: To receive the Marianist Award is a great honor. For the occasion I am asked to say something about the influence of my religious faith on my work, or about the interaction of one with the other. This is perhaps a straightforward assignment for a person whose work has been involved with the direction of public affairs. But it is less easy for an anthropologist, partly because it means delving into fairly intimate thoughts as you will see, and partly because of this particular religion, the Roman Catholic faith.<br>

For the occasion I am asked to say something about the influence of my religious faith on my work, or about the interaction of one with the other. This is perhaps a straightforward assignment for a person whose work has been involved with the direction of public affairs. But it is less easy for an anthropologist, partly because it means delving into fairly intimate thoughts as you will see, and partly because of this particular religion, the Roman Catholic faith.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x06gq">The Experience of God: A Postmodern Response</a><br>
  Author(s) HART KEVIN<br>
  Abstract: Merely utter the simple expression “the experience of God” and you will divide a room, especially if it happens to be filled with philosophers and theologians. There will always be a group that strenuously objects that the expression makes no sense at all—or, if it does, then it is downright dangerous. “It is the very nature of God not to be experienced by finite beings,” someone will offer as a first comment. “And if we do encounter anything that appears divine it would be, at best or worst, an idol.” Chances are that another member of this group will<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x06gq">The Experience of God: A Postmodern Response</a><br>
  Author(s) MCKENZIE RENEE<br>
  Abstract: Kristine Culp has taken us on an interesting ride. We have experienced with her memories of her visit to Lourdes, and we have shared with her a partial yield of her reflection. We have discovered that she, unlike some postmodern feminists, wants to reclaim, at least for feminist theology, the intrinsic and extrinsic value of experience in saying something meaningful to ourselves and others about God and our self. This work is intriguing even with the recognition of its being read with the eyes of one who, in great similarity to Culp’s experience at Lourdes, could neither fully participate in<br>

  Abstract: In the acceleration of the tempo of historical developments in which we live, two factors, it seems to me, stand out above all others as characteristics of a development that, earlier, began only slowly. The first is the formation of a world society in which individual political, economic, and cultural powers depend, more and more, on each other, and come into contact and permeate each other in their different spheres of life. The other is the development of man’s possibilities, of his power to make and to destroy, possibilities that, exceeding everything to which we have previously been accustomed, raise<br>

  Abstract: In August 2004, a short film that dealt with the theme of violence against women in Islamic societies was broadcast on Dutch television. The key scene showed four topless women in transparent clothing; their bodies had been covered with calligraphically inscribed verses from the Koran that legitimate the subjection of women. Working from a script written by Member of Parliament Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the filmmaker Theo van Gogh had created the ten-minute movie

  Book Title: Between Chora and the Good: Metaphor's Metaphysical Neighborhood-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BIGGER CHARLES P.<br>
  Abstract: Plato's chora as developed in the Timaeus is a creative matrix in which things arise and stand out in response to the lure of the Good. Chora is paired with the Good, its polar opposite; both are beyond beingand the metaphors hitherto thought to disclose the transcendent. They underlie Plato's distinction of a procreative gap between being and becoming. The chiasmus between the Good and chora makes possible their mutual participation in one another. This gap makes possible both phenomenological and cosmological interpretations of Plato. Metaphor is restricted to beings as they appear in this gap through the crossing of metaphor's terms, terms that dwell with, rather than subulate, one another. Hermeneutically, through its iswe can see something being engendered or determined by that crossing.Bigger's larger goal is to align the primacy of the Good in Plato and Christian Neoplatonism with the creator God of Genesis and the God of love in the New Testament.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x06ms">Between Chora and the Good: Metaphor's Metaphysical Neighborhood</a><br>
  Abstract: Metaphor, that old, anarchical alchemist, transmutes belief into truth, illusion into reality, ignorance into knowledge—only then to turn around and do the opposite. How? She lets unsociable differences cross over to dwell with and interpret one another in order to reveal unsuspected identities—fictional, real, and virtual.¹ Water is one thing, electricity is another; but when Faraday crossed them and saw electricity through hydraulics, a new science was born. Electricity isn’t a fluid and does not flow, yet its dynamics are formally the same as those of water. Sometimes what is seen is an artifact of the metaphor. Waves<br>

  2  The Matrix from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x06ms">Between Chora and the Good: Metaphor's Metaphysical Neighborhood</a><br>
  Abstract: E. V. Walters’s
                  Placewayschronicles his journey along the sacred path to Plato’s Academy and the matrix. He calls attention to Ptolemy’s distinction betweentopos,the space of geography—and Descartes’s extension or Aristotle’s innermost container—andchora,a qualitative, phenomenological place that organizes and evokes images, memories, feelings, meanings, and the work of the imagination.¹ Like the Rome of Freud’sCivilization and Its Discontents“in which nothing once constructed ever disappears,” the matrix seems to hold in storage the entire contents of past experience. We have known this archival and creative or threatening power of place in Delphi, Chartres,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x06ms">Between Chora and the Good: Metaphor's Metaphysical Neighborhood</a><br>
  Abstract: The movement away from predication toward an apprehensive of “the thing itself,” metaphor’s phenomenological task, was begun by Plato in the Seventh Epistle and as Leibniz saw, is the point of dialectic. This deictic movement was nipped in the bud by Aristotle’s

  9  The Hypostasis: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x06ms">Between Chora and the Good: Metaphor's Metaphysical Neighborhood</a><br>
  Abstract: Interpreting Plato’s “living creature” (
                  Tim.,30B–D) as a hypostasis goes beyond his letter, if not his spirit; it takes us a long way toward unraveling something of the mystery of incarnation. Plato saw that the separationist account in thePhaedodefined soul through its relation to theideas,but then it left no place for “change, life, soul, and understanding” and condemned us “to stand immutable in solemn aloofness, devoid of intelligence” (Sop.,249A). The hypostasis as developed in Greek patristic usage can begin to put these together and to correct the mistaken view that Platonism, if not Plato<br>

  Abstract: If Rilke, Hölderlin, George, and Trakl are among the poets who set truth to work for Heidegger, something like this happened for me through an obscure Byzantine icon representing the Virgin Mary as the
                     Zoodochus Pegeand another calling her “the place of the placeless.” In her welcome, “matter shows itself for the first time in its materiality.”² Llewelyn has it that “maternity is the mother of materiality because it is the in-vention of the other … a pre-naissance of pre-nature.”³<br>

  Abstract: Let’s begin by asking ourselves, what do
                  wemean by time? No doubt, many different things, but chief among these is that time is mine, what I am in my innermost self. What is it? We share Augustine’s dilemma; he knew what time was until asked. What is this time that is mine and yours alone, the time we are caught up in, never have enough of, cannot endure, and can lend or give to others? Then there is the time clocks keep that ticks away inexorably, indifferent to our moods and the occupants of its now, its before and<br>

  Abstract: What is left to language were the said peeled away from the saying? A primal fecundity awaiting the word. When saying is propositioned by erotic reason, it is as if the said hypothesizes, stands out, and is substantial through the other. If

  Abstract: The questions raised by this conference are both professional and personal for me. As a sociologist, the social changes of the last forty years have provided ample fodder for research, and I’ll attempt to tell you some of the things I think we’ve discovered in the process. But as a parent of a daughter born in 1980, I also stand before you with many of the same concerns that I suspect brought some of you here. Will our children have a faith to guide them?

  Abstract: I stand before you today with a mixture of gratitude and apprehension. Gratitude, because the organizers of this conference saw fit to include the Taizé Community in their program, ostensibly as a “model that retain[s] religious traditions in non-reductive ways while at the same time bridging in an open and dialogical way the ever-increasing religious pluralism of the contemporary world.” It is quite something to be considered, even remotely, such a model. So on behalf of my community I thank the organizers for this show of confidence in the life we have been attempting to live for the past sixty-plus<br>

  1  First Philosophy from:

  Abstract: The title of Vladimir Jankélévitch’s first major work is

Traditionally, a first philosophy provides the cornerstone on which the rest of a thinker’s philosophy is constructed either upward in the architectonics of systematic structures or outward in concentric circles extending from the initial pulse of inspiration at the epicenter. Jankélévitch is fond of citing Henri Bergson, who wrote that a philosopher of value has said only one thing and the rest of his life and work is dedicated to that single point.¹ Or more poignantly, Jankélévitch’s philosophy follows Bergson’s insight that there is “something simple, infinitely simple, so<br>

  Abstract: Forgiveness, for Vladimir Jankélévitch, is simple. It is almost nothing (
                  presque rien). For this reason, he approaches the topic of forgiveness apophatically. As he writes, “The élan of forgiveness is so impalpable, so debatable, that it discourages all attempts at analysis.” He sees no points of contact or solid ground “in this fleeting shock, in this imperceptible flickering of charity” that would make a philosophical discourse possible. The negative method he adopts, therefore, primarily takes account of the “empirical substitutes for metaempirical forgiveness [or] the natural forms of supernatural forgiveness.” About these he has a vast amount to say.¹ To<br>

  Abstract: Irreversibility, irrevocability, and imprescriptibility relate to each other as the natural to the ethical to the legal. In a sense, these terms represent a progression of an idea, moving from one category to another, sharpening and narrowing its scope in the procession from nature to ethics to the legal and juridical domains. The idea driving these notions is that of time or, more precisely, the temporal constitution of human affairs.

Heidegger’s statement that “the possible is more real than the real” (

If I understand Kearney correctly, this statement must not be restricted toDasein’s being-in-the-world and its finite self-understanding, but is also true of God’s divinity.<br>

  Abstract: Richard Kearney is a possibility thinker, a philosopher, novelist, and poet fired by a passion for/of God. For Kearney, philosophy links imagination and affectivity with reason in a rhetoric of persuasion aiming for individual and societal transfiguration. In other words, as I read him, philosophy is not an abstract-theoretical exercise dedicated to getting things straight, finding solutions for particular theoretic problems. Rather, for Kearney, philosophy is a way of life, a spiritual exercise¹ working toward the incitement of passion for visionary transformation and cultural change rather than the elaboration of grand systems and the elimination of paradoxes.

  Abstract: Richard Kearney and I have a common interest in Heidegger’s existential and ontological understanding of the “possible,” which moves far beyond the classical and modern logic of modalities and Nicolai Hartmann’s modal ontology. Heidegger’s statement that “the possible is more real than the real” (
                     Being and Time, §31) could be augmented by Paul Celan’s beautiful verse, “Alles ist weniger als es ist, alles ist mehr” (Everything is less than it is, everything is more). If I understand Kearney correctly, this statement must not be restricted toDasein’s being-in-the-world and its finite self-understanding, but is also true of God’s divinity.<br>

  Author(s) OLTHUIS JAMES<br>
  Abstract: Richard Kearney is a possibility thinker, a philosopher, novelist, and poet fired by a passion for/of God. For Kearney, philosophy links imagination and affectivity with reason in a rhetoric of persuasion aiming for individual and societal transfiguration. In other words, as I read him, philosophy is not an abstract-theoretical exercise dedicated to getting things straight, finding solutions for particular theoretic problems. Rather, for Kearney, philosophy is a way of life, a spiritual exercise¹ working toward the incitement of passion for visionary transformation and cultural change rather than the elaboration of grand systems and the elimination of paradoxes.

  Abstract: Theology is a cartography (that is, an attempt to create maps, to mark out, to graph, or to plot a course or courses) that will lead to a place, a
                  topos, where divine revelation may occur and knowledge of God may be discovered. At these various places (topoi) and through its various topics, theology concerns the “way,” the right way, the proper way,theway, or one of many ways that can lead individuals to know something about God.

  Abstract: Aristotle, in distinguishing between actuality (ἐνέργεια) and possibility (δύναμις), undertook two crucial steps that have haunted the history of Western metaphysics ever since: he gave a qualitative priority to actuality over potency, and then he identified the former with pure essence. Possibility, for Aristotle, is a mode that denotes transition and corruption, and thus imperfection. However, the risk that he acknowledges and fears most is that potency is ambiguous and undecidable. In his words, “the possible could be both a being and a non-being … it could equally be both things and neither” (1050b10, 1051a1). It is this

The simplest controversy is also the weightiest, and still the most painful: Is it only a persistent idol that dies, or must it be religion itself, as the practice of idolatry? Do the fires of suspicion only purify, or do they consume everything that touches them? What religion, if any, survives the fever of Sils Maria and Turin?<br>

  Abstract: We do not yet know what it means to speak of the death of God, and not only because those who speak of it do not always have the same thing in mind. The simplest controversy is also the weightiest, and still the most painful: Is it only a persistent idol that dies, or must it be religion itself, as the practice of idolatry? Do the fires of suspicion only purify, or do they consume everything that touches them? What religion, if any, survives the fever of Sils Maria and Turin?<br>

  The Maker Mind and Its Shade from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0741">After God: Richard Kearney and the Religious Turn in Continental Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) GREISCH JEAN<br>
  Abstract: Richard Kearney and I have a common interest in Heidegger’s existential and ontological understanding of the “possible,” which moves far beyond the classical and modern logic of modalities and Nicolai Hartmann’s modal ontology. Heidegger’s statement that “the possible is more real than the real” (
                     Being and Time, §31) could be augmented by Paul Celan’s beautiful verse, “Alles ist weniger als es ist, alles ist mehr” (Everything is less than it is, everything is more). If I understand Kearney correctly, this statement must not be restricted toDasein’s being-in-the-world and its finite self-understanding, but is also true of God’s divinity.<br>

  Divine Metaxology from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0741">After God: Richard Kearney and the Religious Turn in Continental Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) OLTHUIS JAMES<br>
  Abstract: Richard Kearney is a possibility thinker, a philosopher, novelist, and poet fired by a passion for/of God. For Kearney, philosophy links imagination and affectivity with reason in a rhetoric of persuasion aiming for individual and societal transfiguration. In other words, as I read him, philosophy is not an abstract-theoretical exercise dedicated to getting things straight, finding solutions for particular theoretic problems. Rather, for Kearney, philosophy is a way of life, a spiritual exercise¹ working toward the incitement of passion for visionary transformation and cultural change rather than the elaboration of grand systems and the elimination of paradoxes. Indeed, it is<br>

  Abstract: In the preface to the second edition of the
                  Science of Logic, Hegel refers to “the peculiar restlessness and distraction of our modern consciousness.”¹ Although the tone of this statement makes it sound like something to be avoided or at any rate minimized, a moment’s reflection tells us that for Hegel, it is one of modernity’s irreducible and most definitive components. Superficial though it may be, restlessness is nonetheless also the forerunner of negativity, what he calls elsewhere the “seriousness, the suffering, the patience and work of the negative.”² Finally, for Hegel, this restlessness is the active dimension without which<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x07vw">Committing the Future to Memory: History, Experience, Trauma</a><br>
  Abstract: To end with a discussion of the work of Maurice Blanchot is rife with difficulties, two of which I will mention by way of beginning. The first involves the sheer difficulty of reading his work. While to be sure, this seems to be something of a “side issue,” it is one with important consequences: An encounter with Blanchot’s texts—whether those of his fiction, his criticism or the aphoristic, fragmentary texts of the later years—induces a deep feeling of exposure and vertigo, the negativity or indeterminacy of which is hardly conceivable as a mediating moment toward a higher reconciliation,<br>

  Abstract: If all the world’s a sign, and all things to which signs point become caught in signification again, then our world is full even as it is fleeting, traced with absence even in what stays. With the modern turn away from a sense of saturated signification, the world’s signs are lost not merely, perhaps not even primarily, in their ability to refer indexically; the world at once desacralized and insignificant loses still more its power to seduce.<br>

  In Place of a Conclusion: from:

  Abstract: Seduction resists conclusion—“the melancholy of everything
                  finished,”¹ as Nietz sche aptly has it. It depends upon recurrence and sustaining, on the continued emergence of a new or re-newed and not quite comprehended possibility, on something we know we want even if we aren’t quite sure what it is (even the desire of it is to be desired as a good). To conclude a work on seduction thus seems a bit misguided, so in place of a conclusion I would like to offer this very brief meditation on the coincidence of two inconclusive possibilities, of new emergence and infinite recurrence<br>

Geneticists can enhance the DNA of almost any living creature, including human beings. Cloning is a reality, no longer just the stuff of science fiction. New genetic engineering and organ transplantation technologies raise legal questions about the ownership of one’s own DNA and one’s own body.

  Abstract: Reading, or otherwise sitting on, the work of René Descartes (March 31, 1596–February 11, 1650) with the quiet plea sure I see in a g(r)azing cow, I have been savoring, and saving somewhere, this nagging thought: His philosophy—his “Cartesianism,” his “rationalism,” his “methodological” doubt, his theoretical “self-centeredness,” his historicized him-ness—seems to remain overread and underexplored.

  Abstract: At the end of an afternoon of gardening, one looks back, if only for a moment, to survey the ground that one has covered and worked through. It seems fitting, therefore, to take account of the moves made in this book. I have argued that the imagination plays a central role in the development of human cognition and, more generally, in the humanness of human life. At the service of this argument, I have amplified, extended, and explained the opening passage of

  Abstract: What kind of relationship exists between these two terms? Is there something essentially “common” in melancholy, and does melancholy have something to do with the very form of community? The answer that the literature on melancholy has offered has often been negative. Within both its pathological interpretation as a sickness of the body and spirit and its positive one as genial exceptionality, melancholy has generally been situated as not only different from community but actually in opposition to it. Indeed, we might say that for much of the interpretative tradition, and most markedly within sociological inquiry, melancholic man has been<br>

  Abstract: Before taking up how the theme of freedom relates to community, I would like to consider something even more fundamental that involves the entire political lexicon and the growing difficulty such a lexicon faces in signifying its own object—namely, the political.¹ A true barrier seems to have been erected between language and politics. It is as if politics has escaped from language, as if language no longer has any words with which to name politics. As early as the 1930s, Simone Weil wrote, “On inspection, almost all the words and phrases of our political vocabulary turn out to be<br>

  Abstract: More than fear or hope, perhaps surprise is what recent international events have made us feel. Before they turn out to be positive, negative, or even tragic, international events are first and foremost unexpected. Moreover, they seem to contradict all reasonable calculation of probability. From the sudden and bloodless collapse of the Soviet system in 1989 to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and everything that followed, what we can say at a minimum is not only that we couldn’t have imagined them before they occurred but that everything appeared to make their occurrence unlikely.

  Abstract: 1933–2003. Is it legitimate to turn once again to the question of Nazism seventy years after it took power? The answer, I believe, can only be yes: not just because forgetting Nazism would represent an unbearable offense for its victims but also because, despite an ever increasing body of literature, something about Nazism remains in the dark, something that touches us. What might it be? What links us invisibly to what we point to as the most tragic political catastrophe of our time, and perhaps of all time? My own sense is that this thing that both troubles and<br>

  Abstract: How does someone dreaming, wondering about half-forgotten stories in dead languages, (

  Abstract: The period between Dewey’s emergence as a major philosophical voice and his becoming the leading figure in the movement that became known as “pragmatism” is not well understood. That it was something of a mystery to Dewey himself is evident by the prominence it has in his intellectual autobiography, “From Absolutism to Experimentalism.” In 1887, with the publication of his
                  Psychology, Dewey, rather than Royce, could well have been called the crown prince of American idealism. In 1903, with the appearance ofStudies in Logical Theory, Dewey was recognized as the head of the Chicago School, which was understood as<br>

  FOUR  THE BEING OF NATURE: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0c0w">The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence</a><br>
  Abstract: American philosophy has been dominated by the theme of “Nature.”¹ From Edwards to Emerson to Dewey to Dennett, American thought has variously invoked Nature. But to articulate a philosophy of Nature is not thereby to espouse a form of “naturalism.” In fact, philosophies undertaken in the name of “naturalism” seem to have a different temperament than those that begin with the
                  thoughtof Nature as such. As a theme, “Nature” invites an expansive mood for reflection, while “naturalism” sounds constrictive and combative. “Nature” disposes the mind to musement, “pondering,”theoria, Denken—to becoming Emerson’s “transparent eyeball.” “Naturalism” has something of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0c0w">The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the most fascinating and totally unproductive exchanges between two major American philosophers commenced with Santayana’s review of Dewey’s
                  Experience and Natureand Dewey’s rather testy rejoinder, “Half-Hearted Naturalism.” Santayana’s review was perversely insightful, highlighting in Dewey’s metaphysics just about everything Santayana detested about America: pragmatism, metaphysics, idealism, romanticism, optimism, the busy foolishness of industrial democracy, naivete. Dewey’s outlook was irredeemably “boyish” and “near-sighted,” focusing on the human foreground rather than upon nature, which herself had no foreground or background. Dewey’s “naturalism” was tainted with the loathsome bacillus of idealism; it lacked a discipline of spirit in which nature’s<br>

  Book Title: Malicious Objects, Anger Management, and the Question of Modern Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kreienbrock Jörg<br>
  Abstract: Why do humans get angry with objects? Why is it that a malfunctioning computer, a broken tool, or a fallen glass causes an outbreak of fury? How is it possible to speak of an inanimate object's recalcitrance, obstinacy, or even malice? When things assume a will of their own and seem to act out against human desires and wishes rather than disappear into automatic, unconscious functionality, the breakdown is experienced not as something neutral but affectively--as rage or as outbursts of laughter. Such emotions are always psychosocial: public, rhetorically performed, and therefore irreducible to a "private" feeling. By investigating the minutest details of life among dysfunctional household items through the discourses of philosophy and science, as well as in literary works by Laurence Sterne, Jean Paul, Friedrich Theodor Vischer, and Heimito von Doderer, Kreienbrock reconsiders the modern bourgeois poetics that render things the way we know and suffer them.<br>

                  Antigone, everything has already been said and we come too late in the game.”¹ So late do we come that it seems presumptuous, if not actually impious, even to try to lend a helping hand, let alone speak with any authority on the work that has already been done or the game that has been played out. Though we can try to forget that we are touching here on an almost sacred work of art, what Hegel called “one of the most sublime, and in every respect most consummate works of art human effort ever produced,”²<br>

  Author(s) Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: In his notebooks of 1976, Jacques Derrida proposes to himself the task of describing his broken covenant with Judaism in a work that would “leave nothing, if possible, in the dark of what related me to Judaism, alliance [
                  alliance, covenant; Hebrew:berit] broken in every respect.”¹ For Derrida is Jewish without being Jewish, Jewish sans Judaism, married outside Judaism, hissonsuncircumcised, he an atheist. Of this broken covenant, this breach of analliancethat stretches “throughout thousands of years of Judaism,” he says—now the time has changed to 1989 and this note has been stitched into “Circumfession”—“that’s<br>

  Author(s) Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: I work my way through things by writing. So, whenever I read what others have written about my work, whenever what I have written is read back to me by others—never, of course, without a gloss—it is as if the inert pages of books and journals have come to life and begun to talk back to me (and sometimes even to bite back). It is as if something that is structurally private, written in solitude, my most secret thoughts, meant only for me and God—like Augustine confessing to God in writing, “

  Abstract: What Paul Ricoeur called the “hermeneutics of suspicion” has become the sine qua non of literary and cultural studies. Whether one thinks in terms of an unconscious, a superstructure, or a subtext, the analysis of intellectual and social phenomena begins from the assumption that things may not be what they seem, even where our most tangible intuitions and deeply held beliefs are concerned. From a methodological perspective, this has led to the emergence of what we might call “an archaeology of the presupposition.” An argument demonstrates its rigor by rendering its own aims and procedures as explicit and transparent as<br>

                  hearthe music that is the ambient fluid of their music-drowned world. This is one of the genre’s most fundamental illusions: we see before us something whose fantastic aspect is obvious, since the scenes we witness pass to music. At the same time, however, opera stages recognizably human situations, and these possess an inherent “realism” that demands a special and complex understanding of the music we hear. We must generally assume, in short, that this music is not produced by or within the stage-world, but emanates<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0rk0">Unsung Voices: Opera and Musical Narrative in the Nineteenth Century</a><br>
  Abstract: Human narrators come in many forms. Some are completely reliable: most epic narrators speak with detachment, and thus with authority. They elicit trust. But human narrators may also be revealed as immoral by giving tongue to lies, by speaking themselves buffoons, unreliable, or dubious. Then their stories will
                  ring false, for while we may notknowthat the story is a lie, something about its presentation betrays its teller. When narration is allied to music, sensing truth demands doubly acute ears. Strauss’s Clytaemnestra says, “was die wahrheit ist, das dringt kein mensch heraus” [“what is true, what is untrue, no<br>

There is little chance of coming to a triumphant halt before the definitive answer to such issues.

  Abstract: This book examines the still-continuing debate over the nature of winning and losing in the American context—what it feels like for an American to succeed or to fail in a country which is often defined in terms of its own success or failure as an idea and as an experience. There is little chance of coming to a triumphant halt before the definitive answer to such issues. The many arguments given breathing space here will not settle matters; rather, they will serve to complicate, not to simplify, and to extend the debate past the last page, not to cut<br>

  Abstract: In 1829 Thomas Skidmore denounced out of hand the entire conception of heirs and contracts between generations. He felt no property should be thought of as transferable; no father ought to hand on
                  in absentialand or money to his sons. Mark Twain also rebuked the burden imposed upon him by the charge his father had given him on his death-bed, “Cling to the land and wait; let nothing beguile it away from you.” As he records it in hisAutobiography,the Tennessee Claim was for the Clemens family both unattained dream and solid land that contained coal, iron, copper,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x1k8c">Value and Values</a><br>
  Author(s) Smid Robert<br>
  Abstract: The question of what would constitute a “Confucian” economics for the twenty-first century is a decidedly unsettled one. Drawing back to the places and times in which the Confucian tradition held significant sway over such questions, it is fair to say that it resulted in nothing much like the two economic systems—communism and capitalism—that have dominated the twentieth century (any minor similarities notwithstanding). At the same time, however, the powerful influence of these two systems requires that any consideration of new economic directions, Confucian or otherwise, proceed in conversation with at least one—or, ideally, both—of these<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x1k8c">Value and Values</a><br>
  Author(s) Hershock Peter D.<br>
  Abstract: One of Buddhism’s central insights is that our conflicts, troubles, and suffering can be positively and sustainably addressed only on the basis of things “as they have come to be” (Skt.
                  yathabhutam) and not simply as they are at present. Histories matter, in other words. A second insight, and one with powerful contemporary resonances, is that all things arise interdependently. Strongly interpreted, this means that relationality is more basic than “things-related.” Interdependence is not a contingent, external relation among essentially separate entities; it is internal or constitutive. In short, interdependence entails interpenetration. Seeing this is to see that conflicts, troubles,<br>

  CHAPTER 4  The Lure of the Modern: from:

  Abstract: As new social practices were introduced into Japan during the early Meiji period, they disseminated unevenly from the cities to the countryside. While Western fashions were adopted initially among the elite, who had ties to the government and who were concerned about promoting Japan’s image as a civilized nation, they soon spread to members of the middle class, who embraced Westernization as a means of social mobility and distinction. The high cost of Western fashions limited their widespread appeal, but by the Taisho period (1912–1926) and the introduction of uniformed clothing in various work professions, Western fashion became increasingly<br>

We met and talked for an hour and then—although he certainly wasn’t writing any kind of muckraking piece—he lamented that he couldn’t find anything bad about her, that he couldn’t find anyone who would say anything bad about her. The article didn’t get published. But, I thought, there has to be something.<br>

  Author(s) Urquhart Jane<br>
  Abstract: Many things could be said, and no doubt have been said, in praise of both Carol Shields and the work she created: her humanity, her ability to record and celebrate what others might see as less than dramatic lives, her skill in character development (evidenced by the veracity of dialogue, eccentricity of action, and sensitive renditions of her character’s inner lives), and her ability to put together beautifully crafted sentences. I loved Carol and loved everything about her work, and, at the end of the day, what I loved more than anything was what I will call the clarity of<br>

  Abstract: A playful specter is haunting the world. Since the 1960s, when the use of the word “ludic” became popular in both Europe and the US to designate playful behavior and artifacts, playfulness has become increasingly a mainstream characteristic of modern and postmodern culture. In the first decade of the 21st century we can even speak of the global “ludification of culture” (Raessens 2006; 2014).

  Abstract: Location-aware mobile technologies produce different forms of control. Parents give their children “chaperone” phones equipped with GPS to control where they might go. Parole officers remotely control parolees’ mobility patterns to restrict the places they can visit (Shklovski et al. 2009; Troshynski, Lee, and Dourish 2008). People use their GPS-phone mapping capabilities to feel familiar with their surrounding environment, leading to the belief they are able to “control” the chaos of urban spaces.

  Abstract: In “Nietzsche, Genealogy, History,” Michel Foucault (re)introduced a concept in philosophy and the writing of history that he had derived from Friedrich Nietzsche: genealogy.¹ Foucault presented this concept as a history-writing against the grain insofar as it no longer starts from timeless values and realities lying in wait behind the stories of the past. Genealogy, for Foucault, was no longer naïve, in that it no longer searched for the pure origin of things but rather showed how such origins were constituted out of incoherent fragments, accidents, errors, and failings. Insofar as genealogy had to do with
                  descent, this was a<br>

  Abstract: Years ago, I was hitching with a friend on a Buginese fishing boat from Sulawesi to the island of Lembata in eastern Indonesia. One late afternoon, when the sun was at its lowest, we had spotted a whale rising up from the waters within yards before us—so close and unexpected as to almost become unreal. Dolphins regularly accompanied our boat, and the sea stretched out with nothing in sight save some deserted islands scattered here and there. It was exactly one year before the great flood devastated eastern Flores, wiping away several islands in the Flores Sea. Now, however,<br>

  Abstract: Space is not the name of a thing, but of that outside of things thanks to which their distinctness is granted them. Things could not be distinct in nature if they did not also occupy distinct places. If I am taking the tree’s place (and not just “replacing it”), there is neither tree nor human being, but something else: a sylvan divinity, for example. When the distinction of place is hindered or rejected, a crushing, a constriction, and a suffocation is produced. That is what we can see in those geological folds and contractions out of which come igneous fusions,<br>

  Book Title: Missing Link-The Evolution of Metaphor and the Metaphor of Evolution<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): DONALDSON JEFFERY<br>
  Abstract: We look for missing links in the sciences and humanities, but the essential missing link - metaphor - is always in front of us. In Missing Link, Jeffery Donaldson unites literary criticism and evolutionary and cognitive science to show how metaphor has been with us since the beginning of time as a seed in the nature of things. With examples from centuries of poets, critics, philosophers, and scientists, he details how metaphor is a chemistry, an exchange of energies forming and dissolving, and an openness in the spaces between things. He considers the ways in which DNA learns how to liken things that have been, how mutation makes errors and then tries them on, and how evolution is hypothesis - nature's way of "thinking more." The mind is a matrix of relations: neural synapses cascade into ever-changing pathways and patterns. Metaphor is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. It is the unbroken thread between matter and spirit. Whether offering analysis of a turn of phrase or chemical reaction, Missing Link presents a vision of literature that is also a vision of the cosmos, and vice versa. It enters the debate between evolution and religion, and challenges scientists, literary theorists, and religious advocates to rethink the relations between their disciplines.<br>

He tells us what a literary work means.” Thus says Monroe Beardsley,¹ who has written as thoughtfully and influentially on the subject as any philosopher in the past fifty years, and this is as good a place to start as any. Though there may well be ways of embodying interpretations that do not involve saying
                     whatsomething means (for example, reading a poem out loud), I shall follow Beardsley’s lead and concentrate on what interpreterssay,on interpretive remarks. Consider some putative examples:<br>

  Abstract: The first thing required to make criticism possible is an object to be criticized—something for the critic to interpret and to judge. with its own properties against which interpretations and judgments can be checked. The Principle of Independence. as it might be called. is that literary works exist as individuals and can be distinguished from other things. though it is another question whether they enjoy some special mode of existence. as has been held. I think everyone must agree on this first postulate—here rather roughly stated. But there is another postulate that is logically complementary to the first:<br>

  Abstract: In the early 1900s when the American film industry was just getting on its feet, several million Irish and Italians immigrated to America looking for prosperity. They had fled the grinding poverty of Kilkenny and Catania, endured terrible hardships at sea, and then signed up for twelve-hour shifts in American factories. But at least they could feed a large family and gradually build up some savings. Nothing in their ethnic values or their religion prevented them from subscribing to the country’s Anglo-Protestant ethic of hard work, private ownership, and success.<br>

This wordhegemonyis often confused with empire and frequently appears with such ancillary words asimperial, imperialist,and so on, as if they all meant the same thing. Of course, they can be made to mean the same thing. But what if the consensus is fundamentally mistaken about what is actually unique about the current<br>

  Abstract: Philosophical anthropology. The label conjures up a hybrid few have heard of, and for many of those, a hybrid of questionable viability. Indeed, the words sound a flat thud in the ears of most philosophers and a rude intrusion in the ears of most anthropologists, who hardly want anything to do with it. Some would in fact question the very existence of such an animal since the cross-disciplinary marriage necessary to its birth is believed never to have been consummated—at least to the satisfaction of both parties.<br>

  Author(s) Pritchard Michael S.<br>
  Abstract: FOR SOME TIME NOW I have been puzzling over what we really have in mind when we say that the schools should be doing a better job of helping students develop their critical-thinking abilities. Although most educators agree that something should be done, there is no consensus on how to go about it. I suspect that this is partly because there is no consensus on what critical thinking is. I offer no definition. But I do have some reflections that, I hope, will contribute to our understanding of critical thinking.<br>

  Abstract: WHEN JILL PORTOS tries to tell Lisa and Harry about her father’s theory of mind in Chapter Seven, all she can remember is the distinction between differences of degree and differences of kind. Harry is excited by this idea; he links it with his rule, discovered earlier, about turning sentences around. He now realizes that his rule exemplifies certain kinds of relationships between things. Since they occur again and again throughout the story in different guises, it is important for us to understand the nature of these relationships. Furthermore, comprehending these relations will help us to explain why his rule<br>

  Abstract: If we take our subject seriously, the theory of leadership known as “dirty hands” must be considered. Without this theory, a discussion of military morality would seem unreal. Briefly, the theory holds that in order to govern an institution, one must sometimes do things that are immoral. To act properly as a mayor of a city, a chief of a police department, a head of a large corporation, or a commander of an engaged military unit, one must have morally dirty hands. Further, this theory insists, we do not want leaders who are so concerned with their own personal morality<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we considered religious conversion in terms of an inchoate (total) fulfillment of our conscious-intentional orientation toward meaning, truth, and goodness. It is the experience of God’s love flooding our hearts (Rom. 5:5), of being loved by God “before the foundation of the world” (Eph. 1:4). This involves a radical shift in our horizon so that in everything we do we act on a different level, with an expanded range of possibilities for meaning, truth and goodness.

It is full of frustration and fear. There is consternation and a vexed wrestling with the entrapping “jaws” that belong … well, to “something.” State terror’s theatrics are like that, unleashing forces that brutalize<br>

  Book Title: The Wisdom and Foolishness of God-First Corinthians 1-2 in Theological Exploration<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Askani Hans-Christoph<br>
  Abstract: The first two chapters of Paul’s first epistle to the Christians of Corinth, written in the fifth decade of the first century, have played a significant role in the history of Christian theology. Interpreting the central event in Christianity, namely the crucifixion of Jesus, Paul reflects on the wisdom and foolishness of God, which he opposes to the world’s wisdom. According to Paul, the “word of the cross," which is “foolishness" to some and “scandal" to others, leads to an upheaval in one’s way of thinking. For two millenia, theology has often turned to these passages in order to sustain its reflection. Many central questions emerge from Paul’s text on the meaning of a crucified Messiah, on God’s omnipotence, weakness, and suffering. This volume hopes to achieve two things by seeking to place exegetes, historians, philosophers, and theologians in conversation: to better understand Paul’s text and its reception and also to examine the ways in which it can nourish our theological reflection today.<br>

Everything is demanded of theology, up to and including the most austere renunciation, the most shocking deprivation of its privileges, of its regal aspirations as the queen of the sciences, of its own special knowledge, revelations, and inspirations, requiring it to be poor and itinerant, naked and obedient, even unto death.

  Abstract: I have to begin by confessing that when asked to present something on St. Maximus the Confessor, I chose the title because I was very familiar with one passage in St. Maximus that relates the theme of the foolishness of God to the play of Wisdom, or strictly the Word—because I had included the passage in the works I had translated in a book on the Confessor—and rather imagined that I would find several parallel passages, if I looked, and could build up something on that basis.¹ It didn’t quite work out like that: Maximus quite rarely refers<br>

  Abstract: Words are not the same thing as concepts. While concepts make things accessible to reason and thought, words make them accessible to speech (
                  parole). In ordinary language there may not be much need to differentiate neatly between the two, especially since speech and thought are closely interrelated, perhaps even closer than language (langue) and thought. But, at least in part, their interrelatedness is due to their common opposition to what in ordinary language is called reality. Speech and thought are among the most important devices of the human soul for conceptualizing reality. It may be naïve to identify reality with<br>

  Abstract: In 1 Cor. 1:23–24, Paul writes: “we proclaim Christ nailed to the cross; … he is the power of God and the wisdom of God,” before adding, in v. 25, that “the weakness of God is stronger than human strength” (reb). The link between the cross of Christ and the power of God is thus explicitly made by Paul. Consequently, one must ask whether it is possible, in a Christian theological perspective, to think about something we may call God’s “almightiness” from the event of the cross and, first, from the “word of the cross” around which the second<br>

  Abstract: Several well-known contemporary philosophers have been struck in recent years by the apostle Paul and, in at least one case, by the theme of “universalism.”¹ But Paul is, of course, not only the author of the famous sentence of Gal. 3:28: “There is no such thing as Jew and Greek, slave and freeman, male and female; for you all are one person in Christ Jesus” (neb). He is also the one who, like no other, concentrated Christian thought and life on the figure of Christ crucified—“I resolved that while I was with you I would not claim to know<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155j66d">Resisting history</a><br>
  Abstract: There are moments when the pursuit of history can seem truly unnerving. Sometimes that past which was meant to ground our ideas and conceptions gives way and reveals something stranger, alien and uncanny. Although such episodes are rare events in most historians’ lives, they form a recurring motif in fantastic literature, where they are widely associated with the breakdown of identity and personality. Stories of historians driven to madness and despair when their narratives are confounded recur repeatedly in novels, from Mary Ward’s

  Book Title: Acceptable words-Essays on the poetry of Geoffrey Hill<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): WAINWRIGHT JEFFREY<br>
  Abstract: Geoffrey Hill has said that some great poetry 'recognises that words fail us'. These essays explore Hill's struggle over fifty years with the recalcitrance of language. This book seeks to show how all his work is marked by the quest for the right pitch of utterance whether it is sorrowing, angry, satiric or erotic. It shows how Hill's words are never lightly 'acceptable' but an ethical act, how he seeks out words he can stand by - words that are 'getting it right'. This book is the most comprehensive and up-to-date critical work on Geoffrey Hill so far, covering all his work up to ‘Scenes from Comus’ (2005), as well as some poems yet to appear in book form. It aims to contribute something to the understanding of his poetry among those who have followed it for many years and students and other readers encountering this major poet for the first time.<br>

  Abstract: Robert Southwell (1561–95), Catholic martyr and poet from whose work Geoffrey Hill takes his epigraph for his 1975 sonnet sequence ‘Lachrimae or Seven tears figured in seven passionate Pavans’ (
                  Tenebrae, 1978;CPpp. 145–51) wrote in his posthumous workSt Peter’s Complaint(1595) of what he saw as his contemporaries’ abuse of their poetic talents: ‘a poet, a lover and a liar are by many reckoned but three things with one signification’. That the identification of poetry and feigning was nearly a commonplace in Elizabethan literary culture might be gauged by its reiteration by the rather less spiritually<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155j67x">Acceptable words</a><br>
  Abstract: After the long, shifting account of Charles Péguy in Hill’s poem, what are we to take from him? What sense is to be made, for what will he, who ‘commends us to nothing’, serve? The concluding moment of the poem is when we expect summary, a considered gesture, at least the ceremony of closure even though it might resemble stiffened custom and a bellowing ‘with hoarse dignity into the wind’. Hill’s tone, directed at his own contemplation as well as that of the reader, concedes little. ‘Take that for example!’ mingles defiance, the clean blow, with surly dismissal.<br>

  Abstract: Douglas Coupland is captivated by rubbish, its possible uses and its plural connotations. Motifs of household garbage, environmental pollution and technological junk are everywhere in his fiction and visual art – the substance of his work is frequently constructed from broken things, forgotten concepts, obsolete inventions and the many ‘time-expired’, disposable items that we routinely ditch. In his ‘Canada House’ exhibition (2003; 2004–5), for example, a number of sculptures incorporate salvaged odds and ends – discarded tin cans, plastic bottles, food packaging, shreds of clothing, broken buoys and the assorted, shop-worn treasures of the tenacious beachcomber – all of which are redeployed<br>

  Book Title: The subject of love-Hélène Cixous and the feminine divine<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Renshaw Sal<br>
  Abstract: *The Subject of Love: Hélène Cixous and the Feminine Divine* is about abundant, generous, other-regarding love. In the history of Western ideas of love, such a configuration has been inseparable from our ideas about divinity and the sacred; often reserved only for God; and rarely thought of as a human achievement. This book is a substantial engagement with her philosophies of love, inviting the reader to reflect on the conditions of subjectivity that just might open us to something like a divine love of the other. Renshaw follows this thread in this genealogy of abundant love: the thread that connects the subject of love from 5th century B.C.E. Greece and Plato, to the 20th century protestant theology of agapic love of Anders Nygren, to the late 20th century poetico-philosophy of Hélène Cixous. This study will be of particular interest to academics and students of the history of gender, cultural studies, criticism and gender studies<br>

  CHAPTER 1  Speaking of love: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jb3s">The subject of love</a><br>
  Abstract: Throughout history theorists and philosophers of love have been preoccupied with the relationship between the subjects and objects of love. From Plato’s reflections on the divinity of a disembodied love of wisdom to the Christian ideal of loving our enemies, there is a recurring concern with understanding the mediating aspects of love. How should we think of the kinds of exchanges that love brings about? Whether thinking about love concerns relations between human beings, or relations between humans and the divine, the very notion of love as developed in Western thought presupposes that something is loved, while someone else, as<br>

  Abstract: In an interview in 1996 with Hélène Cixous, Kathleen O’Grady broke something of a critical silence regarding the subject of Cixous’ relationship to religion. To the question of her personal relation to God, Cixous describes herself as ‘religiously atheistic’ (O’Grady, 1996–97). The statements that frame this disclosure, however, provide a context in which to read just what it is that she is implicitly distancing herself from and, more importantly, what it might be within religious discourses with which in practice she aligns herself. In the preceding sentence she said of God something she has said many times throughout her<br>

  3  Foucault and the ethics of subjectivity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jbh0">The structure of modern cultural theory</a><br>
  Abstract: Michel Foucault wrote next to nothing specifically about the concept of culture, did not publish too much about art and barely addressed in a direct way the specific issue of creativity. He is sometimes assumed to be a postmodernist, and something of a pessimistic one. This chapter will argue that, to the contrary, Foucault was a modernist and that his work, especially in its late period, was saturated with the question of aesthetics – and, for that matter, with that of creativity – which, for him, was part of a bigger question than the issue of the socalled status of ‘ art’<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jbh0">The structure of modern cultural theory</a><br>
  Abstract: Much has been made in this book of the idea of modern cultural theory being ultimately ethical in its aims and outlook. Or at least, our principles of reading in relation to Adorno, Bourdieu and Foucault have been, in effect, ethico-critical ones; emphasising that these thinkers are best read not simply in ‘positive’ or epistemic terms but as contributing to a kind of ethically minded reconfiguration of ourselves as critical beings, something that has been shorthanded in terms of the ethics of autonomy.<br>

  Abstract: This book has claimed that there is – or was – such a thing as modern cultural theory and argued that there is – or was – something ultimately ethical about it. It would no doubt be an understatement to observe that a great many issues and problems remain. Of the many, perhaps four stand out in particular. There is still, naggingly, the question of the exact status of this entity, modern cultural theory. Related to this, there might be continuing queries about what is ‘modern’ and what is ‘theoretical’ about modern cultural theory. There are questions of politics. And then there is more,<br>

  Abstract: The difficulties involved in giving an account of the contemporary significance of the ‘aesthetic tradition’ from Kant to Nietzsche become apparent when one considers phenomena such as the following.¹ It might, for example, seem surprising that many of the thinkers who enthusiastically pursue a post-Nietzschean undermining of the illusions and repressions they associate with ‘Western metaphysics’ still have a considerable investment in art and in philosophical reflection on art. A radically anti-metaphysical view of art is in some respects more congruent with the idea that art itself is now something whose very existence has been put in doubt by various<br>

  Abstract: I have suggested that being close to the good seems to mean extending out into a far away place where it is possible to draw an idealised picture of yourself. From Britain, the work in Africa looks very clearly good, along the lines I have drawn – it is disinterested, grand, unifying and differentiating. But if the work in Africa is to have lasting currency in these terms – if it is to continue to enable self-idealisation – there must be something about the way Britain engages in Africa that allows this idea to persist, and the ideal to remain<br>

  Abstract: I began this book with the idea that New Labour’s approach to Africa represented something different from foreign policy as usual. This position has often appeared difficult to defend: realist interpretations, those who pointed out the self-promotion or self-justification of politicians, and the sometimes justifiable charges of hypocrisy, all throw up compelling alternative explanations. None of these can be totally dismissed. There have been occasions on which British interests have been put before African welfare: the sale of a military air traffic system to Tanzania, and the tacit support for Ethiopian incursions into Somalia, for example.

  Book Title: Contemporary Violence-Postmodern war in Kosovo and Chechnya<br>

  Author(s): Moore Cerwyn<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary Violence: Postmodern War in Kosovo and Chechnya draws on several years of field research, as well as interpretive IR theory and analysis of empirical source material so as to shed light on contemporary violence. Drawing on interpretive approaches to International Relations, the book argues that founding events and multiple contexts informed the narratives deployed by different members of each movement, illustrating why elements within the Kosovo Liberation Army and the armed forces of the Chechen republic of Ichkeria favoured regional and local strategies of war in the Balkans and the North Caucasus. The book draws on post-positivist analysis and empirical research so as unravel the relationship between narratives, stories and hermeneutic accounts of International Relations; regional politics and trans-local identity; globalisation and visual aspects of contemporary security; criminality and emotionality; which together illustrate the dynamics within the armed resistance movements in Kosovo and the North Caucasus and the road to war in 1999. The book is a major addition to a small field of genuinely readable studies of IR theory. The book will be of interest to academics, researchers, students, area studies experts and policy-makers seeking to understand the formation of the armed resistance movements in Kosovo and Chechnya. Amongst other things, the book will be of interest to students and scholars of International Relations, Political Studies, Area Studies, as well as those within Cultural and Historical and Sociological Studies.<br>

                  S:241). ‘Sugar’, the last and eponymous piece in Byatt’s first collection of short stories, is essentially a story about the act of storytelling – about its place in and its shaping of our everyday lives, our individual and collective identities, and our complicated sense of what, if anything, can be said to constitute a ‘truth’<br>

                  PM:170). The conflict between literary experimentation and realist allegiances, with all its connotations of avant-garde innovation and linguistic astuteness on the one hand, and the socio-political impulse to return to a portrayal of ‘understandable characters in a reasonably straightforward style: no tricks, no experimental foolery’ (Kingsley Amis qtd in Morrison, 1980: 299) on the other, had become something of a commonplace in criticism<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jht2">Jonathan Lethem</a><br>
  Abstract: Amnesia is a kind of immobility. To obliterate connections between past and present is to preclude the possibility of movement or change in the future, to condemn oneself to the anaesthetised drudgery of the endless present. It is appropriate, then, that Jonathan Lethem so often employs spatial metaphors in his interrogations of the condition of American amnesia. In
                  Amnesia Moon(1995), which collides the road narrative with dystopian science fiction, the road performs this metaphorical function. Mikhail Bakhtin cites the road as an example of a literary chronotope, something he defines as ‘the primary means for materializing time in space<br>

  Abstract: One of the main expectations of first-century charismatics was that they be healers. Even a cursory look at the four gospels reveals that Jesus was seen as a healer. Healing, evidently, played a major role in Jesus’s ministry.¹ There are some fifteen stories of healing by Jesus. For the sake of argument, even if the historian comes to the conclusion that such-and-such miracle stories are not authentic—say, for instance, the changing of water into wine at Cana—the story as creation of the early church says some significant things about the historical Jesus: his participation in a banquet; his<br>

  Abstract: “Why do you want to study al-Azhar? There is nothing to be said about it. It is a pawn of the state,” an Egyptian intellectual once told me, showing contempt for my object of study.² I almost believed him. When I first visited al-Azhar University in 1992, in the very center of Fatimid Cairo, the first thing that struck me was its emptiness. ‘Things’ were happening somewhere else, I thought. My political scientist colleagues who studied political or radical Islam would probably get more interesting data from their field research than I would. While al-Azhar Street, the large and crowded<br>

  Abstract: “This is unbelievable!” I said, astonished to see this beautiful building for the first time. Meanwhile he, a British expert who used to work in Historic Cairo, looked at me out of the corner of his eyes, somehow proud of the fact that he knew something about my city that I did not. I must admit that it was shocking for me to discover this highly refined building a few steps off al-Dab al-Ahmar Street, very close to the well-known Bab Zuwayla, the southern gate of Historic Cairo. Despite the fact that I have been through this area hundreds of<br>

  1  Landscape Biographies: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15r3x99">Landscape Biographies</a><br>
  Author(s) Renes Johannes<br>
  Abstract: As an essential part of human life worlds, landscapes have the potential to absorb something of people’s lives, works and thoughts. But landscapes also shape their own life histories on different timescales, imprinted by human existence, affecting personal lives and transcending individual human life cycles. This combination of reciprocity and distinctness creates a strong but complex intertwining of personhood and place – an intertwining which most people become aware of during their own lifetime. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the ‘co-scripting’ of landscapes and people figures prominently in literature, autobiographies and academic research, as well as in our<br>

  2  The Marsh of Modernity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15r3x99">Landscape Biographies</a><br>
  Author(s) Palsson Gisli<br>
  Abstract: Nature is unruly, continually causing problems through flooded rivers and perfect storms and, of course, receding glaciers and global warming. In the modernist language of mainstream ecology, things spin out of control, beyond steady states and tipping points. While some of these events may be less surprising than they used to be, they often pose spectacular problems for human society and, as a result, demand close attention and concerted action. Wetlands have repeatedly provided apt examples, refusing to “behave”. Representing a substantial part of the earth’s land surface (about 6%), wetlands occur practically everywhere, on every continent (except Antarctica), in<br>

  Author(s) Holtorf Cornelius<br>
  Abstract: Although things are not living beings, in a metaphorical sense they can be considered to have lives. Things are made; they often do something; and over time many things move from place to place. Their meanings and functions change in different contexts. As time goes by things age and eventually they end up at a final resting place where they gradually disintegrate. Things can reach very different ages, from a few minutes to many millennia, but once dead only very few are brought back, for example as antiques or collectables, and given additional meanings in a new life.

  Abstract: The full body of reflection on the truths of the Catholic faith represents the collected wisdom of intelligent and holy men and women from every part of the world over two millennia. Its tributaries include thousands of years of ancient Jewish experience as well as the cultures of Mesopotamia and Egypt; it draws on the entire heritage of classical Greece and Rome, the civilizations of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the scientific revolution, romanticism, modernism, and our globalized postmodern culture. Briefly put, there is nothing quite like it.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15zc91j">A Godly Humanism</a><br>
  Abstract: In the united states, at the mention of “religion,” what people often think of first is a moral code. We’re a pragmatic people; we’re practical people; we’re concerned about how to do things and how to act. In fact, pragmatism as a philosophy argues that theorizing follows action. Whereas classical Western wisdom stresses the thinking first and only thereupon the action that follows, Americans are very strong on action, and when it comes to defining religion, we tend to divide religions according to how they influence people’s behavior. Is it a “strict” religion? Is it an “easy” religion? What does<br>

  Abstract: It has long been recognised that the book of Leviticus is priestly literature, that it was most likely put together in the post–exilic period, and that it was incorporated into the emerging Torah at a late stage. This tended to create an impression that it is of lesser importance than other parts of the Torah. More recent focus on the present text has resulted in something of a reversal; a growing tendency to see it as a key piece within the Torah, even its centerpiece.¹ It provides instructions that are central for the relationship between God and Israel, between<br>

                  A Compendious Schema for the Constitution on the Sources of Revelation.¹ Famously, the Dogmatic Constitution itself would reject the (traditional) notion of Scripture and Tradition as two separate sources (fontes) of Revelation and assert that ‘Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture are tightly connected and linked with one another.

  Abstract: In-Between God' explores three important areas for contemporary Christianity: theology, community and discipleship. Part One inquires into the rhythms of faith as it interacts with themes of uncertainty and doubt, the nature of theological discourse, the task of systematic theology, evangelism and the various ways in which theology is done. Part Two discusses the importance of place in relation to the church, and themes of innovation, undecideability and new forms of monastic community. Part Three addresses themes in discipleship: simplicity, mysticism, the passions and pilgrimage. A red thread connecting these essays is the character of the triune God who is the energy and life in between all things.<br>

  Abstract: Innovation derives from the Latin

It is a controversial feature of the life of the Christian church. Innovation is almost endemic to Christianity. The very nature of the gospel suggests that notions of surprise and novelty belong to the life of discipleship because they first inhere in the very character and action of God.

  Abstract: If nothing else, postmodernism has reminded us of the influence that our own experience has on how we interpret Scripture. We bring as our ‘text’ to the text, as it were. But if all of us bring our own ‘texts’ to the text of Scripture, how will we interpret it in a consistent, meaningful, and nourishing fashion? Such is the disparity among Bible-believing Christians regarding the ‘plain meaning’ of Scripture that some have given up the idea that Scripture is to be interpreted. Rather, they say it should be merely read or listened to, whereby the biblical worldview will automatically<br>

  Abstract: Interpretation does not happen in a void. Interpretation emerges out of a context and speaks into a context. Interpreters are not disembodied voices. There is an interplay of interests at work, whether social or emotional, cultural or national, academic, financial, or religious. It is tempting to focus exclusively on the insights and achievements of individuals; these are usually accessible in their publications. We need to be aware of the existence of wider influences and interests that surge around individual scholars and shape something of their work.<br>

  Abstract: At the turn of the twenty-first century, Richard Rorty put forward his vision for a new form of social hope, “the hope that life will eventually be freer, less cruel, more leisured, richer in goods and experiences, not just for our descendants but for everybody’s descendants.”¹ The first step toward this neopragmatic future requires a change in priorities in which “everybody thinks that it is human solidarity, rather than knowledge of something not merely human, that really matters.”² This utopian task of “replacing certainty with hope” requires establishing a different kind of solidarity based on increasing individual happiness rather than<br>

  RESPONSIBILITIES AND CHALLENGES: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16f8cb0">Thou Shalt Not Kill: A Political and Theological Dialogue</a><br>
  Abstract: It is clear that, for whoever lives within the Judeo-Christian tradition, the first responsibility that issues from the commandment “You shall not kill” consists of deciding to remain within the covenant-pact and thence too of advocating that all men follow the dictates of rational, universal moral law. This responsibility is never obvious; it ever renews itself, and indeed its perennial renewal is an inexhaustible source of wonder and joy. The covenant-pact and the rational recognition of the splendor of the truth of fundamental moral experience, which shines in every man, is not a thing of the past. It is the<br>

  THE SEX OF CAIN from:

  Abstract: And if Cain had been a woman? The hypothesis is obviously absurd, and it is so for more than one reason. Even though Eve has an important role in the Edenic scene of sin that establishes humanity as a mortal species, the homicidal and fratricidal act that initiates human history provides for no woman. Something analogous happens to Pandora, the first woman according to Hesiod, from whose belly is born death in addition to other ills for the human race: the lineage that then descends from her is exclusively male, often brothers or those united in the warrior brotherhoods, whose<br>

  Abstract: In one of his last studies on colonial cinema, Marcel Oms inquires into the question of the genre’s aims and limits.¹ Pertinently, he highlights the near-absence of allusions to military conquest, from Algeria to sub-Saharan Africa to Indochina. Watching these films, one has the impression that these things never even happened, as if France had simply come into possession of these territories naturally. Colonization is presented as being around, as always having been around. Hardly ever does its origin of violence and opposition taint the silver screen.

  Abstract: The focus of this chapter will be provided by a consideration of a postcolonial approach to literature and its utility to French literary studies. A postcolonial methodology considers colonial influences and tropes in literary production, and works to reveal them. Let it first be noted that postcolonialism—in terms of its focus on the colonial influences and tropes in literary production—is already an important domain in the fields of literature and social sciences in Anglophone universities and in other academic institutions all over the world.

  Abstract: I do not begin from the premise that religion, as a set of beliefs, thoughts, or symbols, is an independently individuated entity of its own. By this I mean that religion is individuated as a phenomenon through human behavior and thought. This is intended to imply that the study of religions must think about religions as arising through, or possibly existing in, human behaviors. In this sense, religion does not exist independently of a human subject with causal or agentive powers in the world.

  Abstract: In his afterword to Paul Rabinow’s
                  Reflections on Fieldwork in Morocco(2007 [1977], 166–67), Pierre Bourdieu cites Jean Piaget’s famous dictum, “it is not so much that children don’t know how to talk: they try out many languages until they find one their parents can understand,” and concludes, “Ethnology will have taken a giant step forward when all ethnologists understand that something similar is taking place between informants and themselves.” This is a striking yet curious statement. Curious because it portrays anthropology as an improvable, developmental discipline, in spite of Bourdieu’s critique several pages earlier of the “positivist conception<br>

He did not want to separate the stable things which we see and the shifting way in which they appear; he wanted to depict matter as it takes on form, the birth of order through spontaneous organization” (Merleau-Ponty 1964 [1945]: 13).<br>

  Abstract: Clay animated films were produced in the United States as early as 1908 when Edison Manufacturing released a trick film entitled
                  The Sculptor’s Welsh Rarebit Dream.In 1916, clay animation became something of a fad, as an East Coast artist named Helena Smith Dayton and a West Coast animator named Hopkins produced clay animated films on a wide range of subjects. Hopkins in particular was quite prolific, producing over 50 clay animated segments for the weeklyUniversal Screen Magazine.But by the 1920s, cartoon animation using either cels or slash system was firmly established as the dominant mode of animation<br>

  Abstract: Following the Augustinian tradition, original sin is something that we are responsible for and hence guilty of, yet in another sense it is a destiny that befalls us. At stake is hence a fine balance between necessity and freedom, between personal guilt and delivery to destructive structures. Accordingly, acknowledging sin takes a personal sense of the I, confessing or revealing itself as the originator of deeds and speech, while acknowledging that this I is indebted—for better and for worse—to the inheritance of and continuous participation in a form of life that bestows coherence to those deeds and utterances.<br>

  Abstract: While Julia Kristeva doubtless did not have in mind the undead corpse of the zombie when she wrote of the abject and how it forces death upon the living, the walking dead undeniably embody abjection. It is not strange, then, that in representations of zombies, in film, literature, television, or other media, the primary focus is on how the humans who have not been infected confront and battle those who have returned from the dead. Those who engage in zombie fighting are necessarily confronting and denying the death (among other things) that the posthuman monster represents. This analysis of Seth<br>

  Abstract: Here is a list, very incomplete, of things one should keep in mind when attempting to write seriously about zombies. Zombies do not exist. Zombies are not related to werewolves or vampires.¹ Zombies are not, literally, mindless consumers, enraged proletarians, or stupid Americans—although some were perhaps once these things—and there is little use in casting them, even metaphorically, as
                  essentiallysuch, especially when attempting to offer a “theory of zombies.” This is because zombies do not form a natural kind, not even afictionalnatural kind. Wiithin the genre, zombies vary greatly in behavior, cognitive power, and athletic<br>

  Abstract: Language has been granted too much power. The linguistic turn, the semiotic turn, the interpretative turn, the cultural turn: it seems that at every turn lately every “thing”—even materiality—is turned into a matter of language or some other form of cultural representation. The ubiquitous puns on “matter” do not, alas, mark a rethinking of the key concepts (materiality and signification) and the relationship between them. Rather, it seems to be symptomatic of the extent to which matters of “fact” (so to speak) have been replaced with matters of signification (no scare quotes here). Language matters. Discourse matters.

Excruciatingly conscious of nature’s constitution as Other in the histories of colonialism, racism, sexism, and class domination of many kinds, many people who have been both ground to powder and formed in European and Euro-American crucibles nonetheless find in this problematic, ethno-specific, long-lived, and globally mobile concept something we cannot do without<br>

  11  HOW REAL IS RACE? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzgqh">Material Feminisms</a><br>
  Author(s) Hames-García Michael<br>
  Abstract: A quick read of Ward Connolly’s Racial Privacy Initiative (which would have eliminated California’s use of race as a means of classification) reveals much about the contradictions in public discourse about race. Among other things, it explicitly provided for the retention of racial profiling on the part of the police while freeing police departments from having to keep track of the race of the people they arrested or detained. The ballot measure, promoted using liberal, antiracist rhetoric, would have frustrated all attempts to demonstrate discriminatory patterns of surveillance, arrest, or harassment by police. Race clearly matters, and yet throughout its<br>

  14  CASSIE’S HAIR from:

  Author(s) Bordo Susan<br>
  Abstract: In the first year and a half of Cassie’s life, her hair was basically not an issue because she didn’t have much. Then one day she came home from day care with a dozen tiny braids marking a complex and delicate pattern on her tiny head. I was, first of all, mystified. I had no idea she had enough hair to do anything like this. Where had all that hair come from? How had her teacher gathered it up like that? And how had she gotten her to sit still long enough to do it?<br>

  Abstract: In Book XI of his
                  Confessions, Augustine records his perplexity over the nature of time. What is it? We talk about it all the time in our everyday conversations, as if we know what it is. “What then is time? Provided that no one asks me, I know. If I want to explain it to an inquirer, I do not know.”¹ Something similar is true about the self: in late modern Western culture, we talk about selves—and “the self”—all the time.

  Abstract: In chapter 6 we saw that the cruciform self is not a punctual self. In this chapter I demonstrate the sense in which the cruciform self is a capable self, since capability is one of the central themes of philosophical anthropology. On Ricoeur’s definition, capability is a power or potentiality that the self is able to exercise—most basically, “the power to cause something to happen.”¹ So our question is this: What place do human agency and the power to act have in the life of faith?

  THREE  INSISTENCE AND HOSPITALITY: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzk5p">The Insistence of God</a><br>
  Abstract: The name of God is the name of trouble. The insistence of God means that God calls for a response or, since God is not somebody who “does” things like call, it means that the calling takes place in the middle voice, in and under the name of God. God calls in the middle voice. The call is perfectly figured in an unexpected and insistent knocking on our door. A disturbing visitation in the night is an uncertainty in which all the sting of “perhaps” is perfectly concentrated, in which the dynamics of “perhaps” and a theology of insistence is<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzk5p">The Insistence of God</a><br>
  Abstract: Žižek’s rereading of Hegel is more radical and disruptive than Malabou’s. Žižek sees the Hegel of the
                  au revoircoming, the Hegelian Absolute inching its way home through its peregrinations through world history, and he stops it in its tracks. In its place Žižek puts a more deeply doubly negative dialectic, where the Spirit does not come home, where it never had a home, where there never really was a “Spirit.” Adieu to the Spirit, good riddance. No, we will not meet again. No, no, we never met in the first place. Stop trying to recollect something that never happened.<br>

                  odium theologiae—the total contempt for religion on the part of secularists, the demonization of atheism by the theologians, which leads to outright violence by religious extremists. The whole thing is a perfect recipe for war. The current form this blackmail has taken in recent years is a new wave of “materialism,” “realism,” and “atheism” that has arisen in reaction to the so-called theological turn. These terms are used more or less interchangeably, as if theology is allergic to<br>

  Abstract: Having thus redescribed “objectivity” as a way to think about the world in which we live as if we were dead or never born, let us now take a careful look at the words that have sparked the current critique of continental philosophy—Meillassoux’s critique of “correlation” and “fideism,” in that order. This criticism has been set in motion by the theological turn, or the return of religion, which is taken to be a regrettable consequence of continental antirealism. I think there is something to this critique of fideism but it should be put to better purpose. It should be<br>

  Book Title: What Is Fiction For?-Literary Humanism Restored<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Harrison Bernard<br>
  Abstract: How can literature, which consists of nothing more than the description of imaginary events and situations, offer any insight into the workings of "human reality" or "the human condition"? Can mere words illuminate something that we call "reality"? Bernard Harrison answers these questions in this profoundly original work that seeks to re-enfranchise reality in the realms of art and discourse. In an ambitious account of the relationship between literature and cognition, he seeks to show how literary fiction, by deploying words against a background of imagined circumstances, allows us to focus on the roots, in social practice, of the meanings by which we represent our world and ourselves. Engaging with philosophers and theorists as diverse as Wittgenstein, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Foucault, Derrida, F. R. Leavis, Cleanth Brooks, and Stanley Fish, and illustrating his ideas through readings of works by Swift, Woolf, Appelfeld, and Dickens, among others, this book presents a systematic defense of humanism in literary studies, and of the study of the Humanities more generally, by a distinguished scholar.<br>

It seems to many at present that talk of such a power must necessarily imply what Paul de Man liked to call a specular relationship between the text and something outside it, which we might call in clumsy English “the extratextual” or, following Derrida and in only slightly less clumsy French, the “
                  hors-texte.” In an obvious sense, of course, what is<br>

  EIGHT  Aharon Appelfeld and the Problem of Holocaust Fiction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzkgb">What Is Fiction For?</a><br>
  Abstract: The problem many find with literary fiction about the Holocaust is that it is fiction. Such fiction presents us, therefore, no doubt among other more important things, with a further challenge to bring the arguments concerning fiction and reality that occupied us in part 1 down from the abstract empyrean of philosophical debate to the firm ground of practical literary criticism.<br>

  NINE  The Limits of Authorial License in Our Mutual Friend from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzkgb">What Is Fiction For?</a><br>
  Abstract: To expose the intimate connections between intellectual confidence and selective blindness, it is often sufficient to confront current certainties with the exploded convictions of a vanished age. In this Pickwickian sense, G. K. Chesterton’s 1911 essay on
                  Our Mutual Friendremains a useful companion to the novel.¹ Chesterton is as convinced that literature is “referential,” that its prime business is to represent reality, as we are that it is not. He celebrates Dickens for many things, but always, and centrally, for the accuracy of his descriptions of manners: “The particular kind of chaos that is created by the hospitality of<br>

It was not long before the newly moneyed were exerting power and influence over university education, while simultaneously expressing their suspicion of the very education they were funding.

  2  Solitary Men from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzn65">Levinas and the Crisis of Humanism</a><br>
  Abstract: “No one is more self-sufficient than Rousseau,” Levinas proclaims in his 1935 book,
                  On Escape,a statement that could be easily dismissed as a passing swipe at the eighteenth-century thinker.¹ No doubt, Levinas would have ambivalent feelings about Rousseau, whose philosophy is often cited as influential in the French Revolution and the development of the French Republic. Yet, Levinas’s stab at Rousseau’s emphasis on self-sufficiency is not simply a throwaway line; self-sufficiency lies at the heart of a humanism that would develop out of modernity and to which Levinas offers a sustained response. In short, “self-sufficiency” sums up everything that<br>

  Book Title: Material Ecocriticism-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oppermann Serpil<br>
  Abstract: Material Ecocriticism offers new ways to analyze language and reality, human and nonhuman life, mind and matter, without falling into well-worn paths of thinking. Bringing ecocriticism closer to the material turn, the contributions to this landmark volume focus on material forces and substances, the agency of things, processes, narratives and stories, and making meaning out of the world. This broad-ranging reflection on contemporary human experience and expression provokes new understandings of the planet to which we are intimately connected.<br>

  Author(s) Oppermann Serpil<br>
  Abstract: An ancient Mediterranean landscape; an endangered species in the Amazon; the Library of Congress; the Gulf Stream; carcinogenic cells, DNA, dioxin; a volcano, a school, a city, a factory farm; the outbreak of a virus, a toxic plume; bio-luminescent water; your eyes, our hands, this book: what do all these things have in common? The answer to this question is simple. Whether visible or invisible, socialized or wild, they are all material forms emerging in combination with forces, agencies, and other matter. Entangled in endless ways, their “more-than-human” materiality is a constant process of shared becoming that tells us something<br>

  Abstract: Responding to his country’s record rainfalls in the beginning of the twenty-first century, British journalist Brian Cathcart seems to bring more of it.
                  Rainmakes a dreary forecast: “It is only when things go wrong that our dim consciousness of scientific meteorology rises to the surface” (66). French sociologist of science Bruno Latour would diagnose this tendency as “blackboxing.” Focusing only on the success of a scientific or technological apparatus paradoxically renders “the joint production of actors and artifacts entirely opaque” (Hope 183).¹ When a meteorology machine runs smoothly, it produces factual climates that we can reasonably predict and accurately<br>

  Author(s) Bennett Jane<br>
  Abstract: Paracelsus (1493–1541) experienced the natural world as a complex order of sympathies, resonances, magnetic attractions, and analogies (Pagel 52).¹ Though Paracelsus is variously categorized as physician, philosopher, alchemist, herbalist, I like to think of him as a plant physiognomist, as, that is, a practitioner of the art of discovering temperament and character from outward appearance. Each natural object bore for him a divine “signature” encoded in the thing’s shape, smell, texture, color, posture. This equivocal sign served as a spur to the human perceiver to engage in the artistry—the speculative thinking and practical experimentation—that would give determinacy<br>

  Abstract: In entitling my contribution to this postscript “Spirits That Matter” (with thanks to the editors for their inspired suggestion), my intention is not to oppose something immaterial called “spirit” to the materiality of “the body,” as might be implied for those readers who hear in this phrase an allusion to Judith Butler’s influential
                  Bodies That Matter.On the contrary: my implied divergence from Butler moves, rather (in company with other new materialists), in the direction of a more thoroughgoing materialism than that which is entailed in Butler’s discursive constructivism.

  Abstract: “I received your letter,” wrote Marie de l’Incarnation to her son, Claude, “and everything that was in your packet when I was no longer expecting it.” It was the summer of 1647 and nearly a decade since Marie had left her cloister in Tours, France, to found the first Ursuline convent in the New World. The Quebec in which Marie had settled in 1639 was still, eight years later, underdeveloped, poorly organized, and thinly populated—a struggling outpost pitifully vulnerable to Iroquois attacks.

  Abstract: To his critics, Bourdieu’s understanding of human agency (upon which I have relied to loosely structure my explanation of the abandonment) amounts to nothing more than a sophisticated version of social determinism.¹ Although Bourdieu’s intention had been to articulate a way of thinking about why people do what they do that transcended the reductive binaries of domination and resistance, his critics have consistently accused him of proposing a model of agency that condemns human actors to the reproduction of their own histories. And it is easy to see upon what logical grounds such accusations rest. For Bourdieu, after all, social<br>

  Abstract: Hegel is without a doubt one of the most misunderstood thinkers in Western intellectual history, a history he claimed to sum up and bring to its maturity. This misunderstanding has several roots. One is the intrinsic difficulty of grasping Hegel’s thought. It is dense, technical, dialectical, and arranged in such a way that, to understand anything in it, one has to understanding its linkage with the whole system of thought. This means that one could easily take any given statement out of context and find in it a meaning that on the surface sounds preposterous.<br>

  Abstract: In a polemic typically aimed at Hegelians and in the name of religious piety, Kierkegaard complained that philosophers construct magnificent thought-castles and dwell in miserable shacks nearby. Dwelling is a matter of deepest individuality, of subjectivity, passion, and inwardness.¹ It is a matter of the heart, of which Pascal says that reason knows nothing.² And everyone knows that the individual with his precious heart is swallowed up in Hegelian panlogicism and ground under in the march of the Absolute through history.<br>

                  amor fatias the will to the Eternal Recurrence of the Same.² It seems that we have identical, if paradoxical, claims. Both of them find affinities in Spinoza, for whom everything follows with rigid necessity, and the free man is one who is privileged by the working of necessity to recognize that fact by rising above the appetites that cloud the mind.³ Awareness of belonging to the Whole and accepting the necessity of fate link Nietzsche to Spinoza<br>

  Abstract: Nothing seems more evident than the nature of body. We apply the term “body” to what presents itself through the five senses: what can be seen, touched, smelt, heard, and tasted. It is what is extended, mobile, and resistant, appearing in various shapes and exhibiting the properties correlative to each of the senses. We ourselves are evidently bodies and we have to do always with bodies in our wakeful lives. But that does not settle the question of their nature—only how we ordinarily use the term and how we identify instances of it.<br>

Shakespeare’s line, “There are more things in heaven and on earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy,” though applicable to many thinkers, seems inappropriate when applied to Weiss. In his own way, Weiss is even more ample than the omnivorous Hegel, who, after all, never elaborated a philosophy of sport. But then again, many seem inclined to reverse Shakespeare’s line in Weiss’s case: “There are more things in Weiss’s philosophy<br>

It is dense, technical, dialectical, and arranged in such a way that, to understand anything in it, one has to understanding its linkage with the whole system of thought. This means that one could easily take any given statement out of context and find in it a meaning that on the surface sounds preposterous.<br>

  Abstract: In a polemic typically aimed at Hegelians and in the name of religious piety, Kierkegaard complained that philosophers construct magnificent thought-castles and dwell in miserable shacks nearby. Dwelling is a matter of deepest individuality, of subjectivity, passion, and inwardness.¹ It is a matter of the heart, of which Pascal says that reason knows nothing.² And everyone knows that the individual with his precious heart is swallowed up in Hegelian panlogicism and ground under in the march of the Absolute through history.<br>

  Abstract: Nothing seems more evident than the nature of body. We apply the term “body” to what presents itself through the five senses: what can be seen, touched, smelt, heard, and tasted. It is what is extended, mobile, and resistant, appearing in various shapes and exhibiting the properties correlative to each of the senses. We ourselves are evidently bodies and we have to do always with bodies in our wakeful lives. But that does not settle the question of their nature—only how we ordinarily use the term and how we identify instances of it.<br>

  Abstract: The Platonic dialogues are not treatises in disguise. They are protreptic and proleptic instruments, positioning the reader dispositionally and providing hints for the work of completing the direction of thought by attending to “the things themselves,” the phenomena to which human beings, properly attuned, have native access. Plato, I would contend, is a proto-phenomenologist whose dialogues yield significant coherent results when approached from that point of view.<br>

  Abstract: Plato and Heidegger stand at two ends of the philosophic tradition. Plato launched metaphysics as the search for the truth of the Whole; Heidegger attempted to get back to the ground of metaphysics after it reached its supposed end—in one sense in Hegel and in another sense in Nietzsche. Crucial to Plato is the struggle of philosophy with art over the basis of human existence. The infamous line in the tenth book of the

  Abstract: In the

Each division, in turn, is further divided into positive and negative properties. The positive relative properties, goodness and truth, have received extended treatment by the Scholastics, as has the negative absolute property, unity. However, the positive absolute propertyres(thing) and especially the negative relative propertyaliquid(other, i.e.,alium quid) are generally given scant treatment.<br>

                  Critique of Pure Reason, we find the famouscosmological antinomiessetting the empirical against the rational: the limited or unlimited character of time, the divisible or indivisible character of the basic constituents of things, freedom or the laws of nature, and necessity or contingency as the basis of things.¹ In theCritique of Practical Reason, the rational nature, governed by duty, is set over against the animal nature of inclination, duty against happiness, deontology<br>

  Abstract: The most contested affirmation regarding Jesus of Nazareth pertains to his divinity. It is the case, however, that the traditional affirmation of the perfect humanity of Jesus is also utterly controversial in modern theology. In one sense, this is simply because it is inherently controversial to affirm that there exists a real “essence” of human nature that God could assume. The subjacent question is philosophical: can we speak about perennial natures present in things in general and in human beings in particular down through time, and if so, how is it the case? In another sense, the controversial character of<br>

  Aspects of Historicity in John 1–4: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16ptndz">John, Jesus, and History, Volume 2</a><br>
  Author(s) Koester Craig R.<br>
  Abstract: The manner in which modern scholars investigate questions of historicity is one that the Fourth Evangelist would find peculiar. In contemporary research, the historical Jesus is the pre-Easter Jesus, and questions of historicity focus on how much we can know about the ministry of Jesus prior to his death. The writer of the Fourth Gospel, however, assumes that truly understanding the pre-Easter Jesus involves a post-Easter perspective. At points this Gospel specifically draws later insights into the meaning of Jesus’ words and actions and acknowledges that Jesus said and did things that were not understood prior to his resurrection (John<br>

  Imitating Jesus: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16ptndz">John, Jesus, and History, Volume 2</a><br>

  Abstract: From earliest days, John has been viewed as the “spiritual gospel” (πνευματικὸν εὐαγγέλιον), while the “external facts” (actually, “the bodily things” (τὰ σωματικὰ) were preserved in the Synoptics (a saying originally attributed to Clement of Alexandria by Eusebius,
                  Hist. eccl.6.14.7). Thus John has been seen as relatively late and Hellenistic, and primarily theological, while the Synoptics were seen as earlier and more Jewish, and therefore, according to this argument, more historical. Not surprisingly, then, John has been neglected in the various quests for the historical Jesus. Nowhere is this contrast more obvious than with regard to the ethical teaching<br>

  Book Title: Speak Thus-Christian Language in Church and World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hovey Craig R.<br>
  Abstract: In its various forms, speech is absolutely integral to the Christian mission. The gospel is a message, news that must be passed on if it is to be known by others. Nevertheless, the reality of God cannot be exhausted by Christian knowledge and Christian knowledge cannot be exhausted by our words. All the while, the philosophy of modernity has left Christianity an impoverished inheritance within which to think these things. In Speak Thus, Craig Hovey explores the possibilities and limits of Christian speaking. At times ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical, these essays go to the heart of what it means to be the church today. In practice, the Christian life often has a linguistic shape that surprisingly implicates and reveals the commitments of people like those who care for the sick or those who respond as peacemakers in the face of violence. Because learning to speak one way as opposed to another is a skill that must be learned, Christian speakers are also guides who bear witness to the importance of churches for passing on a felicity with Christian ways of speaking. Through constructive engagements with interlocutors like Ludwig Wittgenstein, George Lindbeck, Jeffrey Stout, Stanley Hauerwas, John Howard Yoder, Thomas Aquinas, and the theology of Radical Orthodoxy, Hovey offers a challenging vision of the church'able to speak with a confidence that only comes from a deep attentiveness to its own limitations while able to speak prophetically in a world weary of words.<br>

  Abstract: Stanley Hauerwas has claimed that “Everything John Howard Yoder believes, I think is true.”¹ Indeed, this is also a common assumption regarding the two theologians since Hauerwas is better known and also makes plain his indebtedness to Yoder in nearly every essay and book. However, Craig Carter recently wrote that “The biggest problem in Yoder interpretation arises with regard to Stanley Hauerwas.”² This is because many readers come to Yoder by way of Hauerwas and, as a consequence, impose an interpretive grid whereby the differences between the two are overlooked.<br>

                  c.1561–1623).¹ HisThe Passions of the Minde in Generall, first published in 1601, has become something of a touchstone for literary scholars, offering a detailed description of embodied passion that has often been used as a gloss on dramatic and poetic representations of affective experience. In 2004 Mary Floyd-Wilson described Wright’sThe Passionsas ‘a handbook on rhetoric and the management of one’s emotions’, and a decade later one could be forgiven<br>

Yet Mowbray’s eloquent lament fails to influence the monarch who has banished him; as King Richard says, ‘It boots thee not to be compassionate. / After our sentence, plaining comes too late’ (1.3.174–5).

  Abstract: No government can operate entirely in the round. Some amount of secrecy is both necessary and inevitable.¹ But secrecy is fundamentally an affront to representative democracy, and it always exacts a cost. Secrecy engenders distrust, frustrates accountability, encourages arbitrary action, compromises the value of citizen participation, and disrespects human dignity. Secrecy also adds to the sense that government is distant and unresponsive. Institutions practice secrecy at their peril, yet many yield to its siren song. Institutions practice secrecy to various degrees and for various reasons: sometimes leaders or others have something terrible to hide, but often it simply seems easier<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt17kmw6p">Reconfiguring Myth and Narrative in Contemporary Opera</a><br>
  Abstract: Before anything takes place on stage, the overture ushers us into a sound world wrought with tension: the short, declamatory motive in the solo trumpet poses a question, which is answered by the cello’s descending glissando that heaves a sigh. Following this sequence of call and response, the viola and flute exchange a mournful melody. Interjected between these sonic blocks are the
                  disembodiedvoices of the male and female chorus. The static, cyclical motive sung by the female choir on “a” is counterpointed by the low, semitonal “sigh” motive sung by the male choir. Their voices remain wordless and invisible,<br>

  1  Luther at the Crossroads Between the Old and the New from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt17mcsdm">Luther and Liberation</a><br>
  Abstract: The Reformation originated in the action of the Augustinian monk Martin Luther (1483-1546). Luther’s outstanding importance in his own time and his relevance still today are too obvious to ignore. However, nothing is more inappropriate for Luther than to simply celebrate him.¹ For “What is Luther?” asked Luther in 1522, describing himself as “poor and stinking maggot fodder,” and his name as “wretched,” so that no one should call themselves “Lutheran,” but simply “Christian.” In any case, “Neither was I crucified for anyone.”²<br>

  2  In Praise of the Moral Imagination from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt17t7592">Divination’s Grasp</a><br>
  Abstract: The moral imagination encounters a powerful challenge in wisdom divination. It is at once visual, tactile, and verbal—to draw on an oral archive of archaic praise poetry and to make small things—the divinatory lots—speak with much moral significance about elusive and often ill-defined concerns. Many images are brought to bear with the poetry and the lots; the juxtapositions are sometimes paradoxical, not easily fused together. Yet there is a promise of getting wise guidance from an expert—the experienced diviner. What a diviner and his clients seek to grasp escapes ordinary knowledge—it concerns the occult in<br>

  Abstract: In Tswapong wisdom divination, the aesthetically pleasing way from the surface of things, including the divinatory lots, to their inner significance passes through poetry. The genre to which this poetry belongs is rich and widely found across Africa and, very prominently, in southern Africa—the oral poetry of praises,
                  maboko, singular,leboko,derived from the verbboka“honour by giving titles to a person in poems, sing the praises of” (Schapera 1965, 1, citing Brown 1931, 26); and the praise-poet is calledmmoki.¹ It is eulogy—a poetry that glorifies things, from trees, crops, rivers, hills to many scenic features<br>

  Abstract: In July 2002, I rode a taxi east from the town of Mampong toward a diviner’s village to interview him and his staff. The drive is along a dirt and clay road through two small towns before reaching Apiakrom, where the road then narrows off into the bush. The trip generally lasts about twenty-five minutes.

  Abstract: In his introduction to the
                  Anthropology of Evil, published some thirty years ago, David Parkin calls for an approach to the social manifestation of evil that extends beyond a narrow focus on witchcraft. If evil is perceived more broadly, as a range of actions that are associated with causing human harm, the categorization can include diverse instantiations of the phenomenon. Moreover, as a classification that is inherently relational, involving the imputation of responsibility to someone or something, the analysis of evil takes us into concerns with wider issues of cosmology and ontology.

  Author(s) CHAMBERS PAUL<br>
  Abstract: Welsh religious belief and practice has historically been associated with Nonconformity and an egalitarian religious practice grounded in the local chapel and the Welsh language and culture. Nonconformism emerged as a significant cultural and social force in Welsh society in the late eighteenth century and was consolidated in the nineteenth century. Grounded in religious and cultural dissent and subject to constant schisms, the religious landscape of Welsh was dotted with a patchwork of small Protestant denominations, sects and independent congregations. Taken individually, these groups were diverse in matters of belief and politics. Taken together they constituted something rather more significant,<br>

I am fascinated with narratives, too.

Montesquieu, like many others, held that the main cause of Europe’s technological and scientific advances was the harsh climate, which required the inhabitants to be inventive and sharp-witted to survive.

From Foucault, we have kept concepts about discourse, power and regimes of knowledge; from Bourdieu, habitus, doxa and forms of capital; from Marxism, a sustained critical interest in power and economics; and from structuralism, the acknowledgement that the human mind functions in a particular way, frequently by way of contrasts. Nonetheless, structuralism, in its original form, is all but forgotten today. Few take up the cues left by 1960s and 1970s Marxism.

  Abstract: One of the most promising areas of future research into literature and national identity in early republican Mexico is the literature of the U.S.-Mexican War of 1846–1848. Mexican literary responses to the United States’ invasion of its territory, and to Mexico’s continued defeats on the battlefield, constitute an invaluable archive for examining the emergence of Mexican nationalism. Indeed, during the war and its aftermath, Mexican writers recognized the value of national unity as they never had before, because they saw their defeat on the battlefield as a function of their political disunity. “A nation is nothing but a large<br>

Yet there are certain social principles which have very widespread acceptance among the vast majority of Catholics in France. Usually most members of the Hierarchy endorse these principles, though they are not considered as Church dogma. In fact, they have become so generally identified with Catholicism that Catholics with different views must usually explain their reasons for going against the crowd.<br>

They certainly could be some of those “people beside Paul” on which this collection seeks to reflect. But three of these seem especially important rhetorically in the letter. The exhortation to Euodia and Syntyche displays a major concern and even the climax of the letter,¹ as it turns more explicitly to address them to “think the same thing” as Paul.² These verses are a<br>

  TWO  Philosophy: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt189ttzv">The Hidden God</a><br>
  Abstract: The destruction of metaphysics is a favored topic in twentieth-century philosophy, in terms of a positivist critique, an overcoming, an
                  Abbau,a rejection, or a deconstruction of traditional metaphysical notions and concepts. But where and when does this discussion of a general destruction of metaphysics start? I argue that theHeidelberg Disputationplays a key role here.¹ In this short disputation, Luther presents forty theses giving a principal justification of his position, twenty-eight of them theological and the other twelve philosophical. In the explanation to thesis 21, he argues that the cross is a good thing, since itdestructs(destruuntur;<br>

  NINE  Deus Absconditus from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt189ttzv">The Hidden God</a><br>
  Abstract: On one point Erasmus of Rotterdam and Martin Luther perfectly agree: There are too many myths circulating in society, church, and academia, and too much superstition, ignorance, and mysticism surrounding the notion of God. Malicious tongues would probably comment that things haven’t changed a lot over the five centuries that have passed. For the discussion on the hidden and mysterious god,
                  deus absconditus,this general estimation of beliefs and superstitions turns out to be significant. Erasmus claims that the very notion of‘deus absconditus’contributes to the confusion and the speculations concerning the nature of God and distracts from the<br>

  Abstract: A new debate on political theology has emerged since the turn of the millennium, due to a general shift in the understanding of the relationship between religion and secularity in modern societies. After José Casanova’s
                  Public Religions in the Modern World(1994) and Habermas’s speech on faith and knowledge (2001), where he coined the term “post-secular society,” there have been a number of controversies on the issue, including debates on this specific term.¹ Hans Joas has pointed out that the term is misguiding, since there has never been such a thing as asecularsociety, not even in the modern<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt18dzskq">Interrogating Cultural Studies</a><br>
  Abstract: Few, if any, entire academic fields have attracted more consistently febrile attention than cultural studies. It has always received criticism, invective, vituperation; often angry, often confused and confusing (mis)representations of what it is, what it does, and why it goes about things the ways it does. It has also, of course, had its fair share of celebration, (over)indulgent congratulation and flattery. These two types of reaction entail each other: if cultural studies has often announced itself as being somehow messianic or at least deeply consequential – ‘radical’, ‘revolutionary’, ‘emancipatory’, and so on – then it is surely inevitable that those<br>

  Abstract: In the wake of women’s studies, cultural studies has, in my view, been responsible for the absolutely indispensable opening up of the disciplinary structure of the humanities. By challenging methodological dogma, and elitist prejudice and value judgement, it has been uniquely instrumental in at least making the academic community aware of the conservative nature of its endeavours, if not everywhere forcing it to change. It has, if nothing else, forced the academy to realise its collusion with an elitist white-male politics of exclusion and its subsequent intellectual closure.

  Abstract: The question here is no longer the much-exercised question of ‘what is cultural studies?’, but rather, ‘for what?’, ‘for whom?’, ‘in the name of what project?’, ‘what politics?’, what properties, orientations and affiliations does cultural studies have, should it have; what methods, aims, intentions; in what context does it see itself; etc.? Jeremy Gilbert thinks through the schema and the question of ‘Friends and Enemies: Which Side is Cultural Studies On?’, while Julian Wolfreys interrogates the manner in which it is too easy to forget the lessons of deconstruction, and to consider cultural studies ‘as if such a thing existed’.<br>

  Author(s) Fernandez James W.<br>
  Abstract: I begin with two important modern philosophers, Wittgenstein and Rorty, as a context for more grounded anthropological discussion. These philosophers are both intensely interested in language (and particularly figurative language) and sympathetic to the anthropological project.² I refer to the project dating at least back to Vico which understands culture as something reconstructed, largely out of the building materials of language, from that which is long given.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt18fs9q6">Locating Cultural Creativity</a><br>
  Author(s) Friedman Jonathan<br>
  Abstract: Creativity has become something of a slogan among latter-day Birmingham cultural sociologists and their more seasoned allies, the cultural studies crowd. There has been a clear move from the study of working-class culture to the aesthetics of everyday life. While Birmingham certainly flirted with abstract structural Marxism, their interests lay more in the direction of the concrete, since they, unlike many Marxist sociologists, were trying to gain a purchase on reality in the street, so to speak – although one may have reservations about the nature of their ethnography, which, except for some of the research reports, was explicitly focused<br>

  Author(s) Borofsky Robert<br>
  Abstract: How does one locate ‘cultural creativity’? Where does one search? Just trying to define the phrase – so one has a clear sense of what one is after – is enough to muddle the process. Regarding culture, for example, Hatch notes: ‘Even though the term has been discussed in countless books and articles, there is still a large degree of uncertainty in its use – anthropologists employ the notion in fundamentally different ways’ (1973:1). Likewise, ambiguity surrounds creativity. My dictionary equates creativity with inventiveness, bringing something new into being, originating.

  Author(s) Parkin David<br>
  Abstract: I take the paradox to be globally widespread. Consumers or, more commonly, spectators of others’ consumerism, see commodities replaced one after another by new ones. Yet, despite being new, each such commodity may sometimes be regarded as representing tradition and as having originated from inside the society rather than having been imported or affected by external influences. For example, local artists and craftsmen may think they know what foreign tourists want, but in fact find that their art works are bought by local people as much as and even more than by outsiders. This unexpected outcome is not always something<br>

  Author(s) FREIDENBERG OLGA<br>
  Abstract: The story of Agamemnon is told in the

In spite of the prophecy, Aegisthus married the spouse of the Atrides, whom he then murdered upon his return home; Aegisthus neglected the gods’ advice and Orestes’ revenge—and had to pay for everything. Athena is more succinct (1.298). She only reminds [Telemachus] of the glory of Orestes, who killed the deceitful “father- slayer.” Nestor (3.197) at first only mentions the return of the Atrides, the murder, and Orestes’ revenge. In almost the same words, Athena again speaks about the same events<br>

  Author(s) Morton Seth<br>
  Abstract: Over one hundred years after the first Futurist manifesto, the historical avant-garde looks like an oddity that died long ago. Perhaps nothing has served the avant-garde better than its own death. In death, the avant-garde is memorialized and archived. Its antiart position has been absorbed by the art world, and its logics inform mass culture and high art alike. Although the historical avant-garde failed to make good on revolutionary ideals, avant-garde logics continue to evolve and diversify across our entire cultural media landscape, from Dada to Monty Python and Saturday

  Abstract: It is a curious, if not downright odd, first thing to say about
                  The Oddball Archivethat, above all else, it has spoken to me at the level of politics. After all, particularly as it is practiced in the contemporary academy, politics or political science is a discipline famed for its “seriousness”; its social-science predictive ways; its focus on institutions, structures of power, and governance; and its avoidance of the messy stuff of culture, agency, and desire. Could anything be less oddball, less hospitable to the playfulness of hoaxers and hoarders, or the incongruity of dissected fish and Dixie cups?<br>

  Abstract: In religion, myth, legend, and above all in the arts there is an imaginary space populated with messengers: It is the world of angels, of placeless mediators between heaven and earth. The study of angels (‘angelology’¹) is an epiphenomenon of monotheism: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have added a more or less extensive army of angels to the statuary isolation of their God; the constitutional invisibility, unrepresentability, and remoteness of God is therefore supplemented with the offer of something holy that is visible, representable, and close, which takes on an allegorical form in angels. Angels are not simply there, but rather<br>

  Book Title: Timing Canada-The Shifting Politics of Time in Canadian Literary Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Huebener Paul<br>
  Abstract: From punch clocks to prison sentences, from immigration waiting periods to controversial time-zone boundaries, from Indigenous grave markers that count time in centuries rather than years, to the fact that free time is shrinking faster for women than for men - time shapes the fabric of Canadian society every day, but in ways that are not always visible or logical. In Timing Canada, Paul Huebener draws from cultural history, time-use surveys, political statements, literature, and visual art to craft a detailed understanding of how time operates as a form of power in Canada. Time enables everything we do - as Margaret Atwood writes, "without it we can't live." However, time also disempowers us, divides us, and escapes our control. Huebener transforms our understanding of temporal power and possibility by using examples from Canadian and Indigenous authors - including Jeannette Armstrong, Joseph Boyden, Dionne Brand, Timothy Findley, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Gabrielle Roy, and many others - who witness, question, dismantle, and reconstruct the functioning of time in their works. As the first comprehensive study of the cultural politics of time in Canada, Timing Canada develops foundational principles of critical time studies and everyday temporal literacy, and demonstrates how time functions broadly as a tool of power, privilege, and imagination within a multicultural and multi-temporal nation.<br>

  Abstract: Evolutionary science establishes—unassailably—that self is body. In this chapter we explore how science makes this point and what it means for us. Some years ago, I had an experience that brought it home to me in an unforgettable way. A young man, who showed promise to become an exceptional pastor, arrived in his first call after graduation from seminary. At every step of his preparation, he had proved himself to be unusually well-suited for parish ministry—everyone expected great things from him. It was a shock when in the first months of this activity he was unexpectedly overwhelmed<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt197059n">Our Bodies Are Selves</a><br>
  Author(s) Pederson Ann Milliken<br>
  Abstract: We know that our identity emerges from the entangled and extended relationships in which our bodyselves are embedded. We are technobody selves, tethered in, with, and under the technologies and social media that create our personhood. Many of us embody multiple identities and selves: virtual, real, male, female, inter-sex, poor, rich, middle-class, young, older, dying, birthing, viable, fetus, embryo, child, and adult. We will resist being explained by “nothing buts” and simplistic labels. We can celebrate the multidimensional nature of our bodyselves, whose relationship to the world, both past and into the future, emerges through entangled and extended webs of<br>

  Abstract: A starting point for engaging the intersection of the performing arts and literature in the Caribbean region is the famous exchange between the storyteller and the writer-figure in Patrick Chamoiseau’s
                  Solibo Magnifique: “To write is to take thelambiout of the sea to shout: here’s the conch! The word replies: where’s the sea? But that’s not the most important thing, I’m going and you’re staying. I spoke to you, you’re writing, announcing that you come from the word. You give your hand over the distance. It’s all very nice, but you just touch the distance” (28; see French in<br>

  Author(s) Poirion Daniel<br>
  Abstract: Fascinated by the mirror in the “fountain of Narcissus,” critics compete in ingenious attempts to unveil its philosophical implications. The
                  Romance of the Rosehas thus become a key text for the definition of unhappy self-consciousness. However, this medieval poem teaches us at the same time how to turn away from contemplating an empty consciousness in order to examine those things without which consciousness is nothing: the “malady” induced by analyzing subjectivity should be healed by a healthy dose of objectivity. That which Guillaume de Lorris’s text suggests, Jean de Meun’s demonstrates explicitly, by multiplying references to concrete objects within<br>

  1  First Crossings of the Rhine from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19jcj7k">Heidegger in France</a><br>
  Abstract: Heidegger’s sudden celebrity following the publication of
                     Sein und Zeitin 1927 did not go completely unnoticed in Paris, which was at the time, even more than today, the intellectual capital of Europe, and probably of the world. But to know a name is one thing; to enter into a thinker’s thought is another. While Heidegger’s masterpiece had to wait nearly sixty years before being translated in its entirety into French, reports and publications establish that distinguished university professors like Léon Brunschvicg and Xavier Léon quickly recognized, in this case, that a philosophical event had taken place in Germany.<br>

  1  First Crossings of the Rhine from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19jcj7k">Heidegger in France</a><br>
  Abstract: Heidegger’s sudden celebrity following the publication of
                     Sein und Zeitin 1927 did not go completely unnoticed in Paris, which was at the time, even more than today, the intellectual capital of Europe, and probably of the world. But to know a name is one thing; to enter into a thinker’s thought is another. While Heidegger’s masterpiece had to wait nearly sixty years before being translated in its entirety into French, reports and publications establish that distinguished university professors like Léon Brunschvicg and Xavier Léon quickly recognized, in this case, that a philosophical event had taken place in Germany.<br>

  3  Postwar Fascinations from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19jcj7k">Heidegger in France</a><br>
  Abstract: It is not surprising that Liberation was not solely political, but cultural as well, and that the Sartre bomb was not the only one to explode at the time of an intense intellectual turmoil, amidst a joyous confusion. Sartre himself noted and deplored that existentialism, transformed into a fashion, became a word that “has been so stretched and has taken on so broad a meaning, that it no longer means anything at all.”¹ Existentialism had almost become a slogan, whose meaning was no longer clear. “At St. Germain des Prés, the language of that time was taking shape and so<br>

  1  The Spirit-Animated Event of Preaching from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19qgg2f">Ways of the Word</a><br>
  Author(s) Powery Luke A.<br>
  Abstract: Preaching is risky business. It is risky because, frankly, its divine aims are impossible to achieve, humanly speaking. There is no set of rules any of us can follow, no book we can read (this one included), that guarantees that when you step up to a pulpit and open your mouth, the words that reach listeners will be a word that is God’s own. We can speak with consummate rhetorical skill of things theological, but only God’s animating Spirit makes our preaching a life-transforming, world-changing message.<br>

  4  Preaching as an Act of Worship from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19qgg2f">Ways of the Word</a><br>
  Author(s) Brown Sally A.<br>
  Abstract: As any naturalist would tell us, if we want to understand how a living creature normally functions, we need to observe it in its natural habitat. Something similar is true of preaching. There are undoubtedly people whose lives have been transformed by a sermon they picked up on the car radio while driving across Texas or stumbled upon while searching the Internet for a long-lost friend. But a stand-alone sermon, like a single shot from a film, is lifted out of its native setting. In this chapter we consider preaching in relation to its natural context, Christian worship.<br>

  3  The Influence of Dietrich Bonhoeffer on Karl Barth from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19qgg3z">Engaging Bonhoeffer</a><br>
  Author(s) Greggs Tom<br>
  Abstract: It may seem an odd thing to think and speak of the influence of Dietrich Bonhoeffer on Karl Barth. Born in 1886, Barth was a half-generation older than Bonhoeffer (born 1906). Bonhoeffer was only twelve years old when Barth published his theological epoch making
                  Romerbrief. Bonhoeffer studied Barth’s work and was influenced by him as a student, such that hisHabilitationsschrift, Act and Being, was written in large part in dialogue with Karl Barth’s work. Even though this work contains critical elements,¹ this criticism should be seen within a shared discourse—a discourse established by Barth into which Bonhoeffer enters.<br>

  Author(s) Linde Gesche<br>
  Abstract: As with all the classical pragmatists, Peirce’s interest in the subject of religion is subordinate to his more central questions. What Peirce has to say about God, creation, the church, faith, and love is systematically derived from a philosophy that, having semiotics at its core, spans a broad range of topics, such as mathematics, logic, epistemology, cosmology, linguistics, and occasionally even bridges design and engineering. It is this subsidiary status that, to my mind, lends methodological soundness as well as modernity to Peirce’s reflections, because the clear implication is that religion is not a primary phenomenon but something that develops<br>

  Abstract: A survey of literary studies reveals a relatively sudden and now widespread fascination with all things cartographic. According to the

Before 1990, a total of 503 titles used the terms “map” or “mapping.” After 1990, the enthusiasm for using “ map” as the defining label grew by a factor of three (Figure 3.1).

And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death—even death on a cross.”¹ This radically personal God, who willingly accepts radical kenotic constraints in order to dwell among humankind, shares fully in human vulnerability—including death—in order to make<br>

  Book Title: Radical Theology-An Essay on Faith and Theology in the Twenty-First Century<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Dalferth Ingolf U.<br>
  Abstract: Ingolf U. Dalferth develops a “radical theology" that unfolds the orienting strength of faith for human life from the event of God’s presence to every present. In a concise and clear manner, Dalferth outlines the theological and philosophical approaches to hermeneutics in the modern era, in order to promote a convincing and defensible theology for the twenty-first century, critically carrying on Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Bultmann, without forgetting Karl Barth. The result of his reconstruction is a “radical theology" that neither glorifies premodern theology in an antimodern attitude nor seeks a mystical deepening of the secular, but argues for a radical change in theological perspective of the possible. In doing so, theology unfolds “limit concepts" that restrict the claims of science and philosophy critically, and develops “ideas of orientation" that illumine the ways in which human life is understood and lived in radically new ways in faith. From here, Dalferth unfolds the reality of revelation and the Christian sense of an unconditional hope that fundamentally transcends all beliefs based on mundane realities and orients the world on something beyond its own temporal horizon—its loving Creator.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter explores the connections between creation and the God of Israel’s consummating and redemptive purposes in the election of a peculiar people. As has been previously argued, Israel knew herself to be contingent, to be a people formed by God’s gracious intention. As a correlate of this understanding, Israel came to apprehend her God as the Creator of all. Reflecting on this “rule of faith” in Israel, Jenson cites 2 Maccabees: “Look at the heavens and the earth … and acknowledge that God made them.”¹ The new thing the New Testament adds, states Jenson, is that creation is for<br>

By offering a redescription of the solar system in heliocentric terms, Copernicus reimagined planetary motion from the vantage point of the surface of the sun rather than the earth—a change of vantage point was everything. When Kant states that in proceeding through theCritiquewe shall be “proceeding precisely on the lines of Copernicus’ primary hypothesis,” he is suggesting that we invert classical modes of knowing. It has “been assumed that all our knowledge must<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t7k7">Theology in the Flesh</a><br>
  Abstract: The recent revolution in cognitive science has investigated how human minds make sense of our experience, uncovering the ways we find meaning in everything from various shapes to blinking lights. Cognitive linguistics is part of this revolutionary discovery. The study of cognitive linguistics began in the 1970s and is an influential approach to meaning construction used by an international body of scholars.¹ Cognitive linguistics examines how we think about the entire range of human experience, including causation, motion, time, relationships, entities, and emotions.² The research is interdisciplinary in nature, involving fields such as psychology, anthropology, neuroscience, philosophy, sign language, and<br>

  Abstract: Biblical writers used the same cognitive processes available to us. They made use of image schemas, frames, idealized cognitive models, prototypes, conceptual metaphors, metonymy, and conceptual blending. Biblical texts manifest the conceptual conventions present in their languages and cultures. This includes everything from grammar to moral reasoning to cosmology. Much can be learned about how different biblical writers conceived various topics by paying attention to the conceptual structures prompted by the texts.<br>

  Book Title: The Mutual Cultivation of Self and Things-A Contemporary Chinese Philosophy of the Meaning of Being<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Chad Austin<br>
  Abstract: Yang Guorong is one of the most prominent Chinese philosophers working today and is best known for using the full range of Chinese philosophical resources in connection with the thought of Kant, Hegel, Marx, and Heidegger. In The Mutual Cultivation of Self and Things, Yang grapples with the philosophical problem of how the complexly interwoven nature of things and being relates to human nature, values, affairs, and facts, and ultimately creates a world of meaning. Yang outlines how humans might live more fully integrated lives on philosophical, religious, cultural, aesthetic, and material planes. This first English translation introduces current, influential work from China to readers worldwide.<br>

  1  Meaning in the Context of Accomplishing Oneself and Accomplishing Things from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b7x4qv">The Mutual Cultivation of Self and Things</a><br>
  Abstract: Accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things is a concrete historical process of knowing the world and knowing oneself and reforming the world and refining oneself, which simultaneously generates meaning and produces a world of meaning. The world in-itself cannot pose for itself the question of meaning, which is to say that there is no way to dissociate meaning from one’s own being. Humans question the meaning of the world and the meaning of their own being; therefore, the genesis of meaning owes its origin to the “being” of humans. As the introduction to this book has already demonstrated, from the perspective<br>

  2  Human Capacities and a World of Meaning from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b7x4qv">The Mutual Cultivation of Self and Things</a><br>
  Abstract: Directed at the genesis of a world of meaning, accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things unfolds throughout the whole process of one’s being. But as the basic way in which human being exists, how is this process possible? The question “How is it possible?” primarily concerns grounds and conditions. Here, the capacities of human being intrinsically condition the genesis of a world of meaning as the internal conditions of accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things. Similar to “wisdom,” the phrase “human capacities” has its everyday connotations, but as a concept, it has philosophical meaning as well. In everyday terms, just as being<br>

  3  Systems of Norms and the Genesis of Meaning from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b7x4qv">The Mutual Cultivation of Self and Things</a><br>
  Abstract: The historical process of accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things, as we have seen, is internally conditioned by human capacities, but many forms of normative systems condition it as well. On the one hand, accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things concretely unfolds as a process of knowing and practicing, which involves different senses of normativity. On the other hand, the knowledge and wisdom formed through this process further constrain knowing and practicing by means of externalizing, transforming into universal systems of norms. Directed at knowing the world and the self and changing both the self and the world, norms not only involve<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b7x4qv">The Mutual Cultivation of Self and Things</a><br>
  Abstract: Conditioned by the interrelation of human capacities with systems of norms, accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things constitutes human being’s basic way of being and mode of being. In the historical unfolding of accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things, the presentation of things and the directionality of intentions reciprocally interact; the world enters the realm of ideas through this interaction and henceforth becomes being with meaning. As noted earlier, the problem of meaning does not occur to the world in-itself; rather, the source of meaning lies in the historical process of one coming to know the world and oneself while transforming both<br>

  5  Meaning and Reality from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b7x4qv">The Mutual Cultivation of Self and Things</a><br>
  Abstract: In the process of accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things, meaning is not only presented at the level of ideas in the act of cognizing and evaluating; when grounded in practical activity, meaning is also externalized as the world of actual beings or the real world. As the externalization or actualization of meaning, this domain of being, which is generated through the process of knowing and practicing could also be seen as the actual or external formation of a world of meaning, whose actual content is the Nature for-humans or things-for-us as social reality or the living world.<br>

  Abstract: Grounded in the historical process of accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things, a world of meaning may take shape into different forms. Whether it is exhibited internally in the form of ideas or unfolds externally into humanized reality, a world of meaning is always inseparable from the being of humans. Now, when considering the relation between the being of humans and a world of meaning, the individual or the person is an important aspect that cannot be ignored, because a world of meaning is first opened up and presented to the concrete individual or person. At a much broader level, the<br>

  7  Accomplishing Oneself and Accomplishing Things: from:

  Abstract: Free individuality, human capacities, and inner state of mind most directly involve the personal space of the self but also in a broader sense the distinction and interaction between the individual domain and the public sphere. As interrelated aspects of the social world, the individual domain and its connection to the public sphere also sets the concrete background for the historical process of accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things. As the actual mode of being, accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things is never separable from diverse social resources, and the acquisition, possession, and distribution of resources involves the issue of social justice.<br>

  Book Title: Grand Hotel Abyss-Desire, Recognition and the Restoration of the Subject<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Safatle Vladimir<br>
  Abstract: Long-expected translation of the Portuguese academic bestseller Grande Hotel Abismo. In the last two decades recognition - arguably one of the most central notions of the dialectical tradition since Hegel - has once again become a crucial philosophical theme. Nevertheless, the new theories of recognition fail to provide room for reflection on transformation processes in politics and morality. This book aims to recover the disruptive nature of the dialectical tradition by means of a severe critique of the dominance of an anthropology of the individual identity in contemporary theories of recognition. This critique implies a thorough rethinking of basic concepts such as desire, negativity, will and drive, with Hegel, Lacan and Adorno being our main guides. The Marxist philosopher György Lukács said that the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer, Adorno, etc.) left us with nothing but negativity towards the state of the world. Their work failed to open up a concrete possibility of practical engagement in this world. All too eager to describe the impasses of reason, the Frankfurt philosphers remained trapped in a metaphorical Grand Hotel Abyss (Grand Hotel Abgrund). It was as living and being guardian of lettered civilization in a beautiful and melancholy grand hotel, of which the balconies face a gaping abyss. But perhaps in this way Lukács gave – and no doubt without realizing it himself – a perfect definition of contemporary philosophy, namely to confront chaos, to peer into what appears to a certain rationality as an abyss and to feel good about it. Touching Hegelian dialectics, critical theory and psychoanalysis, Grand Hotel Abyss gives a new meaning to the notion of negativity as the first essential step for rethinking political and moral engagement.<br>

  Abstract: In a certain sense, it is the intention of the present book to provide a long-form answer to the above questions, posed by Wittgenstein, by showing how, when it comes to human beings, an openly indistinct image is preferable to a falsely sharp one. Accurately recognizing the moments where indistinct pictures become necessary, however, might be the greatest challenge yet posed for philosophical reflection. For indistinct pictures are elusive: in them, the contours of a familiar image may be discerned, yet must not be completely determined. Such an image is pervaded by something that incessantly corrodes it from within, and<br>

His mother’s side of the family felt some allegiance to the Jewish reform community in Berlin, while his father’s side inclined to the orthodox rite, but all during Benjamin’s protected childhood his family celebrated Christmas in high style and organized Easter egg hunts for the children—these occasions are commemorated in his

  Book Title: Moving Images-From Edison to the Webcam<br>
  Publisher: John Libbey Publishing<br>
  Author(s): Widding Astrid Söderbergh<br>
  Abstract: In 1888, Thomas Edison announced that he was experimenting on "an instrument which does for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear, which is the recording and reproduction of things in motion." Just as Edison's investigations were framed in terms of the known technologies of the phonograph and the microscope, the essays in this collection address the contexts of innovation and reception that have framed the development of moving images in the last 100 years. Three concerns are of particular interest: the contexts of innovation and reception for moving image technologies; the role of the observer, whose vision and cognitive processes define some of the limits of inquiry and epistemological insight; and the role of new media, which, engaging with the domestic sphere as cultural interface, are transforming our understanding of public and private spheres.<br>

  Abstract: This essay addresses the question of how the concept of the national provides a context for the work of the Spanish lecturer in early cinema. As is well known, previous studies have always stressed that the film lecturer was responsible for mediating between the screen and viewers, for whom, at least in the beginning, moving pictures were something strange.¹ Also we should not forget that he was dealing with a specific public, determined not only by the period of time, but also by the location.

  Abstract: In the early 20th century, movie stars often seemed to offer everything that real men did not. This essay explores how the female cinema audience in Imperial Germany responded to male movie stars and how their emerging movie fandom was linked to the contemporary discourse about nationality, national identity and patriotism during World War I. A telling example for this discussion is the German fan magazine debate about whether or not it was acceptable to “adore” the Norwegian actor Gunnar Tolnaes, who played characters as “foreign” as an Indian maharaja, instead of the German supreme commander, Paul von Hindenburg.<br>

Are all nations not in some respect exceptional?

Even myths and cosmologies embedded in a cyclical conception of time require narratives, accounts of things, actions, and events connected with adverbial particles such as “before” and “after,” “later” and “earlier,” “in the beginning” and “in the end.”<br>

  Author(s) Wineburg Samuel S.<br>
  Abstract: School children the world over spend countless hours every year learning about the past. In Western countries, the block of the school day devoted to this study is referred to as “history,” “social studies,” “civics,” “government,” or a host of other names. Yet, despite this variety in nomenclature, in practically every case, students are taught something about what transpired before their births. Despite variations in context, different national traditions and curriculuar customs, students from Tokyo to New York, Auckland to Berlin, and Tel Aviv to Toronto all learn something about a movement known as the Renaissance, an event known as<br>

  Chapter 1  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbwzh">Sartre Against Stalinism</a><br>
  Abstract: Anyone proposing to write yet another book about Jean-Paul Sartre must do so with a certain sense of guilt. Given the huge number of books and articles that already exist, what justification can there be for adding to them? Moreover, any writer on Sartre lives with the melancholy awareness that Sartre himself insisted that he had never learnt anything from any of the books written about him.¹ Yet such is the richness and complexity of Sartre’s work that there are still things that have not been said – as well, unfortunately, as some that have been said all too often,<br>

  Chapter 3  The Threat of Fascism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbwzh">Sartre Against Stalinism</a><br>
  Abstract: The most crucial influence on Sartre in the 1930s was that of events themselves. The decade was marked by the rise and consolidation of fascism in Italy, Germany and then Spain. Sartre developed a deep loathing of fascism, beginning from the year he spent in Berlin when Hitler’s regime was consolidating itself.¹<br>

  Chapter 4  War within War from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbwzh">Sartre Against Stalinism</a><br>
  Abstract: ‘So now I’m cured of socialism, if I needed to be cured’. Thus Sartre wrote in his notebook on 14 September 1939.¹ For Sartre the Second World War had begun with the Hitler–Stalin Pact of 23 August 1939. It is important to remember just what a shock the Pact was for all those on the left, whether inside or outside the PCF. For nearly five years the PCF’s strategy had been centred on the idea of the Popular Front; it had argued indefatigably that the struggle against fascism must take priority over everything else, including the struggle for socialism,<br>

  Chapter Six  Prefiguring NAFTA: from:

  Author(s) Musante Patricia<br>
  Abstract: Eric Wolf ’s emphasis on interconnected, global processes in
                  Europe and the People Without History(1982) provides a model for bringing the concerns of history, geography, and anthropology together to study the political economy of globalization, both past and present. To his list of “thingified” concepts I would add the local or thecommunitywhich have been, and continue to be, reified within anthropological discourse and practice. The boundaries of the local or the community—however broadly they may be defined or imagined—are often taken as a given, and hence naturalized. This tendency continues even as anthropologists increasingly broaden<br>

  Author(s) Reynolds Siân<br>
  Abstract: Is it true, as Pierre Nora claimed in 1984, that memory becomes precious just when it vanishes? ‘On ne parle tant de mémoire que parce qu’il n’y en a plus’. What he seems to mean is not that individuals have forgotten their own past, but that collective repositories of memory – such as the French
                  paysans– have been destroyed or scattered by devastating and rapid change in recent times. Memory as something magical, often tied to physical objects, rituals or sensations, can be contrasted as it is by Nora, with history, which implies critical reflection: memory is poetry, history<br>

  Author(s) Friese Heidrun<br>
  Abstract: The notion ‘identity’ opens towards a variety of questions. Derived from ‘
                  idem,’ the word’s semantic field ranges from ‘the sameness of a person or thing at all times or in all circumstances; the condition or fact that a person or thing is itself and not something else; individually, personally’ to its use in logic and mathematics and asks the question, how something can remain the same despite time and inevitable change. The word addresses at the same time the ‘condition’ and the ‘fact’ of remaining the same person throughout the various phases of existence. It underlines the ‘continuity of the<br>

  Author(s) Hahn Barbara<br>
  Abstract: When all had been destroyed, demolished and obliterated, a voice began to speak: ‘Mother Rahel / weeps no longer. Hauled over / all the weeped things’—a poem of Paul Celan’s from the cycle
                  Fadensonnenof 1968 (1990: 202). Rahel weeps no longer; no one is there who could mourn as Rahel mourned her children. ‘No longer’—a dominant temporal dimension in Celan’s poetry, an uncanny time, without relation to the present moment. It is past, unalterable, and related to a site that also no longer exists. ‘Rübergetragen / alles Geweinte’—’Hauled over /all the weeped things’—to another place,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbz63">Identities</a><br>
  Author(s) Sivan Emanuel<br>
  Abstract: Over the last two decades or so, a thriving cottage industry has developed dealing with the origins and genesis of fundamentalist movements around the globe. Yet the scholars, policy analysts and intelligence experts involved in this huge effort had precious little to say about why such movements survive, and even flourish at times. After all, the odds are pretty much against them, as evidenced by the fact that the membership turnover rate is high. The stringent behavioural requirements, typical of fundamentalist groups, stand in stark contrast to the anything-goes, hedonistic, open society around them. One can just pick up one’s<br>

  Author(s) Webber Jonathan<br>
  Abstract: Making sense of the past ranks among the key intellectual activities of any society and indeed of any individual. Not only must we learn to select those social and personal events with which we have had direct or indirect experience, make connections between these events, smooth out inconsistencies, establish meanings, construct narratives, mask out uncertainties, and develop an aesthetic appreciation of our historical understanding of things; we also seem to be able to do it all the time. We know how to adapt previous interpretations to suit new circumstances, and we are capable of remodelling our memories of the past<br>

  Author(s) Benthall Jonathan<br>
  Abstract: When I used to think of women anthropologists prominent during the last quarter of the twentieth century, either the profile would come to mind of a figure with arms akimbo ready to pounce on some ill-judged generalisation that I might have let slip, or alternatively a texture of silky meekness charged with static electricity and sheathing a healthy set of claws. The fault for these warped representations was, of course, entirely mine, and was no doubt due to schooling in competitive male boarding institutions where the opposite sex had been a reality only at the margins.

  Abstract: I first knew Shirley Ardener as a name in textbooks, in the sections on Africa and on gender studies, and so meeting her for the first time in 1997 was an overwhelming experience. Given that she was such a well-known figure, how could I not agree to her polite request to attend the seminars on Gender and Tourism at Queen Elizabeth House, even though my research interests lay very much in the opposite direction? In doing so, I learned quickly that any seminar series organised by Shirley is sure to have something of interest for any researcher regardless of their<br>

  Abstract: My relationship with Shirley and Edwin Ardener began in 1977 when I came to Oxford as a Human Sciences undergraduate. My first glimpse of Shirley was in the quad at St John’s College when one of my friends pointed her out as one of our anthropology tutors. I blinked and she was gone. For the next few months, the same thing happened. She either flew or zoomed past me on her bike or on foot. Nothing has changed, since I found it hard to keep up with her when we eventually carried out fieldwork together on body piercing in 2003.<br>

  Abstract: Are you white? (Or, do you have a friend who is?) If so, how do you know? Is race real—or is it constructed, an “as-if” concept, something we all agree to bestow on each other? Is it a relational concept, existing only in binary fashion (e.g., black/white), so that if all the people on a tropical island, say, looked pretty much the same, there would be no race or races? Modern-day scientists tell us that whites and blacks have more genes in common than the ones that distinguish them—the variability between the average white and the average black,<br>

  22  Dysconscious Racism: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bw1kc5">Critical White Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) KING JOYCE E.<br>
  Abstract: “Dysconscious racism” is a form of racism that tacitly accepts dominant white norms and privileges. It is not the
                  absenceof consciousness but animpairedconsciousness or distorted way of thinking about race as compared to, for example, critical consciousness. Uncritical ways of thinking about racial inequity accept certain culturally sanctioned assumptions, myths, and beliefs that justify the social and economic advantages white people have as a result of subordinating others. Anything that calls this ideology of racial privilege into question inevitably challenges the self-identity of white people who have internalized these ideological justifications.

  Author(s) MAHONEY MARTHA R.<br>
  Abstract: What is race? A social construct, a concept having no natural truth, no truth separate from historical development, and possibly no truth comprehensible apart from domination. The term has meant different things in this country over time; and its social and cultural meanings continue to change within our own time. In law as well as elsewhere in society the term “race” has been used to stand for several different concepts. Even the Supreme Court, when faced with the question, had to recognize that “race” was a contingent category that shifted over time.¹<br>

  Abstract: Race and gender are, after all, just words. Yet when we learn that someone has had a child, our first question is usually “Is it a girl or a boy?” Why do we ask that, instead of something like” Are the mother and child healthy?” We ask, “Is it a girl or a boy?” according to philosopher Marilyn Frye, because we do not know how to relate to this new being without knowing its gender.¹ Imagine how long you could have a discussion with or about someone without knowing her or his gender.

  Abstract: Imagine that a plane crashes, and in the wreckage we discover a book. Nothing on its cover gives any indication of its contents. But when we open it up, it reveals all the secrets of how to behave as if you rule the world. Suddenly we have an explanation for why so many of them seem to behave the same way and also why they just don’t get it: This handbook teaches them all how to be who they are and makes them so they can’t hear us or see us, so much of the time.

Trying not to wake up my sister, I crawl out of bed into the chilly Massachusetts air and pull on jeans, a T-shirt, a sweatshirt, and sneakers. Nothing that can’t get dirty.

  Abstract: In 1980, Joseph Loguidice, an elderly Italian-American from Chicago, sat down to give his life story to an interviewer. His first and most vivid childhood recollection was of a race riot that had occurred on the city’s near north side. Wagons full of policemen with “peculiar hats” streamed into his neighborhood. But the “one thing that stood out in my mind,” Loguidice remembered after six decades, was “a man running down the middle of the street hollering …’I’m White, I’m White!’” After first taking him for an African-American, Loguidice soon realized that the man was a white coal handler covered<br>

  Abstract: Nature delights in nothing so much as in the inequality of her products. She revels in unlikenesses, in differences, in disparities. She endows the brain of one man, or one race, with the noblest genius, while to another she gives scarcely anything at all, except a brutal instinct to satisfy the simplest of animal needs and passions.

  Author(s): de VRIES HENT<br>
  Abstract: What do we talk about when we talk about religion? Is it an array of empirical facts about historical human civilizations? Or is religion what is in essence unpredictable-perhaps the very emergence of the new? In what ways are the legacies of religion-its powers, words, things, and gestures-reconfiguring themselves as the elementary forms of life in the twenty-first century?Given the Latin roots of the word religion and its historical Christian uses, what sense, if any, does it make to talk about religionin other traditions? Where might we look for common elements that would enable us to do so? Has religion as an overarching concept lost all its currency, or does it ineluctably return-sometimes in unexpected ways-the moment we attempt to do without it? This book explores the difficulties and double binds that arise when we ask What is religion? Offering a marvelously rich and diverse array of perspectives, it begins the task of rethinking religionand religious studiesin a contemporary world. Opening essays on the question What is religion?are followed by clusters exploring the relationships among religion, theology, and philosophy and the links between religion, politics, and law. Pedagogy is the focus of the following section. Religion is then examined in particular contexts, from classical times to the present Pentacostal revival, leading into an especially rich set of essays on religion, materiality, and mediatization. The final section grapples with the ever-changing forms that religionis taking, such as spirituality movements and responses to the ecological crisis.Featuring the work of leading scholars from a wide array of disciplines, traditions, and cultures, Religion: Beyond a Concept will help set the agenda for religious studies for years to come. It is the first of five volumes in a collection entitled The Future of the Religious Past, the fruit of a major international research initiative funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.<br>

  Book Title: Irony on Occasion: From Schlegel and Kierkegaard to Derrida and de Man-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Newmark Kevin<br>
  Abstract: What is it about irony--as an object of serious philosophical reflection and a literary technique of considerable elasticity--that makes it an occasion for endless critical debate? This book responds to this question by focusing on several key moments in German Romanticism and its afterlife in twentieth-century French thought and writing. It includes chapters on Friedrich Schlegel, Soren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Thomas Mann, Jean Paulhan, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida, and Paul de Man. A coda traces the way unresolved tensions inherited from Romanticism resurface in a novelist like J. M. Coetzee. But this book is neither a historical nor a thematic study of irony. To the degree that irony initiates a deflection of meaning, it also entails a divergence from historical and thematic models of understanding. The book therefore aims to respect irony's digressive force by allowing it to emerge from questions that sometimes have little or nothing to do with the ostensible topic of irony. For if irony is the possibility that whatever is being said does not coincide fully with whatever is being meant, then there is no guarantee that the most legitimate approach to the problem would proceed directly to those places where "irony" is named, described, or presumed to reside. Rather than providing a history of irony, then, this book examines particular occasions of ironic disruption. It thus offers an alternative model for conceiving of historical occurrences and their potential for acquiring meaning.<br>

  Abstract: The central characteristic of monotheism may be, not the exclusive acknowledgement of a single God, but something that Jan Assmann recently named the “Mosaic distinction.”¹ This distinction is twofold. According to Assmann, it primarily designates the discordant difference between true and false religion, and between a true and a false God.² Assmann demonstrates how this distinction turned the natural and obvious presence of religion itself into a
                  problem. Religion had to interrogate its truth instead of simply coinciding with it—“being” its own truth—and in this way its presence was no longer guaranteed, nor was that of its God:<br>

  Book Title: Words of Life: New Theological Turns in French Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Words of Life is the sequel and companion to Phenomenology and the Theological Turn,edited by Dominique Janicaud, Jean-Francois Courtine, Jean-Louis Chrtien, Michel Henry, Jean-Luc Marion, and Paul Ricoeur. In that volume, Janicaud accuses Levinas, Henry, Marion, and Chrtien of veeringfrom phenomenological neutrality to a theologically inflected phenomenology. By contrast, the contributors to this collection interrogate whether phenomenology's proper starting point is agnostic or atheistic. Many hold the view that phenomenology after the theological turn may very well be true both to itself and to the phenomenological things themselves.In one way or another, all of these essays contend with the limits and expectations of phenomenology. As such, they are all concerned with what counts as properphenomenology and even the very structure of phenomenology. None of them, however, is limited to such questions. Indeed, the rich tapestry that they weave tells us much about human experience. Themes such as faith, hope, love, grace, the gift, the sacraments, the words of Christ, suffering, joy, life, the call, touch, listening, wounding, and humility are woven throughout the various meditations in this volume. The contributors use striking examples to illuminate the structure and limits of phenomenology and, in turn, phenomenology serves to clarify those very examples. Thus practice clarifies theory and theory clarifies practice, resulting in new theological turns and new life for phenomenology. The volume showcases the work of both senior and junior scholars, including Jean-Luc Marion, Jean-Yves Lacoste, Kevin Hart, Anthony J. Steinbock, Jeffrey Bloechl, Jeffrey L. Kosky, Clayton Crockett, Brian Treanor, and Christina Gschwandtner-as well as the editors themselves.<br>

Ethical theorists, on the other hand, are blinded by it. With their preconceived concepts they cannot grasp what is real, let alone seriously encounter something whose essence and power they don’t even recognize.<br>

  Abstract: Today we have villains and saints again, in public view.… That evil appears in the form of light, of beneficence, of faithfulness, of renewal, that it appears in the form of historical necessity, of social justice, is for the commonsense observer a clear confirmation of its profound evilness. Ethical theorists, on the other hand, are blinded by it. With their preconceived concepts they cannot grasp what is real, let alone seriously encounter something whose essence and power they don’t even recognize.<br>

  Author(s) Walton Steve<br>
  Abstract: Jesus is not the first to travel to heaven in the Jewish scriptures, nor in the wider Jewish tradition,¹ to say nothing of Graeco-Roman traditions.² The question that naturally arises is to what extent, if at all, these earlier traditions have influenced Luke’s telling of the ascension of Jesus. This essay focuses on two key narrative traditions from the Old Testament (OT) of people travelling to heaven, namely, Elijah (2 Kgs 2:1–18) and, much more briefly, Enoch (Gen 5:24). We shall review these traditions and consider how far their language and themes are echoed in Luke’s accounts of Jesus’s<br>

  Book Title: On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy-A Guide for the Unruly<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.<br>

  Abstract: The real “movement” of the sciences takes place when their basic concepts undergo a more or less radical revision which is transparent to itself. The level which a science has reached is determined by how far it is
                  capableof a crisis in its basic concepts. In such immanent crises the very relationship between positively investigative inquiry and those things [Sachen] that are under interrogation comes to a point where it begins to totter. Among the various disciplines everywhere<br>

  4  Poetic Communities from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c84gmm">On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Ecstasy. Scholarly tradition pictures Hesiod, like Homer before him, as a great pedagogue.¹ The poet is in charge of a vast encyclopedia concerning gods and heroes (and also, in Hesiod’s particular case, everyday life). But from Hesiod we also learn that poetry itself is not a kind of learning but a species of ecstasy. No one studies to be a poet. No one asks to be such a thing. One is, for no reason, summoned out of one’s house and exposed to a kind of transcendence. Exactly what kind of transcendence is not always clear. One can imagine preferring the<br>

  Abstract: Artspace. What becomes of things in art? This is still the question of questions in aesthetic theory, which has understood from the beginning of modernism that the terms “nonrepresentational,” “nonmimetic,” or “abstract,” however much they may capture something of what the experience of nontraditional works of art is like, have little application to twentieth-century art and literature. Modern art is filled with things. A cubist collage is made of real newspaper clippings, and so is a poem by William Carlos Williams. The method of modern poetry is, manifestly, “quotation, commentary, pastische,” as if the poem had become a space for<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c84gmm">On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Poetry as Unhappy Consciousness. It is well known that in Maurice Blanchot’s early criticism writing appears to be less a productive activity than a self-reflexive movement. For example, at the outset of “Littérature et la à la mort” (1947– 48) he remarks that literature begins when it becomes a question for itself (PF. 293/WF. 300–301). What sort of question, exactly? Evidently not Jean-Paul Sartre’s “What is literature?’’ which like all “what is . . . ?” questions carries a demand for justification.

  Abstract: One may wonder whether the doctor-patient relationship has ever succeeded in being a simple, instrumental relation that could be described in such a way that the cause and the effect, the therapeutic gesture and its result, would be directly related one to the other, on the same plane and at the same level, without being mediated by something foreign to its space of intelligibility. It is certain, in any case, that the centuries-old invocation of a

  Author(s) Galperin William<br>
  Abstract: The subtitle of this chapter—“British Romanticism and the Emergence of the Everyday”—could easily be reversed because, quaint as it sounds, this is an essay about periodization and the hot chronology in British literary and cultural production that we continue to call “romantic.” Specifically, it is about a category of experience—the everyday—that comes to light during this interval as a history of missed opportunities, where what the “everyday” might suffice to name or to describe emerges both as something “uncounted” and as a missed opportunity for historical

  The Pathology of the Future, or the Endless Triumphs of Life from:

  Author(s) Edelman Lee<br>
  Abstract: Though my title could be read as referring to the emergence of a pathology
                  inthe future, it intends, on the contrary, to mark as pathological our relation to the future as such. Naming, that is, not a pathology to come but the pathology that determines our investment in the promise of something that isalways“to come,” something, to borrow Wordsworth’s phrase, “evermore about to be,” this pathology of the future informs our contemporary versions of romanticism.

  Abstract: What is contemporary romanticism? What is its time? Its date? These questions—of aesthetics, periodization, legacy, and continuity—are bound up with another question: what does it mean to come after?

  Abstract: Though the Romantic-era debate between William Godwin and Thomas Malthus seemed to have concluded in the 1820s in something of a stalemate, this conversation has been recently been revived, though with a rather peculiar twist. The Romantic-era version of this debate pitted Godwin’s principle of perfectibility against Malthus’s principle of population, with Godwin arguing that social relations could be slowly perfected to the extent that legal and political “institutions” were eliminated and Malthus countering that a key determinant of collective behavior was located in the biological register of “population.” Malthus contended that the register of population was inaccessible to human<br>

The chapter concludes with a speculation on what a Romanticism built on technomagism might mean for our own present collective moment of global environmental precarity.<br>

  Author(s) Spivak Gayatri Chakravorty<br>
  Abstract: Two pieces of practical advice. Like Aristotle in the
                     Poetics, Coleridge is giving advice on how to sell poetry. And Marx cautions against basing all analysis on people’s sense of things; rather one should investigate what worldly factors produce that sense. One is talking about producing a certain willingness in the readership. The other is saying that willingness is produced by material conditions bigger than the personal will. For Coleridge, the determinant is spiritual. For Marx, social. Let us call this these remote presuppositions of my argument.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter on Bergson and memory I shall focus on two key questions that Henri Bergson sought to establish as the foundation for a philosophical treatment of memory. First, what is the relation between past and present? Is it merely a difference in degree, or it possible to locate the difference between them as one of kind? If we can do the latter, what will this reveal about memory? Second, what is the status of the past? Is it something merely psychological, or might it be possible to ascribe an ontological status to it? In other words, what is<br>

  Author(s) Leslie Esther<br>
  Abstract: In mid-December 1932 Siegfried Kracauer wrote a short newspaper article entitled “Street without Memory.” Here he describes Berlin’s fashionable shopping street, the Kurfürstendamm, as a place voided of memory: “the embodiment of empty flowing time, where nothing persists.”¹ He relates how on visiting a café where he often ate, and where he was sure he had peeked in the night before, he found it closed, its interior emptied. A year later he found that the café’s replacement, a patisserie, had suffered the same fate. Having disappeared, these spaces do not become part of memory, for “constant change purges memory.”² Reflecting<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c999bq">Memory</a><br>
  Author(s) O’Connor Brian<br>
  Abstract: In Theodor W. Adorno’s philosophy, memory is analyzed as a form of knowledge that has become problematic. Adorno argues that what we can know through memory is threatened with eclipse by certain allegedly more rational forms. That eclipse, though, amounts to an act of forgetting that is, as he puts it, equivalent to a “destruction of memory.”¹ Now obviously not all events or all things can be remembered or ought to be remembered. Adorno’s considerations of the issue, in fact, pivot specifically both on the loss of
                  individualityand on the danger of forgettinghuman suffering. This places memory at<br>

There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers, the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our intelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so obedient—at others, so bewildered and so weak—and at others again, so tyrannical, so beyond controul!—We are to be sure a miracle in every way—but our powers of recollecting and forgetting, do seem peculiarly past finding out.”<br>

For Bloch human consciousness is “the subject matter of history . . . reality itself.” To ask why something happened or how it happened and under what conditions is a “common law of the mind,” Bloch avers, an “instinctive need of understanding.” Historical facts are psychological facts in the sense that however “brutal” are external forces, “their action is weakened or intensified by man and his mind.” Man’s mind is not always conscious, logical, or rational, Bloch continues; it can be explained neither<br>

  Abstract: IN THIS chapter, I consider Milton’s intervention in the debate concerning things indifferent in his prose works. As we will see, in enlarging the sphere of things indifferent and giving the individual conscience discretion in such matters, Milton departs from the usual puritan position, according to which “nothing is indifferent.” At the same time, he develops the principle of indifference into a rhetoric, thereby dramatizing his awareness that the sphere of indifference is the sphere of rhetoric, in which persuasion and action may take place.

  Book Title: Freud's Moses-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yerushalmi Yosef Hayim<br>
  Abstract: Moses and Monotheism, Freud's last major book and the only one specifically devoted to a Jewish theme, has proved to be one of the most controversial and enigmatic works in the Freudian canon. Among other things, Freud claims in the book that Moses was an Egyptian, that he derived the notion of monotheism from Egyptian concepts, and that after he introduced monotheism to the Jews he was killed by them. Since these historical and ethnographic assumptions have been generally rejected by biblical scholars, anthropologists, and historians of religion, the book has increasingly been approached psychoanalytically, as a psychological document of Freud's inner life-of his allegedly unresolved Oedipal complex and ambivalence over his Jewish identity.<br>

  Abstract: The literature of criticism exists, yet we show it ambivalence and condescension. Literary devices when found in the language of critics are viewed as a breach of decorum: we like our criticism neat, a secondary and clearly separated activity in style and function. We could echo the reply of Thamus to Egyptian Theuth, in Plato’s

  Abstract: Wallace Martin’s response to “Literary Criticism and Its Discontents” is anything but naive. Its most sophisticated device is to posit my invention of a “naive reader” and to suggest that I would place the New Critics and their heirs in that category. But when I see the movement of criticism after Arnold as exhibiting an anti-self-consciousness principle or being so worried about a hypertrophy of the critical spirit that that spirit is acknowledged only by refusing it seminal or creative force, I am not alleging naivete but “organized innocence,” or the privileged assignment of some given, intuitive (in that sense<br>

  Abstract: Even more than in the case of the other sections it must be stressed that the selections presented constitute nothing more than an introduction. The double-barrelled title already suggests an embarrassment: are we dealing with one movement or two? In fact semiotics (or semiology, the term often preferred in Europe), let alone structuralism, is used to cover a considerable variety of positions. In the case of movements such as the expression theory and formalism the approaches in their alternative versions have already been pretty thoroughly worked out.

  Author(s) French Charles<br>
  Abstract: This tale is something that John was already attuned to. It really arises from studying one area exceptionally well from a soils and pollen perspective, and then turning one’s attention to a new area – in this case the Cranborne Chase area of the Wessex chalk downlands, forcing a re-examination of an existing regional land-use model that has been thought to be well understood. John was always intrigued by what palaeosols could tell you about different landscape histories. Like myself, John was always puzzled by the relative lack of soil data pointing to a wooded chalk downland in the Mesolithic and<br>

  Author(s) Whittle Alasdair<br>
  Abstract: John Evans hated formality; anything that involved suits, ties or agendas made him unhappy. This unease extended, I believe, to grand or over-abstract theorising. He was much more comfortable in informal settings; field trips, especially with a small group, or the task of cross-examining a section during excavation, were his
                  forte. There he could bring to bear, in particular situations, his extraordinarily wide frame of reference. Looking back on his last two books,Land and ArchaeologyandEnvironmental Archaeology and the Social Order(Evans 1999; 2003), and especially the latter, one might be tempted to see a superficially anecdotal style,<br>

  Abstract: Alongside his christocentric pacifism, Yoder is perhaps best known for posing the church as an alternative political body to the nation state. In imitation of the politics of Jesus, Christian communities are to share goods, welcome the excluded, and practice reconciliation, servant leadership, and the priesthood of believers.¹ When it does these things, the church becomes “a proclamation of the lordship of Christ to the powers from whose dominion the church has begun to be liberated.”² Through faithfulness to its master, not compromise, the church fulfills its call “to contribute to the creation of structures more worthy of human society.”³<br>

  Abstract: The world of mental health and illness is a strange place. It is strange, not because people are strange, but because it is essentially mysterious. What exactly do we mean by mental illness? How can a mind be ill? Indeed, how can something immaterial be either broken or mended? It is clear that whatever mental illness is, it is not the same as measles or influenza. It may be that some claim to have tracked down biological, neurological, or genetic causes for our psychological disturbances. But such explanations, whilst arguably telling us from where such experiences come from, do little<br>

  Abstract: Origen grew up in a Christian family, spending his formative years studying and then teaching in Alexandria, before moving to Caesaria where he continued to teach and also to preach. He lived through a period of persecution: his father was matyred and he himself is thought to have died as the result of injuries sustained through the Decian persecution. Origen is famed for many things: he is arguably the first ever systematic theologian, and his

  Abstract: Julian of Norwich has a high profile these days. This is surely no accident. In an age that has become sensitive to the wisdom sounding in voices historically less heeded, she speaks as a medieval woman. In an age that has learned to wonder whether the systematic discourses of reason penetrate to those mysteries lying at the very heart of things, she speaks in the language of mystical revelation. Moreover, among the female, medieval, and mystical voices we have been minded to listen to anew, hers is one of the most mellifluous. I mean that her voice attracts us. It<br>

  Author(s) Ansell Nik<br>
  Abstract: “[T]he theology of the cross,” writes Moltmann in his early work The Crucified God, “is the true Christian universalism. There is no distinction here, and there cannot be any more distinctions. All are sinners without distinction, and all will be made righteous without any merit on their part by his grace which has come to pass in Christ Jesus (Rom 3:24).” Christ’s atonement for our sins is truly unlimited. That “God’s Son has died for all,” says Moltmann, “must undermine, remove, and destroy the things which mark men out as elect and non-elect.”²<br>

Washington was forced to take a hard look at the European situation, and over the course of a decade they concluded that there was nothing they could do to reverse the continental division. The calculation that Europe would remain divided for the foreseeable future was not based solely on the United States’s inability to influence the power structure behind the Iron Curtain.

  Abstract: In 1935, the musical “Porgy and Bess” made headlines because it was the first all African American cast to take to Broadway stages. Written by George and Ira Gershwin, it pushed American publics to see African American life. It was, to be sure, stereotypical in a lot of ways. When “Sportin’ Life,” a drug dealer, questions devotion of churchgoing listeners, he sings, “De things dat yo’ liable to read in de Bible, it ain’t necessarily so.” His words are heretical and scandalous.

  Abstract: A marine biologist and an artist look at the ocean differently. A marine biologist asks questions about the ecosystem and the inter-relation of species within that system. This approach to the ocean proceeds by collecting and interpreting data, with a goal of accuracy. An artist sees the beauty and power in the ocean, ruminating on the ways it evokes metaphors about the unknown or the expanses we cannot traverse, with a goal of insight. I do not know enough about marine biology or art to know if a painter and scientist can learn anything from each other. I do know,<br>

The idea emerges from the restorative justice movement and the repair required in the aftermath of genocide in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Bosnia, Cambodia, Liberia, and Uganda.

Nearby, in the center of things, is Maximus the Confessor, lifting his right hand before it was hacked off for his allegedly heretical writings.

Doubtless Benedict, who prepared “this little rule … for beginners” (RB73.8b),¹ would have eschewed being regarded the center of anything. God, however, has always displayed a knack for elevating the humble (Ps 149:4; Luke 1:52).

  Abstract: Everyone does metaphysics. Whenever we endeavor to understand the nature of reality we are doing metaphysics. Such an enterprise is not an abstract mind game—to the contrary, nothing could be more mundane, more practical than our operational understanding of reality. Even so, no operational understanding of reality is simply pragmatic; every time we plan or perform any activity in what we take to be a realistic manner, we do so by putting our confidence in a set of deeply held beliefs about the nature of reality itself.<br>

  Abstract: Behind every psychological theory is a vision of human fulfillment. An image of optimal health is at work when we name something “neurotic,” “sick,” or “pathological.” We cannot speak of a deficit, a fault, or a sense of brokenness without an image of human health. Or as Paul Tillich used to frequently say, every perspective on the human condition conveys a sense of what is wrong with us, how we can find healing, and how we can sustain the reality of a new life.<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we contrasted Kohut with a broad stream of the Western tradition that has focused on the darker dimensions of the human condition. From this darker perspective, something is inherently wrong with us. Our destructiveness, violence, and capacities for evil emerge from an inherited blueprint that is self-seeking and corrupt. In contrast to this Augustinian/Freudian emphasis on out-of-control drives, we examined the more optimistic view of Kohut. While acknowledging the human capacity for destructiveness, Kohut refused to see that destructiveness as a part of our basic nature. Instead, psychological deprivations and distortions promote the human dilemma. The<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf0cr">The Crisis of Global Capitalism</a><br>
  Author(s) Rowland Tracey<br>
  Abstract: Caritas in Veritateis the most recent in a long list of papal interventions in the territory of social justice, and for most commentators there was nothing surprising in the document apart from its extraordinary length and the way in which it sought to offer a comprehensive overview of the whole tradition rather than isolating a couple of issues and focusing upon them. It was as if Benedict XVI reviewed the tradition, made an executive summary of what he regards as its most significant elements, and gave his papal stamp of approval to them, at the same time as enriching<br>

  5  Fraternity, Gift, and Reciprocity in Caritas in Veritate from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf0cr">The Crisis of Global Capitalism</a><br>
  Author(s) Zamagni Stefano<br>
  Abstract: One of the marks of our time is a constant call for ethics, which has progressively replaced, over the past quarter of a century, the persistent call for politics typical of the 1960s, when it was imagined that “everything was politics.” But this agreement on the primacy of ethics ceases when it comes to tangible moral issues. As Alasdair McIntyre observed in
                     After Virtue, the apodictic use of moral principles serves only to put an end to the ethical dialogue itself. In other words, the broad convergence on ethics in public debate almost never translates into ethical consensus.<br>

  6  The Paradoxical Nature of the Good from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf0cr">The Crisis of Global Capitalism</a><br>
  Author(s) Pabst Adrian<br>
  Abstract: A cross different academic disciplines, we are witnessing a fundamental and perhaps paradigmatic shift away from individuality towards relationality. Both natural sciences and humanities are seeing the emergence of different relational models that attempt to theorize the widespread recognition that reality cannot be reduced to self-generating, individual beings and that the outcome of interactions between various entities is more than the sum of parts (whether these be more atomistic or more collectivist). For instance, in particle physics it has been suggested that there are “things” such as quarks (subatomic particles) which cannot be measured individually because they are confined by<br>

  Book Title: Radical Embodiment-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Nikkel David H.<br>
  Abstract: "Radical embodiment" refers to an anthropology and an epistemology fundamentally rooted in our bodies as always in correlation with our natural and social worlds. All human rationality, meaning, and value arise not only instrumentally but also substantively from this embodiment in the world. Radical embodiment reacts against Enlightenment mind-body dualism, as well as its monistic offshoots, including the physicalism that reduces everything to component matter-energy at the expense of subjectivity and meaning. It also rejects certain forms of postmodernism that reinscribe modern dualisms. David H. Nikkel develops the perspective of "radical embodiment" by examining varieties of modern and postmodern theology, and the nature and role of tradition-in terms of linguistic and non-linguistic experience, the religion and science dialogue on the nature of consciousness, and the immanent and transcendent aspects of God.<br>

  3  The Body in Tradition from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf0ht">Radical Embodiment</a><br>
  Abstract: Before directly expounding the substance of the body in tradition, I will begin with a more formal consideration of the “radicalness” of radical embodiment. Etymologically,
                  radicalliterally means getting to the roots of something. Our bodies as they orient us in an environment, a world, are the very roots which make possible all our living, knowing, and valuing. As such they limit and define us at the same time they grant us all our potentialities. Constructivist-essentialist debates are parasitic upon (and typically tacitly assume) the range of possibilities our bodies provide. We are normally aware of our ubiquitous rootage in<br>

  Abstract: In
                  Phantastes, which C. S. Lewis credits with baptizing his imagination, George MacDonald tells the story of Anodos, who has just come of age and is about to receive his inheritance.² The framework with which Anodos approaches life is one of confident mastery, self-referent pragmatism, and enough curiosity to make him wonder if there is more to life than what he has experienced. Clearly a person of strong self-esteem, Anodos expresses his sense of mastery by placing things in convenient categories. When he first meets his fairy grandmother who appears to him in “tiny woman-form” wearing a Grecian dress, he<br>

  Abstract: Christians are united when saying
                  thatthe Christian life is a life in the Spirit. But the unity breaks down when explaininghowthe Christian life is a life in the Spirit. A stereotype of one extreme comes from my own Lutheran tradition. It can leave the impression that the Spirit’s work in the Christian life consists entirely in bringing sinners to faith, doing nothing to transform believers and bring them to new life. This can happen when Lutherans explain good works by quoting Isaiah—“as filthy rags”—and when they regard the righteousness God conveys in justification as a<br>

  Author(s) Moberly Walter<br>
  Abstract: Evangelical Christians are characterized by, among other things, high regard, indeed reverence, for Scripture. The Bible is the word of God. This means, among other things, that the Bible is understood to contain the self-revelation of the one true God, who is made known in many and various ways, and supremely in Jesus Christ. As such, the Bible is to be trusted and what it says is to be carried out – this is the way to live life most fully and faithfully.<br>

It was a heady time for theology students with the appearance of works by Hans Küng (On Being a Christian) and Edward Schillebeeckx (Jesus: An Experiment in Christology) both reflecting the impact of critical biblical scholarship on our understanding of Jesus. Within the excitement of these works, Meyer’s book stood out as something different, serious, scholarly, patient and measured in its conclusions.

                  necessarythat some things are so, merelycontingentthat other things are so. A key metaphysical question for philosophers then, is to ask what things are necessary and what things are contingent.² From a theological perspective this question is often framed in terms of the distinction between God and the created realm.

  Abstract: The late American liberal theologian, Gordon Kaufman, once said something to me that struck my religious sensibilities. “Experience and God,” he said, “is a category mistake.” Kaufman came to his claim by his particular reading of Kant’s
                  Critique of Pure Reason. Kant, according to Kaufman, argued that the ideal of God was a symbol with no corresponding reality. 1 It can be debated whether Kaufmann’s interpretation of Kant is correct. According to Kant scholar Allen Wood, Kant actually held on to the existence of God as the ground of all possibility, namely a “subjectively necessary hypothesis (A 581–2/B 609<br>

  Author(s) JOHANNESSON KARIN<br>
  Abstract: Many scholars studying how religious faith develops around the world today emphasize one important transition. Linda Woodhead and Paul Heelas, following the philosopher Charles Taylor, characterize this ongoing transformation as a spiritual revolution.¹ It reveals itself,
                     inter alia, as a growing interest in a multifaceted variety of activities associated with various religious traditions that have one important thing in common. They have traditionally been conceptualized as spiritual training since they have been assumed to contribute to a more flourishing relationship with God or a deeper contact with a spiritual reality. Yoga, pilgrimages, and meditation are examples of such undertakings.<br>

  Abstract: When J.E. Lesslie Newbigin retired from missionary service and returned to Britain in 1974, he discovered that his homeland was as much of a mission field as India. While he had been in constant contact with Britain and the West throughout his missionary career, what he saw upon his return ignited his missionary spirit and caused him to set out in retirement to discover the cause of the problem and propose an answer. It was not that he would discover something new; in fact, he had the answer all along but had to articulate it anew for the new context.<br>

  Abstract: Kinship relations belong to the sacred—this point is emphasized in our narrative by God’s constant presence and concern for domestic affairs, which are elevated thereby to a superior level. And this deserves all our attention, for the natural brotherly kinship is transcended. It receives a special divine confirmation and is the object of a special divine care. J, who had already stressed the oneness of husband and wife in Genesis 2–3, now shows the sacredness of the family ties. Cain’s fratricide will not just be unnatural, but blasphemous.

  Abstract: We are marked off as other to finite external things in their fixed particularity, since the original power of our being makes us dialectical selves capable of immanent self-differentiation. Our sense of our own difference is inseparable from the fullness of our opening out to being other than ourselves. We must now explore that otherness, not in terms of the difference between the self and external things, but in terms of what transcends the self in its finiteness.

  Abstract: The desire to know is capable of unreserved openness to otherness. It is openness to what is given. But what is given, we now see, cannot be restricted to the contracted concreteness of the particular thing. Thus the four degrees of concreteness previously discussed are modes of appearance of the thing, progressively more complex presentations of its otherness; correlatively, the four modes of identification are increasingly ample acknowledgments of its inherent richness. As the immanent self-articulation of the thing becomes more concretely communicable, so the matching openness of a human being moves from the immediate, through the dialectically self-mediated, to<br>

  Author(s) Bulkeley Tim<br>
  Abstract: The claim by Shakespeare's Juliette “What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet” is often quoted to claim that naming is arbitrary. Yet what we call things matters. For our classifying, and hence our naming, in part defines what we can and will perceive. This chapter investigates three approaches to naming the genre present in the speeches commonly known as “the confessions of Jeremiah” in order to uncover three responses to the dark times. While these are different they also often coincide and collaborate as our spirits respond to disaster<br>

  Abstract: Lamentations 4 depicts a desolate scene, confronting its readers with a lonesome landscape that is pockmarked with pain. The chapter impresses upon readers a picture of unthinkable reversal: the impossible has occurred and everything is the opposite of what it ought to be. Gold has lost its lustre, sacred jewels are worthless, and precious gold is broken like clay pots (4: 1–2). כהעמי is cruel, suckling infants thirst, and those used to rich delicacies starve for lack of food (4: 3–5).

His text was Romans 10:5–8, a text from which he had preached at least as early as 1740 and from which he would preach as late as 1789: “For Moses describeth the righteousness which is by the law, The man who doth these things shall live by them.

It is notable among other things for its inclusion of five women in the annotations; five mothers who are on the textual margin of the genealogy.<br>

  CHAPTER TEN  Witness and Christian Responsibility from:

  Abstract: In this last section of the book, we carry through in practice what was developed in theory, namely that Christian ethics is “responsible witness of the Word of God” serving both “God and men” (
                  CDIV/3: 609). In each movement, there is a corresponding dialectic of God’s initiating action and human response. In chapters 7–8, we saw how the Yes of moral knowledge of the good, human agency, and moral judgment is followed by the No against the nothingness of sin, death, evil, and the powers. We are now able to discuss further how God’s reconciling Yes provides the<br>

  Author(s) Dahill Lisa E.<br>
  Abstract: What do we learn from Dietrich Bonhoeffer about being and becoming human? That question animating this volume of essays pushes deep into Christian anthropology, ecclesiology, social analysis, and Christology—that is to say, it invites us into the territory of the
                  body. To assert that the questions at the heart of Bonhoeffer’s thinking and witness are inherently matters of reflective Christianembodimentin the world may seem so clear as not to warrant comment; obviously humans are constituted as bodies, and anything we might say about our humanity and life together in the world must take account of that fact.<br>

  Abstract: A central motif in the ethics of the Danish theologian and philosopher K. E. Løgstrup is the mutual trust between persons encountering each other, giving rise to an ethical demand that is universal. Løgstrup has a phenomenological starting point, describing an ontological structure according to which human beings are delivered over into each other’s hands, thereby raising an ethical demand. In every encounter with another human being there is an ethical demand requiring care for the other.² For Løgstrup this is a universal demand and therefore not something unique to the Christian tradition. Therefore, Løgstrup also argues that there is<br>

  Abstract: The twentieth century is now but a memory, existing in the minds, souls, and seared flesh of those who survived it and we who write and read the words that become our past. Theology—whether Jewish or Christian—is embedded in the past and the command to remember, or to forget. But remembering or forgetting are both unstable and unreliable. We remember and we forget but in part, as individuals and as communities. We remember things that we would prefer to forget, or seek to blot out those things which make life intolerable or are an offense. Alana Vincent’s book<br>

To say that postcolonial pedagogy continues and departs from the institutionalization of literary studies is to say something of such obviousness that it would seem not to bear repeating, yet it is precisely to “the obvious” that pedagogy must attend insofar as both pedagogy and the obvious perform so much social—and so much complex—work.

  Author(s) BABE ROBERT E.<br>
  Abstract: Marshall mcluhan was, if anything, enigmatic, paradoxical, and seemingly self-contradictory. Most famously, he exalted the “global village” for “retribalizing” humankind—that is, for restoring wholeness and cooperation to a humanity fragmented by print. He even likened it to the mystical body of Christ—as the fulfilment of human destiny and purpose.¹ He also warned against the global village, however, claiming it to be totalitarian, full of spite, and devoid of privacy. “It never occurred to me,” McLuhan intoned, “that uniformity and tranquillity were the properties of the global village. It has more spite and envy.”² Similar-seeming contradictions pertain to his<br>

  Author(s) GOW GORDON A.<br>
  Abstract: Metaphor is a polestar in the work of Marshall McLuhan: everything revolves around it. His journey through media, culture, and mind was guided largely by means of metaphor, since his thoughts on technology, his method, and his mode of presentation were all intimately oriented toward it in some form or another. Yet the contemporary study of metaphor in McLuhan’s work is made difficult precisely because it is so pervasive. This paper is an initial attempt to chart some of the contours of a persistent

  Abstract: If there is one thing urgently required in nations around the world confronted with growing demands for recognition of various forms of particularity—ethnic, cultural, linguistic, gender, and so on—it is a conception of civil association that reconciles recognition of difference with respect for the rights of individuals. Many older liberal democracies are rapidly becoming multicultural societies preoccupied with collective identities while many emerging democracies face similar challenges, often while struggling simultaneously to overcome a legacy of authoritarian and/or colonial rule. The dark side of identity politics has been illustrated all too frequently in modern times, most recently by<br>

  Author(s) Fairfield Paul<br>
  Abstract: While not an altogether new phenomenon, political argumentation in recent times has increasingly opted for a discourse of collective identity over traditional liberal discourses of utility, the common good, and individual rights. Considerations of collective identity—whether articulated along national, ethnic, linguistic, gender, or other lines—and demands for recognition are increasingly displacing vocabularies of universality, neutrality, and, perhaps most of all, individuality.¹ Political disputes between proponents of individual freedoms and collective interests, or between the requirements of universality and particularity, are in themselves nothing new. What is new is the manner and extent to which the vocabulary of identity,<br>

  Author(s) Kainz Howard P.<br>
  Abstract: First, I want to discuss some terms. “Natural rights” and “human rights” are closely related but not synonyms. Natural rights are connected with natural law theory and encompass human rights. If something is considered a natural right, it is also a human right. Not every proponent of human rights subscribes to natural law theory, however. From this perspective, it is false to say that if something is a human right, it is also a natural right. Although we expect a broad convergence of rights agreed on from both perspectives, divergences may occur.<br>

  Abstract: Dictionary definitions are often historically revealing. The term “right” as used in the expression “human rights” is usually understood as some kind of entitlement or “privilege.” The term has both legal and ethical connotations. According to the

Not only are they doubled, but this doubling is done in a duplicitous way. Like Eisengrim himself, who is named after that cunning animal the wolf, Doubles are often there to trick us. I intend to examine this doubling in two ways: in terms of narrative content and narrative structure. In the content phase, I will focus on<br>

  Abstract: Many Canadian readers are familiar with early Aboriginal literature— even that which was produced up until the middle of the last century — only through the “myths and legends” included in school textbooks and anthologies. Although several contemporary Aboriginal writers (many of whom write in English as well as an Aboriginal language, or write exclusively in English) have now claimed a place in English Canada’s literary canon, very few contemporary non-Aboriginal translators approach the early oral literature of the First Nations as anything but a collection of folktales without authors or as examples of the primitive.

  Abstract: Arguably one of the most difficult tasks of philosophy is to grasp where we are today. While undoubtedly this has something to do with the usual biases of the day, in that philosophers are as surely bound by mundane prejudices as everyone else, it also seems to derive from a factor peculiar to philosophy. It is no accident that philosophers have long dealt with the question of the good life. Philosophers have always wanted to leave the cave. Whether or not one fashions the departure in grand metaphysical terms, one can maintain, with fairly adequate justification, that a defining characteristic<br>

  Abstract: Kant’s central thesis is that the mind structures the sensible manifold, which is given to us under the a priori forms of space and time, into a public world of objects by synthesizing that manifold according to certain a priori rules. This thesis is supposed to defeat scepticism by providing a body of a priori laws that govern the structure of experience. These laws provide the conceptual framework within which all empirical cognition takes place. But they hold only of the phenomenal world and not of things as they may be in themselves and apart from the manner in which<br>

What many of us do not share is thé expérience of being able to articulate how oppression, inequality, and sexism détermine our “différent” treatment. In général, we are not exposed to environments which can assist us or which encourage us to learn about our unequal status.

  Book Title: A Theology for the Earth-The Contributions of Thomas Berry and Bernard Lonergan<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): DALTON ANNE MARIE<br>
  Abstract: While many feel that something must be done, few perceive the state of the ecological crisis as a "profound religious problem." While Thomas Berry sought to fire the imagination and motivate his listener to action, Bernard Lonergan was absorbed by the growing gulf between traditional Christian theology and its relevance to modern problems. This book brings together the work of these dynamic thinkers and examines their mutual contribution to theology for our time and for our planet.<br>

  Abstract: While most of the relevant categories of Bernard Lonergan’s thought will be employed in more detail below, some comments about his distinction between two language categories (description and explanation) shed initial light on the nature of Berry’s proposal. Succinctly stated, description deals with things as they relate to us; explanation with things as they relate to each other.¹ So, for instance, to speak of a wheel as round is to

That is, are there natural and inalienable rights which any human being anywhere, anytime, can appropriately lay claim to no matter what his situation in life and no matter in what society he finds himself? Bentham tells us that “Natural rights is simple nonsense: natural and imprescriptable rights rhetorical nonsense — nonsense upon stilts.” But in our time some able and analytically oriented moral philosophers have again defended, albeit not without modifications, this ancient notion.<br>

  Author(s) Witetschek Stephan<br>
  Abstract: It has become a piece of textbook knowledge that the Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John differ on the chronology of Jesus’s passion. While the Synoptics present Jesus’s last supper as a regular passover meal (and apparently have him tried, sentenced, and crucified on the first passover holiday), John’s account of the Last Supper implies nothing at all about a Passover meal, and Jesus is indeed, according to John, tried, sentenced, and crucified on the “Day of Preparation,” just before the passover feast begins (see esp.John 18:28; see also matson 2009). moreover, there is also a difference regarding the<br>

  Abstract: As to the possibility of discovering “what actually happened,” my doctorfather, J.

  Abstract: In the early 1990s, while completing my PHD at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois, I experienced a fairly precipitous drop in my ability to see. I procrastinated as long as I could before finally going to see a doctor. When, at long last, I got around to visiting an ophthalmologist, my eyesight had gotten so bad I was in desperate need of new glasses (or, as it turned out, special contact lenses).

  Abstract: What does the Johannine Son of Man have to do with the historical Jesus? In modern critical scholarship, the answer is: Absolutely nothing. The sentiment of the majority of scholars can still be summed up in the statement of Ernst Käsemann (1964, 32): “We must admit that nowhere in the New Testament is the life story of Jesus so emptied of all real content as it already is here [in the Gospel of John], where it seems to be almost a projection of the present back into the past.” Normally, when John’s Gospel is allowed at all as a source<br>

  Author(s) KOTERSKI JOSEPH<br>
  Abstract: There are numerous ways in which philosophy can be of service to theological education. There is something invaluable, for instance, in the art of making distinctions, and among the many ways of acquiring such facility, this skill is especially promoted by training in logic, philosophy of nature, and metaphysics. It is not just a matter of avoiding arbitrary distinctions without a basis in real differences but of devising distinctions that make their cuts between diverse natural kinds. Crucial to the theoretical justification for this activity is the notion that things have real natures that can be discovered by human inquiry.<br>

  Abstract: At the outset of the
                  Metaphysics, Aristotle says that “all men suppose what is called wisdom (sophia) to deal with the first causes (aitia) and the principles (archai) of things,” and that it is these causes and principles that he proposes to study in this work.¹ During the thirteenth century the recent recovery of Aristotle’s works of natural philosophy (Physics, Metaphysics, De anima, Meteora), resulted in an evolution of the understanding of causality, which in turn resulted in remarkable developments in biblical interpretation.² Especially at the universities of Paris and Oxford commentators reevaluated conventional anthropological presuppositions and reassessed the human<br>

  Abstract: This habit of prescribing more of what has caused the problem is a mark of our age. Philosophers, aware that something has gone wrong in their discipline, do not see the need for a 180-degree turn. What are considered radical solutions, merely plunge us deeper into nihilism and relativism. In short, the culture and its philosophy have grown worse since 1879, and the remedy Leo XIII proposed remains the only cure. The human mind must again be<br>

  Abstract: This chapter seeks to honor the esteemed Ralph McInerny by exploring what Robert Sokolowski has to say about the role of philosophy in theology and theological education. He has addressed this issue many times, in many ways. I begin with some evidently sensible advice that he has given to seminary educators about philosophy. There follows a description of what he calls the “theology of disclosure.” Third, I gather up some of the “disclosures” he has made in Christology. Last, I try to press things just a little further in one or two matters Christological.<br>

  Abstract: Despite the monster’s pervasive presence within the medium, academics writing about zombies in popular culture can have a somewhat smug attitude toward video games. There is often something slightly elitist in the attitude of theorists in their treatment of the video-game zombie as a lesser creature, a monstrous aberration in comparison to the true undead of cinema. Kyle Bishop’s disparaging description of the first

  [PART III Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d391qf">The Wedding Feast of the Lamb</a><br>
  Abstract: Like birth or resurrection, the eucharist denotes first of all a passage. It is a passage of body to body in a transubstantiation (of bread to body and of wine to blood), an assimilation (of God in man through manducation), and an incorporation (of man in God through the mystery of the Church, of spouses). It brings about a Passover (
                  pèsah) on the day of the Passover, or rather, it speaks the Passover. After that time when everything centred solely on the assumption of the body of Christ in the consecrated Host, we have now come to a time for<br>

  Abstract: I am not going to attempt here a history of the doctrine of transubstantiation. This is neither the place nor the time to attempt something that has been done perfectly well and fully discussed by others.¹ The thread of my argument here leads me instead to try to think through the transformation of our embodiedness in the act of the eucharist (eucharistic
                  content), having rooted it in an animality that is converted into humanity through recognition of its filiation (eucharisticheritage), and before performing the donation in an agape that loses nothing of its erotic genesis even in relinquishing its<br>

  9  Plunging Bodily from:

  Abstract: There is a paradox here: The body finds itself all the more when it is lost, or when it plunges unreservedly into something. Or at least, we can say that the body is most present when it surrenders itself. This is common knowledge. Nothing blocks a gift more than the knowledge that it is a gift; Christ’s words to the Samaritan woman—“If you knew the gift of God” (John 4:10)—are less a sign of nostalgia for ancestral knowledge than thoughtfulness concerning a desire that, in essence, could destroy the gift.

  Abstract: Like birth or resurrection, the eucharist denotes first of all a passage. It is a passage of body to body in a transubstantiation (of bread to body and of wine to blood), an assimilation (of God in man through manducation), and an incorporation (of man in God through the mystery of the Church, of spouses). It brings about a Passover (
                  pèsah) on the day of the Passover, or rather, it speaks the Passover. After that time when everything centred solely on the assumption of the body of Christ in the consecrated Host, we have now come to a time for<br>

  8  “This Is My Body” from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d391qf">The Wedding Feast of the Lamb</a><br>
  Abstract: I am not going to attempt here a history of the doctrine of transubstantiation. This is neither the place nor the time to attempt something that has been done perfectly well and fully discussed by others.¹ The thread of my argument here leads me instead to try to think through the transformation of our embodiedness in the act of the eucharist (eucharistic
                  content), having rooted it in an animality that is converted into humanity through recognition of its filiation (eucharisticheritage), and before performing the donation in an agape that loses nothing of its erotic genesis even in relinquishing its<br>

  9  Plunging Bodily from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d391qf">The Wedding Feast of the Lamb</a><br>
  Abstract: There is a paradox here: The body finds itself all the more when it is lost, or when it plunges unreservedly into something. Or at least, we can say that the body is most present when it surrenders itself. This is common knowledge. Nothing blocks a gift more than the knowledge that it is a gift; Christ’s words to the Samaritan woman—“If you knew the gift of God” (John 4:10)—are less a sign of nostalgia for ancestral knowledge than thoughtfulness concerning a desire that, in essence, could destroy the gift. As Jean-Luc Marion has pointed out, “The words<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d8hbbv">Analogies of Transcendence</a><br>
  Abstract: Stephen Duffy observes that “no dimension of Christian life or thought can be addressed without” at least implicit recourse to the problem of nature and grace.¹ Precisely because of its fundamental importance, it embraces an exceedingly long and complex history. It has generated magisterial pronouncements, fulminated controversies that have fractured Christendom, and pitted religious orders against each other. Moreover, no commentator in whatever era can say anything meaningful about the subject without appealing to metaphysics, which finds little sympathy in today’s agnosticism about universal truth claims. The question thus arises: how is it currently possible for someone to address the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d9892h">Body or the Soul?</a><br>
  Abstract: At the end of a long journey from Québec City, the lawyer and legislative councillor Henri-Elzéar Juchereau-Duchesnay (1809–71), related by marriage to the powerful Taschereau family of nearby Ste-Marie, confessed to being most unimpressed with the small rural parish of St-Joseph-de-Beauce.¹ It was near the end of the 1850s when he saw the collection of whitewashed houses and commercial establishments in the centre of the parish. He remarked somewhat scathingly that the village, “if one could give that name to a dozen scattered houses,” offered few advantages and had many disadvantages compared to Ste-Marie.² The most notable feature of<br>

  3  Martin Heidegger: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d9nk7w">The Event</a><br>
  Abstract: This theoretical inquiry into the concept of the
                  eventstarts with Heidegger’s thinking aboutdas Ereignis, usually translated as “event of appropriation,” by means of which he elaborates a philosophy of Being as event.¹ Indeed, Heidegger offers an important source in the study of the event insofar as it is considered not as a simple happening in the world but rather as that which makes any happening possible. The priority Heidegger assigns this term casts a new light on some acute traditional problems concerning the conception of time and presence, the identity of things, human being, and the essence of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d9nk7w">The Event</a><br>
  Abstract: Walking through Washington Square in New York City, I discovered this inscription cut into a monument: “The event is in the hand of God.” Though poetically articulated, this is of course an imprecise statement, because God, rather, is always in the hands of the event. That is to say, God is something other than the omnipresent demiurge who pronounced the words “fiat lux.” Perhaps what we call God is only the blink of an eye at the instant the voice resounded: Let there be light. It may well have been the combined and undefined vibration of matter and perception, of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d9nmkj">Anthropologists and Their Traditions across National Borders</a><br>
  Author(s) LAMONT MARK<br>
  Abstract: In Europe, social anthropology is a major social science that can now boast thousands of participants. This was not the case in the 1920s and 1930s, when the number of professional, university-trained anthropologists was limited to a few dozen individuals (Goody 1995; Kuper 1983). The subject is not taught in high schools, yet university recruitment remains robust, even in recent decades when government cutbacks threaten even some of the oldest, most established fields in the humanities and social sciences. It would seem, on the surface, that anthropology has something to offer. While the reasons individuals would choose to study anthropology<br>

  Author(s) CASON JACQUELINE<br>
  Abstract: The way we read the past shapes our present and future, and the genius of Loren Eiseley’s evolutionary metaphors remains relevant to current cultural and ecological issues. William Zinsser describes the sixties as the “golden era of nonfiction” (56). Eiseley’s books sold well after World War II, when the reading public developed an appetite for works that dealt directly with reality, preferring nonfiction to novels and short stories. W. H. Auden read everything of Eiseley’s he could lay his hands on (15). Yet in spite of a loyal and diverse following, Eiseley has yet to receive critical attention commensurate with<br>

  Abstract: Herta Müller’s is a poor writing, or a writing that uses the poverty of means to escape, momentarily, a greater and much more profound poverty. The world presented in her writing, in a collision of verisimilitude and surrealism, is a world in which one makes do with very little; Müller’s Nobel Prize speech (titled “Every Word Knows Something of a Vicious Circle”), for example, is an extended meditation on words and things, starting from, and always coming back to, the handkerchief.¹ In a world outside of, or below, the consumer economy, small objects, passed from parent to child, assert themselves.<br>

  Author(s) Müller Herta<br>
  Abstract: “Do you have a handkerchief?” was the question my mother asked me every morning, standing by the gate to our house, before I went out onto the street. I didn’t have a handkerchief. And because I didn’t, I would go back inside and get one. I never had a handkerchief because I would always wait for her question. The handkerchief was proof that my mother was looking after me in the morning. For the rest of the day I was on my own. The question “Do you have a handkerchief?” was an indirect display of affection. Anything more direct would<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1df4gp3">Born in the Blood</a><br>
  Author(s) Swann Brian<br>
  Abstract: Translating Native American languages is a very different process from translating European languages. For one thing, the translation of European languages does not usually present real physical and spiritual dangers.¹ For another, there are the complexities of collaboration between non-Native academics and Native American culture-bearers, formerly “informants.” Moreover, translators have to decide how to transform oral expression into a written form, and in addition they may have to produce their own grammars and dictionaries, as part of what Julie Brittain and Marguerite MacKenzie in this volume term “a unique constellation of factors.” This constellation can also include “the interaction of<br>

  Author(s) Whiteley Peter M.<br>
  Abstract: In Hopi discourse, important ideas and processes involving cultural and historical order are localized and commemorated in the landscape and are indexed by place-names. Events happened at particular places: in Hopi oral history, knowing
                  wheresomething happened is an important part of knowingthatit happened. As texts, some named places are interconnected, while others are more independent (on related Pueblo geographic sensibilities, see, e.g., Harrington 1916; Ortiz 1969, 1972; Silko 1999). Some texts are sociological, others historical, some mythological, others political, economic, religious, or ecological (cf. Thornton 2008 on Tlingit place-names). Like Hopi personal names, Hopi place-names individuate (see<br>

  Author(s) Clements William M.<br>
  Abstract: One decision confronting translators of orally performed American Indian verbal art concerns what to do with material that is regarded as questionable by one of the several persons who may figure into the process that begins with oral performance and ends with the publication of a written representation of that performance. The performer, the ethnographer who documents the performance, the translator, an editor, or a publisher may decide that a feature of a story or song should be withheld or transformed, usually to protect someone or something from moral or spiritual contamination. Under ideal conditions, the performer should not feel<br>

  Abstract: It is a story that is familiar to most modern North Americans. When unexplained, sinister, or violent things happen in the landscapes and communities we inhabit, one explanation seems to satisfy us more than many others. Whether accounting for the haunted house down the dirt lane, the spectral woods behind the subdivision, or the seemingly cursed stretch of highway up the canyon, one kind of story in particular helps us make sense of these places:

The established generic grid of the Western proved elastic and porous enough for new filmmakers looking to utilize its broad expectations and codes for different purposes, building on the promising works of directors such as Nicholas Ray, Sam Peckinpah, and Robert Altman.

  Book Title: Writing and Materiality in China-Essays in Honor of Patrick Hanan<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Widmer Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Speaking about Chinese writing entails thinking about how writing speaks through various media. In the guises of the written character and its imprints, traces, or ruins, writing is more than textuality. The goal of this volume is to consider the relationship of writing to materiality in China’s literary history and to ponder the physical aspects of the production and circulation of writing. To speak of the thing-ness of writing is to understand it as a thing in constant motion, transported from one place or time to another, one genre or medium to another, one person or public to another. Thinking about writing as the material product of a culture shifts the emphasis from the author as the creator and ultimate arbiter of a text’s meaning to the editors, publishers, collectors, and readers through whose hands a text is reshaped, disseminated, and given new meanings. By yoking writing and materiality, the contributors to this volume aim to bypass the tendency to oppose form and content, words and things, documents and artifacts, to rethink key issues in the interpretation of Chinese literary and visual culture.<br>

Sir Isaiah Berlin, in describing that sense, has come closer than anyone else to explaining it. Tolstoy’s heroes achieve a kind of serenity through coming to accept “the permanent relationships of things and the universal texture of human life.” Through them we become aware of an order underlying and perhaps girding the world of our experience. It is an order which “ ‘contains’ and determines the structure of experience, the framework on which it—that is, we and all we<br>

  Abstract: One may as well begin with Miss Bartlett’s words to Lucy Honeychurch. The scene is Florence, the Pension Bertolini. The ladies have been given rooms that overlook an interior court. Mr. Emerson and his son offer their own rooms in exchange: rooms with a view. Miss Bartlett is offended by the indelicacy of the proposal, but Lucy is less certain how to take it: “ ‘No, he is not tactful; yet have you noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate, and yet at the same time—beautiful?’ ”“ ‘Beautiful?’ said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the<br>

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dszwtv">Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern</a><br>
  Abstract: Let me try to situate my book by taking up, in some fairly familiar ways, the question of what sort of thing hermeneutics might he and what its point is. The simplest answer is that hermeneutics is a tradition of thinking or of philosophical reflection that tries to clarify the concept of
                  verstehen, that is, understanding. What is it to make sense of anything, whether a poem, a legal text, a human action, a language, an alien culture, or oneself? The difficulty is that this is not an entirely coherent question; or rather, the question of understanding turns up in<br>

  Abstract: It must be acknowledged that hermeneutics belongs to the realm of opinion, or rhetoric, rather than to the realm of truth, or philosophy.¹ But it seems part of every hermeneutical desire to cross the threshold of rhetoric and to speak, well, philosophically. My purpose in this chapter is to consider one or two ancient examples of this desire. These examples are related to the question of tradition, that is, the question of how we stand with respect to all that comes down to us from the past. A main problem about tradition is that things do not seem exactly to<br>

  Abstract: The first thing to be said about the Hebrew Scriptures is that we have very little evidence as to how they came into existence. Nineteenth-century textual criticism dispelled once for all the idea that Moses was the author of the sacred books; and indeed, it is now hard to see how a notion of authorship can be applied to these texts in any significant way.

  Abstract: In this chapter I want to try to gloss the above passage, with its reference to something that looks very much like the Stanislavsky method of getting into character, where one loses oneself in the construction of someone else. Imagine a theory of poetry as acting, in which the distinction between being and acting loses its ontological force.

  9  On the Tragedy of Hermeneutical Experience from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dszwtv">Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern</a><br>
  Abstract: Hermeneutics is made up of a family of questions about what happens in the understanding of anything, not just of texts but of how things are. This is different from the usual question about how to make understanding happen, how to
                  produceit the way you produce a meaning or a statement where one is missing. For hermeneutics, understanding is not (or not just) of meanings; rather, meaning is, metaphorically, the light that a text sheds on the subject (Sache) that we seek to understand.

                  Truth and MethodGadamer sketches out a history of hermeneutics that begins with the romantic idealism of Hegel, Schleiermacher, and Dilthey, where hermeneutics is defined in terms of a consciousness whose objects are the products of an expressive spirit<br>

My sense is that every hermeneutical situation has the structure of this quarrel, which is governed by a logic that is by turns exclusionary and allegorical.

These activities are located within two larger fields: the practices and beliefs of the Greek Orthodox religion on the one hand, and the practices and beliefs of anthropology on the other. Up to this point Tinos, the island, has remained in the background, noted merely as the location of the Church of the Annunciation, as the site of my earlier village fieldwork, and as a place to which both pilgrim and anthropologist must travel<br>

  Abstract: Thinking about perceptions of body as they are used in the Bible leads, inevitably, to reflecting on clothing and the idea of clothing. Clothing is a powerful image throughout biblical literature and in human society generally.¹ At the most obvious level, clothing covers and conceals the body, protecting it from exposure to the elements and the view of other persons.

  Abstract: José Lezama Lima came of age under the sign of neocoloniality.¹ Which meant that his first political experience was politics as farce. The Republic was a pseudorepublic. Everything political took on the hue of the counterfeit. Rather than imagining that this was an accident that could be corrected, that there was a true politics, and that it was a matter of locating and activating it, Lezama’s early orientation shows a young intellectual who assumes the opposite.

This might seem paradoxical, for how could politics be disregarded when it comes to revolution? Politics becomes invisible when the only viable strategic maneuver to dismiss a political position hinges on the accusation that an authority in power is not legitimate<br>

There is nothing novel in this observation, for this has been a perennial fact of human existence since our first parents were cast out of the garden.

We seldom encounter anything of the kind in the New Testament.¹ The easy answer, given by many in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries, but which Bonhoeffer unequivocally rejects, is that the Old Testament embodies a primitive stage of “religion.”² For him something far more significant is going on in connection with the Old Testament that bears directly and substantially on the performance of this-worldliness for a world come<br>

  How The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man Became an Unlikely Literary Classic from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g2kmgz">New Perspectives on James Weldon Johnson's "The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man"</a><br>
  Author(s) NOWLIN MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: In the first major interview he gave after winning the National Book Award for
                  Invisible Man, Ralph Ellison was asked whether he thought his novel would still be around in twenty years. “I doubt it,” he answered. “It’s not an important novel. I failed of eloquence, and many of the immediate issues are rapidly fading away. If it does last, it will be simply because there are things going on in its depth that are of more permanent interest than on its surface. I hope so, anyway.”¹ The humility rings a bit false here, even with the benefit of hindsight.<br>

  AFTERWORD from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g2kmgz">New Perspectives on James Weldon Johnson's "The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man"</a><br>
  Author(s) SINGH AMRITJIT<br>
  Abstract: James Weldon Johnson, who thought of
                  The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Manas a living, moving work— a “biography of the race”—no doubt would have had much to add to his novel as he viewed more than a century of African American experiences following its publication. The novel has proven prescient in the way it anticipated the ongoing story of African American life. This story, still unfolding in the twenty-first century, is central to everything the United States as a nation stands for. As Ralph Ellison reminds readers in his essay “Twentieth-Century Fiction and the Black Mask of Humanity,”<br>

  Author(s) Zamora Margarita<br>
  Abstract: Readers of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega’s
                  Royal Commentaries of the Incaswill remember the provocative chapter “Nombres nuevos para nombrar diversas generaciones” (Book IX, Chapter XXXI), where the author comments on the term mestizo.¹ It is the final one in the group of sixteen consecutive chapters describing things that did not exist in Peru before the arrival of the Spanish.² The heart of the chapter is Garcilaso’s affirmation of his racial hybridity, but the larger question of race in the Indies arises in the very first sentence: “we were forgetting the best imports into the Indies, namely the Spaniards,<br>

  Author(s) Corbett Barbara M.<br>
  Abstract: The only part of Reyes’s quotation that interests me here is the chronicle, its generic nature and its acceptance as literature.¹ The conceptual structure of Reyes’s statement presumes that the chronicle is a genre, and a literary genre at that. But is it really? In asking the question “what is literature?” or “what is a genre?” we are confronted with a complex problem. One could answer the question in a straightforward manner, simply stating that literature is everything that our traditions recognize as literature and that genres are categories of texts, such as chronicles or missionary plays. In other words,<br>

  A MONETARY PRELUDE: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g2kmnj">Indebted</a><br>
  Abstract: Money was the rising star at the turn of the nineteenth century in Europe. Heralded by many contemporary economists as the symbol of economic rationality and the facilitator of a stable social order, money was considered one of the greatest institutional advances of humankind.¹ Yet in spite of such warm praises, money also gained a rather dubious reputation. Rumor had it that money was indeed something unimportant, at times even suspicious, a neutral “veil” that only obscures the “real” economic basis of society, namely, the good old practice of barter, the direct exchange of good and services.²<br>

  CHAPTER 4  THE INCOMPLETE TEXT AND THE INDEBTED AUTHOR from:

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, my reading of Agnon’s
                  A Simple Storyended with emphasis on the closing dialogue between Hirshl and Mina. While it is true that, in the narrator’s words, “Hirshl and Mina’s story is over,” the novel itself does not conclude with their dialogue. In fact, instead of granting the reader a sense of closure, the novel ends with the narrator’s statement that Bluma’s story isnotover. The narrator also promises the reader that “everything that happened to Bluma Nakht would fill another book.”¹ This promise, however, was never fulfilled. Subsequently, it only adds to the reader’s<br>

  Abstract: One of the most amazing objects in any European museum is a painted clay statue on display in Nicosia which shows a woman with a baby emerging upside down from her vagina. It is probably the only representation in all of European prehistory which shows a woman actually giving birth — a mind-boggling fact when one considers, as Mark Twain remarked, that being born is one of the few universal human experiences. And this thought-provoking find is not alone. From the golden face masks of Mycenae to the unparalleled youths and processing women in the Akrotiri frescoes — so unlike anything in<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ggjkqm">An Archaeology of Prehistoric Bodies and Embodied Identities in the Eastern Mediterranean</a><br>
  Author(s) Galanakis Yannis<br>
  Abstract: Although mortuary data is one of the primary sources for studying the Late Bronze Age (LBA) in the Aegean, it is often studied in isolation from the complex, multi-staged processes and performances that made up the funeral and everything that followed it. The depositional sequence of these actions is most frequently overlooked, not least because of practical difficulties in reconstructing these events and the ephemeral and often ambiguous nature of the evidence. Despite these limitations, however, there are many clues, both direct — in the form of residual remains — and indirect — in the form of purposefully destroyed things¹ — that hint at<br>

  Abstract: A phenomenological description of dialectical criticism? The contradiction is not so great as it might at first glance appear. The peculiar difficulty of dialectical writing lies indeed in its holistic, “totalizing” character: as though you could not say any one thing until you had first said everything; as though with each new idea you were bound to recapitulate the entire system. So it is that the attempt to do justice to the most random observation of Hegel ends up drawing the whole tangled, dripping mass of the Hegelian sequence of forms out into the light with it. So it is<br>

  Author(s) Jennings Theodore W.<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis may be viewed (following suggestions by Paul Ricoeur [1970] in
                     Freud and Philosophy) as a hermeneutics, specifically as a hermeneutics of desire. it traces or tracks the imprint of desire first in the dream and then in a variety of behavioral symptoms (jokes, slips of the tongue, as well as bodily symptoms). This hermeneutics is, however, never simple since desire is constitutionally conflicted, divided, deflected, and disguised. Thus desire is never only or primarily what it seems. it is constitutionally enigmatic. it is this that necessitates something like a science of desire, an analytics of desire.<br>

  Book Title: The Muses on Their Lunch Hour-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Garber Marjorie<br>
  Abstract: As a break from their ordained labors, what might the Muses today do on their lunch hour? This collection of witty, shrewd, and imaginative essays addresses interdisciplinary topics that range widely from Shakespeare, to psychoanalysis, to the practice of higher education today. With the ease born of deep knowledge, Marjorie Garber moves from comical journalistic quirks (GÇ£Fig LeavesGÇ¥) to the curious return of myth and ritual in the theories of evolutionary psychologists (GÇ£Ovid, Now and ThenGÇ¥)._x000D_ Two themes emerge consistently in GarberGÇÖs latest exploration of symptoms of culture. The first is that to predict the GÇ£next big thingGÇ¥ in literary studies we should look back at ideas and practices set aside by a previous generation of critics. In the past several decades we have seen the reemergence ofGÇöfor exampleGÇötextual editing, biography, character criticism, aesthetics, and philology as GÇ£hotGÇ¥ new areas for critical intervention. The second theme expands on this observation, making the case for GÇ£cultural forgettingGÇ¥ as the way the arts and humanities renew themselves, both within fields and across them. Although she is never represented in traditional paintings or poetry, a missing MuseGÇöwe can call her AmnesiaGÇöturns out to be a key figure for the creation of theory and criticism in the arts.<br>

Consider the case of the fig leaf, a term that once, and not all that long ago, had a fairly secure referent, both in the Bible and in the history of art. But somewhere along the way the image—and the reference—parted company with the figure of speech. “Fig leaf ” today means something, for sure.

  Abstract: The 1970s represent one of the great transitional periods for Hollywood, producing an increasingly independent and confrontational approach to cinema in terms of both narrative content and aesthetic display. Film-makers sought to break violently with film-making conventions by reimaging genre tropes through a more visceral and realistic style, challenging audiences with graphic, nihilistic, and often brutal imagery. Thus, John Carpenter, director of
                  The Thing(1982), confesses that he “wanted something savage to happen. I don’t believe I could do that now. I don’t believe they’d let me do that,” while David Cronenberg explains that he “wanted to blow other people’s<br>

They knew that since I was something of a missionary for cyberpunk and avant-pop texts, I would appreciate this film, an unlikely export from South Africa that had quickly attracted a cult following. They were right. Blomkamp’s ideas and shocking images immediately reminded me of Shinya Tsukamoto’s cyberpunk Tetsuo films (Tetsuo: The Iron Man, 1988, andTetsuo II: Body Hammer, 1992) which had inspired me to write my first book,Full Metal Apache(2006).

  Abstract: Memory is at once an innate capacity, and an intangible ‘store’ of past experiences, sensations, abilities and events. But as recent studies of memory have repeatedly underlined, it is mediated through and stimulated by
                  things: sites, monuments or archives in the public domain, and paraphernalia, possessions or souvenirs in the personal sphere. In his highly critical study of the prevalence of memory as an explicit theme in recent writing, Kerwin Klein argues that contemporary memory is frequently vested in ‘a dramatically imperfect piece of material culture, and such fragments are best if imbued with pathos’. These memorial tropes, he argues,<br>

  Abstract: The title of this paper refers to the peculiar and indeed special role played by the concepts of nature, in general, and natural beauty, in particular, in Adorno’s philosophy. In fact, since Adorno’s early works of the 1930s up to his mature works of the 1960s, nature seems to represent what has been systematically repressed in the course of civilization. Hence, if observed from a dialectical point of view and expressed in somehow Pinkfloydian terms, nature appears as something like “the dark side of the truth” (or, in a more Springsteenian fashion, the “darkness” that lies “at the edge of<br>

  Abstract: From
                  Dialectic of EnlightenmenttoAesthetic Theory: these two book titles somehow sum up the entire development of Adorno’s philosophy. From a meditation (together with his friend and colleague Horkheimer) on the unavoidable polarity in the Modern between the dynamics of rationalization and the persistence of myth, to an arduous analysis of the relationship between the work of art and philosophy. His posthumous and unfinishedAesthetic Theoryhas often been read as nothing more than an outcome to which Adorno was led by the internal aporias of a “critical theory” of the late-capitalist society understood as an “administered world” in<br>

  Chapter 2  MAY’S TENSIONS TODAY: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxp8kc">Sixties Radicalism and Social Movement Activism</a><br>
  Author(s) McDonald Kevin<br>
  Abstract: On 15 March 1968 France’s most important newspaper,
                  Le Monde, published an editorial by Pierre Viansson-Ponté, its chief political writer, entitled ‘France is bored’ (Viansson-Ponté 1968). The author, a former member of the Resistance and one of the country’s most respected political commentators, bemoaned the fact that France was ‘removed from the convulsions reshaping the world’, a place where ‘nothing is happening’. He observed in passing that a few students were demonstrating at Nanterre University for the right of female students to enter the male dormitories, dismissing this as ‘despite everything, a limited conception of human rights’.

  Chapter 12  WHEN THE PERSONAL BECAME POLITICAL: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxp8kc">Sixties Radicalism and Social Movement Activism</a><br>
  Author(s) Freely Maureen<br>
  Abstract: It began with a memo. Its original title (‘Some Thoughts in Response to Dottie’s Thoughts on a Women’s Liberation Movement’) suggests the spirit in which it was written. Carol Hanisch, a community organiser for the Southern Conference Educational Fund, was responding to a memo by another staff member. Like so many other activists in the civil rights movement, the antiwar movement, and the New Left, this colleague did not view the fledgling women’s liberation movement as truly political. Dottie Zellner had been particularly scathing about the new vogue for consciousness-raising, which she dismissed as therapy.<br>

  Abstract: It is Jürgen Habermas (1981) himself who quite some time ago had challenged us that now we need a new philosophy of science which is not scientistic. It is worth asking Habermas, and all of us sociologists for whom sociological engagement is nothing more than an elaboration of the agenda of modernity, whether we need an understanding of and relationship with modernity which is not modernistic. This inquiry is at the core of understanding paths of civil society and experiments with modernities, not only in India but also in Europe, East Asia, Africa, Latin America and around the world.

  Abstract: In Isa 47 YHWH declares that violence shall befall Babylon, which is characterized as “virgin Daughter Babylon” and “daughter Chaldea”¹ and referred to in this essay simply as “Daughter Babylon.” In the Hebrew Bible, cities are in many cases anthropomorphized as female within discourse that represents interaction between the city and YHWH, and such interaction may be either favorable or unfavorable for the city.² In Isa 47:3 YHWH declares to Daughter Babylon, “Your nakedness shall be uncovered, and your shame shall be seen.

  Abstract: Ezekiel 16, the problematic narrative of Jerusalem as YHWH’s adopted daughter and faithless wife, has been richly illuminated for contemporary readers by way of postcolonial theory and postmodern literary approaches to metaphor and gender.¹ These interpretations have helped modern readers move from initial feelings of revulsion and shock at this tale of YHWH’s violent punishment of daughter/wife Jerusalem to a more complex assessment of its symbolic treatment of the city’s destruction. To be sure, nothing can dispel the tale’s unsettling violence; nevertheless, it has become possible to appreciate how the narrative’s use of metaphor and gender allowed its ancient readers<br>

  Book Title: The Resounding Soul-Reflections on the Metaphysics and Vivacity of the Human Person<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Kimbriel Samuel<br>
  Abstract: It is surely not coincidental that the term “soul" should mean not only the centre of a creature’s life and consciousness, but also a thing or action characterized by intense vivacity (“that bike’s got soul!"). It also seems far from coincidental that the same contemporary academic discussions that have largely cast aside the language of “soul" in their quest to define the character of human mental life should themselves be so – how to say it? – bloodless, so lacking in soul. This volume arises from the opposite premise, namely that the task of understanding human nature is bound up with and in important respects dependent upon the more critical task of learning to be fully human, of learning to have soul. The papers collected here are derived from a conference in Oxford sponsored by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy and together explore the often surprising landscape that emerges when human consciousness is approached from this angle. Drawing upon literary, philosophical, theological, historical, and musical modes of analysis, the essays of this volume vividly remind the reader of the power of the ancient language of soul over against contemporary impulses to reduce, fragment, and overly determine human selfhood.<br>

  Abstract: In the texts from the caribbean included here, the generative themes of African philosophy find expression in the context of the black diaspora forced by the Atlantic slave trade. The ontological emphasis on a relational con ception of reality plays a particularly important role in helping define the black community as something distinct from the European community of slaveholders. In turn, the Caribbean philosophical tradition presented here devotes much attention to the issues of constructing notions both of identity and self-determination and of culture and ethos within the framework of the black community.

I’m putting it to my black brothers and sisters that the color of our skins is the most fundamental thing about us. I could have chosen to talk about people of the same island, or the same religion, or the same class—but instead I have chosen skin color as essentially the most binding factor in our world. In so doing, I am not saying that is the way things ought to be. I am simply recognizing the real world—that is the way things<br>

  Abstract: In the last decade something beyond the watch and guard of statistics has happened in the life of the American Negro, and the three Norns who have traditionally presided over the Negro problem have a changeling in their laps. The sociologist, the philanthropist, the race leader are not unaware of the New Negro, but they are at a loss to account for him. He simply cannot be swathed in their formulae.

  Abstract: Black Power is now a part of the nomenclature of the national community. To some it is abhorrent, to others dynamic; to some it is repugnant, to others exhilarating; to some it is destructive, to others it is useful. since Black Power means different things to different people and indeed, being essentially an emotional concept, can mean different things to the same person on differing occasions, it is impossible to attribute its ultimate meaning to any single individual or organization. One must look beyond personal styles, verbal flourishes, and the hysteria of the mass media to assess its values, its<br>

  Abstract: For those of us who wish to carry on living—as bodies and as “us,” a totality of lived relations—ENERGY is needed. How do we get enough calories to get up and do it again or to create something? Collaboration is necessary, but on what terms? For now, the terms by which people must engage with one another to meet their needs for energy are capitalist ones. “The capitalist production process,” our best theorist on the matter explains, is “a process of accumulation” (K.

Developed as part of a marketing campaign for the Aluminum Company of America, it consisted of a 24-inch elliptical aluminum platform supporting moving pinwheels and star shapes, all made of brightly colored anodized aluminum.

  Abstract: Invocations of fear, attacks, and adversaries have long been characterized as security imaginaries. More recently, the prospect of catastrophic disruption has led security professionals across the Western world to draw up new scenarios of the worst still to come and to prepare exercises for inhabiting the catastrophic futures they have imagined. More established threats insidiously morph into unexpected, unknowable, and unpredictable catastrophic events that can erupt anytime, anywhere.

  Abstract: The Niger Delta is where Nigeria’s plagues of political gangsterism, corruption, and poverty converge. What is happening in the Niger Delta is nothing short of a militarized insurgent struggle against the violent machinery of state security forces with a terrible reputation. At the same time, there is something distinctive about this violence; the militants’ struggle is a backlash against a long history of exploitation, the presence of transnational oil corporations, a style of politics dependent upon violence, and myriad groups, gangs, and cults with no leadership as such.<br>

  Abstract: In all living things, ENERGY is consumed in specific physical and chemical reactions. Respiration, reproduction, digestion, blood circulation, and waste removal are functions of these metabolic processes. One driver of metabolism is the endocrine system, which regulates the flow of hormones through the body. Hormones act as a complex exchange of messages among different states and locations. The thyroid gland secretes instructions that increase the rate at which cells utilize energy from food. Human reproduction is similarly governed by sensitivity to chemical messengers like estrogen and testosterone. But the conventional energy sources that power economies and give rise to myriad<br>

Secrecy, guardedness, defensiveness, and corporate ventriloquism are hallmarks of the industry. Despite its technical expertise and scientific sophistication—drilling in deep water is like putting someone on the moon, oil mavens like to say—there is a startling degree of inexactitude, empirical disagreement, and lack of (or lack of confidence in) basic data. Why are the simplest facts of the oil world so vague, opaque, and elastic? Epistemological murkiness greets seemingly mundane, banal questions of how much oil there actually is and<br>

  Book Title: Supper at Emmaus-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): OLSEN GLENN W.<br>
  Abstract: Supper at Emmaus traces various important intellectual topics from the ancient world to the modern period. Generally, as in its treatment of the question of whether the long-standing contrast between cyclical and linear views of history is helpful, it introduces important thinkers who have considered the question. A preoccupation of the book is the appearance and reappearance across the centuries of patterns used to organize temporal and cultural experience. After an opening essay on transcendental truth and cultural relativism, the second chapter traces a distinction, common in historical writings during the past two centuries, between an alleged ancient classical "cyclic" view of time and history, used to describe the claimed repetitiveness of and similarities between historical events ("nothing is new under the sun"), and a contrasting Jewish-Christian linear view, sometimes described as providential in that it moves through a series of unique events to some end intended by God. In the latter, history is "about something," the education of the human race or the redemption of humankind. As in each of the remaining essays, the book then attempts to draw out the limitations of what the current consensus on this topic has become. It does this for such things as our current understanding of religious toleration, humanism, natural law, and teleology. Some of the essays, such as those on debate about Augustine's understanding of marriage or the concluding illustrated essay on the baroque city of Lecce, are published for the first time. Others are based on previously published contributions to the scholarly literature, though generally each of these chapters concludes with a postscript that engages with current scholarly debate on the subject.<br>

I was able to visit it in early June, and the following records a reflection that came to me at that time on one aspect of Giotto’s achievement.

  Abstract: “Sound,” the American composer Morton Feldman wrote, “does not know its history” (2000, 22). Feldman’s statement captures a particularly modernist approach to the material aspect of art: in the case of music, sound is to be encountered as a thing in itself, without any immediate connection to exterior meaning or reality. The desire for the experience of pure artistic form implies its converse, also desired, in which art is experienced as an object in time, linked to tradition and occasion. To set these two aspects of artistic experience against one another is the hallmark of the modern sensibility. Modernity, as<br>

If we accept that “there is no such thing as an authentic origin of memory, since all memory, whether preserved in image, word, or sound, is grounded in representation” (van Dijik 2004, 268), we must accept too that there is no such thing as an authentic<br>

Living here [in Dublin], I am finding other sides to the mentality” (quoted in Knight 2001, 67). In Roddy Doyle’s short story “Home to Harlem,” his protagonist Declan claims to feel “like Bloom” when he is stigmatized for not being “Irish enough” or “less Irish” than<br>

  Abstract: In an ever-growing list of studies on the work of Seamus Heaney, this book will attempt something different. His poetry will not be the focus of analysis, except where it is relevant to the main theme, which is an outline of Heaney as an aesthetic thinker in the European intellectual tradition. This tradition, generally located in the sphere of Continental philosophy and cultural theory, sees the aesthetic as a valid epistemological mode of thinking. From Plato through Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel to contemporary philosophical and theoretical writers such as Martin Heidegger, Theodor Adorno, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1j1nw0t">Seamus Heaney as Aesthetic Thinker</a><br>
  Abstract: It has become a truism to say that politics and poetry should not be conflated. This suspicion of the role of poetry in the public sphere has existed as far back as Plato, but became something of an orthodoxy in the period that saw the rise of fascism in Europe. Fascism in Germany, Italy, and Spain merged the divisions between the rational and the emotional and between the constative and the performative, as the public sphere became a dramatic space where the concept of the people, the
                  Volk, was embodied and dramatized through massive sociocultural performative theater. Walter Benjamin was<br>

  Abstract: The Fourth of July in 2002 was anything but another routine celebration of Independence Day in the United States of America. Nine months earlier on 11 September, Al Qaeda operatives had rammed a passenger jet plane into the north tower of New York’s World Trade Center at 8:45 A.M. and a second airplane into the south tower eighteen minutes later. At 9:40 A.M. a third plane crashed into the Pentagon Building in Washington D.C.; a fourth plane—Flight 93—later crash-landed at Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

I have suggested that we can read embodied rhetoric and bodied rhetorical history as powered by tension around normativity. I have also explored disability myths and disability rhetorics. My argument is that disability has myriad meanings, many of them positive and generative.

  Abstract: In my treatment of Plato, the first of the great philosophers to address matters aesthetic, I begin to flesh out more fully the framework considerations I have offered in the previous chapter by an interpretation that builds a whole world of meaning, encompassing every aspect of human existence. There is a sense in which one might say that Plato’s philosophy is essentially an aesthetic. Beauty plays a central role in his thought, though he has some harsh things to say about its appearance in art. However, in spite of the latter, his own works exhibit an artistry unmatched in the<br>

                  artin ordinary experience, ranging them in a hierarchy of broadest to narrowest usage and setting them in a system of contrasts. At the broadest level art is contrasted to nature.

  Abstract: Though the artistic practice of the Middle Ages was unparalleled, especially in the construction of the cathedrals that housed magnificent sculptural and pictorial works and were filled with the haunting sounds of Gregorian chant, it might not be too far off the mark to claim that, from the point of view of aesthetics (i.e., reflection on the nature of art and beauty), the thought of the Middle Ages was essentially derivative. Indeed, among the major thinkers, the great philosopher-theologians, besides citation and paraphrase of traditional sources, one finds very little sustained treatment of aesthetic matters, and almost nothing of any<br>

The beginning of the quotation reads: “Two things fill the heart with ever new and increasing admiration and awe[Bewunderung und Ehrfurcht]….”² The starry skies above are the object and model for mechanistic science.

This may come as a surprise to some. In their standard two-volume survey of American philosophy, Elizabeth Flower and Murray Murphey do not even mention Dewey’s

  Abstract: Whether viewed as the breakdown of civilization, as its ultimate and most ennobling expression, or as something in between, war has always been fraught with possibility and peril for religious leaders, activists, and people of faith. War amplifies passions and exposes societal rifts even as it generates calls for unity and narratives of common experience. War offers the hope of transforming hostile nations and peoples politically, culturally, and religiously, but also threatens to poison relations between victor and vanquished, liberator and liberated. War creates mission fields and troubles those very same fields.<br>

  Abstract: James O’Donnell has characterized Book 10 of the
                  Confessions, with a measure of irony perhaps, as a “repellent and frustrating text.”¹ The reason has to do with the book’s structure: “bright mystical vision, culminating in luminous and often-quoted words … is suddenly derailed by an obsessive and meticulous examination of conscience.” The structural difficulty is, however, also a material one. The whole character of Augustine’s ethics as presented in this book is put in question for O’Donnell by the sudden transition from the luminous to the meticulous.

  Abstract: The relationship between eudaimonism and Christian love is a vast and vexing topic, in part because both notions have been taken to mean so many things. Of course, eudaimonia itself has been variously understood.¹ Indeed, as the transliteration of the term from Greek into English suggests, eudaimonia is notoriously difficult to translate, reflecting long-standing disagreements about the content of this abstract idea.² Furthermore, apart from controversy regarding the nature of eudaimonia, eudaimonism has signified several positions in its own right. Eudaimonism often denotes theories describing the connection between eudaimonia and morality, although not always.³ Moreover, there is considerable diversity among<br>

  Abstract: Biblical interpretation is political. And as African Americans well know, biblical interpretation has always been political. The political is inherently hierarchal, in that some people are considered as superior to others who are constructed as inferior and subordinated. The political is concerned with the control of and access to resources, knowledge, and power. The power attributed to the Bible is profoundly demonstrated in the 2010 American postapocalyptic film

                  The Great Cemeteries under the Moonthe following: “Because you do not live your faith, your faith has ceased to be a living thing. It has become abstract—bodiless. Perhaps we shall find that the disincarnation of the Word of God is the real cause of all our misfortune.”¹ This propensity—the tendency to idealize experience and “disincarnate” theological phenomena from<br>

  INTRODUCTION from:

  Abstract: Any account of the relation between myth and literature has a responsibility first to define “myth.” And there, with historical stubbornness, lies not merely a problem, but perhaps the entire subject of myth studies. On the one hand, there is a question as to what myths actually refer to, since they have come to mean many things, from primitive and sacred ritual to propaganda and ideological statements. On the other, there is a good deal of confusion and conflicting argument over how to define the significance of myth. Is it primarily a matter of thematics, or form, or function—or<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1m3nvnr">Coleridge on the Language of Verse</a><br>
  Abstract: The prolific Coleridge scholarshipof recent years has strangely slighted that aspect of the poet’s literary theory which he himself thought centrally important and which, perhaps uniquely, owes little or nothing to any German “source”: his conception of poetic diction. What little attention it has received is largely confined to how and wherein his opinions on the subject differ from Wordsworth’s, with only perfunctory accounts, if any, of the theoretical grounds of the difference.

  Abstract: It is still possible to recapture something of François-René de Chateaubriand’s suavely austere reverie overlooking the Dead Sea in the early 1800s, but to do so you have to climb the heights of Masada at dawn (fig. 13).² There is a piece of irony in the detour. Not because the sublimity effect so readily encountered in the nineteenth-century archive of Dead Sea expeditions must be deliberately sought out, away from the sprawling industrial and consumerist complex that now dominates the profile of the region,<br>

  Book Title: New Romantic Cyborgs-Romanticism, Information Technology, and the End of the Machine<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Coeckelbergh Mark<br>
  Abstract: Romanticism and technology are widely assumed to be opposed to each other. Romanticism -- understood as a reaction against rationalism and objectivity -- is perhaps the last thing users and developers of information and communication technology (ICT) think about when they engage with computer programs and electronic devices. And yet, as Mark Coeckelbergh argues in this book, this way of thinking about technology is itself shaped by romanticism and obscures a better and deeper understanding of our relationship to technology. Coeckelbergh describes the complex relationship between technology and romanticism that links nineteenth-century monsters, automata, and mesmerism with twenty-first-century technology's magic devices and romantic cyborgs.Coeckelbergh argues that current uses of ICT can be interpreted as attempting a marriage of Enlightenment rationalism and romanticism. He describes the "romantic dialectic," when this new kind of material romanticism, particularly in the form of the cyborg as romantic figure, seems to turn into its opposite. He shows that both material romanticism and the objections to it are still part of modern thinking, and part of the romantic dialectic. Reflecting on what he calls "the end of the machine," Coeckelbergh argues that to achieve a more profound critique of contemporary technologies and culture, we need to explore not only different ways of thinking but also different technologies -- and that to accomplish the former we require the latter.<br>

  Abstract: Making a connection between romanticism and technology is not a very obvious thing to do; the two terms do not seem to live together comfortably. The main reason for this has to do with the fact that we are romantics to the bone: most romantics think that there is an unbridgeable gap between both. So what is romanticism, and what does it mean for our relation to technology? In this chapter I outline some key features of Romanticism as a cultural-historical movement (hence the capital

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1np9c3">Time and the Shape of History</a><br>
  Abstract: To situate history in the long term entails having a view upon time. Its dynamic force provides the unfolding framework within which things both continue from the past and also change. Time’s three perspectival states of past, present, and potential future remain fixed in their successive sequencing. Yet the eras to which they apply are always being updated. As that happens, more history is generated daily for humans to consider.<br>

  CHAPTERLINK 1–2: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1np9c3">Time and the Shape of History</a><br>
  Abstract: Shaping and reshaping history is a retrospective art, performed after the event. Communal and individual interpretations of the vast and complex past are, however, perennially open to debate – which has spawned the intriguing thought of sending not merely the mind travelling to other epochs but living people to do likewise. If such voyages were to become feasible, then the shape of history could be viewed from both far away and close at hand. And epoch jumpers could not only witness past events to provide a trans-time commentary but they might even, so it is speculated, be able to change things<br>

  Abstract: All societies have ways of locating themselves in time and history. That is far from saying that the popular recall of the past is perfect. On the contrary, many are the complaints that people today – led especially, it seems, by the young – are constituting a heedless ‘Now Generation’ that knows nothing of olden times. ‘Speak so much of memory because there is so little of it left,’ the French historian Pierre Nora exclaimed dramatically in 1989. And he is not alone in expressing such anxieties.<br>

  Abstract: Many decades after the fall of Hitler’s and Mussolini’s regimes a generally agreed theoretical account of fascism – or just a definition – has remained elusive. There is not even consensus about whether fascism is a strictly limited historical term, something that happened to Italians (or rather was perpetrated by Italians) between 1922 and 1945, or a universal phenomenon. The disputes surrounding fascism are not just a result of academic nitpicking; they point to what appear to be characteristics of the thing itself. At least rhetorically, fascism was opposed to ‘reason’; it glorified will, intuition and sentiment. One could feel<br>

  II  Writing and Difference and Of Grammatology from:

  Abstract: In this chapter I devote extensive attention to two books that Derrida published in 1967,
                  Writing and DifferenceandOf Grammatology. In both works, Derrida insists on the skeptical position he had established in his studies of Husserl. Yet, more important, he also moves beyond the battle between metaphysics and deconstructive skepticism. The real story ofWriting and DifferenceandOf Grammatology, especially the former, is Derrida’s desire for a new, even revolutionary, truth. This truth cannot be found through the mere act of debunking metaphysical assertions. Derrida seeks something more, an empirically present reality: the encounter with the face<br>

We suspect there are others. However, it is clear that we have only begun to glimpse the fundamental biological mechanisms that enabled simplexity to emerge in life.

We take for granted, for example, that reflecting in a self-conscious way about experience— “intellectualizing”—is something our students naturally see the point of and want to learn to do better. If they don’t, after all, why are they in school? At the same time, we cannot help noticing that many students are skeptical about the value of such intellectualizing.

  Abstract: In the first lecture we discussed the reasons why literary theory in the twentieth century is shadowed by skepticism, but as we were talking about that we actually introduced another issue that isn’t quite the same as skepticism—namely,
                  determinism. In the course of intellectual history, we said, first you encounter concern about the distance between the perceiver and the perceived, a concern that gives rise to skepticism about whether we can know things as they really are. But then as an outgrowth of this concern in figures like Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, you get the further question, not just<br>

  CHAPTER 3  Ways In and Out of the Hermeneutic Circle from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npkg4">Theory of Literature</a><br>
  Abstract: Despite the intimidating sound of the word, “hermeneutics” is easily defined as the science of interpretation. You would think hermeneutics had always been a matter of interest, but in fact it’s of continuous interest only fairly recently. Aristotle did write a treatise called
                     De Interpretatione, and the Middle Ages were much concerned with interpretation, so I suppose what I’m saying in part is that the word “hermeneutics” wasn’t then available; but it’s also true that at many times the idea that there ought to be a systematic study of how we interpret things wasn’t a matter of pressing concern.<br>

  CHAPTER 4  Configurative Reading from:

  Abstract: In this lecture we continue discussing approaches to interpretation. Before we talk further about E. D. Hirsch and then move to Wolfgang Iser, I want to go back to Gadamer and say something more about his implied taste in books, about the kind of literary and intellectual canon that his approach to hermeneutics establishes. You remember that Gadamer is concerned with the norm of classicism, which later in your excerpt he begins to call “tradition.” The reason tradition is so important for him is not quite the same as the reason tradition is important for a political or cultural conservative;<br>

  Abstract: We’ve now completed a sequence of theoretical approaches to identity, always with a view—though rather often lately a view from afar—to the way identity is constructed in literature. I’ll return to what may have seemed at times the missing link, literature, in a minute. In the meantime, I just wanted to point out something I’m sure you’ve noticed even when I haven’t mentioned it: namely, that each of these approaches to identity has a history in two chapters. Each history arrives at a second chapter that is something like a deconstructive moment, signifying on theory itself, on the<br>

  Abstract: In the last lecture, we offered theory a reprieve from its banishment by Knapp and Michaels, and we did so by saying that there really is a difference between language and speech. That’s a claim that I want to continue investigating in today’s concluding lecture. In the meantime, when I keep saying we saved theory, you may well be asking why anybody would bother saving it. We began to wonder last time, especially in view of the neo-pragmatists’ claims about the common agency of language and speech—understood on their view to be one and the same thing—whether we<br>

  Abstract: The essays gathered in this volume represent three decades of trying to understand the New Testament—and the people who wrote and first listened to and used the writings out of which the New Testament came into being. Looking back over that career, all this labor to understand such a small book seems odd even to me. Yet I have hardly been alone. These essays constitute but a drop in the sea of ink that has spread around those few pages of Greek text in nineteen centuries.

  Abstract: In Helmut Koester’s enormous contribution to the history of early Christianity, one of the things of which he has never tired of reminding us is the exuberance of Jesus’ followers that created, in the first decades of the movement’s existence, the wildest diversity of mythic portraits of him.¹ Students of the New Testament had often been blinded to this diversity by confusing the church’s canon with the canon of the historian. However, we do not have to look beyond the canonical documents to see one of these developments that is among the most astonishing of all: the subject of this<br>

What is required for a robust ethical life, writes Williams, is “moral confidence,” and moral confidence “is basically a social phenomenon.”¹ The study of the work of Paul acquires a new accent if we consider his letters in light of the question suggested by Williams’s argument: What is the social process by which a religious movement like that of the early Christians undertakes to instill moral confidence in its<br>

  Author(s): Bloom Harold<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging discussion of Kabbalah-from the mystical trends of medieval Judaism to modern Hasidism-one of the world's foremost scholars considers different visions of the nature of the sacred text and of the methods to interpret it. Moshe Idel takes as a starting point the fact that the postbiblical Jewish world lost its geographical center with the destruction of the temple and so was left with a textual center, the Holy Book. Idel argues that a text-oriented religion produced language-centered forms of mysticism.Against this background, the author demonstrates how various Jewish mystics amplified the content of the Scriptures so as to include everything: the world, or God, for example. Thus the text becomes a major realm for contemplation, and the interpretation of the text frequently becomes an encounter with the deepest realms of reality. Idel delineates the particular hermeneutics belonging to Jewish mysticism, investigates the progressive filling of the text with secrets and hidden levels of meaning, and considers in detail the various interpretive strategies needed to decodify the arcane dimensions of the text.<br>

  Author(s): Bloom Harold<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging discussion of Kabbalah-from the mystical trends of medieval Judaism to modern Hasidism-one of the world's foremost scholars considers different visions of the nature of the sacred text and of the methods to interpret it. Moshe Idel takes as a starting point the fact that the postbiblical Jewish world lost its geographical center with the destruction of the temple and so was left with a textual center, the Holy Book. Idel argues that a text-oriented religion produced language-centered forms of mysticism.Against this background, the author demonstrates how various Jewish mystics amplified the content of the Scriptures so as to include everything: the world, or God, for example. Thus the text becomes a major realm for contemplation, and the interpretation of the text frequently becomes an encounter with the deepest realms of reality. Idel delineates the particular hermeneutics belonging to Jewish mysticism, investigates the progressive filling of the text with secrets and hidden levels of meaning, and considers in detail the various interpretive strategies needed to decodify the arcane dimensions of the text.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nppmd">Edmund Husserl and Eugen Fink</a><br>
  Abstract: For phenomenology there was a silence in Freiburg. Husserl had died on April 27, 1938, and within a year nothing of what remained of his life and thought was left in that city. Between mid-September and the end of November 1938, thanks to the extraordinary efforts of the young Belgian Franciscan priest, Herman Leo Van Breda, all Husserl’s manuscripts were secretly rescued from Germany and taken to safety in Louvain.³ Fink emigrated to Belgium on March 16, 1939, to be joined by Ludwig Landgrebe from Prague on April 24 and Malvine Husserl on June 20.<br>

  Three  CONSTITUTIONAL SELF-GOVERNMENT ON THE MODEL OF SPEECH from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npqs8">Freedom and Time</a><br>
  Abstract: No metaphor is more common in contemporary political theory than the one that figures democracy or self-government in the language of speech, voice, conversation, dialogue, discussion, or some other speech-cognate. “The will of the community, in a democracy, is always created through a running discussion between majority and minority. . . .”¹ “Democracy is government by public discussion. . . .”² Self-government is that “state of grace in which . . . the voice of authority is nothing other than the voice of the self.”³ “[M]odern democracy invites us to replace the notion . . . of a legitimate power,<br>

  Abstract: The ontological objection against popular commitments, it will be recalled, maintains that there is no such thing as a “People,” understood as a collective subject persisting across generations. This chapter, like the last one, will attempt to show: (1) that contrary to what is usually thought, the objection applies to persons as well as to peoples; and (2) that the way we answer the objection in the case of persons further explains the place of time and of commitments in an adequate account of human self-government. In addition, the answer to the ontological objection in the case of persons furnishes<br>

  Abstract: There are many conceptions of beauty. Some associate beauty with proportion and harmony; some with pleasure taken in the appearance of things; and some, more narrowly, with
                  disinterestedpleasure. Kant, of course, uses disinterested pleasure as the central mark of what he calls free beauty. However, Kant also speaks of dependent or accessory beauty, which pertains to the aesthetic judgments we make about things in relation to the determinate concepts under which the objects in question fall.¹ Human beauty, for Kant, is of this sort.² We call a human beautiful, he suggests, insofar as a person approaches being a perfect<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nps8x">Engaging the Moving Image</a><br>
  Abstract: As with other artforms, the initial problem of talking about style or form in film is complicated by the fact that the concept of style can be applied to so many different kinds of things and at so many different levels of generality.¹ One might use “style” to refer to whole periods of filmmaking, speaking, for example, of the German Expressionist style, or Hollywood studio style in the thirties. Or one might apply the concept of style to the work of a particular filmmaker’s oeuvre, referring, for instance, to the style of Stanley Donen or Yvonne Rainer or Theo Angelopoulos.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nps8x">Engaging the Moving Image</a><br>
  Abstract: As film emerged as one of the dominant media of the twentieth century, critics often challenged its artistic credentials by alleging that it was nothing more than “canned theater”—not an autonomous artform, but merely surrogate theater served up in celluloid. As a result, film theorists spilled a great deal of ink trying to prove that the medium of film is
                  essentiallydifferent from that of theater and that, in consequence, the possibility that film could be an artform—with equal standing as regards not only theater, but with respect, as well, to its other five sister arts—had to<br>

  Abstract: In retrospect,
                  Lives of Performersstrikes one as an allegory of its time—of Yvonne Rainer’s (and the avant-garde filmworld’s) movement from minimalism to something else. The film begins with rehearsal footage of the danceWalk, She Said,which gives every appearance of being a minimalist exercise devoted to the exploration of movement as such.¹ Though a rehearsal (and, therefore, by definition something that looks toward the future), this dance, oddly enough, points back to the past—to minimalism with its commitment to a modernist aesthetic of austerity. In a narrow sense, the dance rehearsal points backwards to Rainer’s own<br>

  Abstract: The rapid expansion of the film studies institution over the last two decades in the United States was undoubtedly abetted, in one way or another, by something called film theory, or, as its acolytes are apt to say, simply Theory—a classy continental number, centrally composed of elements of Louis Althusser, Jacques Lacan, and Roland Barthes, often with optional features derived, often incongruously, from Michel Foucault, Julia Kristeva, Pierre Bourdieu, Gilles Deleuze, and (
                  maybesometimes) Jacques Derrida, along with contributions from French cinéphiles like Christian Metz, Raymond Bellour, and Jean-Louis Baudry, although generally filtered, albeit with a difference, through exegetes<br>

  Abstract: When I began advocating against the brutal murder of women in the name of “honor” almost seventeen years ago in Jordan, I never imagined that this cause, among many other causes, would be used by the West to attack the Islamic religion. Of course, the abuse and the use of Islam increased following 9/11. All of a sudden, I sensed that it was an issue of East versus West and that the West believed that only “evil Muslims and Arabs” were responsible for the bad things that happen in the world, and specifically in “our” part of the world.

  Abstract: In a book that ranges from St. Augustine to alcoholism, Thomas Aquinas to Thomas Mann, Shakespeare to the Holocaust, Eagleton investigates the frightful plight of those doomed souls who apparently destroy for no reason. In the process, he poses a set of intriguing questions. Is evil really a kind of nothingness? Why should it appear so glamorous and seductive? Why does goodness seem so boring? Is it really possible for human beings to delight in destruction for no reason at all?<br>

  Book Title: Agitations-Essays on Life and Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Krystal Arthur<br>
  Abstract: We disagree. From small questions of taste to large questions concerning the nature of existence, intellectual debate takes up much of our time. In this book the respected literary critic Arthur Krystal examines what most commentators ignore: the role of temperament and taste in the forming of aesthetic and ideological opinions. In provocative essays about reading and writing, about the relation between life and literature, about knowledge and certainty, about God and death, and about his own gradual disaffection with the literary scene, Krystal demonstrates that opposing points of view are based more on innate predilections than on disinterested thought or analysis.Not beholden to any fashionable theory or political agenda, Krystal interrogates the usual suspects in the cultural wars from an independent, though not impartial, vantage point. Clearly personal and unabashedly belletrist, his essays ask important questions. What makes culture one thing and not another? What inspires aesthetic values? What drives us to make comparisons? And how does a bias for one kind of evidence as opposed to another contribute to the form and content of intellectual argument?<br>

Such people wrote about books in order to write about art, politics, religion, and the interaction of society and culture—in short, what men and women of letters have always brought to the table. Although the same can be said of current literary practitioners, something else can be said as well: Unlike those who interpret books today, earlier critics possessed an implicit belief in literature’s significance, not simply because literature espoused a point of view,<br>

  Book Title: The God of All Flesh-and Other Essays<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hanson K.C.<br>
  Abstract: Biblical faith is passionately and relentlessly material in its emphasis. This claim is rooted in the conviction that the creator God loves the creation and summons creation to be in sync with the will of the creator God. This collection of essays is focussed on the bodily life of the world as it ordered in all of its problematic political and economic forms. The phrase of the title “all flesh" in the flood narrative of Genesis 9 refers to all living creatures who are in covenant with God – human beings, animals, birds, and fish – as recipients of God’s grace, as dependent upon God’s generosity, and as destined for praise and obedience to God. The insistence on the materiality of life as the subject of the Bible means that the difficult issues of economics and the demanding questions of politics are front and centre in the text. So the Pentateuch pivots around the Exodus narrative and the emancipation from an unbearable context of abusive labour practices. In a similar manner, the prophets endlessly address such questions of social policy and the wisdom teachers reflect on how to manage the material things of life and social relationships for the well-being of the community. This emphasis, pervasive in these essays, is a powerful alternative and a strong resistance against all of the contemporary efforts to transcend (escape!) the material into some form of the “spiritual". All around us are efforts to find an easier, more harmonious faith. This may be evoked simply because of a desire to shield economic, political advantage from the inescapable critique of biblical faith. Such a temptation is a serious misreading of the Bible and a critical misjudgment about the nature of human existence. Thus the Bible addressed the most urgent issues of our day, and refuses the “religious temptation" that avoids lived reality where the power of God is a work.<br>

  Abstract: In two decades of energetic activity, wisdom studies have reached something of a plateau.¹ As a result of the work of Professor Whybray, along with Gerhard von Rad, James L. Crenshaw, and Roland E. Murphy (to name the most prominent), we are now able to take as a consensus a great deal concerning Israelite wisdom literature, e. g. its modes of disclosure, its assumptions about authority, its probable social contexts, its general theological intentionality, its tensions with more dominant modes of faith, and its paradoxical relation to broader wisdom traditions in the Near East.² The dominant wisdom literature, which functions<br>

  Book Title: The God of All Flesh-and Other Essays<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hanson K.C.<br>
  Abstract: Biblical faith is passionately and relentlessly material in its emphasis. This claim is rooted in the conviction that the creator God loves the creation and summons creation to be in sync with the will of the creator God. This collection of essays is focussed on the bodily life of the world as it ordered in all of its problematic political and economic forms. The phrase of the title “all flesh" in the flood narrative of Genesis 9 refers to all living creatures who are in covenant with God – human beings, animals, birds, and fish – as recipients of God’s grace, as dependent upon God’s generosity, and as destined for praise and obedience to God. The insistence on the materiality of life as the subject of the Bible means that the difficult issues of economics and the demanding questions of politics are front and centre in the text. So the Pentateuch pivots around the Exodus narrative and the emancipation from an unbearable context of abusive labour practices. In a similar manner, the prophets endlessly address such questions of social policy and the wisdom teachers reflect on how to manage the material things of life and social relationships for the well-being of the community. This emphasis, pervasive in these essays, is a powerful alternative and a strong resistance against all of the contemporary efforts to transcend (escape!) the material into some form of the “spiritual". All around us are efforts to find an easier, more harmonious faith. This may be evoked simply because of a desire to shield economic, political advantage from the inescapable critique of biblical faith. Such a temptation is a serious misreading of the Bible and a critical misjudgment about the nature of human existence. Thus the Bible addressed the most urgent issues of our day, and refuses the “religious temptation" that avoids lived reality where the power of God is a work.<br>

  Abstract: By all accounts, Saint Irenaeus of Lyons, a bishop of the early church, didn’t have it easy. For one thing, he’d left the thriving, well-established Christian community in Asia Minor for what was, in essence, missionary territory. Lyons was hardly the back of the beyond—it was, in fact, a thriving commercial center in southern Gaul that did a lot of trade with the East, which was why Christianity could slip in so easily. But if the bourgeois cosmopolitanism of the city offered opportunities for the fledgling church, it also posed its own set of challenges.<br>

  Author(s) Williams Rowan<br>
  Abstract: Becoming a child again: the first reaction may be a feeling that this would be wonderful—no responsibility, no battling with expectations, no long memories of failure and ambiguity. But when Jesus of Nazareth tells us to become like children, and when spiritual masters urge us to connect with the “child mind,” they are not being nostalgic or sentimental. They are drawing our attention to something we all instinctively recognise. There is something that our habitual adult consciousness has lost or buried, and it must be found, not as a comforting reinstatement of half-forgotten happiness but as a breakthrough to<br>

In one sense there are few boundaries and so the child imbues everything with equal interest. “He enters into the world of things with all his senses . . . everything is alive, full of eyes and ears . . . the child is initiated into the secret life of ordinary objects, often the most miniscule.”¹ The tiny details matter and there can be either a pleasurable rapturous immersion or the opposite—great desolation.<br>

  Abstract: Eastern thought has long understood the value of the child mind in the adult seeker for spiritual maturity. The child mind is seen as a place of surrender, alertness, and nakedness. It is seen as a space where there is little if any self-consciousness; there is no judgment of others. It is a time of humility. It involves an awareness of the person’s nothingness—where the person is no -thing. The child mind recognizes the person’s smallness and yet connection in the scheme of things, and in Eastern practices it is seen as a state that can be developed through<br>

  Abstract: The theologian Dorothee Soelle thought that in the materialist West we are “orphan-like in relation to nature,”² and that in earlier cultures visions and experiences of another reality were commonplace—especially in early childhood. Even in our contemporary culture the small child does not discriminate between aspects of creation through accepting one thing such as the butterfly, and rejecting another such as the slug, until they are encouraged to do so. Anything and everything is amazing and is worthy of notice and interest until judgement sets in and positive values are apportioned to one thing and negative attributes to others.<br>

  Abstract: The reactions of displaced writers who remain outside their homelands for a considerable period of time generally range between two extreme groups – isolationism and universalism. According to Rubchak, for writers who belong to the first group, writing becomes either “a vehicle for memories and hopes or a totally self-enclosed shell” (101). Thomas Mann speaks about another extreme which he experienced personally: “Exile has become something quite different from what it once was; it is no longer a condition of waiting programmed for an ultimate return, but rather [it] hints of the dissolution of nations and the unification of the world”<br>

  Book Title: The Vision of the Soul-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson James Matthew<br>
  Abstract: Ours is an age full of desires but impoverished in its understanding of where those desires lead-an age that claims mastery over the world but also claims to find the world as a whole absurd or unintelligible. In
      The Vision of the Soul, James Matthew Wilson seeks to conserve the great insights of the western tradition by giving us a new account of them responsive to modern discontents. The western- or Christian Platonist-tradition, he argues, tells us that man is an intellectual animal, born to pursue the good, to know the true, and to contemplate all things in beauty. Wilson begins by reconceiving the intellectual conservatism born of Edmund Burke's jeremiad against the French Revolution as an eff­ort to preserve the West's vision of man and the cosmos as ordered by and to beauty. After defining the achievement of that vision and its tradition, Wilson off­ers an extended study of the nature of beauty and the role of the fine arts in shaping a culture but above all in opening the human intellect to the perception of the form of reality. Through close studies of Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Maritain, he recovers the classical vision of beauty as a revelation of truth and being. Finally, he revisits the ancient distinction between reason and story-telling, between mythos and logos, in order to rejoin the two.Story-telling is foundational to the forms of the fine arts, but it is no less foundational to human reason. Human life in turn constitutes a specific kind of form-a story form. The ancient conception of human life as a pilgrimage to beauty itself is one that we can fully embrace only if we see the essential correlation between reason and story and the essential convertibility of truth, goodness and beauty in beauty. By turns a study in fundamental ontology, aesthetics, and political philosophy, Wilson's book invites its readers to a renewal of the West's intellectual tradition.<br>

  Abstract: When we look at the world around us, we see it positively teeming with desires: squirrels foraging for food to fill their bellies, dogs on the prowl for a mate, flowers craning their heads upward to drink in the sun. Indeed, desire is not limited to living things, as all material objects tenaciously cling and conform to the laws of nature, though not by a will of their own.¹ Human beings offer the most varied spectacle of desire, not only seeking a wide range of objects to slake their hungers, but also seeming to be moved by desires that are<br>

  Abstract: Even before the elections in November 2008, particularly astute conservatives had lamented that many of the supposed victories for their cause were in truth nothing to celebrate. In the years since, the volume of this lament has grown to the point of becoming audible within the main corridors of contemporary political debate. Most of these persons were “paleo” or traditional conservatives, who saw in the George W. Bush administration little that was genuinely conservative and much that testified to the further usurpation of the word “conservative,” and of the Republican Party, by a neo-conservative agenda.¹ That agenda was largely repugnant<br>

We must ask, then, what is art itself and whence comes the truth it reveals? I shall discuss four ways of thinking about art that seem to command the attention of the skeptic who doubts its value as anything more than an empty gesture of liberal humanism. These four ways are also, in a qualified way, consonant with the account, which is a central claim of this book, of the reality of beauty as a<br>

  Abstract: One can readily see how Maritain’s Thomistic reflections on art at once flattered and admonished the artists of Paris’s Left Bank and beyond. He corrected the romantic intuitionism of those who had learned from Kant that artistic beauty was that which pleases universally
                  without a concept, but who had blended that philosopher’s theory of genius with the sensationalism of Hume and Burke so that art had come to be thought of as not only beyond all intelligible rules save those the genius himself imposes, but also derived from something other than the intelligence. Maritain did this by rearticulating whatever truth<br>

  Abstract: We began this study with the claim that conservatism should be viewed as the modern, settled disposition that perceives the form of politics, of culture, and of reality as an essentially aesthetic one. These things are ordered by and to beauty. The conservative is one who sees their forms, recognizes them as both good and true, and who therefore seeks to conserve and cultivate these orders in shifting, often hostile, circumstances. The tradition Burke inaugurated is distinctively modern, because it was formulated in response to the modern doxa forged during the Enlightenment, but it is also ancient and venerable, because<br>

We encounter other people and places in a “field of perceptible reality” that is enacted by visual representations, making some things visible while rendering others invisible.¹ Photographs, paintings, video, film, computer games—each and every pictorial artifact—helps establish what can be represented and how it can be shown. In turn, those images are made possible by a series of historical, cultural, and political frames or infrastructures.²<br>

  Author(s) KILGORE DE WITT DOUGLAS<br>
  Abstract: The striking thing about September 11, 2001, and the War on Terror that followed is the way in which a spectacular event was momentarily rendered invisible, placed beyond the seeable either by reason of its traumatic visibility or by responses to the political history of images inherited from previous conflicts—especially the Vietnam War. In the month following 9/11, the American film industry became embroiled in a moral panic about what to do with the iconic, cinematic visibility of the New York City skyline. One initial solution was to digitally excise the World Trade Center Towers (WTC).¹ This brief banishment<br>

  Book Title: Constructing Constructive Theology-An Introductory Sketch<br>
  Publisher: Fortress Press<br>
  Author(s): Wyman Jason A.<br>
  Abstract: To date, constructive theology hasn’t been viewed or conceptualized as a movement or trend in theology on its own as a whole. Questions arise as to what constructive theology is, where it came from, why it considers itself “constructive," and why constructive is something different from the ways in which theology has been done in the past. This book traces the overall historical arc of constructive theology, from proto-movement through the present. Inklings of constructive theology emerged well before it began to take any formalized shape. At the same time, an important shift occurred when a group of theologians decided to create the Workgroup on Constructive Theology. Further, even as the workgroup continues to work collectively, producing textbooks, statements, and methodologies concerning theology, many theologians who are not part of the workgroup or may not even know it exists have adopted the moniker of “constructive theologian." The book also considers the term “constructive" itself, offering possible reasons and historical contexts that led to this distinction being made in contrast to “systematic" theology and its subcategories. Constructive theology speaks to a very specific, historically situated emergence in the academy generally and in theology’s attempts to engage those shifts specifically.<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pwt43v">The Priority of Injustice</a><br>
  Abstract: What is theory good for? Theories are things we argue with. They provide the resources for making validity claims, for drawing inferences, and for constructing generalizations. Arguing with the help of theory is a means of engaging in reasoned debate. And theories are things we use to score points in the midst of an argument. But theories are also things we argue with in another sense, insofar as argument entails passionate, sometimes unreasonable disagreement. Theories can make us angry and invite criticism, if not outright dismissal, because they unsettle our most cherished thoughts. In the social sciences and humanities, arguments<br>

  CHAPTER 7  Subjects of Domination from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pwt43v">The Priority of Injustice</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter, I argued that debates about cosmopolitanism, environmental issues, global poverty, and transnational migration have helped to draw into view the norm of all-affectedness as the central reference point for thinking about democratic legitimacy. It is easy enough to think that the principle of all affected interests exhausts the question of
                  whoshould constitute the democratic polity. But the principle of affectedness also relates to questions of effective agency, that is, to the capacity to do things. It refers to thehowof democracy as well the identity of who is affected. The translation of the all<br>

  CHAPTER 8  The Sense of Injustice from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pwt43v">The Priority of Injustice</a><br>
  Abstract: The reorientation around the value of non-domination that I discussed in the last chapter is at the heart of the prioritization of injustice in critical theory. In this chapter, we will see that this involves moving away from thinking of injustice as either an empirical deficit measured against an ideal of justice or a conceptual derivative of such an ideal. Among other things, we will see that the prioritization of injustice involves reimagining the dynamics through which demands for democratization emerge in the world in a way consistent with the discussion in chapter 2. This chapter therefore seeks to demonstrate<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1q1xs0v">Divination and Human Nature</a><br>
  Abstract: One may enter the world of the Neoplatonists expecting that traditional divinatory thinking will find fertile ground. This ancient school, after all, advanced ideas on union with the divine, spiritual ascent through contemplative
                  askêsis, and the practice of theurgy. But the expectation is not exactly met. It is something of a enigma, which the prior work allows us to understand better. The most serious Neoplatonic thinker on the question, Iamblichus, will advance restrained views toward traditional divination, and will even be ready to toss aside the whole practice. He expresses these nuances while vigorously embracing a newly configured notion of<br>

  Abstract: The future is unpredictable. But one thing we can do is examine the factors that are likely to steer the development of specific institutions: in this case, medicine. That is what I will do in this essay. To identify those factors, however, it is first necessary to define the situation in which medicine currently finds itself and examine the events that forged that situation. I suggest that the current state of medicine is shaped by three circumstances.<br>

  Abstract: One problem that individuals venturing into the health care debate encounter is the multiplicity and complexity of special interests, each representing something different and contradictory to the whole.

  1  The Compatibility of Art and Religion for Willa Cather: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1qv5psc">Cather Studies, Volume 11</a><br>
  Author(s) SHIVELY STEVEN B.<br>
  Abstract: The touchstone for this essay is Godfrey St. Peter’s statement to his students in
                  The Professor’s House(1925) that “Art and religion (they are the same thing, in the end, of course) have given man the only happiness he has ever had” (69). The Professor asserts that art and religion are compatible, that they are—or at least have the potential to be—equal and complementary forces for finding meaning in life. Many readers and critics believe this linking of religion and art expresses not only Godfrey St. Peter’s thinking but also that of Willa Cather, who said almost the<br>

Ten-year-old orphan Jim Burden has embarked from Virginia for Nebraska in the company of Jake Marpole, “one of the ‘hands’ on my father’s old farm under the Blue Ridge,” Jim writes, and the two travel west “all the way by day-coaches, becoming more sticky and grimy with each stage of the journey.” Along the way, Jake, who is older but not much more worldly than his charge, “bought everything the newsboys offered him: candy, oranges, brass collar buttons, a watch-charm, and for<br>

  Abstract: In a letter addressed to her mother, Mary Virginia Boak Cather, on 2 March 1925, Willa Cather, seeking her mother’s forgiveness after a quarrel, reminds her that the last time they had been “cross” at one another was “about poor Mrs. Garber”: “and you see now, don’t you, that I understood her better than you thought I did, and that though I admired certain things, I was never taken in by her” (

  Author(s) PRENATT DIANE<br>
  Abstract: Willa Cather discovered the American Southwest a decade after she discovered Europe. I use the word “discovered” deliberately, despite its postcolonial baggage, because for Cather, to encounter a landscape was to discern what it had to reveal, to uncover its meaning. As a child transplanted from Virginia to Nebraska, she may have developed an early disposition for such discoveries, but her imaginative experience of landscape and its relation to her writing were redefined by her first trip to Europe in 1902, and especially by her visit to Provence.

The essays included here broaden our understanding of maternal identity as something not only constructed within the family and by society at large, but also influenced significantly by historical traditions and contemporary belief systems of religious communities. A multidisciplinary compilation of essays, this volume joins narrative and scholarly voices to address both the roles of mothering in Mennonite contexts and the ways in which Mennonite mothering intersects with and is shaped by the world at large. Contributors address cultural constructions of motherhood within ethnoreligious Mennonite communities, examining mother-daughter relationships and intergenerational influences, analyzing visual and literary representations of Mennonite mothers, challenging cultural constructions and expectations of motherhood, and tracing the effects of specific religious and cultural contexts on mothering in North and South America.’Mothering Mennonite marks the first scholarly attempt to incorporate religious groundings in interpretations of motherhood.

  Author(s) JOLLY NATALIE<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, I examine the social landscape of femininity to contextualize women’s fear of pain in childbirth. For many women, vaginal delivery has become something to avoid. Trends in medicalization and surgical intervention (including increased rates of elective cesarean section) suggest that childbirth need not involve labour (both generally, in terms of effortful work, and specifically, in terms of the three stages of the birth process). In this chapter, I consider what has motivated this trend towards increased medicalization of birth, with an eye towards the cultural features of our social world. In particular, I suggest that the components<br>

  Book Title: Love and its Critics-From the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton’s Eden<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Movsesian Arpi<br>
  Abstract: This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin’amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur’s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself – in short, the very things it resists. The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted. It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.<br>

  Abstract: There is a picnic bench on the shore of Loch Morlich in Scotland with a panoramic view of the wild Cairngorm mountains, one of the most beautiful views that I know. I may even go so far as to say that the landscape is sublime. But when I say the view is beautiful or sublime, what do I mean? Similarly, what makes something stand out as good art, or what characteristics make an everyday object or encounter a beautiful contribution to contemporary life? These are the concerns of aesthetics. In this chapter the relevance of aesthetics to criminology is explored.<br>

  Abstract: It may seem obvious to say that biographical research differs from all other sociological research. The differences apply to research techniques, procedures of analysing biographical material and something that can be called a ‘style of work’, which covers the very time-consuming research stages of material collection and analysis. These and many other specific features of biographical research are grounded in theoretical and methodological assumptions which vary for particular types of biographical work. However, the outstanding characteristic of this kind of work is that the research material is biography.<br>

  Abstract: Planning in France has always been a state affair. In the 17th century, a territorial administration was created to implement the rational organisation of space through centralised infrastructure as the cornerstone of the new-born nation state and, from the late 18th century, a vector for republican values (Foucault, 1975). In the late 20th century, despite a shift towards decentralisation that saw private actors taking a central role in urban planning, things remained fundamentally unchanged. By defining and implementing urban laws, including the process for the declaration of public utility, national and local government remain responsible for orchestrating spatial planning.¹ This<br>

  Abstract: The term
                  wen, which has a pre-eminent place both in Confucian philosophy and among the virtues named in theZuozhuanandGuoyu, is notorious for the complexity of its semantic range. In oracle bone and bronze inscriptions, it functions largely as an epithet for deceased ancestors and rulers and appears to mean something like “accomplished.”¹ In references to artifacts, it denotes stripes of the sort found on cowry shells or patterns woven into cloth.² It is the preferred pre-Qin word for “logograph.”³ In the writings of certain philosophers, most notably Xunzi, it becomes a more abstract sort of “pattern,” the<br>

  Abstract: One could categorize narratives by the things they represent as objects of repression, which are always the same things they represent as irrepressible. For example, Freud, the inventor of the notion of the “return of the repressed,” made unresolved childhood conflicts his focus; to defend his thesis, he wrote narratives in which these conflicts are the source of the energy that drives plots forward and disrupts patients’ sanity.¹ For the narrators of the

Fredric Jameson, applying an insight of Levi-Strauss to the study of narrative, has written that “ideology is not something which informs or invests symbolic production; rather the aesthetic act is itself ideological, and the production of aesthetic or narrative form is to be seen as an ideological act in its own right, with the function of inventing imaginary or formal ‘solutions’ to unresolvable social contradictions.”¹ Both in selecting material and in setting the terms of its intelligibility, narrators uphold certain views on the workings of the world while rejecting others as wrong or<br>

However, reactions to the doctrine in the latter half of the twentieth century were of a different kind and greater degree. Although criticisms of divine simplicity are nothing new, modern theology developed a new narrative of the origins and content of divine simplicity that<br>

  Abstract: Violence is the ethos of our times. It is the spirituality of the modern world. It has been accorded the status of a religion, demanding from its devotees an absolute obedience to death. Its followers are not aware, however, that the devotion they pay to violence is a form of religious piety. Violence is so successful as a myth precisely because it does not seem to be mythic in the least. Violence simply appears to be the nature of things. It is what works.

  Abstract: How did the Domination System get started? The myth of redemptive violence gives this answer: war, conquest, plunder, rape, and enslavement are all ordained in the very constitution of the universe, which itself is formed from the corpse of a murdered goddess. “Civilization” is a condition of periodic or perpetual warfare, “peace” the achievement of warfare, “prosperity” the fruit of warfare successfully accomplished.

  Abstract: In the previous chapter I suggested that “Resist not evil” is better rendered “Do not return evil for evil,” “Do not mirror evil,” “Do not respond to evil in kind.” This refusal of reactive opposition is one of the most profound and difficult truths in Scripture. We become what we hate. The very act of hating something draws it to us. Since our hate is usually a direct response to an evil done to us, our hate almost invariably causes us to respond in the terms already laid down by the enemy.

That much is clear, not just from the Sermon on the Mount, but from his entire life and teaching and, above all, the way he faced his death. His was not merely a tactical or pragmatic nonviolence seized upon because nothing else would have “worked” against the Roman Empire’s near monopoly on violence. Rather, he saw nonviolence as a direct corollary of the nature of God and of the new reality emerging in the world from God.

                  believe inanything else. And that phrase “believe in” provides the clue. We trust violence. Violence “saves.” It is “redemptive.” All we have to do is make survival the highest goal, and death the greatest evil, and we have handed ourselves over to the gods of the Domination System. We trust violence because we are afraid. And we will not relinquish our fears until we are able<br>

  Abstract: Faced with a task that feels like trying to pack the world into a suitcase, I have deliberately decided not to attempt a hurried historical overview of Christian disagreements about the nature of our existence—and our freedom, in particular. Instead, I offer a brief personal theological guide to negotiating the thematic landscape from one particular Christian point of view.

  Abstract: That god created “heaven and earth” or simply “all things” is a fundamental Christian belief, repeatedly stated in scripture and featuring in the ecumenical creeds. It entails an absolute difference between God and all that is not God—absolute in the sense that this difference is incomparable with any of the relative differences between creatures. The difference can be stated in a number of ways. For example, it means that all creatures are utterly dependent on God for their very existence as well as for being the creatures they are and for all that makes for their flourishing.

  Abstract: To make my discussion of human action within the sovereignty of God manageable and useful for this particular occasion, I limit its scope in significant ways. I do not seek to respond to the denial of human freedom by those natural scientists to whom world processes are deterministic to the point of eliminating any true notion of freedom. Nor do I take up the equally strong rejection of human freedom by neuroscientists and philosophers of mind who argue that everything humans do is caused by our “neurons”—that is, neuroscientific determinism.

                  historyandpoetry.He distinguished between them by declaring that “poetry is something more philosophic and of graver import than history, since its statements are of the nature rather of universals, whereas those of history are singulars.

The kind of changes I refer to are what Foucault called epistemic changes, what Meyer Abrams has characterized as a change from a pragmatic to an organic orientation, what the anthropologist Clifford Geertz calls “an alteration of the principles of mapping. Something is happening to the way we think about the way we think.”¹ The conceptual change I refer to is what Brian McHale and other postmodern critics<br>

Here, I shall use ‘popular’ to refer to what are, today, industrially produced forms of music directed at and appreciated by a very large, or ‘mass’, audience. Such forms do not usually require any conventional musical competence or erudition; and they are easily available on the market. I will take ‘pop (music)’ to mean something more specific, namely all forms of broadly speaking youth-oriented music<br>

  Author(s) Balfour Lawrie<br>
  Abstract: “As is the inevitable result of things unsaid, we find ourselves until today oppressed with a dangerous and reverberating silence.”¹ The writer of these words is James Baldwin (1924–1987), and “the dangerous and reverberating silence” is the unspoken story of racial brutality that qualifies any claim for the achievements of American democracy. Although Baldwin issued his warning before the undoing of legal segregation, his assessment of the United States as a nation haunted by its racial heritage goes to the core of the post–civil rights predicament. For Baldwin foresees the limits of formal equality and pushes beyond them to<br>

  Author(s) Lloyd Vincent<br>
  Abstract: Religious language, ideas, and images pervade the essays, plays, stories, and novels of James Baldwin. A product of Black Pentecostalism and a teenage preaching prodigy, Baldwin describes his writing style as influenced by the King James Bible and the storefront church.¹ Verses from the Bible and snippets of gospel music pervade Baldwin’s texts. Yet religion also appears in Baldwin’s work as something he has overcome, a distasteful encounter with authoritarianism that he passed through to reach his present secular, democratic enlightenment. If this is the case, the religious language that appears in Baldwin’s texts could be read as rhetorical flourish,<br>

  Abstract: In an essay from 2001 on “Cosmopolitanism and Internationalism,” Timothy Brennan ventures to probe the contemporary significance of cosmopolitan desire for capitalist common sense. Reflecting critically on recent “calls for extra-statist forms of political community,” Brennan wonders whether it “would … not be more realistic to think of contemporary neo-liberal orthodoxy as a form of unofficial party organization across national frontiers.”¹ The evidence, he continues, is considerable: Far from puncturing dreams of cosmopolitan futurity, contemporary capitalist practice is – at least from Brennan’s devastating perspective – crucial to them. The blistering rigours of neoliberal doctrine – deregulation, monetarism, indebtedness, “the financialization of everything”³–<br>

  Abstract: It has often been said that if Nietzsche expresses various views about the state, these do not amount to anything systematic enough to be considered a political theory. Leiter, a prominent commentator on Nietzsche, has written that the “interpretative question” concerning Nietzsche’s political philosophy is whether “scattered remarks and parenthetical outbursts add up to
                  systematicviews on questions of philosophical significance.” His own view is that Nietzsche “has no political philosophy, in the conventional sense of a theory of the state and its legitimacy.” If he “occasionally expresses views about political matters[,] … read in context, they do not add<br>

  The Eighteenth-Century Challenge to Narrative Theory from:

  Author(s) McKeon Michael<br>
  Abstract: I’ll begin with a narrative. Years ago in graduate school, as I became aware of the novel as something to study as well as to read, my eye was caught by two recent books whose claim was that the novel was getting a lot more attention than it deserved. Although very different in other respects, both Frye’s
                  Anatomy of Criticismand Scholes and Kellogg’sThe Nature of Narrativemade the point that in those days, the dominance of novel studies was such that to speak of the novel, it seemed, was to speak of narrative as such. Their influential books<br>

The novel’s justly-celebrated plot with its twists and turns and surprises seems to involve for readers a series of uncertainties about the ultimate fates of its characters.

  Abstract: From a narratological point of view, one of the most controversial legacies the eighteenth-century novel has bestowed onto its inheritors is the technique of authorial narration. Described by Franz K. Stanzel as one of three typical narrative situations, authorial narration as defined in the
                  Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theoryis ‘characterized by a highly audible and visible narrator’ who ‘sees the story from the ontological position of an outsider, that is, a position of absolute authority which allows her/him to know everything about events and characters, including their thoughts and unconscious motives’ (Jahn, 2005, p. 364).

  Author(s) Rogers Pat<br>
  Abstract: Why Curll, of all people? A natural reaction to the title of this essay might be to wonder what the rascally publisher Edmund Curll has to do with narratology, the theme of this volume. It might be thought that Curll (1683-1747) was an interesting fellow, no doubt, but scarcely a pioneer of writerly innovation. The case I shall try to make here is that Curll’s most characteristic productions, above all the instant biographies he brought out in the late 1720s and early 1730s, do tell us something about paratext – specifically on the way it constitutes a type of narrative statement<br>

  Author(s) Pelletier Martine<br>
  Abstract: Though the choice of 1990 as a watershed year demarcating ‘old’ Ireland from ‘new’, modern, Ireland may be a convenient simplification that ignores or plays down a slow, complex, ongoing process, it is nonetheless true to say that in recent years Ireland has undergone something of a revolution. Economic success, the so-called ‘Celtic Tiger’ phenomenon, and its attendant socio-political consequences, has given the country a new confidence whilst challenging or eroding the old markers of Irish identity. The election of Mary Robinson as the first woman President of the Republic came to symbolise that rapid evolution in the cultural, social,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wn0rxk">Irish Literature Since 1990</a><br>
  Author(s) Cowper Joanna<br>
  Abstract: It is possible to detect within Seamus Heaney’s poetry recurring patterns of alternating ‘familiarisation’ and ‘estrangement’. By poems of familiarisation I mean ones in which he strives towards an accurate portrayal of the places, events or individuals that his poems ‘st[an]d in for’,² overcoming ‘otherness’ with a diligent scrutiny. Cycles of estrangement invariably follow those of familiarisation, as Heaney seeks to recapture something of the ‘outsider’s’ perspective in order to revitalise the poetic energy that familiarity saps from the world around him. In lyrics that re-examine the familiar from a new perspective or re-imagine it in a new context, he<br>

The first leg is human hope; the second leg is the biblical message addressed to humanity. Trekkers who, without having responded yet to the summons of the Bible, are nevertheless seriously thinking about the human predicament, may be considered (from a Christian perspective) as walking with one leg.

  Abstract: In their journey toward faith or toward a more mature faith, a good number of hikers walk with two legs. The first leg is human hope; the second leg is the biblical message addressed to humanity. Trekkers who, without having responded yet to the summons of the Bible, are nevertheless seriously thinking about the human predicament, may be considered (from a Christian perspective) as walking with one leg. Of them, Clement of Alexandria wrote, “Those who do anything or utter anything without the word of truth are like people struggling to walk without a foothold.”¹ By contrast, many of the<br>

  2.  VIRTUOUS HYPOCRISY: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wvwdtb">Rethinking Sincerity and Authenticity</a><br>
  Abstract: Immanuel Kant’s commitment to the self-congruence of character, with its pervasive impact on his moral thought in particular, may surprise some readers. Much more surprising, however, is his belief that the cultivation of character also requires incongruence. Despite his well-known prohibition against lying and a related distaste for hypocrisy, Kant often recommends something strikingly similar to both. Specifically, he recommends both
                  dissimulation(concealing one’s thoughts and feelings) andsimulation(pretending to be something one is not). Just as surprising—and just as revealing of his ambivalence toward self-congruence—is the subject of this chapter’s latter half: Kant’s occasional recommendation of<br>

  Book Title: The Illiberal Imagination-Class and the Rise of the U.S. Novel<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): Shapiro Joe<br>
  Abstract: Through close readings of the works of foundational U.S. novelists, including Charles Brockden Brown, Hugh Henry Brackenridge, Catharine Maria Sedgwick, James Fenimore Cooper, and Harriet Beecher Stowe, Joe Shapiro demonstrates that while voices of economic egalitarianism and working-class protest find their ways into a variety of early U.S. novels, these novels are anything but radically dialogic; instead, he argues, they push back against emergent forms of class consciousness by working to naturalize class inequality among whites.
      The Illiberal Imaginationthus enhances our understanding of both the early U.S. novel and the history of the way that class has been imagined in the United States.<br>

  1  Monuments in History from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1x76f8h">Holocaust Monuments and National Memory</a><br>
  Abstract: In his famous essay on ‘Monuments’ of 1927, the writer Robert Musil claims that there is nothing more invisible to the human eye than a monument. ‘The remarkable thing about monuments is that one does not notice them. There is nothing in the world so invisible as a monument.’¹ The suggestion that precisely those images, figures and events that people strive to represent in public should go unheeded provokes numerous questions about the relation of individuals and groups to symbols and their impact as focal points of political communication. If familiarity with everyday objects indeed erodes the curiosity of passers-by,<br>

  Author(s) Walzer Michael<br>
  Abstract: My aim in this essay is to defend a complex, imprecise, and, at crucial points, uncertain account of society and politics. I have no hope of theoretical simplicity, not at this historical moment when so many stable oppositions of political and intellectual life have collapsed; but I also have no desire for simplicity, since a world that theory could fully grasp and neatly explain would not, I suspect, be a pleasant place. In the nature of things, then, my argument won’t be elegant, and though I believe that arguments should march, the sentences following one another like soldiers on parade,<br>

  Author(s) Pinkard Terry<br>
  Abstract: I will offer some very general reflections on why certain communitarian ideas have been raised in the national debate and why the communitarian agenda on its own cannot be the full story of what we should be doing and thinking. It strikes me that we ought to begin with the very general question: why is it that communitarianism has suddenly been appearing on the political and philosophical landscape in the way that it recently has? In trying to answer this question, I am going to do three things. I am going to begin with an anecdote, end with a slogan,<br>

  Author(s) Selznick Philip<br>
  Abstract: My own departure from socialism occurred almost fifty years ago. In 1940 I broke with a small Trotskyist, Marxist-Leninist group and for a while belonged to the Norman Thomas socialists. However, by the time I returned from service in the army in 1946, I was convinced that the idea of socialism, at least for the United States, was no longer something I could really support. I retained very warm feelings for Norman Thomas, and felt a strong moral continuity with his concept of democratic socialism.<br>

  Abstract: As a statement of principle, the Marxism and Leninism as applied by Lenin and Stalin have nothing to do with socialism. They are complete perversions of the great vision of socialism. And instead of creating a free society of equal chances and international solidarity, they established an especially crude form of capitalism and of national supremacy.<br>

  Abstract: This paper was originally written differently, argued differently, and presented differently, before the clouds and drums of the unspoken and undeclared war and occupation that surround us now. However, this same war, whose absence produced a different discourse, makes imperative the reflection on what follows. The events of 9/11 forced upon us the radical reevaluation of the ways in which we engage in critical discourses. Not that we need to invent new ways of addressing the events around us, because, as Schiller already noted in his letter to Goethe, “everything is already there, so it needs only to be extricated.”<br>

  Abstract: Something about Chinese landscape painting stirs my interest in questions of art and art history, rather than the other way around. What is said about the paintings raises questions, and those questions return to the paintings as if for nourishment. Because of the nature of this inquiry I have not had the opportunity to say much about what attracts me to individual paintings—their visual force, their geographic contexts, their consumers, their painters’ lives—and it may often have seemed that I would rather talk about what art history is, rather than what the paintings suggest it should be.

  Abstract: Is philosophy ready to take account of the sudden emergence and factuality of the event, which since Plato has been defined as a thought of the generality and invariance of essence? Such is the very general question with which I would like to begin. As Husserl recalls at the very beginning of his lectures on the phenomenology of internal time-consciousness, the question of time and its contingency has always constituted the most crucial challenge for philosophy, marking the limits of its enterprise to intellectually possess the world because, as the very stuff of things, time seems to escape radically from<br>

  Abstract: In one of his last texts, dedicated to “Heidegger, thinker of humanity,”¹ Jan Patočka claims that Heidegger is the thinker who realized Dilthey’s idea of “understanding the human on the basis of the human” by starting from what separates the human from all other beings, without recourse to anything foreign to humanity.² For Heidegger, the human is the only being capable of truth, which at first sight has the air of a truism, but in fact refers to an entirely new manner of posing the problem of truth.

  Abstract: In the Semitic world of desert wanderers, nothing is more important than hospitality. Hospitality is the fundamental condition of survival, an unconditional necessity of life. The duty owed the wanderer and the stranger is holy and inviolable, and without it the world of wanderers would perish by its own hand. To provide a place of respite and refuge, to offer bread and water, even to take food out of one’s own mouth in order to share it with the stranger, in short, to make welcome, that is the law of the land, indeed, that is the law of God (Are<br>

  Book Title: The Origin of the Political-Hannah Arendt or Simone Weil?<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Williams Gareth<br>
  Abstract: In Esposito's account Arendt and Weil emerge "in the inverse of the other's thought, in the shadow of the other's light," to "think what the thought of the other excludes not as something that is foreign, but rather as something that appears unthinkable and, for that very reason, remains to be thought." Moving slowly toward their conceptualizations of love and heroism, Esposito unravels the West's illusory metaphysical dream of peace, obliging us to reevaluate ceaselessly what it means to be responsible in the wake of past and contemporary forms of war.<br>

  Abstract: It is precisely in relation to this order of inquiry that Arendt and Weil’s interpretations of the Homeric world—and of
                  The Iliadin particular—assume singular importance. This is the case because it is a question to which they both return on a number of occasions, as if the return itself were decisive for the formulation of their own categories. But, above all, it is the case because their interpretations uncover, like nothing else, the aforementioned phenomenon of “concordant dissonance” or of “dissonant concordance.” It is not by chance that the most extensive reference that Arendt ever made to<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xhr6c5">The Origin of the Political</a><br>
  Abstract: It might seem that the path traced thus far in Arendt’s thought can best be characterized as the squaring of a circle, as the forging of a lineal solution for the antinomic relation between originality and duration, deconstruction and constitution, violence and power. But things are more complex than they appear to be at first sight. If we take a closer look at the hinge that conjoins and absorbs the “before” and the “after,” we can see that it does not develop without gaps or remainders. As such, in order to guarantee the success of a differential translation of war<br>

  Abstract: The

Weil’s definition of the poem as the “picture of God’s absence” (Notebooks, Vol. II-A, 405), as “misery of the man without God” (Notebooks, Vol. I-C, 229) should not be interpreted merely in terms of lack. It should be interpreted in the sense of the powers that fill and inhabit, of the plenitude that installs itself most optimally in the absence of God, or, rather, as that absence itself in its most terribly “positive” expression, as the content of Abandonment: “The Creation<br>

  Abstract: As already observed, the void is the place of force’s deployment and, as such, of the implacable conflict that divides and locates men in their opposition. However—and this is the analytical shift that moves in a direction unexplored by Alain—the fact that force deploys in an originary void is not the same as saying that it is the origin of the universe. If things were so, that is, if origin were once again self-coincidental on the side of force, then its plenitude alone would exist rather than the emptiness throughout which it extends.

For Weil, thejusappeared to be nothing more than the self-legitimization of force; thetraditiobuilt the violent uprooting of all other cultures; and thereligio, which she understood to be the theological-political glorification of the Roman State, was judged for that<br>

  Abstract: Despite all of the above, one final twist, acute divergence, or digression still remains in the relation between Arendt and Weil’s notions of heroism. In order to understand this twist, however, it is necessary to approach from afar, for it originates in one of Nietzsche’s aphorisms: “The heroic consists in doing a great thing (or in not doing a thing in a great fashion) without feeling oneself to be in competition with others before others. The hero always bears the wilderness and the sacred, inviolable borderline within him wherever he may go” (Nietzsche,

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sbd">Piaget's Theory of Knowledge</a><br>
  Abstract: We know things, Piaget claims, because we construct epistemic structures, which function as necessary conditions for knowledge. In this process our epistemic structures become progressively more adequate. This constructivism, whatever conceptual flaws it may have, lies at the heart of Piaget’s theory of knowledge. An attempt to provide such a theory of knowledge we labelled “epistemology proper” or “normative epistemology.” Piaget’s constructivism, I suggested, is a theory about how we actually know. Constructivism can be viewed as an answer to the earlier (transcendental) question; how is it possible (developmentally) for us to have the knowledge we have? Piaget answers that<br>

With Plath, we once more begin “in a kingdom by the sea,” before all separations and departures. In such a prelapsarian mythic matrix, human breath, the breath of the sea, and the breath of poetry pulse in unison. Plath recalls this origin in “ocean

Yet hypotheses relating to poetry, although they may appear to be very distant illuminations, could be the fires of fate, if rhetoric ever meant anything.”¹ If‥‥ And, luckily, it does not, the philosopher knows, and he proceeds to expose his rhetoric of a poetry coincident with reality.

  Abstract: Ezra Pound wrote in 1933, “Mr. Eliot and I are in agreement … in so far as we both believe that existing works form a complete order which is changed by the introduction of the ‘really new’ work.” But he offered a qualification that measures the radical “disagreement” between the two poets: “‘Existing monuments form an ideal order among themselves.’ It would be healthier to use a zoological term rather than the word monument.

  Abstract: What goes on in the writings of the later Heidegger cannot truthfully be called a reasoning of any sort. From the standpoint of progressive, systematic, calculative thinking, it is certain to appear repetitious, opaque, pointless or unproductive. It is not (like this book) an attempt to get straight about anything. It may not even be the sort of thinking that Heidegger talks about in What is Called Thinking? And no one who had ever given a thought to poetry would call it poetry. One could call it, loosely, reflection, but Heidegger would probably say that it doesn’t need to be<br>

  Abstract: The folly of trying to follow closely Heidegger’s thinking, I mean his later writings, comes out very forcefully when you try to stop, because there is no natural stopping place, no place of arrival where everything falls into place and you can say, “Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.” Instead, the movement you get into is that of going back over what has been said in order to pick up on what is missing or what has been left out of account.

Constantly implicit in such an account is the tension between two conflicting demands: that the account be theoretical, that is, composed of (among other things) broadly applicable general statements directed to certain kinds of musical understanding; and that it be firmly situated within the detailed context formed by Bartok’s works and life, as that context has grown in our knowledge over the past fifty years and more. Where it is necessary to choose between these demands, generality must give way to context. But the book attempts to avoid<br>

My methodologies therefore had to be flexible enough to be responsive to things we heard from students along the way. Further, those methodologies also combined qualitative and quantitative data to provide a fuller understanding of student source use; I therefore used both qualitative and quantitative data-analysis strategies to prepare the results for faculty and administrators across the disciplines.

  Book Title: Fundamental Theology-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Mansini Guy<br>
  Abstract: Fundamental Theologyexamines the light by which the mysteries of Christ and the Church, the Trinity and the Sacraments, are revealed to us. That light we call "revelation," and fundamental theology examines in the first place what this light shows about itself, and how it is sustained in the world. Or again, fundamental theology considers what the word of God has to say both about itself and what it has to say about where in the world it is to be heard. So, first it is a theology of Revelation (chapter 1), and second, a theology of the transmission of Revelation in Tradition, Scripture, and the Church (chapters 2, 3, and 4). Why must Revelation have the shape it does, and why must it be constituted by both word and event? Why is Tradition prior to Scripture, why must the word of God be written down, and why must Scripture come to us in two testaments? And why must the message conveyed in Tradition and Scripture have a living interpreter in the Church?Since no word is spoken unless it is heard, fundamental theology also investigates the conditions of hearing the word of God, the very hearing itself in the assent of faith, and a necessary consequence of this hearing. The remote conditions of hearing are also what theology calls our ability to come to the knowledge of thepreambula fidei- the things about God than can be known by the natural light (chapter 5). The immediate condition of hearing is the credibility of the word (chapter 6). Hearing is faith (chapter 7). And true hearing gives the hearer to recapitulate what is heard in his own wondering and thankful voice in theology (chapter 8). The introduction to theology in the last chapter is by way of considering the history of Catholic theology in the 20th century.<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1z27h24">Fundamental Theology</a><br>
  Abstract: Theology is a word about God—talk about God. When it is simply our talk, purely human talk about God, it can be philosophical, something we find in Aristotle’s
                  Metaphysics. More originally, there is God’s talk about God. Before the foundations of the world were laid, there is the eternal Word of God, the Word that St. John says was “in the beginning” (Jn 1:1). Since God’s Word expresses not only the infinite intelligibility of God, but contains the original pattern of every created thing, it already encompasses within itself all true human speech about God, including true philosophical speech<br>

God does not speak unless he can be heard, and he does not command unless he can be obeyed. The actuality of hearing what God says is the topic of the chapter on faith.

That is, the knowledge of God in faith is a higher knowledge than any other, both as to its content and as to its way of knowing.

In so far as anything depends on us under the Spirit’s sovereign impulse, this will be grounded in prayer.

We shall not encounter a single binding concept of reality in Dostoevsky’s thought; rather, his notion of reality is a syncretism.³ Reality for him embraces concrete, historical reality with its classes, its immediate problems and conflicts, and its social and national types which give expression to the<br>

  Abstract: Three things may be said about the lifelong polemic of Maxim Gorky (1868–1936) with Dostoevsky. First, it had deep psychological roots in a confrontation with aspects of his own nature; overcoming Dostoevsky, for Gorky, was a process of self-overcoming. Second, this process of self-overcoming became linked with a central effort of Gorky’s literary and cultural writings—the task of overcoming Russian history, the painful legacy of violence and disorder in Russian man and life, all that he once called “our most implacable enemy—our past.”² And third, this overcoming ultimately took on the dimensions of a struggle between worldviews,<br>

  Abstract: As one considers any biographical treatment of Alexander Pushkin it is prudent to bear in mind the words of the eminent cultural historian, literary theorist, and biographer of the poet Yury Lotman. In his biography Lotman “wanted to show how, like the mythological King Midas who turned everything he touched to gold, Pushkin turned everything he touched into creativity, art. [But] Midas starved to death — his food became gold.”² This metaphor is strikingly apropos when it comes to the facts of Pushkin’s life.

At the same time it is, belletristically if not historiographically, pretty much a flop, a point which has been made more than once over the past two centuries, most persuasively in recent decades by Marc Raeff.² Yet Pushkin was clearly up to something important here, in 1833–34, as he gained access to government archives and gathered materials, visited the sites of the 1773–74 rebellion in the Orenburgguberniya, took down eyewitness accounts, and drafted his history, a history which was intended to<br>

  Abstract: Joseph Brodsky is a bundle of contradictions.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxsj7q">The Superstitious Muse</a><br>
  Abstract: Central to any understanding of Joseph Brodsky as poet and thinker is his myth of language, his belief in words, and not just any words but specifically poetic words, ability to restructure time and to outwit states, tyrants, history itself. “Prosody is simply a repository of time within language,”² writes Brodsky in a statement repeated many times over in different guises and contexts. Poetic words, by their very nature, got there, and are always still getting there, first. Indeed, what makes this idea a myth in the first place, that is, something larger than the life it explains, is these<br>

  Abstract: Addressing questions such as those posed in the introduction requires considering the constellation of Romantic aesthetics and ideologies pervasive among European artists in the first half of the nineteenth century. These are normally understood as being marked by a skepticism toward older, Classical forms and procedures, the employment of which in music, literature, or other of the arts would have been viewed by the Romantics as something of an exercise in form—as the replication of older procedures for the sake of conformist repetition, as an endorsement of Enlightenment ideals that had long since become outdated.

  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxz0jw">Sonata Fragments</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the most important points in the foregoing analyses is that nineteenth century Romantic sonatas (and Romantic sonata forms more broadly) are governed in both structure and content by a central conflict—an essential expressive opposition that can be construed in a variety of ways: perfect versus imperfect, present versus nonpresent, real versus unreal, and so on. The conflict is best understood as stemming from the Romantic compulsion for creating, or re-creating, something better than what is currently available in one’s present situation—looking toward a better future, for example, or reminiscing on a better past.

  Abstract: It is not by chance that modern aesthetics and modern theories of art (and I mean by “modern” those born with Mannerism, developed through Romanticism, and provocatively restated by the early-twentieth-century avant-gardes) have frequently identified the artistic message with metaphor. Metaphor (the new and inventive one, not the worn-out catachresis) is a way to designate something by the name of something else, thus presenting that something in an unexpected way. The modern criterion for recognizing the artistic value was

  Abstract: At one time, let’s say 1990, it seemed as if relational ontologies marked a significant advance for those trying to think past the limits of liberal political theory and the more general posture of the modern subject. Appreciating the interconnectedness of all things, and thus the dependency of any given thing, was taken to have more or less clear ethical-political implications, the kind that should lead to a less violent, even a more cooperative, world.

  Author(s) Failache Juan Carlos Pereda<br>
  Abstract: Socialization processes normally imply that we stimulate and praise—or discourage and scorn—some of our desires. And something comparable happens to our beliefs, emotions, interests, and, of course, to our actions. A tradition or cultural heritage is not just something out there; it entails a complex, and usually implicit, social normativity. However, communities also make explicit, in a fragmentary way, that normativity by means of codes, regulations, exhortations, suggestions, prohibitions, historical narratives, monuments, songs—all in a more or less vague and inconsistent manner. Is this how a public normativity becomes rooted in every person’s life?<br>

  Abstract: While “there are many cosmopolitanisms,” as Jennifer Hansen notes in Chapter 13, “Cosmopolitan Hope,” a feature linking them in their various contemporary instantiations is a certain requisite generosity of perception, an openness to the unfamiliar, foreign, or strange.¹ Perceptual generosity puts no additional demand on the function of eyesight, although it is a refusal of blindness; what is required is a capacious moral purview. This is a shift in relational comportment, something like what Noëlle McAfee in Chapter 2, “Home, Hospitality, and the Cosmopolitan Address,” terms “cosmopolitan imaginary,” by which we think about “how and where we and others are<br>

  8  Hermeneutics as the Recovery of Man from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005tww">The Essential Caputo</a><br>
  Abstract: When Constantine Constantius—the Kierkegaardian pseudonym—undertook a return trip to Berlin, he made an experiment in “repetition” which was, I want to argue, of some consequence for hermeneutics. I believe that what we nowadays call “hermeneutics”—Heideggerian and post-Heideggerian hermeneutics—defends the view that repetition is possible and indeed that everything in hermeneutics turns on its possibility. On this account, hermeneutics is always a work of retrieval (
                  Wiederholung), a laying out (auslegen) which fetches back (wiederholen), an explicating which retrieves what is latent and puts it into words for the first time, as Heidegger says (SZ, § 63, 314<br>

Rorty has given up the Kantian idea that there is a “philosophical tribunal”¹ whose job it is to adjudicate conflicting claims about science or morals or art, in virtue of something that philosophers know and that nobody else knows, not unless they become philosophers, too.

  14  The Good News about Alterity: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005tww">The Essential Caputo</a><br>
  Abstract: Derrida’s work is often mistakenly criticized as a kind of linguistic subjective idealism which traps us inside a chain of linguistic signifiers, unable to do anything but play vainly with linguistic strings. In fact, Derrida’s thought is through and through a philosophy of “alterity,” of openness to the other, which provides a rich and vigorous catalyst for religious thought. After demonstrating the wrongheadedness of the subjectivist reading of Derrida, I go on to show the richness of this philosophy of alterity for theology: first, in terms of the negative theology, where alterity refers to God as the absolutely Other; and<br>

  21  Without Sovereignty, Without Being: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005tww">The Essential Caputo</a><br>
  Abstract: Is there something “unconditional” that is nonetheless without “sovereignty”? Is there something that makes an unconditional claim without laying claim to unconditional force or power?

  Abstract: When Constantine Constantius—the Kierkegaardian pseudonym—undertook a return trip to Berlin, he made an experiment in “repetition” which was, I want to argue, of some consequence for hermeneutics. I believe that what we nowadays call “hermeneutics”—Heideggerian and post-Heideggerian hermeneutics—defends the view that repetition is possible and indeed that everything in hermeneutics turns on its possibility. On this account, hermeneutics is always a work of retrieval (
                  Wiederholung), a laying out (auslegen) which fetches back (wiederholen), an explicating which retrieves what is latent and puts it into words for the first time, as Heidegger says (SZ, § 63, 314<br>

Truthfully, this is no easy demand to fulfill, especially if one considers that—regarded from outside—at first something entirely arbitrary belongs to every beginning.

  Abstract: The lifeworld as the pretheoretical world in which we live—with a view to the question of human self-relations, how are we to make it adequately accessible to a philosophical thematization? This question is all the more urgent insofar as the critical objections that have arisen in the course of the discussion of Husserl’s last great transcendental meditation are taken as valid. That the objection against the Husserlian conception shows itself to be more than a facile detection of mistakes is something of a triviality in the face of the circumstance that here the high road of modern philosophy has<br>

  Abstract: With the hermeneutical demonstration that our never other than life worldly situated self-understanding is always already historical at the origin of its self-worldly significance, the factual analysis of Heidegger’s early work comes to an end, in that for one thing, it makes explicit the point of departure of phenomenological hermeneutics of factical historical life in the wealth of its structures. For another, beyond the fact of placing the starting point in life, the central question of his early work illuminates at the same time how “factical life-experience belongs in a wholly originary sense to the problematic of philosophy,”¹ in that<br>

  Abstract: This chapter examines a new kind of video game, the walking simulator, and how it stages a conflict between old “hardcore gamer” culture and a newer perception of gaming as fundamentally mainstream, artistic, and diverse. This conflict is exemplified by the #GamerGate controversy, which exploded in the gamer community in August 2014, either in response to a lack of journalistic ethics or because of an undercurrent of vicious misogyny in gaming, depending on whom you ask. Among other things, it was an attempt to police the borders of gamer identity in the face of changing demographics and complementary erosions of<br>

  Abstract: Throughout each day we implicitly and explicitly ask
                  What is that?and the most direct way in which we answer this question is via categorization, as in naming or recognizing things according animal species, kinds of vegetables, types of musical instruments, and so on. This basic question often takes the richer form ofHow shall we understand this?which we sometimes answer via metaphor—that is, by conceptualizing something from one category in terms of another category to which it normally does not belong. Literary examples, such as Shakespeare’s prating stones (Macbeth) and Maya Angelou’s “I’m a black ocean, leaping<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt200610s">Music and Embodied Cognition</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter I focus on the “horizontal dimension” of musical motion and space. Unlike the concept of
                  pitch height, there is no component of the concept ofmusical motion, as defined below, that directly involves literal motion. Or, as Viktor Zuckerkandl (1956) and Judy Lochhead (1989–90) have argued, in most cases musical motion is entirely imaginary. Even more than with pitch height, musical motion is thus not perceptible: what we hear and feel is something other than motion, which we then conceptualize metaphorically as motion. The proposition that we do not hear musical motion may conflict strongly with<br>

  Abstract: The history of introducing Soviet-type political regimes in countries along the European border of the USSR has long been the subject of vehement scholarly and journalistic discussions. Historians still cannot agree on what plan exactly Stalin had in mind for Eastern Europe immediately after the war. Remarkably, Soviet and Western assessments of the post-war situation in the region coincided almost completely. The American diplomat George Kennan compared Eastern Europe in the transitional period between war and peace to a ‘malleable and pliant mass’, while Soviet Foreign Minister Viacheslav Molotov spoke of it being in ‘a liquid state’.¹ There was nothing<br>

The sacred. ‘Not religion or its opposite, atheistic negation, but the experience that beliefs both shelter and exploit, at the crossroads of sexuality and thought, body and meaning, which women feel intensely but without being preoccupied by it and about which there remains much for them – for us – to say.’¹ Being quite preoccupied with the rather elusive notion of the sacred, the preceding words by Julia Kristeva always make me smile.

  Book Title: Echoes of the Tambaran-Masculinity, history and the subject in the work of Donald F. Tuzin<br>
  Publisher: ANU E Press<br>
  Author(s): Roscoe Paul<br>
  Abstract: In the Sepik Basin of Papua New Guinea, ritual culture was dominated by the Tambaran —a male tutelary spirit that acted as a social and intellectual guardian or patron to those under its aegis as they made their way through life. To Melanesian scholarship, the cultural and psychological anthropologist, Donald F. Tuzin, was something of a Tambaran, a figure whose brilliant and fine-grained ethnographic project in the Arapesh village of Ilahita was immensely influential within and beyond New Guinea anthropology. Tuzin died in 2007, at the age of 61. In his memory, the editors of this collection commissioned a set of original and thought provoking essays from eminent and accomplished anthropologists who knew and were influenced by his work. They are echoes of the Tambaran. The anthology begins with a biographical sketch of Tuzin's life and scholarship. It is divided into four sections, each of which focuses loosely around one of his preoccupations. The first concerns warfare history, the male cult and changing masculinity, all in Melanesia. The second addresses the relationship between actor and structure. Here, the ethnographic focus momentarily shifts to the Caribbean before turning back to Papua New Guinea in essays that examine uncanny phenomena, narratives about childhood and messianic promises. The third part goes on to offer comparative and psychoanalytic perspectives on the subject in Fiji, Bali, the Amazon as well as Melanesia. Appropriately, the last section concludes with essays on Tuzin's fieldwork style and his distinctive authorial voice.<br>

  Abstract: Some things only become clear with hindsight. This goes for my own fieldwork in the Sepik area (between 1972 and 1983), and it is probably true of other anthropologists as well, many of whom, as I gather from their writings, went through the same difficulties as I did. When I set out for Papua New Guinea, I took with me a pre-postmodern conception of ʹcultureʹ, fuelled by the fascination for other, preferably still ʹautochthonousʹ world views and agency in faraway societies. This predisposition often made it difficult to grasp what appeared to me in my understanding of ʹcultureʹ as seemingly<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284vhr">Postmodernism and Cultural Identities</a><br>
  Abstract: Already in several of my writings¹ I have pointed out that the only reasonable way in which we can understand romanticism is a 
                  dynamic one, that is, romanticism as a succession of waves. Romanticism per se, seen strictly and narrowly, was a brief, explosive, and unstable movement. However, its subsequent impact has been nothing short of<br>

  Abstract: I have two sons. The older of my boys, now age four, enjoys building elaborate sets with his wooden train tracks. The younger of my boys, now age one, enjoys “playing” with his older brother by tearing apart the train set as it is being built. The four-year-old is understandably upset, and some sort of physical behavior is displayed to retrieve the tracks from his younger brother. What is a parent to do in this situation?

  Abstract: In a recent book opening on to many of the issues this one will examine, Stephen Halliwell invokes the shade of Goethe, in particular his essay “Über Wahrheit und Wahrscheinlichkeit der Kunstwerke,” as the propylaia for his reexamination of the concept of mimesis.¹ In setting up this propylaia Halliwell follows Goethe, who draws our mind from a simplistic view of mimetic art as “sheer illusionism—like the famous birds reputedly tricked into pecking at Zeuxis’ painted grapes” to the mimetic as having “the psychological power to draw its audience into its world, to offer something that is wholly convincing and<br>

  Abstract: This section will lay out the place of the 
                  Poetics in criticism and show the filiation of poetry to natural living things on one side and tools on the other. That double analogy shows that constructing poetry is like constructing constitutions, and so criticism of poetry, like criticism of constitutions, will depend upon a correct understanding of final causality in a thing that is not simply a made thing of human choice, but one that also arises out of nature and so is inescapable: that mimeses and constitutions exist is natural, given man’s existence; how they exist is made—but<br>

  Abstract: Before we know, we desire to know. How can this be? And what a strange desire!—what a strange animal! Before we are happy, and before we know what happiness is, we desire to be happy. But there is a natural pleasure in mimesis, and through mimesis we first learn. One of the first things that happens through mimesis is that we enjoy a pleasure not associated with or caused by the ordinary animal appetites: the pleasure of mimesis. And being naturally mimetic, we enjoy this often. Out of this process the arts first grew, but this natural process is<br>

  II  The Humanistic Disciplines from:

  Abstract: We shall now describe the humanistic disciplines, beginning with language. “If language is the essential thing that makes us human beings, linguistics ought to be considered, to an eminent degree, as a science of man, and, therefore, as a humanistic discipline, perhaps the most genuine of them all.”¹ These words by the Swedish linguist Bertil Malmberg present a thesis, but his defensive tone (“ought to be considered”) indicates that the idea is not universally shared. Linguistics is indeed a humanistic discipline, but not all branches of linguistics use the humanistic discourse. On the basis of the distinction between the nucleus<br>

                  Life is a Dream and in a less direct and comprehensive way Don Quijote. In the preceding chapter I have pointed out several things we can do with the humanities, but what we do with them must be founded on their objective value, that is, on what they can do with us. And what they can do, when cultivated as “rigorous knowledge” (Husserl’s idea as alpha and omega) is enlighten us about the<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284x9r">Resilience and the virtue of fortitude</a><br>
  Abstract: Although suffering and challenge demoralize some human beings, others cope and construct instead. Rather than grinding to a halt, certain people hurdle the obstacles or creatively maneuver around them. They even make something positive out of the negative situation. In the face of crisis, they not only survive but also thrive. Resilience capacities involve coping well with difficulty, actively resisting destructive pressures, and rebuilding positively after adversity. However, people do not exercise these capacities in equal measure. Human beings faced with similar situations end up in diverse spots. Some manage destructive life events more efficaciously. Others lose a sense of<br>

  5  Constructive Resilience and Aquinas’ Virtues of Initiative from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284x9r">Resilience and the virtue of fortitude</a><br>
  Abstract: Hope and foresight are vital for constructive resilience. Through individual and communal resilience resources, we muster hope, confidence, and generosity toward initiatives that have a twofold effect. Not only do they promote personal flourishing, they also promote community. Constructive resilience entails rebuilding in the wake of disasters. It empowers us to face the challenges present in worthwhile but difficult projects, enabling us to build something positive out of destructive events. The concept of constructive resilience can help to deepen our understanding of Aquinas’ treatment of initiative. For Aquinas, besides what is specific to the virtues of courage and patience, there<br>

  6  Resistant Resilience and Aquinas’ Virtues of Endurance from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284x9r">Resilience and the virtue of fortitude</a><br>
  Abstract: Fortitude fails if we only intermittently stand firm to fearful things and take initiatives to accomplish our goals. In order to resist the destructive effects of adversity, rather, we need to endure with consistency and master the emotions and dispositions that give us staying power. We must endure the difficulty, hold firm in the good, resist self-destruction, and persist until we accomplish our goal. Thomas identifies two movements and distinct virtues here: patience and perseverance.¹ These virtues are key elements in his virtue theory and in understanding moral and spiritual resiliency and vulnerability.<br>

  10  Conclusions: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284x9r">Resilience and the virtue of fortitude</a><br>
  Abstract: The existential bridge that allows us to relate the psychosocial sciences and St. Thomas’s virtue theory is not only the reality of difficulty, but also the resourcefulness needed to overcome it, that is, the individual and social capacities to cope with difficulty, to resist destruction under hardship, and to construct something positive out of an otherwise negative situation. Both the virtue of fortitude (with its associated virtues of initiative and endurance) and resilience (as concept, phenomenon, and practice) relate to difficulty. Both fortitude and resilience contribute to a fundamentally positive perspective that counters an excessive focus on brokenness, vice, and<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 90 of Hopscotch, Oliveira says, “But everything was fissionable and would immediately allow an opposite interpretation” (417). Later he says of Morelli that toward the end of his career “he could write only with effort, examining at every turn a possible opposite, the hidden fallacy … suspicious that every clear idea was inevitably a mistake or half-truth, mistrusting the words …” (440). If in the second quotation we substitute “understand” for “write,” we have two descriptions of the problem at the heart of Kafka’s fiction: the seeming interminability of interpretation.

  Abstract: Now we can attempt a deeper account for all the engine idling in and around twentieth-century novels. As in the introductory chapter, we will turn to Paradise Lost, its conclusion in particular, for an allegorical explanation. Of those things that Adam and Eve come to know sharply only by their loss, the most important is God’s presence. Prelapsarian Adam and Eve know God in his ever-presence, as a thing always already there, before they were there (before they were Dasein), and thus as a feature of their there-being as they had ever known it. After the Fall, they will come<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284zh3">Person, Being, and History</a><br>
  Author(s) Burbidge John W.<br>
  Abstract: There is something beguiling about Anselm’s argument for the existence of God. By combining a negation with a comparison, it creates a definition that is both subtle and ambiguous. By telling us more about what God is not than about what he is, it bears a whiff of Eastern negative theology. And the delicate relationship between thought and existence, between concept and reality, carries within it the ongoing puzzle about how our (very human) reflections and theoretical constructions could possibly lead us to conclusions about what the world is really like, beyond all appearances.<br>

  Abstract: There are some men who seem venerable even in their youth, and Ken Schmitz was one of them. When I was young and he was already venerable, a function of wisdom, not of age, we met mainly at meetings. He moved often on the academic checkerboard, although many will perhaps imagine that he was in Toronto throughout his career. Not so.

  Author(s) Lampert Jay<br>
  Abstract: Some modern and postmodern philosophers favor violence as a means of outflanking authoritarian forms of peace and philosophy, and find promising concepts of violence in the great philosophers, above all in Hegel. This motivation is not altogether incorrect, but perhaps there are other ways besides violence to slip out of classical constraints. Kenneth Schmitz’s philosophy of freedom is, among other things, a move away from modern violence philosophies. Yet with all his classical philosophical commitments, Schmitz is as modern a philosopher as there is, particularly regarding the modern proof of unconditioned freedom. For these reasons, his work is not only<br>

  Author(s) Dougherty Jude P.<br>
  Abstract: Cultural historians necessarily deal in broad generalizations. Whatever is affirmed of a period, a people, or a nation, no matter how well-grounded by factual study and reflection, is subject to qualification. Exceptions to broad characterizations may always be found without mitigating the value of the broader insight. We grasp something when an author refers to the Greeks, to Roman civilization, to the Hellenic period, to Christendom, to the Benedictines, to the Renaissance, or to the Enlightenment. These designations, all generalizations formed by an examination of a host of particulars, indeed refer to something intelligible, something quite apart from the mind.¹<br>

  Author(s) Dahlstrom Daniel O.<br>
  Abstract: One of Kenneth Schmitz’s major and undoubtedly lasting accomplishments is his demonstration of the distinctive contribution made by Karol Wojtyla to philosophy. In Schmitz’s masterful expositions, Wojtyla’s philosophical project comes alive as an effort to understand action phenomenologically and realistically, as something that proceeds from and reveals, not consciousness, but the whole person “as a being among other beings.”¹ In this connection, among other things, Schmitz corrects a common misunderstanding of the extent of Wojtyla’s philosophical debt to Scheler’s thought. To be sure, Wojtyla plainly acknowledges the importance to him of both Scheler’s critique of Kant’s ethics and its basis<br>

  Abstract: The past forty years have seen nothing short of a revolution in the study of St. Gregory of Nazianzus. Long honored with the title “the Theologian,” conferred by the Council of Chalcedon in 451, Gregory is now widely recognized as the veritable architect of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, a source of great importance for the historiography of late antique and early medieval Christianity, a reservoir of information about classical antiquity, and a major theologian and literary figure in his own right.

If we respond negatively to the first question, then we find ourselves unable to explain why it is that the resilient longing suggested by the second question is so unwilling to fade away. On the other hand, if we reply positively to the first question, then human existence finds itself thrust into an open-ended, dramatic dialogue with the giver of that assurance, that is, someone who is adamantly opposed to closing<br>

  Abstract: Roman congregations, using every device at hand, aimed at forging something more than irreproachable ministers of God well adapted to Trent’s severe discipline and ready for their ordained labors. Churchmen, in the early modern age, were also to be the blood and sinews of temporal governance; in Rome, it was they who held power and went out to far places to represent the state.

  Abstract: It is a commonplace among students of St. Thomas Aquinas that in his view a judgment does not come to rest in its truth until it reaches the thing being judged about. For him the judgment in its fundamental nature is not simply a union of subject and predicate, but is rather the surge of the mind itself towards rest in the being of things 
                  (esse rerum). The judgment terminates not in a mental construction but in the thing itself (ad rem). This has led many Thomists to salute the judgment as the cash value of knowledge. Usually our attention<br>

Is it not surprising, then, that we have had to wait until the twentieth century to hear of philosophies that bear the name “personalism”? Emmanuel Mounier suggests that the neo-Kantian idealist Charles-Bernard Renouvier first used the term to describe his own philosophy in 1903,¹ before it was rescued from idealism for Catholic thinkers by Max Scheler.² No doubt, the thing, the reality—<br>

  Chapter 6  ENRICHING THE COPULA from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853wm">The Texture of Being</a><br>
  Abstract: It is a commonplace among students of St. Thomas Aquinas that in his view a judgment does not come to rest in its truth until it reaches the thing being judged about. For him the judgment in its fundamental nature is not simply a union of subject and predicate, but is rather the surge of the mind itself towards rest in the being of things 
                  (esse rerum). The judgment terminates not in a mental construction but in the thing itself (ad rem). This has led many Thomists to salute the judgment as the cash value of knowledge. Usually our attention<br>

  Chapter 8  THE SOLIDARITY OF PERSONALISM AND THE METAPHYSICS OF EXISTENTIAL ACT from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853wm">The Texture of Being</a><br>
  Abstract: There have been human persons since Adam delved and Eve span. And the word 
                  persona, prosopon—thickened and deepened by the revelation of the God-man Jesus Christ—has been with us since the great Councils of the Church. Is it not surprising, then, that we have had to wait until the twentieth century to hear of philosophies that bear the name “personalism”? Emmanuel Mounier suggests that the neo-Kantian idealist Charles-Bernard Renouvier first used the term to describe his own philosophy in 1903,¹ before it was rescued from idealism for Catholic thinkers by Max Scheler.² No doubt, the thing, the reality—<br>

  Abstract: Near the beginning of the 
                  Summa theologiae St. Thomas Aquinas presents the well-known “five ways.”¹ The quinque viae make up a single proof of the existence of God by way of five approaches: from motion concluding to the First Mover; from causative action concluding to the First Cause or Source; from contingent beings to Something that is absolutely necessary; from degrees of actual perfections in things to the Original Source of their existence and goodness; and, finally, from the regularity of processes in the world to a Creative Intelligence that implants tendencies towards order in things.

  Abstract: In keeping with the theme of 
                  Fides et ratio, I am impelled to complete the subtitle: “New Ontological Perspectives Coming from Philosophy,” with the following: “Coming from Philosophy in its Encounter with the Proposals of Faith.” For the strict substance of the argument in the encyclical insists that nothing truly and profoundly new—it speaks of the “radicality and newness of being”—will come to philosophy except through its encounter with faith. On the contrary, it insists that reason acting as though independent from, indifferent to, or hostile to faith is not stimulated to seek ad novitatem et radicalitatem ipsius<br>

  CHAPTER TWO  Proustian Jokes from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2854m6">Mirages and Mad Beliefs</a><br>
  Abstract: Most of the mad beliefs in Proust’s novel are droll as well as crazy, and have their place in what is often and rightly said of
                  À la recherche du temps perdu, that, among so many other things, it is also a great comic novel (“an unwearying tribute to the muse of comedy”).¹ The tribute assumes many guises and operates in multiple registers, testimony to Proust’s superabundant comic energy and abidingly gleeful attention to the multiplicities of the human comedy itself, although we might hesitate before laying the emaciated hand of taxonomy on its diverse generic manifestations (mimicry, pastiche, parody,<br>

  Abstract: In dramatizing a frozen imagination and a sterilized world, Baudelaire’s rocklike formations crush the life from any belief in the spellbinding or “reenchanting” capabilities of lyric. Subjectivity turned to stone has also been linked (most notably in the wake of Benjamin’s reflections on Baudelaire) to another distinction—that between symbol and allegory in the aesthetics of poetic representation. In Baudelaire the petrified order of things signifies the death of the “symbol,” understood as the quasi-animistic, “living,” and embodying force of analogy and
                  correspondances, and a fall back into the disjunctive, broken sphere of the allegorical, where matter is but the<br>

  Abstract: Martin and Turner (1986, p. 141) defined grounded theory as an ʹinductive theory discovery methodology that allows the researcher to develop a theoretical account of the general features of the topic while simultaneously grounding the account in empirical observations of data.ʹ¹ In grounded theory everything is integrated; it is an extensive and systematic general methodology (independent of research paradigm) where actions and concepts can be interrelated with other actions and concepts – in grounded theory nothing happens in a vacuum (Glaser, 1978; Glaser and Strauss, 1967).<br>

  Abstract: Islam today, it would seem, has become inflexible and intolerant towards the teachings and ideologies of the West. When in fact, its history shows that it has always been accommodating to other peoples and beliefs, especially Christianity and Judaism. Most people know something of Islam. For instance, that it is one of the three monotheisms or the Abrahamic faiths and that it has much in common with Christianity and Judaism. Yet, there is so much that we do not understand about Islam and its overall world view. Islam is centred on the notion of peace, justice and community, yet when<br>

  Author(s) TAYLOR CHARLES<br>
  Abstract: Any view about the long-term history of religion turns on an interpretation of the Axial Age. What was the nature of the Axial revolution? This is sometimes spoken of the coming to be of a new tension “between the transcendental and mundane orders,” involving a new conception of the “transcendental.¹ But “transcendental” has more than one meaning. It can designate something like a “going beyond” the human world or the cosmos (1). But it also can mean the discovery or invention of a new standpoint from which the existing order in the cosmos or society can be criticized or denounced<br>

  Abstract: I am interested in a relatively simple question: Where are Axial commitments located socially, or to put it another way, what does it mean to say that something is an “Axial civilization,” especially for latecomers to global modernity in places like Africa, who sometimes receive pieces of the Axial in disconnected chunks? I have been fascinated by Shmuel Eisenstadt’s argument in
                  Japanese Civilization(1996) that Japan could embrace Axial elements while keeping an archaic core. Despite absorbing many aspects of two great Axial traditions—Buddhist philosophical sophistication and Confucian techniques of governance—Japan remained fundamentally pre-Axial.

  Author(s) ASSMANN JAN<br>
  Abstract: The theory of the Axial Age is the creation of philosophers and sociologists, not of historians and philologists on whose research the theory is based. It is the answer to the question for the roots of modernity. When and where did the modern world begin as we know and inhabit it? The historian investigates the past for the sake of the past. The quest for the roots of modernity, however, is not interested in the past as such but only as the beginning of something held to be characteristic of the present. These are two categorically different approaches that must<br>

I cannot avoid the question, but for practical purposes I will use the term, because for the philosophical and sociological traditions upon which this book draws, the idea of religion has been central.

Nevertheless, as S. S.

In the wake of the destruction, the United States seemingly entered a new era marked by radical changes in the nation's discourse and in the policies of the Bush administration. With the toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the invasion of Iraq, and saber rattling elsewhere, America's global war on terror began to take shape. Lofty rhetoric about expanding democracy and defending freedom filled the halls of elite power and dominated mainstream media coverage of American politics. Blood in the Sand offers both an incisive analysis and a confrontational critique of America's recent international pursuits and its dominant political culture. Stephen Eric Bronner challenges the notion that everything changed in the aftermath of 9/11. He shows instead how a criminal act served to legitimize political manipulation and invigorate traditional nationalistic enthusiasms for militarism and imperial expansion. Employing his own experiences in the Middle East, Bronner acknowledges -- but refuses to overstate -- recent progressive developments in the region. He criticizes the neo-conservative penchant for unilateral military aggression and debunks the dubious notion of fostering democracy at gunpoint. While Bronner analyzes authoritarian repression, human rights violations, shrinking civil liberties, and severe socioeconomic inequalities, Blood in the Sand is neither a narrow political diatribe nor a futile exercise in anti-American negativism. The author honors America by condemning the betrayal of the nation's finest ideals by so many of those who, hypocritically or naively, invoke those ideals the most. Bronner sheds new light on those who insist on publicly waving the flag while privately subverting that for which it stands. Blood in the Sand sounds a clarion call for revitalizing the American polity and reshaping foreign policy along democratic lines. Committed to a political renewal, Bronner urges the American people to recall what is best about their national heritage and the genuine beacon of hope it might offer other countries and other cultures.<br>

  Introduction: from:

  Abstract: In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, the day on which the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington were attacked by Islamic terrorists, commentators from virtually every media outlet concurred in the belief that “everything has changed.” Few doubted that this event had ripped the fabric of history. Many suggested that the post–September 11 world would prove less innocent, more serious, and more reflective and that significant changes would mark the economic, political, and cultural life of the United States. Insofar as 9/11 created the belief that America was vulnerable to outside attack, that<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jcf9d">Blood in the Sand</a><br>
  Abstract: Upon first seeing the image of Gandhi, I received an early taste of racism, Eurocentrism, and cheap cynicism. I remember the cartoon of the mahatma, the great soul, from when I was a child. The Disney Corporation used to depict him as a grotesque, spindly creature with huge glasses and a loincloth looking something like a light brown octopus. Only later, when I entered my teenage years, did I read the short biography
                  Gandhi: His Life and Message for the World(1954) by Louis Fischer, which gave me a sense of his true stature: the beatings he withstood, the imprisonments<br>

  Author(s) Hada Ken<br>
  Abstract: A common perception associated with the classic western suggests characters welded to their notions of right judgment, characters who will not deviate from their code of honor, regardless of consequences. The honor implied in such deliberate devotion to duty is characteristically celebrated, at least on the surface, in the acts and speeches of typical heroes. It follows that the unyielding posture of the hero suggests a certain understanding of ethics. A strong hero is committed to his course of action because he sees the necessity to choose in a particular way, as the right thing to do, regardless of public<br>

  Abstract: It is a commonplace of contemporary film criticism that Native Americans have historically been ill served by the American western, a genre in which they have been misrepresented and demeaned.¹ For those who regard an honest and impartial portrayal of historically oppressed minorities as a moral if not an aesthetic imperative, the American western will offer little in the way of spiritual uplift. But if the American western fails to offer an objective ethnological depiction of indigenous peoples (assuming that such a thing were both possible and desirable), it nonetheless invites a philosophic consideration of the problematics of alterity, an<br>

  Author(s) Sanders Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: To all appearances,
                     Invasion of the Body Snatchers(Don Siegel, 1956) is a paean to individuality and a warning of its imminent loss. Human-size pods appear in the California town of Santa Mira and begin duplicating the bodies of the residents, absorbing their minds while they sleep. Rushing into action with his growing realization that Santa Mira is being taken over by the pods, Dr. Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) shows a resilient defiance in his perseverance against all odds. Evidently, we are meant to understand what it means to believe in something and fight for a cause.<br>

  Abstract: Thomas Anderson, computer programmer and hacker, learns that everything he thought he knew about the world and his life is false, that he’s been deceived. Further, he discovers that he and most of his fellow human beings are enslaved in a way that he never could have imagined and that he is the chosen One, the savior who will lead them out of the slavery of ignorance and to enlightenment and understanding.

The humans consider the androids, which they callreplicants,to be nothing more than multifaceted machines. Created on an assembly line by the Tyrell Corporation’s genetic engineers, they are organisms manufactured to serve as slave labor for exploring and colonizing other planets.

  Introduction from:

  Author(s) Larmour Peter<br>
  Abstract: Common property has often been regarded as an obstacle to development and best—or inevitably—replaced by private or state ownership. However, there are now many well-documented examples of successful management of open-access resources, and experiments in ‘co-management’ by users, owners, and government officials. The idea that the government should intervene to remedy the defects of common property, perhaps by registration, is now contested by a celebration of indigenous systems of self-management (Bromley 1989, Bromley and Cernea 1989). Government intervention may sometimes make things worse. Common property claims are also part of indigenous peoples’ defence and reaffirmation of political sovereignty.<br>

I think I was probably born with this love, but I was also fortunate to come of age in the late 1950s and 1960s, when science permeated the cultural atmosphere around me. The United States was then engaged in a great romance with science, and there was a rich and steady flow of scientific writing to stimulate my passion for learning about the natural world.

  Abstract: I have written well over a hundred poems that are to one degree or another after works of art—usually paintings. When I was asked recently about the attraction of such a topic, it occurred to me that the attraction lies in part in the fact that those works are finished things: whether or not they sport actual frames, they are all in some sense framed. Another way of saying this is that they are the polar opposite of the chaotic; and for reasons in part instinctive and in part educational, I do love the manifestly coherent—a brick wall<br>

  Abstract: These twelve essays have several things in common. For one, they are eminently original. The authors have plumbed their inimitable subjectivities in ways that make them accessible to the reader. This volume is a case of the multiplication of the loaves or, to mix metaphors, an instance of what can be produced when a haunting is moved by a hunting that can locate its catch with words. I read these authors through a theological lens and do so unapologetically. So I see their haunted hunting representing twelve unique cuts into the catholicity of the mind and its fecundity when it<br>

  Book Title: Christianity in Evolution-An Exploration<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): MAHONEY JACK<br>
  Abstract: Evolution has provided a new understanding of reality, with revolutionary consequences for Christianity. In an evolutionary perspective the incarnation involved God entering the evolving human species to help it imitate the trinitarian altruism in whose image it was created and counter its tendency to self-absorption. Primarily, however, the evolutionary achievement of Jesus was to confront and overcome death in an act of cosmic significance, ushering humanity into the culminating stage of its evolutionary destiny, the full sharing of God's inner life. Previously such doctrines as original sin, the fall, sacrifice, and atonement stemmed from viewing death as the penalty for sin and are shown not only to have serious difficulties in themselves, but also to emerge from a Jewish culture preoccupied with sin and sacrifice that could not otherwise account for death. The death of Jesus on the cross is now seen as saving humanity, not from sin, but from individual extinction and meaninglessness. Death is now seen as a normal process that affect all living things and the religious doctrines connected with explaining it in humans are no longer required or justified. Similar evolutionary implications are explored affecting other subjects of Christian belief, including the Church, the Eucharist, priesthood, and moral behavior.<br>

There is, of course, an angle of vision which completely shuts out the former for fear that to take note of anything positive about Stalin is to extenuate his unpardonable sins and mistakes. But for a historian of my background and generation it is difficult, if not impossible, to take such a narrow field of view and equate Stalin with Hitler, to see them as identical twins. Historians are themselves “products of their society<br>

  8.  A Secular Age? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tv6pd">Being in the World</a><br>
  Abstract: At least in the Western context, our age is commonly referred to as that of “modernity”—a term sometimes qualified as “late modernity” or “post-modernity.” Taken by itself, the term is nondescript; in its literal sense, it simply means a time of novelty or innovation. Hence, something needs to be added to capture the kind of novelty involved. To pinpoint this innovation, modernity is also referred to as the “age of reason” or the age of enlightenment and science—in order to demarcate the period from a prior age presumably characterized by unreason, metaphysical speculation, and intellectual obscurantism or darkness.<br>

  Abstract: The first thing I thought about when I drove up to the modest two-story, red brick building on Chapel Hill Road in Durham, North Carolina, was Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak’s comment when he visited the equally unimposing headquarters of the Al Jazeera network in Doha, Qatar. “All this noise from this matchbox?”¹ It’s an easy-to-miss building just southwest of the renovated and gentrified tobacco warehouses of downtown Durham and due south of the gothic magnificence of the Duke University campus.

  THREE  The Artist as Visionary and as “Craftsman”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tvc5d">Faulkner</a><br>
  Abstract: The yearning for pagan sensuality shyly announcing itself in the context of Hawthorne’s Puritan culture emerges with Walter Pater and young Faulkner’s literary idol, Swinburne, as a dominant cultural force. Sensuous fauns and naked Pans side by side with attractive female and male bodies in emancipatory bathing scenes are among the chief inspirations of the international art nouveau movement.¹ It is, therefore, not surprising that fauns constitute a major motif in Aubrey Beardsley’s art nouveau drawings, whose impact is visible in Faulkner’s

  FIVE  New Modes of Metaphor: from:

  Abstract: In chapters 3 and 4, images of the artist have confirmed the profound affinity between masks and metaphors suggested by the introductory chapters on role-playing in photographs, letters, and interviews and also posited by the theoretical chapter. The analogy between the role-playing artist and the reader, who participates in the metaphorizing process, lies in the fact that both engage in an act of the imagination whose object is nothing less than to negotiate the tension between identity and difference.<br>

  Abstract: Please pardon the repetition if you who have heard this anecdote before, but I cannot indeed forbear. When in 1958 I was at the point of concluding my graduate course work in the English department at Ole Miss and began to consider a dissertation subject, my thoughts turned quite naturally to William Faulkner.

  Abstract: “I am,” Charles Johnson states, “first and foremost, a writer of philosophical fiction” (McWilliams, “An Interview” 275). This marriage of the art of fiction and the traditions of philosophy stands behind everything Johnson writes, from his novels to his short stories to his essays (both literary and philosophical—they are one and the same to Johnson) to his book reviews. Johnson’s wide-ranging education and background have provided him with a formidable training in these disciplines: raised in the AME Church with a substantial background in Christianity and the Bible, he is also a formal student of western philosophy, holding a<br>

  Abstract: Beryl Smalley in her landmark book, 
                  The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages, sought to show, among other things, that not all of those who commented on the Bible in the Middle Ages were, in her words, theologians. Some were also scholars.¹ The mark of the scholar was an interest in the literal sense apart from and in contrast to the Middle Ages’ seeming fixation on the spiritual or mystical senses of Scripture. In particular, Smalley was interested in those scholars whose work was a kind of anticipation of modern biblical scholarship, especially of an historical critical flavor.<br>

  Author(s) Marshall Bruce D.<br>
  Abstract: From the West as well as the East, among Roman Catholics as well as Protestants, Christian theologians now regularly suggest that western theology suffers from a “pneumatological deficit.” The Western theological tradition accounts for the temporal actions of the triune God, so these critics worry, without giving the Holy Spirit anything to do. In contrast to the Father and especially the Son, the Spirit has no action of his own, and no property, effect, or relationship to us that is unique to him. As a result, the Spirit himself tends to vanish.¹ Where we should expect traditional theology to speak<br>

  Abstract: Where 
                  did Thomas Aquinas put his ecclesiology? Theologians today generally accept the claim that Thomas has no “ecclesiology” as we would understand that term, by which I mean that he never takes up the Church as a distinct locus for comprehensive theological discussion.¹ Did the famously absent-minded saint simply misplace it? One searches the Summa theologiae in vain for a treatise de ecclesiae.² The situation seems even less promising in his Commentary on the Gospel of St. John, where the commentary genre itself does not tend to the systematic treatment of anything. Yet this does not mean that Thomas’s commentary<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapter considered Lonergan’s understanding of the cosmos as a self-transcending, hierarchical order governed by emergent probability. Human beings are part of this cosmos. We have emerged from the creative world process of emergent probability. As a relatively late, higher-level emergence, humanity is a complex entity subject to both classical and statistical laws on multiple levels of being: physical, chemical, biological, and more uniquely human levels. With the advent of humanity two significant new things arrive in creation: (1) a creature’s ability to discover and work with classical and statistical laws, and thus to guide and accelerate emergent probability,<br>

  Abstract: Everyday life can be problematic. Whether simple or difficult, the challenges we face raise questions. At some point our questioning of life leads to what Lonergan calls “ultimate questions.” Such questions seek insight into the meaning of life, the reason things are the way they are, whether things can improve, and how improvements might be made. Those who pursue such questions with rigor eventually seek insight into the ultimate origin and end of existence. Put in traditional Christian terms, life leads us to questions about the universe, about God, and about God’s relation to the universe as its creator and<br>

  Abstract: The theme of tradition, the handing on of something to be both treasured and handed on again, harbors within it the apparently counter theme of betrayal. All traditions are vulnerable to betrayal for, in the very process of handing on, the original gift may be distorted or even lost. Different traditions no doubt develop different strategies for minimizing the element of betrayal, often centering on the authority to interpret, but these strategies themselves bear witness to the impossibility of reducing the risk of betrayal to zero. Yet the theme of betrayal remains itself ambiguous, for while the guardians or recipients<br>

  Abstract: “Religion” may—or may not—be here to stay. As a “concept” (but which or whose exactly?), from one perspective it might seem to be losing its received reference (the transcendent, the world beyond, and the life hereafter) and its shared relevance (a unified view of the cosmos and all beings in it; a doctrine of the origin, purpose and end of all things; an alert, enlightened or redeemed sense of self; a practice and way of life), if it had<br>

  Abstract: Modernity and the scatter of terms related to it are agreed to be slippery words. They are hardly ever used neutrally, just to describe what happens to be the cultural position at the present moment. They may be used in both positive and negative ways: “modernization” is assumed unthinkingly to be a good thing; “modernism” is a bad thing in the vocabulary of traditional Catholic thought; “modernity” is now commonly used for a cluster of cultural and intellectual habits generated (broadly) by the European Enlightenment and supposedly transcended by the advent of a “postmodern” era.

  Abstract: As a member of the research group MéOS¹ – studying medications as social objects – I am interested in the question of what medications do to people.² The simplest way to discuss this is to speak of effect: medications are used to enhance, cure, pleasure, and stabilize bodies in need of change. As I will argue, however, effect is highly context-dependent and goes beyond the purely molecular level of the individual body. The relevance of this realm of beyond is the central point of this essay and is something I call embodied molecules. The idea of exploring effect more carefully was triggered<br>

  Abstract: Tragedies often confront us in our daily lives. This is a staple of the human experience or condition, and learning from them is what allows us to come up with theories and rules of life. Perhaps the most philosophical attitude we can take to these trials and tribulations appears in aphorisms such as “What doesn’t kill me strengthens me” and “What evil there is must be for some greater good” – sayings that depict our resignation to the unchanging nature of some things in life and our need to somehow manage.

  Abstract: When I think about the politics of speech and writing, I return again and again to the final scene in Akira Kurosawa’s movie
                  Ran, or “chaos,” which contemplates, among many other things, the fragmentation of social life in postmodernity. Kurosawa shows us a man in the fading light, bent forward on his staff at the edge of an enormous cliff. This man, really a boy, cannot see that the sun is going down because he can no longer see anything, having lost his eyes in a dynastic struggle that left most of his family dead.

  Abstract: In spite of the difference between English and continental philosophy, there is a link between Michel Foucault and writers like Jonathan Swift, as there was between Nietzsche and Paul Rée: “The first impulse to publish something of my hypotheses concerning the

  Abstract: The natural sciences allow us to attain relatively certain understanding of, and predictive control and manipulative power over, natural processes — or so it is widely assumed. This view holds, assuredly among scientists, even in the face of postmodernism and the social constructionism of science. Many believe that the natural sciences may, and perhaps should, serve as a model for any attempt at comparable human sciences. Indeed, at the time of the Enlightenment it was widely held that nothing seriously stood in the way of the extension of scientific method to human matters, although there was disagreement over how to carry<br>

  VII  Hermeneutics in Dialogue from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bfxq">Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Abstract: If anything is universal in philosophical hermeneutics, it is probably the recognition of one’s own finitude, the consciousness that actual speech does not suffice to exhaust the inner conversation that impels us toward understanding. Gadamer ties the universality of the hermeneutic process to the fact that understanding depends on this ongoing conversation: “That a conversation occurs, no matter when or where or with whom, wherever something comes to language, whether this is another person, a thing, a word, a flame (Gottfried Benn)—this is what constitutes the universality of hermeneutic experience.”¹ Only in conversation, only in confrontation with another’s thought<br>

  Afterword from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bfxq">Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Abstract: The argument between Derrida and Gadamer has made at least one thing clear: the charge brought against the universal search for truth and understanding is universal perspectivism, as Nietzsche inscribed it in philosophical consciousness. What is the point of striving for understanding, when everything is perspectival and historically conditioned? Often Gadamer has himself been viewed as the spokesman for historical relativism, since he had written that we do not understand better, but only differently. What would it mean to talk about the universality of understanding differently? Ultimately, does it not destroy the whole notion of truth?<br>

  Author(s) NEWMAN BARNETT<br>
  Abstract: The Kwakiutl artist painting on a hide did not concern himself with the inconsequentials that made up the opulent social rivalries of the Northwest Coast Indian scene; nor did he, in the name of a higher purity, renounce the living world for the meaningless materialism of design. The abstract shape he used, his entire plastic language, was directed by a ritualistic will toward metaphysical understanding. The everyday realities he left to the toymakers; the pleasant play of nonobjective pattern, to the women basket weavers. To him a shape was a living thing, a vehicle for an abstract thought-complex, a carrier<br>

  Author(s) PUTZEL HOWARD<br>
  Abstract: Classification is extraneous to art. Most labels attached to painting are unenlightening. Talent’s the thing. “Isms” are literature. Nevertheless, a large part of the public that looks at contemporary painting demands classification. Possibly classification leads to clarification. The word Cubism, though inaccurate, is apt. I hope that some art critic, museum official or someone will find as pertinent a first syllable which may be applied to the new “ism.”<br>

  Abstract: The tragic news of Pollock’s death two summers ago was profoundly depressing to many of us. We felt not only a sadness over the death of a great figure, but also a deep loss, as if something of ourselves had died too. We were a piece of him: he was, perhaps, the embodiment of our ambition for absolute liberation and a secretly cherished wish to overturn old tables of crockery and flat champagne. We saw in his example the possibility of an astounding freshness, a sort of ecstatic blindness.<br>

  Abstract: What makes any definition of a movement in art dubious is that it never fits the deepest artists in the movement—certainly not as well as, if successful, it does the others. Yet without the definition something essential in those best is bound to be missed. The attempt to define is like a game in which you cannot possibly reach the goal from the starting point but can only close in on it by picking up each time from where the last play landed.<br>

  Author(s) ALLOWAY LAWRENCE<br>
  Abstract: A problem that reciprocally involved both subject matter and formality engaged the Abstract Expressionist painters of the middle and late forties. It was how to make paintings that would be powerful signifiers, and this led to decisions as to what signifiers could be properly referred to without compromising (too much) the flatness of the picture plane. The desire for a momentous content was constricted by the spatial requirement of flatness and by the historically influenced need to avoid direct citation of objects. Something of this train of thought can be seen in Barnett Newman’s reflections on the role of the<br>

  Abstract: We are forty years away from Abstract Expressionism, and the question of how we should understand our relationship to the movement starts to be interesting again. Awe at its triumphs is long gone; but so is laughter at its cheap philosophy, or distaste for its heavy breathing, or boredom with its sublimity, or even resentment at the part it played in the Cold War. Not that any of those feelings has dissipated, or ever should, but that it begins to be clear that none of them—not even the sum of them—amounts to an attitude to the painting in<br>

  Abstract: Consider, for just one moment Jackson Pollock’s 
                  Cut-Out of 1948–1950. Don’t flip to look at a reproduction. Instead, and perhaps more appropriately, conjure it in your mind. For though Pollock’s Cut-Out is a painting, it is a work from which the center, the figure, has quite literally been excised, extinguished, a work with nothing more at its core than a ghostly trace, figuration as corpse. Emptied of its bodily fullness, its corporeality, its life, Cut-Out leaves us with nothing other than figuration as a hollow shell, a specter which can only haunt abstraction.

                  everything” (44). Indeed, the whole pleiad of Russian intellectuals in the first half of the nineteenth century exhibited a near obsession with history.

  Abstract: The strong form of the argument from patient rejection seems to me robust vis-à-vis the story model of hermeneutic psychoanalysis. That argument says that patients not only will, but also ought to, reject psychoanalytic interpretations because analysts are asking them to believe things that do not purport to be possibly true. The strong form of the argument applies to the story model alone because on all of the other models psychoanalytic interpretations purport to be true in at least some sense of “true.” A more sophisticated version of the strong form of the argument, which questions whether patients will accept<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bpqz">Care of the Psyche</a><br>
  Abstract: The term
                  confessionis defined as “the disclosing of something the knowledge of which by others is considered humiliating or prejudicial to the person confessing: a making known or acknowledging of one’s fault, wrong, crime, weakness, etc.” Although this definition encompasses matters of special importance in the traditions of both law and religion, it is the religious association that is relevant to the history of psychological healing. In that tradition, it has been considered “a religious act: the acknowledging of sin or sinfulness.” More specifically, it became “auricular confession”: that is, “addressed to the ear; told privately in the ear.”¹<br>

History was indeed the “mistress of life”

  Abstract: I trust that the title I have chosen is not too melancholy. The topic is a large one, but it is certainly familiar to all of us, and it is difficult to see how anything could be of greater concern to thoughtful human beings. The question before us is whether the life of reason is happy or sad. Those who dislike large topics might be inclined to reply, “Sometimes sad, sometimes happy,” and I suppose they would mean by this that happiness depends upon something other than our degree of rationality. In one sense, I agree with this sober reply.<br>

  Abstract: The expression “fusion of horizons” (

It will be the main topic of this essay, but in order to set it into the proper context, I need to say something about Gadamer’s overall enterprise. In so doing I will try to clarify the meaning of hermeneutics and discuss the sense in which it is intended to be universal. This discussion will culminate in a fundamental criticism of Gadamer’s hermeneutics. In the second half of the essay, I<br>

The first thing I thought was, “What am I worrying about?” It would be gratifying to be able to report that this devotion to thinking put a permanent end to my worries. Unfortunately this is not possible. At least with respect to nothing, thinking and worrying are very closely connected. The attempt to distinguish between thinking and worrying is not without its interest. But<br>

  Chapter 15  Kojèveʹs Paris: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bsjw">Metaphysics in Ordinary Language</a><br>
  Abstract: In 1960–61 I was a Fulbright Research Professor at the Sorbonne. My sponsor was Jean Wahl, a kindly gentleman who was one of the first, and perhaps the first, to redirect French philosophical attention to Hegel in the late twenties with his lectures on the unhappy consciousness. Wahl was interesting because of a certain amorphousness in his nature. By education and age, he served as a symbol of the Paris of the previous generation. At the same time, he possessed a childlike openness and imaginative predisposition for novelty that hinted at things to come. One could not confuse him<br>

  2  TOWARD A SEMIOTICS OF LITERATURE from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bt0m">Semiotics and Interpretation</a><br>
  Abstract: “Literature,” of course, is a word, not a thing. In casual conversation the word is used in many ways, some of them in conflict with one another. “Literature” may be thought of as true writing versus false, as beautiful writing versus useful, as nontrue writing versus true/false writing, and so on. It can be thought of as consisting of a few established generic forms, such as poem, play, and story, with such debatable genres as the essay and the film lurking on the borders. Most departments of literature function with no better concepts than these, and, as F. E. Sparshott<br>

  Abstract: Let us assume that there is something called narrative that can exist apart from any particular method of narration or any particular narrative utterance, as we assume that there is something called the English language that exists apart from any particular form of discourse or any individual speech act in English. Narration is, first of all, a kind of human behavior. It is specifically a mimetic or representative behavior, through which human beings communicate certain kinds of message. The modes of narration may vary extraordinarily. (In passing, I should say that I am aware of our customary distinction between what<br>

  2  Cognition and Consciousness from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32btm9">On the Nature of Consciousness</a><br>
  Abstract: Cognitive psychologists and neuropsychologists like Marcel (1983ab), Humphrey (1983), Baars (1988), Weiskrantz (1988), and Schacter (1989) now understand consciousness as a formal system or capacity involving the direction, choice, and synthesis of nonconscious processes. This movement, however, has also been answered with renewed versions of the traditional functionalist and behaviorist rejections of the study of consciousness as anything other than an incidental by-product of computational capacity (Dennett, 1991). Consciousness is seen as private and hence outside scientific scrutiny, confabulated and deluded in its pretended access to cognitive process, and ultimately nonfunctional. Such a rejection is in fact central to the<br>

  Author(s) Fisk Bruce N.<br>
  Abstract: Only a generation ago it was possible for a ranking Pauline scholar to offer a learned treatise on Paul’s relationship to Palestinian Judaism and say virtually nothing about how Scripture functioned in either context. Times have changed. The quest for Paul’s “Jewishness” inspired by E. P. Sanders (among others),¹ combined with the increasing availability of primary sources and the literary turn in late twentieth-century biblical scholarship, meant it was inevitable that Paul’s use of Scripture would come to be compared closely with the way Scripture functioned among the tradents of Second Temple Judaism. Thus today the claim that Paul’s use<br>

  5  Synchronic (Literary) Analysis of the Book of Qohelet from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bzwz">The Politics of Pessimism in Ecclesiastes</a><br>
  Abstract: A proper literary reading of Qohelet must first deal with the problem of how to translate the word הֶבֶל (
                  hebel) in Qohelet and how this relates to the carpe diem ethic in the book. The frame narrator has supplied the reader with the leitmotif of the book: הֲבֵל הֲבָלִים הַבּׁל הָבֶל (“Vanity of vanities; everything is vanity”) (1:2; 12:8). In addition, הֶבֶל is used thirty-eight times in Qohelet, out of seventy-three in the entire Hebrew Bible, which reinforces this. אֶלׁהִים is used forty times in Qohelet, indicating that the relationship between the two is probably significant. Even a casual reading<br>

  Author(s) Pereira Nancy Cardoso<br>
  Abstract: The Bible in Latin America is many things at once.¹ As a “book” of a historically imposed religion, the Bible participates in the religious and cultural polyphony of Latin America in a way that is conflictive and marked by ambiguities. As a religion imposed, Christianity has no positive contribution to make. There is no way to change such an assessment without compromising facts as well as historical interpretations well known to all.<br>

  Author(s) Marshall Bruce D.<br>
  Abstract: Deep in the 
                  Summa theologiae’s questions on the Trinity, St. Thomas Aquinas detects a problem in the Trinitarian theology of St. Augustine. The issue, very extensively discussed in medieval Trinitarian theology from the twelfth century on, is whether the divine essence generates, or is generated—whether the essence itself, and not merely one or another of the divine Persons, can rightly be said to generate or beget anything, or to be generated or begotten by anything. The answer is an emphatic no: “The essence does not generate the essence.”¹ Generating and being generated are each characteristics which are proper or<br>

  Abstract: Etienne Gilson used to claim, not least in 
                  Being and Some Philosophers, that Platonists are regularly confused (at best) about the relation between essence and existence: I presume that his attention was primarily directed not at some ancient Platonist, but at Avicenna, who, in distinguishing essence and existence, was induced to argue that existence is an accident of essence.¹ For Plotinus and ancient Neoplatonists, of course, the “essence” of a thing is associated with the degree of its unity as that thing, and that unity, indicating not that a thing is but what a thing is, is determined by its<br>

  Abstract: Nothing presents more problems for those who would enter the mentality of the medieval philosophical theologian than the task which has been set for this volume. Trying to judge the influence on Thomas Aquinas’s doctrine of one of his authoritative ancient sources requires us to surrender, at least provisionally, what we think we know about the authority in question. As heirs of Renaissance and modern philology, and of the modern constructions of the history of philosophy, we will almost certainly have a different, perhaps even opposed, view of the source than a medieval theologian would have had. Ironically, our problem<br>

  Abstract: In the very last note of 
                  Minima Moralia, Adorno suggests that the only responsible philosophical answer to despair is “to contemplate all things as they would present themselves from the standpoint of redemption.”¹ The essays in the first section of this book all situate themselves at some distance from despair, but they do consistently register difficulty, and they do have redemption firmly in mind. The essays concern the role of the intellectual as translator of what gets forgotten in the contemporary world, the possibility of translating law from culture to culture, the actual practice of simultaneous translation, the translatability and<br>

  Author(s) SPIVAK GAYATRI CHAKRAVORTY<br>
  Abstract: I’d like to begin with what should to be an obvious point. That the translator should make an attempt to grasp the writer’s presuppositions. Translation is not just the stringing together of the most accurate synonyms by the most proximate syntax. Kant’s “Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason” is written with the presupposition that mere (rather than pure) reason is a programmed structure, with in-built possibilities of misfiring, and nothing but calculation as a way of setting right.¹ Since the eighteenth century, English translators, not resonating with Kant’s philosophical presuppositions, have psychologized every noun, making Kant sound like a<br>

  Abstract: The question of metrical translation—its history, theory, and practice—is not often posed in current translation studies, except perhaps by translators who confront “a choice between rhyme and reason,” as Nabokov asked himself in translating Pushkin: “Can a translation while rendering with absolute fidelity the whole text, and nothing but the text, keep the form of the original, its rhythm and its rhyme?”¹ Like swearing an oath to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth before going on trial, the translator who vows to be true to “the whole text, and nothing but the text” must be<br>

  Abstract: “I think fiction rescues history from its confusions.” This tentative assertion in one of the rare interviews with Don DeLillo could draw a hail of objections from historians, as it insinuates, with confident and serious nonchalance (DeLillo’s characteristic style), that history is confused. Elaborating, the novelist goes on to attribute to the writing of fiction a capacity of historical insight that the writing of history cannot possibly possess, a clarity of perception into history’s own

  Abstract: If a state cannot enact traditional retribution for its citizens who were victimized by the former government, is there any point in the gathering and publishing of these victims’ stories? While the story of the evolution from revenge to retribution shows us that a state must do something, must take responsibility to effect a rebalancing for the victims or risk a reversion to personal revenge, our collective imagination has given us little in the way of alternatives to state violence. The pendulum of possible responses swings without pausing from the extreme of traditional retributive justice—requiring investigations, trials, and punishment<br>

  Abstract: In older days it was usual to think of tradition as a kind of perpetual-motion machine, a train that keeps on running. We are more accustomed now to the stops and starts of tradition. As Hobsbawm and others have reminded us, new traditions come into being all around us every year, and likewise old traditions die and no one may miss them.¹ Tradition is no hypostatic entity, airy and transcendent. Nor can we think of it as something hard and durable, like an old chair passed down from hand to hand. What it boils down to is a series of<br>

  Book Title: Shelter Blues-Sanity and Selfhood Among the Homeless<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Desjarlais Robert<br>
  Abstract: Desjarlais shows us not anonymous faces of the homeless but real people.While it is estimated that 25 percent or more of America's homeless are mentally ill, their lives are largely unknown to us. What must life be like for those who, in addition to living on the street, hear voices, suffer paranoid delusions, or have trouble thinking clearly or talking to others.
      Shelter Bluesis an innovative portrait of people residing in Boston's Station Street Shelter. It examines the everyday lives of more than 40 homeless men and women, both white and African-American, ranging in age from early 20s to mid-60s. Based on a sixteen-month study, it draws readers into the personal worlds of these individuals and, by addressing the intimacies of homelessness, illness, and abjection, picks up where most scholarship and journalism stops.Robert Desjarlais works against the grain of media representations of homelessness by showing us not anonymous stereotypes but individuals. He draws on conversations as well as observations, talking with and listening to shelter residents to understand how they relate to their environment, to one another, and to those entrusted with their care. His book considers their lives in terms of a complex range of forces and helps us comprehend the linkages between culture, illness, personhood, and political agency on the margins of contemporary American society.Shelter Bluesis unlike anything else ever written about homelessness. It challenges social scientists and mental health professionals to rethink their approaches to human subjectivity and helps us all to better understand one of the most pressing problems of our time.<br>

The building could not be read like a book, with a single meaning: its uses and meanings tied into one’s position in space and one’s place in society.

Some were on a fixed and steady plan of antidepressant, antianxiety, or antipsychotic medications; by definition, these antidotes countered some malady or symptom more than they fostered a new state of mind. Others repeatedly returned to “their” psychiatrists so that they could adjust the kind and amount of medications prescribed. The adjustments had a hit-or-miss quality to them; different antidotes and dosages were tried until something worked.<br>

  The Street from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhjmz">Shelter Blues</a><br>
  Abstract: Indeed, to understand why people slept in the shelter for months or even years, given its monotonous constraints and routines, we need to know something about “the street.” References to the street or streets did not imply specific, nameable roadways or neighborhoods but instead involved a general sociogeographic domain that intimated a specific way of life and certain frames of mind.<br>

  Pacing My Mind from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhjmz">Shelter Blues</a><br>
  Abstract: Another way that people dealt with things was to pace. Some did not pace at all. I never saw Fred, Helen, or Peter pace, and Irving seemed somehow too regal to want to work his body so. Richard sometimes paced when others did; he shadowed Brian at times, as if the contagion of movement was another way for him to get in touch with people. Men paced more than women, although it was unclear why this was so. Perhaps the difference lay in the culture, in the medications that men took, or in how those medications affected them.

  ʺWho?—Whatʹs Your Name?ʺ from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhjmz">Shelter Blues</a><br>
  Abstract: Although the shelter was very much founded in a conversation-based reality, the social life there was such that people enjoyed contact and quick exchanges with others but tended not to sit down and participate in extensive conversations. To “sit with” someone was to engage in a long and stationary conversation, usually while seated at a table in the common room or television room. More incidental socioeconomic exchanges typically took place on foot, which enabled one to “stand away,” if necessary, when asking for things. Some preferred not to sit with others: “I don’t sit with anyone,” Peter said; “I don’t<br>

  Reactivity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhjmz">Shelter Blues</a><br>
  Abstract: Residents also interpreted events and actions, and tried to recast them in their own image. But the force of the staff’s modality of interpretation made it the more potent and lasting one. Matters were not one-sided, however. Residents did not necessarily follow the staff’s advice or readily conform to their view of things, nor did they take everything at face value (“They tell me I have cancer,” Barbara whispered to me one day, “but the Good Savior told me I don’t, so who you gonna believe?!”). In general there were different wants and competing pragmatics. Staff members tried to advance<br>

  Abstract: The doubly pragmatic approach to reason and madness sketched above, in which words did things on their own in the pragmatics of everyday discourse as much as practically minded people did things with words, applies equally to the makings of self and personhood in the shelter, for residents and staff alike drew on different genres of human identity and agency in their dealings with others.<br>

  How to Do Things with Feeling from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhjmz">Shelter Blues</a><br>
  Abstract: In the State Service Center, feeling was ensconced in rhetoric. The shelter was a place for all things psychological. A great deal of talk involved comments on or indications of states of feeling—such as when Carla said, “I just feel wretched. I really do,” at a group meeting. Although I did not keep count, overt references to feelings seemed more numerous in the shelter than in most other contexts. The high frequency of glossings had a lot to do with the fact that shelter life evolved around therapeutic care. Niko Besnier points out that “in probably all speech communities,<br>

  Abstract: When you’re homeless, Richard explained, you end up with just your body because you don’t own anything else. He and others made good use of what they had. From the rites of pacing to ingestions of caffeine and nicotine to occasional adornments of bodily surfaces, slight but consequential uses of bodies helped shape the phenomenal and social worlds in which people lived. General bodily comportments, in turn, were often the vehicle of rhetorical pitches in the State Service Center, for residents came to embody certain physical stances that helped them to present certain identities or to persuade others.

  Abstract: The short of it was that, the more people settled into the routines of the shelter, the more rhetorical their lives were, not the least because many of the daily routines evolved around rhetorical moves and countermoves. Rhetoric was built into the voicing and feeling of things—in much the same way as it was a “rule” in the shelter to “stand away” when asking for something.<br>

  Book Title: Dreams of Fiery Stars-The Transformations of Native American Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Rainwater Catherine<br>
  Abstract: Selected by
      Choicemagazine as an Outstanding Academic Book for 1999 Since the 1968 publication of N. Scott Momaday'sHouse Made of Dawn, a new generation of Native American storytellers has chosen writing over oral traditions. While their works have found an audience by observing many of the conventions of the mainstream novel, Native American written narrative has emerged as something distinct from the postmodern novel with which it is often compared. InDreams of Fiery Stars, Catherine Rainwater examines the novels of writers such as Momaday, Linda Hogan, Leslie Marmon Silko, Gerald Vizenor, and Louise Erdrich and contends that the very act of writing narrative imposes constraints upon these authors that are foreign to Native American tradition. Their works amount to a break with-and a transformation of-American Indian storytelling. The book focuses on the agenda of social and cultural regeneration encoded in contemporary Native American narrative, and addresses key questions about how these works achieve their overtly stated political and revisionary aims. Rainwater explores the ways in which the writers "create" readers who understand the connection between storytelling and personal and social transformation; considers how contemporary Native American narrative rewrites Western notions of space and time; examines the existence of intertextual connections between Native American works; and looks at the vital role of Native American literature in mainstream society today.<br>

  Abstract: Nothing illustrates the recent changes in the relative status of women and men in Moroccan society so fully as the altered position of the shikha, the female performer. As women who commoditize their voices and bodies in contexts of public celebration (both outdoors at saint’s festivals, and indoors at wedding celebrations) shikhat (pl.) are often associated with the marketplace. In fact, women without moral scruples may be compared to shikhat who are “lost in the suq.”<br>

Appreciating this fact is crucial if we are to understand his intellectual accomplishments; but it must also be kept in perspective. His passion for cohesiveness and completion led to the preoccupation with detail and demonstration that characterizes his logos writings: everything must fit, everything must hang together logically.¹ This being the case, it is not surprising that many later students of Avicenna, attracted by these very attributes of system, detail, and logical coherence, tend to view his philosophy through the prism<br>

  Chapter Five  Strangers and Soteriology in the  from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fj38q">Aliens and Sojourners</a><br>
  Abstract: Not all early Christians thought that speaking about themselves as aliens was a good thing. While numerous texts of the first and second centuries were making exactly this move (as evidenced by our analysis thus far), this was not the only conceptual option available to Christians as they thought about their identity and what its legitimate relationship ought to be to the rhetoric of alienation. Thus there were (perhaps not surprisingly) voices of protest to the increasingly common strategy of constructing the Christian self as other. These voices were not separate or outside the contested discourse of formative Christian identity,<br>

  The Cinema of Attractions as Dispositif from:

  Author(s) Kessler Frank<br>
  Abstract: Raymond Bellour once characterized Christian Metz’s
                  Grande Syntagmatiqueas an “opérateur théorique,” a theoretical operator, because to him this widely discussed model of a cinematic code actualized the possibility of a semiotics of cinema “by bringing its virtualness onto a material level.”¹ In a similar, though obviously different manner, the concept of “cinema of attractions” has become such a theoretical operator by creating a framework thanks to which early cinema could be seen as an object different from classical narrative cinema, as something which was not justearlycinema, that is an earlier form of what cinema was to become,<br>

  Author(s) Gaudreault André<br>
  Abstract: For nearly 200 years the term “attraction” has seen a host of semantic and theoretical shifts, becoming today one of the key concepts in cinema studies. According to the
                  Oxford English Dictionary, the meaning of “attraction” as a “thing or feature which draws people by appealing to their desires, tastes, etc.,esp. any interesting or amusing exhibition which ‘draws’ crowds” dates from as early as 1829 (“These performances, although possessing much novelty, did not prove sterling attractions”). This sense of attraction as something which “draws crowds” had by the 1860s come to mean both an “interesting and amusing exhibition” and<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt46n09s">The Cinema of Attractions Reloaded</a><br>
  Author(s) Gunning Tom<br>
  Abstract: Writing in 1922, flushed with the excitement of seeing Abel Gance’s La Roue, Fernand Léger tried to define something of the radical possibilities of the cinema. The potential of the new art did not lie in “imitating the movements of nature” or in “the mistaken path” of its resemblance to theater. Its unique power was a “matter of
                     making images seen.”¹ It is precisely this harnessing of visibility, this act of showing and exhibition, which I feel cinema before 1906 displays most intensely. [Its] inspiration for the avant-garde of the early decades of this century needs to be re-explored.<br>

  Abstract: We are in the midst of a multiyear centennial celebration of cinema’s beginnings. Motion pictures had their first première just over one hundred years ago, on 9 May 1893, when George M. Hopkins gave a lecture on Thomas A. Edison’s new motion picture system, the kinetoscope and kinetograph camera, at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Science. When the lecture concluded, at least two twenty-second films were shown: Blacksmithing Scene and Horse Shoeing.

  Abstract: No tradition, intellectual or otherwise, can exist or stay alive without demarcating its own identity from something that is seen as representing its negative counterpart, its ‘other’; and as a result, this ‘other’ necessarily accompanies any tradition, as the shadowy background or dark canvas which allows it to draw the contours of its own identity in the first place. The presence of this shadow can therefore never be forgotten; but in order to fulfill its role as a negative background, neither can it be brought into the full daylight of memory and recollection.

  Abstract: A surprising number of scholars and teachers and even poets—people who claim to “know” what poetry is—will insist that only one aspect of poetry is crucial. Insist for instance, that the essence of poetry is formal coherence (order) or that only emotion matters (disorder). Maybe this one-sided emphasis is a temperamental thing. For some people, the need for order is so pronounced and pleasurable that order seems everything to them in the project of poetry. And for others, the destabilizing claims or threats of experience are so urgent that it would be impossible for them to talk about<br>

  Abstract: If Tunis G. Campbell looked for friends and supporters among the people who witnessed his progress along the streets of Savannah, Georgia, or glared into the faces of enemies, he left no record of it. It was 12 January 1876, and Savannah’s populace was as divided over issues of race as it was about most everything else. Even many African American Savannahns found men like Campbell embarrassing, if not frightening. Although he attracted as many people as he frightened, there Campbell was, at age sixty-three, on his way to Colonel Jack Smith’s Washington County plantation, where men were measured by<br>

  Abstract: It is easy to imagine American evangelical Christianity and the ideals of southern manhood in opposition. Nineteenth-century evangelicalism, in the North and the South, has typically been portrayed as women’s domain: women were more in attendance at congregational activities, and pastors bent over backward to accommodate theological ideals to feminine sentimentality even as the culture at large considered women more naturally inclined to spiritual and moral matters than men. Men, in contrast, and especially in the South, were beholden to a code of honor that, among other things, encouraged violence—martial, retributive, or vigilant—gambling, blood sports, sowing wild oats,<br>

  Abstract: If bioregionalism is viewed narrowly, with a bioregion seen as a distinct natural region or a local place touted for its specialities, the feral may function as an unwelcome or invasive intrusion. In this narrow view, the energy of the local is focused on expelling, demonizing, marginalizing, and even destroying the feral. Generally, the feral can be understood as a state that lies somewhere between domesticated and wild. Ferality is implicitly accepted as a natural process: what happens when a domestic escapes, is released, or is transported into another bioregion; or conversely, what happens when the wild thing shifts or<br>

  Abstract: Ethnographies always begin as conversations between anthropologists and our hosts, who are, in turn, in conversation with each other. If we are fortunate, some of these conversations take unexpected turns, develop into genuine dialogues, and continue over many years. Dialogues open the possibility that we may learn something about the process of communication, about how words can be used to construct meaningful accounts of life experience. In this way, they differ fundamentally from structured interviews, where one of the participants claims rights both to pose the questions and interpret the responses.<br>

Education is also an important aspect of professionalism.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hh3bq">Moral Evil</a><br>
  Abstract: Just before being shipped to a concentration camp, a father attempts to pass off the sentence as a novelty worthy of anticipation. By generating his son’s enthusiasm for the trek, Guido protects him from all the implications of their forthcoming doom. Roberto Benigni’s Oscar-winning film about a condemned man’s determination to shield his son from the worst life brings shows the creative force of the will triumphing over genocide. By adopting the right attitude, the film argues, we have the capacity to transform the gloomiest reality into something tolerable. Shortly after

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhcqm">Philosophy of Communication</a><br>
  Author(s) Butchart Garnet C.<br>
  Abstract: To philosophize is to communicate philosophically, and to communicate philosophically is to impart the wisdom of which philosophy speaks and which is spoken at the same time. Would philosophy—ever universalizing and universalized in its claims—be able to stand fast as what it claims to be if it did not impart anything, if it refused to communicate, if it simply remained silent? Even if philosophy managed somehow to keep silent, could this silence be anything other than philosophy’s choice of expression, an expression wisely chosen by philosophy to keep its silence? And could this silence be anything other than<br>

  1  Of ʺThisʺ Communication from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhcqm">Philosophy of Communication</a><br>
  Author(s) Chang Briankle G.<br>
  Abstract: I shall speak about communication.¹ With the statement “I shall speak about communication,” I have just made known what I am about to do. However, in saying this, by saying, “I shall speak about communication,” am I not communicating? In this instance, the act of my saying and what is thus said appear to stand in happy agreement, the latter being little more than a self-reflective report on the former, thereby saying nothing but affirming that this saying, this report, is taking place. Indeed, I begin by making a promise presaging what I shall speak about, and yet this making,<br>

  3  New System of the Nature of the Communication of Substances from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhcqm">Philosophy of Communication</a><br>
  Author(s) Leibniz Gottfried Wilhelm<br>
  Abstract: The system of occasional causes must be partly accepted and partly rejected. Each substance is the true and real cause of its own immanent actions, and has the power of acting, and although it is sustained by the divine concourse nevertheless it cannot happen that it is merely passive, and this is true both in the case of corporeal substances and incorporeal ones. But on the other hand, each substance (excepting God alone) is nothing except the occasional cause of its transeunt actions towards another substance. Therefore the true reason of the union between soul and body, and the reason<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhcqm">Philosophy of Communication</a><br>
  Author(s) Deleuze Gilles<br>
  Abstract: Perhaps the question “What is philosophy?” can only be posed late in life, when old age has come, and with it the time to speak in concrete terms. It is a question one poses when one no longer has anything to ask for, but its consequences can be considerable. One was asking the question before, one never ceased asking it, but it was too artificial, too abstract; one expounded and dominated the question, more than being grabbed by it. There are cases in which old age bestows not an eternal youth, but on the contrary a sovereign freedom, a pure<br>

  Abstract: As the point of departure for our new meditations, let us take what may seem to be a grave objection. The objection concerns nothing less than the claim of transcendental phenomenology to be itself transcendental

  11  On Language as Such and on the Language of Man from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhcqm">Philosophy of Communication</a><br>
  Author(s) Benjamin Walter<br>
  Abstract: Every expression of human mental life can be understood as a kind of language, and this understanding, in the manner of a true method, everywhere raises new questions. It is possible to talk about a language of music and of sculpture, about a language of justice that has nothing directly to do with those in which German or English legal judgments are couched, about a language of technology that is not the specialized language of technicians. Language in such contexts means the tendency inherent in the subjects concerned—technology, art, justice, or religion—toward the communication of mental meanings. To<br>

  Author(s) Heidegger Martin<br>
  Abstract: In what follows we shall try to think about dwelling and building. This thinking about building does not presume to discover architectural ideas, let alone to give rules for building. This venture in thought does not view building as an art or as a technique of construction; rather, it traces building back into that domain to which everything that

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhcqm">Philosophy of Communication</a><br>
  Author(s) Benveniste Emile<br>
  Abstract: If language is, as they say, the instrument of communication, to what does it owe this property? The question may cause surprise, as does everything that seems to challenge an obvious fact, but it is sometimes useful to require proof of the obvious. Two answers come to mind. The one would be that language is
                  in factemployed as the instrument of communication, probably because men have not found a better or more effective way in which to communicate. This amounts to stating what one wishes to understand. One might also think of replying that language has such qualities as<br>

  25  The Fetishism of the Commodity and Its Secret | The Process of Exchange from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhcqm">Philosophy of Communication</a><br>
  Author(s) Marx Karl<br>
  Abstract: A commodity appears at first sight an extremely obvious, trivial thing. But its analysis brings out that it is a very strange thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties. So far as it is a use-value, there is nothing mysterious about it, whether we consider it from the point of view that by its properties it satisfies human needs, or that it first takes on these properties as the product of human labour. It is absolutely clear that, by his activity, man changes the forms of the materials of nature in such a way as to make them useful<br>

  Author(s) Marion Jean-Luc<br>
  Abstract: We give without account. We give without accounting, in every sense of the word. First, because we give
                  without ceasing. We give in the same way we breathe, every moment, in every circumstance, from morning until evening. Not a single day passes without our having given, in one form or another, something to someone, even if we rarely, if ever, “give everything.”¹ Also, we give without keeping account,without measure, because giving implies that one gives at a loss, or at least without taking into account either one’s time or one’s efforts: one simply does not keep account of what<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhks8">The Machine Question</a><br>
  Abstract: A patient-oriented ethics looks at things from the other side—in more ways than one. The question of moral patiency is, to put it rather schematically, whether and to what extent robots, machines, nonhuman animals, extraterrestrials, and so on might constitute an

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hj1hn">Translating Childhoods</a><br>
  Abstract: For more than a decade, I have been documenting the work that the children of immigrants do as they use their skills in two languages to read, write, listen, speak, and do things for their families.¹ I refer to a practice that has variously been called Natural Translation, family interpreting, language brokering, and
                  para-phrasing–terms I discuss further in chapter 1. Placing phone calls, taking and leaving messages, scheduling appointments, filling out credit card applications, negotiating sales purchases, soliciting social services, and communicating for their parents with teachers, medical personnel, and other authority figures are part of everyday life for<br>

  Abstract: Like home-based translation work, public
                  para-phrasing involved a myriad of activities involving an array of institutional domains, set in distinct relationships, and directed toward assorted problems. Children developed and used a wide array of what Luis Moll calls “funds of knowledge,”¹ as they engaged in tasks that ranged from relatively simple things such as asking where items were located in a store or for directions on the street to much more complex negotiations with doctors, lawyers, and social service providers. Translations were provided mostly for family members, as when children read signs, labels, maps, and directions; often, publicpara-phrasing acts<br>

  Author(s) BELL CATHERINE<br>
  Abstract: It is a daunting task to address a question about the “phenomenology” of anything. Yet I have had the good fortune to count among my teachers the great phenomenologist, Mircea Eliade, and the undisputed great anti-phenomenologist, Jonathan Z. Smith. If they remain in my psyche as dual influences, although perhaps more Scylla and Charybdis than yin and yang, they also insure there is little that I cannot
                  attemptto address one way or another. So I put prevarications aside. I have been drawn to the study of texts and issues of textuality since the beginning of my career, and it<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hj5wr">Theorizing Scriptures</a><br>
  Author(s) SHOUCHENG YAN<br>
  Abstract: Christians and Muslims believe in an interventionary God who has revealed something of his nature, his intentions for mankind and the future of the created cosmos through prophets and inspired scriptures and, in the case of Christianity, through a personal intervention in human history. Given such a belief it is, of course, vitally important to decide what God’s messages are, particularly as they are expressed through a medium,<br>

  19  Against Signifying: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hj5wr">Theorizing Scriptures</a><br>
  Author(s) HARRIS LEONARD<br>
  Abstract: To “signify” is to modify texts by “riffing, woofing, scoring, getting loud on something or sometone.”¹ Signifying refers to a wide-ranging critical mode of engagement with texts, not merely an exegesis or the search for the content-meaning of texts, including sacred ones. Signifying is also intended to capture the creation of symbols, meanings, and approaches that are unsettling and made by the social categories defined as subalterns, nondominant populations, minorities, populations on the margin of society, subordinated groups, the oppressed, and the exploited. I will refer to all of these social categories in the following as “subalterns” or “nondominant populations.”<br>

  Author(s) Taylor Joan<br>
  Abstract: The Bible can create a peculiar dissonance for Christians who read it as a sacred story illuminating the relationship between God and humanity. It is not of our age. It may be prefaced, at the very beginning, with something similar to the

  Abstract: Perhaps unsurprisingly, in both cases, though the KJV’s literal translation is unexceptionable, the original meaning has been misunderstood. “The root of the matter” is generally used today to mean the essential or inner part of something, the core,² but roots are more properly the origin of things than their essence.

  Author(s) Lewalski Barbara K.<br>
  Abstract: Why was there such a flowering of religious lyric poetry in England in the seventeenth century, and did the publication of the King James (or Authorized) Version in 1611 have anything to do with it? I think it did, for reasons and in ways I want to explore here. Some aspects of the Reformation and its aftermath in England seem hardly conducive to the development of religious arts—insistence on the single, literal sense of Scripture, iconoclasm, suspicion in some quarters about church music, anxieties about adding to or ornamenting the Word of God in sermons or poems, and the<br>

  Book Title: Political Creativity-Reconfiguring Institutional Order and Change<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Hattam Victoria<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on the rich cache of antidualist theoretical traditions, from poststructuralism and ecological theory to constructivism and pragmatism, a diverse group of scholars probes acts of social innovation in many locations: land boards in Botswana, Russian labor relations, international statistics, global supply chains, Islamic economics in Algeria, Islamic sects and state authority in Senegal, and civil rights reform, colonization, industrial policy, and political consulting in the United States. These political scientists reconceptualize
         agencyas a relational process that continually reorders the nature and meaning of people and things,orderas an assemblage that necessitates creative tinkering and interpretation, andchangeas the unruly politics of time that confounds the conventional ordering of past, present, and future.Political Creativityoffers analytical tools for reimagining order and change as entangled processes.<br>

  Abstract: My experience tells me something quite different from the texts and dances of classicism and metaphysical dualism—that our transcendence is not won at the expense of flesh and body, nor is mind higher than matter: mater, matron, matrix, mother, the land. Rather, we pierce reality through the body, and we transcend downward as well as upward.

At its worst, pain is unchosen, extreme, and without purpose; it obscures memory, thought, language, everything but itself. How can one communicate such an experience? Chronic pain does not present the same challenge to expression as acute pain and even agony can find its way into a story as time passes, but the problem posed by pain remains.

  Abstract: In part 2, we are still moving away from those futile existentialist views that fail to see meaning in life because they emphasize lifeʹs contingency rather than its cohesion, and fail to see the impossibility of erasing (even in our thoughts, let alone our actions) the compelling connectedness of self, body, earth, and world – a universe (a single verse), rendering both unity and diversity possible. Disconnection is possible only if connection is assumed. Likewise, irrationality stands in relation to rationality, nonbeing to being, negative to positive, and contingent properties must be contingent upon something. In short, all oppositions stand<br>

  Author(s) Patterson Orlando<br>
  Abstract: The end of the Cold War entailed not simply the political and ideological victory of the West over its Communist adversary, but the triumph of the West’s most central and cherished value, freedom. Today we are living through one of the periodic explosive diffusions of this ideal as well as the related notion of human rights. According to Freedom House, the majority of the world’s 5.4 billion people have declared themselves in favour of freedom. The world seems to be in anything but a festive mood as a result of the triumph of its master value. The former Soviet Union<br>

  Author(s) Flasch Kurt<br>
  Abstract: With this striking exhortation, Augustine summed up introspection as a constitutive element of the old European system of merit. At the same time, in an anxious, nothing less than beseeching, peremptory tone, it reminds us that human beings have a tendency to throw themselves outwards, to live amid diversions, to fail to appreciate themselves. It is not only with the emergence of industrial-technological civilization that introspection comes under threat; it faces inherent threats. Before Augustine, Neoplatonic and Stoic philosophers reminded us of the same thing: it is we who forget our inner world, plunge into the external world, and lose<br>

  Author(s) Reinhard Wolfgang<br>
  Abstract: When I consider all the unsolicited emails I receive every day, it seems to me that there are two main values for our contemporaries, money and sex, both quite everyday things. Now the world does not, of course, consist solely of spam, but on a somewhat higher level, in the case of professional and economic success measured in monetary terms, and in the case of love, we are in fact dealing with core values of Western culture and society. But they are so normal and everyday that they are scarcely perceived as values that function as guides to action.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjbpw">The Cultural Values of Europe</a><br>
  Author(s) Thome Helmut<br>
  Abstract: When studying values empirically, social researchers apply a methodological perspective which differs substantially from that characteristic of philosophers, social anthropologists, or historians of ideas. In empirical research, values are treated as something ‘measurable’, measurable, above all, with the instrument of systematic surveys. This is a persistent source of irritation, and not just among non-sociologists; I shall therefore deal briefly with this methodology by way of introduction. The first thing to bear in mind is that we constantly produce rough-and-ready ‘measurements’ of values in everyday conversation. Referring to a colleague, for example, we say that he values his work more than<br>

  Abstract: This chapter situates the subject of fiction, and the subject as writer of fiction, simultaneously. Between the two, a third emerges – the subject as critic – offering the reader a triple reading of a triple writing. It is a moment whereby to trace the trace, to trace the historical trajectory of a historical trajectory, requires that both the subject of the fiction and the subject as writer of fiction lay themselves bare on the page – reveal everything – and the critic binds and unwinds, untying the strings of history at different threads, unraveling the hidden, the forbidden, and the repressed that lie<br>

  Abstract: In the English-speaking transatlantic sphere, all legal involvement in the slave trade was officially abandoned between 1807 (Great Britain) and 1808 (the United States);
                  slaverywould eventually be abolished in the British Caribbean in 1833–34 and in the United States in 1865. The struggle to ban the trade in people of African origin and, by extension, their “thingification” (Césaire, 1950) was fought by many – by enslaved blacks and by white abolitionists – and it was fought in many different forms. Forms of resistance on the part of the enslaved ranged from survival tactics of fugitive slaves organizing in so-called maroon<br>

  Abstract: Given his desire to know the street map with his feet, it is unsurprising that the act of walking should play such a prominent role in Carson’s writing. Indeed, his is a distinctively peripatetic aesthetic. Time and again walking serves not only as a means of registering urban experience, the medium through which all manner of encounters, associations, and sidelong observations are made; it also functions as a figure for the meandering, digressive nature of Carson’s narratives, in which ‘one thing leads to another’ (

  Author(s) CHEW SHIRLEY<br>
  Abstract: Joseph Conrad was the first modern writer V. S. Naipaul encountered at the age of ten; and Conrad, seaman turned author, was also someone who ‘had been everywhere before me’ and who ‘sixty to seventy years ago meditated on my world’ (
                  CD, p. 210). Indeed, Conrad’s vision of this world, as some critics have remarked,² is one which Naipaul seems bound to repeat in his own work: ‘half-made societies ... where there was no goal, and where always “something inherent in the necessities of successful action ... carried with it the moral degradation of the idea”’ (CD, p. 208).

Declan Kiberd, for instance, has referred to her prose style as one of ‘surpassing beauty and exactitude’.¹ Such accolades, however, are a relatively recent phenomenon. It is only in the last ten to fifteen years that substantial critical attention has been paid to her work, largely due to the endeavours of feminist scholars.² Most criticism of O’Brien’s work has been from the perspective of gender and sexuality, something which is not surprising given the subject-matter of her early work.³ For critics who read her through psychoanalytical theory, it<br>

  ‘Upon Nothing’: from:

  Author(s) BARLEY TONY<br>
  Abstract: Because of its knowing exhibitionism, because of its flair, because of its mock-solemn pride in its own achievement, Rochester’s poem ‘Upon Nothing’ brushes aside the kind of readerly interrogation invited by similarly impressive metaphysical displays. If Donne’s ‘Lecture on the Shadow’ or ‘A Nocturnall upon S. Lucie’s Day’ or Marvell’s ‘Definition of Love’, provide a recent generic pedigree for ‘Upon Nothing’, Rochester’s salient improvisation on non-entity requires of its readership qualitatively less imaginative effort to succumb to its arguments and admire its paradoxes. ‘Upon Nothing’ asks, supposing it asks anything of its readers, for a take-it-or-leave-it sense of delightedly amused<br>

  Author(s) Larrain Jorge<br>
  Abstract: Following Castoriadis, I shall understand by ‘modernity’ the conjunction of two key significations: autonomy and control. Autonomy refers to the freedom of a society to make its own laws; control has to do with the expansion of rational mastery over the world of things, including the development of science and technology and their application to production and the control of nature (Castoriadis 1990: 15–17). Peter Wagner has developed this idea more precisely into an ‘interpretative approach’, which focuses on the responses that human beings give to certain basic

  Abstract: This chapter looks at world-making from the viewpoint of one of its constitutive ingredients: solidarity. Solidarity is the substance of a successful world-making, if world-making is defined as the creation of a common universe. It makes sense to think that in order for this common universe to exist, there must be something that holds it together. Here, I will argue that solidarity should not be conceptualized as the ‘something that holds the common universe together’ but rather as the ‘there must be something that holds the common universe together’. The distinction here lies in a step I think worth taking,<br>

  Abstract: At the time of writing, it seems that the sceptics have been right. After the referenda on the constitutional treaty of the European Union in France and the Netherlands, the European political project is in disarray. Some of those sceptics will even insist that there never was such a political project anyway. The European Union, in their view, is nothing but an association of states to further their own interests, and the apparent acceleration of political integration over the past fifteen years did not really change its nature.

  Abstract: The idea of place—of
                  topos—runs through the thinking of Martin Heidegger almost from the very start. Although not always directly thematized—sometimes apparently obscured, displaced even, by other concepts—and expressed through many different terms (Ort, Ortschaft, Stätte, Gegend, Dasein, Lichtung, Ereignis),¹ it is impossible to think with Heidegger unless one attunes oneself to Heidegger’s own attunement to place. This is something not only to be observed in Heidegger’s attachment to the famous hut at Todtnauberg;² it is also found, more significantly, in his constant deployment of topological terms and images, and in the situated, “placed,” character of<br>

                  as an object, and its natureas an artwork?¹ The relation is surely not an irrelevant or contingent one, and yet its nature is not at all self-evident. Indeed, in the case of some artworks, namely those that fall within the category of certain forms of so-called conceptual art, it might seem as if the material objectivity of the work (where “objectivity” is taken to refer to what we might also call, a little awkwardly in English, the “thingness” of the work) is entirely incidental<br>

  Author(s) Greenstein Edward L.<br>
  Abstract: The book of Job, particularly its poetic core, appears to contain more unique words and linguistic usages than any comparable work from the ancient Near East. The distinctive language of Job has been attributed to a number of literary factors. For one thing, the characters and events are set in a much earlier, legendary period—the time of the patriarchs.¹ Not only does Job enjoy a lifestyle that is reminiscent of the rural, sheep-and-goat-herding Hebrew patriarchs, but the description of Job and his situation in the narrative framework of the book features language and allusions to the stories of Genesis.²<br>

  Abstract: Can a text migrate? What would it mean to use such a metaphor (and it is, without doubt, a metaphor)? We think of animals and people as migrating, sometimes by choice, sometimes by instinct, sometimes by compulsion. Migration is movement, but not just any movement. It is movement across geographical, national and/or cultural boundaries or differences. So, migration requires difference of some sort.

  2.1  Philosophy and Folk Psychology from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkgzz">Mindscapes</a><br>
  Author(s) Haugeland John<br>
  Abstract: People, as rational or intelligent animals, are distinctive not only in their understanding of the events and things around them, but also in their understanding of one another—specifically, their understanding of one another as rational or intelligent. This latter understanding, in its general character, is what Paul Churchland once called “folk psychology,” and the name has stuck. The principal aim of Von Eckardt’s paper is to argue that philosophical discussions of folk psychology—including, but certainly not limited to Churchland’s—suffer from being empirically underinformed. In particular, by neglecting a substantial research tradition within what is sometimes called “social<br>

  Author(s) Gärdenfors Peter<br>
  Abstract: A very general answer, that I think everybody can agree on, to the question of what a semantics is, is that it specifies a relation between linguistic expressions and the referents of the expressions. But soon afterwards, opinions diverge. There is, in particular, no agreement on what kind of entities the meanings of various words are. Some say that the referents of language are things in the world, some say they are things, but maybe not in this world, and some say they are mental constructions without any posit that these constructions coalesce with reality.<br>

  Abstract: It is difficult to critically comment upon a paper with which one agrees both about the general goals and about their substantive implementation. Hardin’s paper is informative and well argued, and certainly furthers the work in color perception that he established in
                  Color for Philosophers. Most interestingly, in this paper he took what is thought to be clearly aphilosophicalproblem, the inverted spectrum, and showed how attention to detail, scientific and phenomenological, could be utilized to dissolve the force of the case. It appears that humans could not invert the spectrum without there being noticeable differences—“something got lost<br>

  Author(s) van Gelder Tim<br>
  Abstract: After connectionism burst into prominence in cognitive science in mid-1980s, one of the most popular questions among philosophers of cognitive science was: what implications does it have for the philosophy of mind? (See, e.g., Horgan and Tienson 1991; Ramsey, Stich, and Rumelhart, 1991). Ten years later, it seems that the verdict is in. If we suppose that the term
                  connectionismrefers to some reasonably coherent research program standing as an alternative to mainstream computational cognitive science, then connectionism hasnointeresting implications for cognitive science. This is because there is, in fact,no suchthing. There are lots of connectionist<br>

  Abstract: Once, a mind-body theory based upon the idea of supervenience seemed to be a promising alternative to the various kinds of reductionistic physicalism. In recent years, however, Jaegwon Kim has subjected his own brainchild to a very thorough criticism. With most of Kim’s arguments I agree wholeheartedly—not least because they converge with my own thoughts.² In order to explain the few points of divergence with Kim’s views, I shall have to prepare the ground a little. In the course of this paper I will therefore do two things: At the start, I will try to sketch the logical topography<br>

  Abstract: Metaphysics can be described as the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of being, existence, and reality. Epistemology, another fundamental branch of philosophy, is intimately tied to metaphysics because it deals with the nature of knowledge: to talk about what is, one must speak of knowing what is, just as one cannot know something is without also positing that it is.

                  Dark Shadows(2012). In this chapter we explore Burton’s construction of fantastic worlds in the films that feature Depp as Burton’s persona, or “second self.” Our starting point is Tzvetan Todorov’s conception of “the fantastic,” as well as the two closely connected categories that Todorov designates as “the uncanny” and “the marvelous.” We develop Todorov’s ideas into an explanatory hypothesis for understanding Burton’s filmmaking, especially with respect to the films starring Depp. We argue that Burton creates fictional worlds that are, in something like Todorov’s sense, fantastic.<br>

  Abstract: THE FALL AND WINTER of 1963 and the first six weeks of 1964 were extremely hard for Brodsky, but not for the political reasons that those writing about him in hindsight assume. His relationship with Marina Basmanova was coming to a disastrous end; he was thinking of nothing else. But as it happened, at this most vulnerable moment, he became a convenient target for three different interest groups: he fell victim to Nikita Khrushchev’s ideological policy, to the zeal and ambition of the Leningrad police and reactionaries within the Leningrad Writers’ Union, and to the machinations of one Yakov Lerner<br>

  Abstract: When Tolstoy states dramatically in his aesthetic treatise
                  What Is Art?that “the interpretation of works of art by words only indicates that the interpreter is himself incapable of feeling the infection of art,”¹ one forgets, for just a moment, that Tolstoy himself is using words to tell us how to understand art. For me, the exploration of this kind of mild contradiction is part of what makes reading Tolstoy enjoyable. Sometimes the contradiction is really nothing more than the thematic chiaroscuro of a story, as when Tolstoy celebrates fidelity in vivid stories of adultery, or cherishes the innocence of<br>

Ravaged by desire, he ultimately goes insane, vowing in the closing pages of the story either to kill Stepanida or to kill himself in order to end the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkwn0">Leo Tolstoy and the Alibi of Narrative</a><br>
  Abstract: Most readers of Tolstoy will recognize the tragic and angry meditation here as characteristic of Anna’s final hours. Everything seems “dreadful” and “incomprehensible” to her as she loses herself in feelings of loneliness and estrangement. Anna’s thoughts reveal her isolation from the rest of the world and lead her to believe that “to tell another what one feels,” to foster genuine communication would be a sort of miracle.¹<br>

  9  The Poetics of Romantic Betrayal from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkwn0">Leo Tolstoy and the Alibi of Narrative</a><br>
  Abstract: For Tolstoy, love provides one with special abilities to speak and be understood, and in descriptions of love we find his most startling examples of communication. Contrariwise, the loss of love, the emergence of suspicion, infidelity, and betrayal, all take a terrible toll on communication. A jealous husband in Tolstoy’s world has a difficult time communicating with his wife. Of course, that is nothing extraordinary to anyone who has ever been in love—groundless, or even well-grounded, suspicions somehow interfere with intimate conversations. Something more significant is at stake, however: the tenuous bond in Tolstoy’s fiction between thought and language,<br>

  Abstract: ʺCorruptionʺ is one of the most powerful words in the English language. When (for instance) we think of corruption of food, human bodies, or other physical objects, we think of something that is fundamentally or revoltingly altered, impure, rotten, or worse. When we think of corruption in government—the subject of this book—the impact of this word is equally powerful. Charges of corruption in public life have condemned men, destroyed the lives of women, and accelerated the decline and fall of governments. Corruption is something that human beings instinctively loathe, and that<br>

  Abstract: Talk of the relations between “science” and “religion” first became audible in the early 1800s, about the time that students of nature began referring to their work as science rather than natural philosophy (or natural history). Because natural philosophy allowed its practitioners, in the words of Isaac Newton, to discourse about God “from the appearances of things,” one searches almost in vain for references to “natural philosophy and religion.” Some writers expressed concern about tension between faith and reason, but they never pitted religion against science.¹<br>

  Author(s) Saba Cosetta G.<br>
  Abstract: This chapter aims to introduce an epistemological reflection on the concept of “digital archiving” applied to media art. If the latter appears for many reasons to constitute something “transient and un-archivable” (Ernst, 2004 and 2010), it is because it presents itself ontologically in an exponentially complex form. In other words, the aim is to underline the problems (theoretical and methodological) that media art poses to digital archiving. In order to keep media artworks accessible to contemporary and future users, their inclusion in digital archives is desirable. Digital archives can support the fundamental function of the

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wp6f3">Preserving and Exhibiting Media Art</a><br>
  Abstract: Documentation is the process of gathering and organizing information about a work, including its condition, its content, its context, and the actions taken to preserve it. For the writing of art history one used to be able to rely on the art objects. When artworks become prone to obsolescence or are only meant to exist for a short period, documentation is the only thing people can fall back on. The traditional documentation strategy for the conservation of art is focused on describing the object, in the best objective way possible. But conservation as a practice is not as fixed as<br>

  Chapter Five  Homo Ludens 2.0: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wp6n0">Contemporary Culture</a><br>
  Author(s) Raessens Joost<br>
  Abstract: A spectre is haunting the world – the spectre of playfulness. We are witnessing a global “ludification of culture”. Since the 1960s, in which the word “ludic” became popular in Europe and the United States to designate playful behaviour and artefacts, playfulness has increasingly become a mainstream characteristic of our culture. Perhaps the first thing that comes to mind in this context is the immense popularity of computer games, which, as far as global sales are concerned, have already outstripped Hollywood. According to a recent study in the United States, 8 to 18 year olds play computer games on average<br>

  Author(s) Jansen Bas<br>
  Abstract: The opening decade of the new millennium, especially the later part, saw a surge of enthusiasm for new digital technologies and the ways in which these enable formerly passive consumers to activate themselves and engage creatively with the culture surrounding them. Music technologies played a substantial role in this phenomenon. Nowadays, any enthusiast can home-record. Sampling and manipulating pre-existing music have become much simpler. Likewise, the distribution of music is no longer difficult and expensive. It is easy and costs next to nothing. As a consequence of these developments, the question how pop music production works no longer has a<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Assimilation in the French sociology of incorporation from a multicultural perspective from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wp7qd">Secularism, Assimilation and the Crisis of Multiculturalism</a><br>
  Abstract: Assimilation is a rather unfriendly concept when used in a social context. In French, it generally means an act of the mind that considers (something) as similar (to something else). A relevant secondary meaning is the action of making (something) similar (to something else) by integration or absorption. This meaning has existed in physiology since 1495. Around 1840, the concept was related to social processes for the first time, as the act of assimilating persons and peoples; the process through which these persons, these peoples, assimilate (themselves). This connotation incorporates terms like ‘Americanisation’ and ‘Frenchisation’. The older physiological connotation shines<br>

  6  Digital Tools and the Emergence of the Social Text from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wpnfx">A New Republic of Letters</a><br>
  Abstract: Like another important edition of our time, Hans Gabler’s
                  Ulysses, J. C. C. Mays’s edition on Coleridge—three volumes, each in two parts—set an inspiring example of scholarly thoroughness and integrity.¹ But the real strength of the work rests ultimately in something else—something quite rare in the scholarly editions of English-speaking authors produced in the last fifty years. Mays is deeply sympathetic to Coleridge’s poetry—not unaware of or reticent to address its failings and limitations, but fronting all the work with what Desmond McCarthy, writing of Coleridge, called “the most delicate sympathy.” “When he writes of it<br>

  Conclusion: from:

  Abstract: Since all the cultural materials discussed in this book are resolutely Occidental, I should perhaps say something about how I’ve tried to engage with the global issues facing anyone interested in these things. For my argument holds that digital technology has realized the idea of a new Library of Alexandria. That institution’s dark reciprocal, however, is the global character of the threat to memory, epitomized in the crisis of our languages. Linguists expect that by the end of this century some half of the 7,000 currently recognized languages will be extinct. In a narrow Western view, those losses occur at<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wq429">Postmodern Texts and Emotional Audiences</a><br>
  Abstract: Postmodern literature and film have often been characterized by a thematic obsession with the disintegration of families, communities, and larger socio-political ties. Rather than painting such dark themes with the brush of tragedy, postmodern texts often adopt a tone of mocking irony or disaffected nihilism. Kathy Acker’s parodic avant-garde fiction, for example, is a complex meditation on contemporary nihilism, on the “nothingness everybody now seems to want” (
                  In Memoriam to Identity263). The hipness of postmodern disaffection was cemented with the popularity of Quentin Tarantino’s filmPulp Fiction(1994), which turns an absence of morality into fodder for black comedy.<br>

  Abstract: It is folly to think of any single historical person or event as marking the beginning of philosophy in a given culture. Still, any treatment of a philosophical tradition has to start somewhere and we may take a cue for how to proceed from Aristotle. In his narrative about the development of his own intellectual heritage, Aristotle crowned Thales of Miletus as the first philosopher (
                  Metaphysics1.3) and to the present day, most histories of western philosophy follow Aristotle’s lead. He believed Thales to be the earliest Hellenic thinker to seek not merely an explanation for everything, but an explanation<br>

                  The World of Living Things.In it he argued that since all things arise together, the “life” of the organic and inorganic should be considered as part of a single interactive world. Living subjects and the environment were part of each other, flowed into each other, and created a particular world over which each organism had some control, which he termed its “autonomy.”<br>

  Overview from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqg76">Japanese Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: The question of whether there is such a thing as samurai philosophy, and if so, what it might consist of, is one of the more complex issues in Japanese intellectual history. This is primarily due to developments that occurred during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and which are still inextricably linked to current discussions of the question. From the 1890s onward, a romanticized image of the samurai emerged, motivated by cultural and political currents at the time. The major lasting effect of this idealization was the idea that “warrior thought” represented an independent and relatively homogeneous intellectual tradition<br>

  LIFE WRITING AND THE MAKING OF COMPANIONABLE OBJECTS: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqm51">Locating Life Stories</a><br>
  Author(s) GEORGE KENNETH M.<br>
  Abstract: This essay explores some of the cultural, political, and ethical work of life writing that goes on in national and transnational art worlds. We commonly think of life writing as forms or fragments of discourse that depict the lives of human actors, and that give actors’ experiences intelligibility, purpose, and recognition. But life writing also plays a part in the making of what I call “companionable objects”—those things with which we have ethical and affective ties. Things, too, can be actors, and mingle with us in our everyday lifeworlds and publics. They, too, gain intelligibility and purpose from life<br>

  Abstract: Ryōkan has frequently suffered from being presented in one-dimensional terms. Because of his fame as a poet and a calligrapher, for example, Ryōkan is sometimes treated primarily as a literary figure. But to many ordinary Japanese, Ryōkan is above all a cultural hero, a teacher in the broadest sense of the word, one who has something to say not simply about poetry, but about life itself. This is the “Ryōkan san” familiar to millions of Japanese who may never even have attempted Ryōkan’s poems. Indeed, Ryōkan lived his life as a Zen Buddhist beggar-monk, and his poetry and other writings<br>

  Abstract: Little, if anything, is remembered about Pierre-Hyacinthe Azaïs (1766–1845). He gained some notoriety for his philosophical treatise
                  Des compensations dans les destinées humaines(1809). After 1850, he was forgotten. Only Pyrenees enthusiasts occasionally remembered him long enough to ridiculeUn mois de séjour dans les Pyrénées(Paris, 1809), a book that I am going to praise. In the 1970s, Michel Baude rediscovered and studied his extraordinary anniversary diary: from 1811 to 1844, Azaïs kept 365 parallel diaries, one for each day of the year. He was a second-rate philosopher, but a sort of genius of the personal diary. In<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqqwh">Making Transcendents</a><br>
  Abstract: In China, before there was any such thing as a Daoist¹ priest or Daoist scripture, before Buddhist scriptures and images were brought in along the Silk Road or the coast, before there were monasteries where religious practitioners from either of these traditions gathered, there existed an only loosely cohesive tradition, a body of ideas and practices that I will call the quest for transcendence. Its main elements were already in place by the late third century B.C.E., well established by the turn of the first millennium, and increasingly well documented in sources dating from the second, third, and early fourth<br>

  CHAPTER 3  Deeper Repertoire Analysis: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqqwh">Making Transcendents</a><br>
  Abstract: Because the extrinsic functions of particular repertoire features can be complex and powerful, we may learn a great deal from deeper analysis of a single, important repertoire feature: the adept’s claimed avoidance of “grains” (referred to by
                  duangu斷榖, “cutting off grains,” and other terms). Such dietary regimens, whatever their details, directed the adept to minimize or entirely avoid eating things considered to be staple foods in the surrounding culture and to subsist on something else instead, something that, we might say, was precultural or natural, often pureqi(ingested in breathing exercises) orqias available in certain rare<br>

  CHAPTER 8  Hagiographic Persuasions from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqqwh">Making Transcendents</a><br>
  Abstract: Every instance of discourse about a holy person, whether oral or written, is, among other things, an attempt at persuasion. This feature is not unique to hagiographic writings, nor is it their only feature worth examining. But it is important to ask: in hagiographies, who was attempting persuade whom of what, and how?

  6  PERSONALITY SPEAKING from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqt7p">The Melodrama of Mobility</a><br>
  Abstract: In chapter 5 we left off on the difficulties of assessing social mobility—on the Laundress’s various accounts of educating her three sons: various for the extent to which she appreciates her extended family’s contributions, and various for her account of the meaning of that education in South Korea. In both senses, we observed how her view of her own role, or agency, varied. I argued in chapter 5 that the tension between structural constraints and her own contribution to things reflects larger social debates on the course and character of South Korea’s rapid social change or “development.” Similarly, in<br>

  8  ALL IN THE FAMILY: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqt7p">The Melodrama of Mobility</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter we follow kinship lines in and out of the nuclear family: to women’s siblings, siblings-in-law, and cousins of various distances. Increasingly in anthropology, kinship is understood not as a static map of all blood relations fanning out from “ego”—the center of the traditional kinship chart—but rather as a map, however lopsided and quixotic, that traces the odd assembly of persons who matter (Carsten 2000; Stone 2000). The kinship charts in this chapter, then, aim to trace the ties across which things, ideas, and images are exchanged, and through which meaning is made. The chapter focuses<br>

  Abstract: Despite the changing perspectives in the theorization and representation of the subject in the 1980s, and despite the multifarious roles the subject was called upon to perform in the post-Mao era, one thing remained constant: the emerging new subject was expected to be an empowered being fully competent to exercise its formerly inhibited agency. Anticlimactic to the eager anticipation and passionate theoretical pleas for the autonomous subject, however, postrevolutionary literature produced an unprecedented contingent of deformed beings, as David Wang notes.¹ That a problematic subject should dominate the cathartic “literature of the wounded” and “literature of self-reflection” in the wake<br>

  Abstract: In the preceding two chapters, I concentrated on a number of works published by Han Shaogong and Can Xue in the heyday of the New Era, the mid-1980s. The two writers’ visions of the physically and symbolically deformed being are anything but congruent with the optimism of the age that had invested much of its energies and desires in the recovery of the
                  ren, the human being writ large. Despite differences in their subject matter and artistic sensibilities, Han Shaogong and Can Xue are products of the times. Embodying as well as contributing to the ethos of the 1980s, their<br>

  Abstract: “
                  Perhaps the most obvious thing about death,” write Sarah Goodwin and Elisabeth Bronfen, “is that it is always only represented.”¹ We can never truly know first hand what it would be like to be dead; we can only imagine it. This chapter is about a fantasy inside view of death. It is not an exposé of the topography or organization or activities of the afterlife, (although there are many Chinese stories that do this), but rather what it means to inhabit the subjective viewpoint of the dead. In contrast to the previous chapter, which was about imagining the Other’s dead<br>

  Abstract: In listening to Richard Rorty’s paper (see “Justice as a Larger Loyalty” in this volume), it struck me yet again that what Rorty fails to appreciate sufficiently is that workable social arrangements are
                  discoveries. As someone who identifies himself as a pragmatist, but one who hews to the Peirce-Dewey line rather than to Rortian neopragmatism, I think we need to take our discoveries rather seriously. While I agree that we should eschew paying ourselves and our ways of doing things empty compliments by designating them as “rational” in some transcendental sense, I feel as well that we should avoid needlessly<br>

  Abstract: If ever a democratic republic similar to that of the United States came to be established in a country in which earlier a single man’s power had introduced administrative centralization and had made it something accepted by custom and by law, I have no hesitation in saying that in such a republic despotism would become more intolerable than in any of the absolute monarchies of Europe.

  Author(s) Ames Roger T.<br>
  Abstract: On May 1, 1919, John Dewey arrived in China to begin his twenty-six month lecture tour. Three days later, the May Fourth uprising occurred in Beijing, initiating one of the most crucial periods in the history of modern China. In the beginning, the New Culture movement was particularly open to novel ideas and programs urging social reform, and given that the central subject of Dewey’s numerous and wide-ranging lectures was to be that of “democracy,” circumstances appeared auspicious for the positive reception of Western democratic ideas. Indeed, Dewey’s influence was significant. Among other things, soon after his arrival, efforts were<br>

  Abstract: When the dark writing that informs our environments is perceived, it can be discerned in everything. The pied beauty of clouds, foliage, and limestone walls comes into view not as a background to important events but offering an alternative focus of its own. The mackerel shimmer of offshore waves, transposed downtown, is crystalized in a hive of windows, while down below the crowds flow cinematically to and fro. Dark writing indicates the swarm of possibilities that had to be left out when this line was taken. It notates reflections, warping the grids of harborside façades into tremulous concentricities.

While we remain still ignorant of many things about the evolution of theShuihucomplex, we can now say one thing with a reasonable amount of certainty: Thefanbentext ofShuihu zhuan, which presents full-fledged vernacular prose, was “written” and repeatedly “rewritten” amid constant contacts with orality over a long time historically.

  Abstract: Kollumba (Columba) Kang Wansuk (1761–1801), who perished in the great anti-Catholic persecution of 1801, is well known among a small number of historians of Korean Catholicism, but not among more general scholars of Korean history or in the wider field of Korean Studies. She should be more broadly recognized, since aside from her importance as an early Catholic, she was also a remarkable woman who worked in a cause that unfolded outside the home in public space, something that was hardly imaginable for a woman in her time and probably without precedent in earlier Korean history.

  Author(s) VON VERSCHUER CHARLOTTE<br>
  Abstract: The elites of Kyoto — emperors, court officials, monks, literati, and poets — have been the focus of many studies of Heian Japan. What is often overlooked is that the local population in the provinces provided the food, clothing, and various supplies the elites needed to perform their daily duties. And although the commoners rarely appear in the historical sources or the literary works of the age, they were of central importance to the livelihoods of the central elites. This chapter focuses on provincial life and examines Heian society from a material point of view in an attempt to explore this codependence.<br>

  Abstract: The abuse of language has spawned innumerable errors, and the pronouncements of celebrated philosophers are all too often the product of verbal incontinence. Systematic recourse to inflated language is invariably detrimental to the ideas to be conveyed. The speaker or writer who uses the word “sincerity” at the drop of a hat is likely to be suspected of being less than sincere: the indiscriminate use of words dulls their edge. Words are cheapened through overuse; like everything else that is beautiful and rare, they gain value when held in reserve. The wise man hoards his words, rather than spending them<br>

  Author(s) Machamer Peter<br>
  Abstract: Interpreting “things” is an activity that people (and maybe some animals) engage in. Sometimes we call this activity of interpreting trying to understand or trying to make sense of something. In some sophisticated circles, interpretation is called the search for meaning. What results from interpreting is an interpretation or, perhaps, some degree of understanding. Some people might say the interpreter has found out what the meaning of something is or has constructed a meaning.<br>

  Abstract: Environmental ethics sometimes depends upon ideas of life forms immersed in a surrounding “world.”¹ For Trevor Norris, “world” is the “dynamic relatedness that grounds our identity” (see his essay in this volume). The philosopher Martin Heidegger derives the notion of “world” from his study of Jakob von Uexküll’s biological research, which suggested that different sentient life forms have different experiences of their surroundings, and hence phenomenologically (that is, experientially) different worlds. A “world” in this sense is a zone of things that surround the sentient being, which have various kinds of significance for that being.<br>

  Abstract: Religious identity’s second facet is assumption as in consciously taking something on, like assuming the responsibilities of office upon being sworn in. Usually the second facet is a response to challenges that question or present alternatives to a religious identity that, heretofore, had simply been assumed. These challenges need not result in radical change, although, as we saw earlier in some of the self-accounts, they can. More often they produce a process of distancing, uncertainty, and reformulation.<br>

While the need or desire for acceptance or inclusion may seem to signal weakness or low self-confidence, I think of it as a sign of health and as part of daily life. Even more, however, it is part of religious belief and behavior. Indeed, the religious desire for inclusion or acceptance, among other things, accounts, it seems to me, for the expectation of a positive outcome beyond death, which can arise less<br>

  Abstract: When porphyry refers (repeatedly) to Homer’s cave of the nymphs as a σύμβολου of certain hidden meanings, he is using the term in a sense that appears only in the postclassical period in ancient Greece. The early Greek term meant something quite different—so different, in fact, that we will be forced to wonder just how it developed a literary sense at all. These earliest manifestations of the Greek symbol provide insights into the trajectories the notion later follows. Of course, they do not and cannot be asked to provide some authentic glimpse of the “true” or “real” symbol, as<br>

  Abstract: The followers of Pythagoras introduced us to a sacramental dimension of the ancient concept of the symbol. The secretive tradition that grew up around the Presocratic philosopher’s legend employed his “symbols,” the short epigrammatic sayings attributed to him, as tokens of true identity and as a kind of catechism in a ritualized ascent to knowledge. They also made comparisons between Pythagoras’s symbols and the efficacious speech used in magical practices. But after the third century c.e., the idea that symbols have the power to

Not the thing itself, which I think merely there, like Transylvania, but the dread of it, which I think unfounded. It is unfounded because the moral and intellectual consequences that are commonly supposed to flow from relativism—subjectivism, nihilism, incoherence, Machiavellianism, ethical idiocy, esthetic blindness, and so on—do not in fact do so and the promised rewards of escaping its clutches, mostly having to do with pasteurized knowledge, are illusory.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rkn7">Available Light</a><br>
  Abstract: In the opening paragraphs of the introduction of his
                  Philosophical Papers, Charles Taylor confesses himself to be in the grip of an obsession.¹ He is, he says, a hedgehog, a monomaniac endlessly polemicizing against a single idea—“the ambition to model the study of man on the natural sciences.” He calls this idea many things, most often “naturalism” or “the naturalistic world view,” and he sees it virtually everywhere in the human sciences. The invasion of those sciences by alien and inappropriate modes of thought has conduced toward the destruction of their distinctiveness, their autonomy, their effectiveness, and their relevance.<br>

  XI  The World in Pieces: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rkn7">Available Light</a><br>
  Abstract: Political theory, which presents itself as addressing universal and abiding matters concerning power, obligation, justice, and government in general and unconditioned terms, the truth about things as at bottom they always and everywhere necessarily are, is in fact, and inevitably, a specific response to immediate circumstances. However cosmopolitan it may be in intent, it is, like religion, literature, historiography, or law, driven and animated by the demands of the moment: a guide to perplexities particular, pressing, local, and at hand.<br>

  Book Title: A Theory of the Trial-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burns Robert P.<br>
  Abstract: Burns explores the rich narrative structure of the trial, beginning with the lawyers' opening statements, which establish opposing moral frameworks in which to interpret the evidence. In the succession of witnesses, stories compete and are held in tension. At some point during the performance, a sense of the right thing to do arises among the jurors. How this happens is at the core of Burns's investigation, which draws on careful descriptions of what trial lawyers do, the rules governing their actions, interpretations of actual trial material, social science findings, and a broad philosophical and political appreciation of the trial as a unique vehicle of American self-government.<br>

  Chapter Six  Who Is the Subject? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rrpr">Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher</a><br>
  Abstract: Freud’s thinking about the ego combines several formulations, which begin with early modernist principles. In some sense, he draws an alliance with Descartes’s meditation, “I am a thinking thing,” as the “true” center of his identity. Indeed, the modernist endeavor to define personal identity begins by recognizing that the self cannot be derived, but instead, the Cartesian
                  cogitans—the end point of the skeptic’s query—serves as the starting point of self-consciousness.¹ Accordingly, to the extent that “identity” has a definition in the Freudian universe, it must be that which can be identified; that is, the conscious ego examines and<br>

  ELEVEN  AT THE SIGN OF THE DOVE AND SERPENT from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rwjm">The Satanic Epic</a><br>
  Abstract: We have just been exploring the contrasting but related activity of the poem’s two protagonists, Son and Satan, in Book 10. This opposition, which is essential to the combat myth Milton is retelling, is actually signalled very early in the poem and pervades it from then on. But so many things are happening in the first few lines of
                  Paradise Lostthat we are in danger of missing the wood for the trees. Thus we may miss the fact, obvious enough when we think about it, that the narration places two symbolic animals close to the beginning. First, as the<br>

  Brahms, Max Klinger, and the Promise of the Gesamtkunstwerk: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rxmx">Brahms and His World</a><br>
  Author(s) KARNES KEVIN C.<br>
  Abstract: On the first day of January 1894, the artist Max Klinger sent Brahms a remarkable gift in the form of his newest creation. That gift, a volume consisting of forty-one etchings and engravings interspersed with the complete scores of six of Brahms’s vocal works, Klinger called the
                  Brahms-Phantasie.¹ By the time Klinger unveiled his tribute to Brahms, he had achieved considerable renown as a visual artist. Indeed, as Hugo von Hofmannsthal declared, he was considered by some to be “the most original artist that Germany has the honor of calling her own.”² But theBrahms-Phantasiewas something more than just<br>

  Brahms’s Four Serious Songs, op. 121 (1914) from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rxmx">Brahms and His World</a><br>
  Author(s) KARNES KEVIN C.<br>
  Abstract: Brahms left us several written statements about his
                  Four Serious Songs, the maestro’s final work, designated opus 121. These statements—sometimes running parallel to, other times diverging from his verbal remarks—might seem to contradict each other. At first glance, the contradictions appear to be profound. However, a closer look does away with them completely. The first thing one notes is the jovial, almost frivolous tone with which Brahms speaks of the “godlessSchnadahüpferln,” the “Schnadahüpferlnof May 7,” or simply the “Schnadahüpferln,” as if it were obvious that he could only be referring, with this term, to the Four<br>

  Brahms and the Newer Generation: from:

  Author(s) FRISCH WALTER<br>
  Abstract: When I think of the time during which I had the fortune to know Brahms personally—it was during the last two years of his life—I can recall immediately how his music affected me and my colleagues in composition, including Schoenberg. It was fascinating, its influence inescapable, its effect intoxicating. I was still a pupil at the Vienna Conservatory and knew most of Brahms’s works thoroughly. I was obsessed by this music. My goal at the time was nothing less than the appropriation and mastery of this wonderful, singular compositional technique.<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  “The Only Villain among the Crowd of Noble Characters” from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7s0j7">Freud's Wishful Dream Book</a><br>
  Abstract: The last two stories embedded in the dream book certainly pose something of a puzzle. They are not about dreams, they feature the censorship, and—as I trust I have shown—they are spurious. The first is blatantly anecdotal, a joke on women clearly meant to amuse; the second is part fiction, part autobiography, and finally neither one nor the other. Yet the pair of stories, supposedly about actual consultations involving a careless girl and naughty boy, offer the last evidence in the book for Freud’s theory as well as the last bit of humor. Except for the humor, they<br>

  Book Title: Performing Africa-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): EBRON PAULLA A.<br>
  Abstract: The
         jali--a member of a hereditary group of Mandinka professional performers--is a charismatic but contradictory figure. He is at once the repository of his people's history, the voice of contemporary political authority, the inspiration for African American dreams of an African homeland, and the chief entertainment for the burgeoning transnational tourist industry. Numerous journalists, scholars, politicians, and culture aficionados have tried to pin him down. This book shows how the jali's talents at performance make him a genius at representation--the ideal figure to tell us about the "Africa" that the world imagines, which is always a thing of illusion, magic, and contradiction.<br>

  PART ONE  Representations / Performances from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7s6ph">Performing Africa</a><br>
  Abstract: Cultural theorist Homi Bhabha has suggested that there is something in the nature of stereotypes that makes them easy to utter repetitively (1983). For Bhabha, this repetition can be attributed to the role of stereotypes in the making of the psyche. Yet it is also possible that speakers are caught up in repetitive modes, that is, narrative conventions that encourage them to repeat stereotypes, which allow them to remain in the conversation. Conversations, then, as well as psyches, are constituted in repetitions of their foundational frameworks. These ideas provide a context in which to discuss my interpretative lens for understanding<br>

  Abstract: The prevailing opinion about the character of reason renders this Platonic paradox quite unthinkable today. Philosophers, we learn in Plato’s fable, are ruled by reason; yet in what sense could it possibly be true that reason is necessary to

  Abstract: In the last chapter we studied different forms of externality, of that which is other than self, and we considered the necessity of authority for an idea of the self as something beyond a mere bundle of desires. Moreover, we argued that it was only with the transcendent (what Rudolf Otto termed the
                  ganz Anderen, or wholly other) that the self as locus of moral decision making can exist.¹ Only with the emergence of this dimension of existence is it possible to keep the sacred from collapsing into mere idolatry and thereby to sustain those assumptions about a realm free<br>

That conflict was a cultural and political watershed; it marked the beginning of Europe’s political and cultural decline and set in motion a chain of events that led to an even more destructive war. Without World War I we might have been spared the horrors of communism, Auschwitz, and the Cold War.

  Abstract: Some of the more interesting things that Christianity has to say about territorial boundaries come by way of its views on the nation, national identity and loyalty, and nationalism. Historically, of course, Christianity—or, rather, Christians—have said different and sometimes quite contradictory things on these topics. Some have considered each nation to be specially ordained by the eternal God, while others have stressed the mutable historicality of national compositions and boundaries.¹ Some have virtually equated loyalty to the nation with loyalty to God, while others have regarded it as inimical to pacific, universalist Christian faith.

  7  Pluralism as a Matter of Principle from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7t1pt">Christian Political Ethics</a><br>
  Author(s) SKILLEN JAMES W.<br>
  Abstract: David Little builds his case for a ʺweak theoryʺ of ethical pluralism largely on the basis of what he calls ʺconscientious individualism.ʺ In response, I would like to argue that something broader and deeper than conscientious individualism is needed to account for both the diversity of ethical responsibilities that humans bear and the diverse, often incompatible ways they exercise those responsibilities. By enlarging and strengthening the normative basis, I believe it is possible to develop a strong, principled argument for pluralism, which is not the same as a defense of ethical relativism.<br>

  11  Just War Thinking in Catholic Natural Law from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7t1pt">Christian Political Ethics</a><br>
  Author(s) BOYLE JOSEPH<br>
  Abstract: I am in substantial agreement with the analysis in John Finnisʹs chapter. Indeed, it is as good a short statement of just war theory within the Catholic natural law tradition as I know of. Given this, I think the most useful contributions I can make are to underline certain points that seem to me to be important, to develop some of the distinctions Finnis makes, and to draw out some of the implications of his analysis. I will also say something more than Finnis does about conscientious objection and the duty of citizens to support their nationʹs war efforts.<br>

  Author(s) KOONTZ THEODORE J.<br>
  Abstract: I have four aims in this chapter. The first is to describe briefly something of the range of views that may fit under the heading ʺChristian nonviolence.ʺ The second is to give an account of the context out of which it makes sense to be committed to a certain kind of Christian nonviolence (ʺpacifismʺ). The third is to note how, from this pacifist perspective, the questions posed to just war theorists and realists are not the central questions about peace and war, and how focusing on them in fact distorts our thinking. The fourth is to attempt, nevertheless, to deal<br>

This question reads like one of those conundrums in philosophy, prompting the reflective to ask, “Who is this ‘I,’ then?” As an instance of discourse in an autobiography, it seems doubly problematic, for autobiography is nothing if not a referential art, and the self or subject is its principal referent.

  Abstract: It is February of 2003; the poet has just turned off the evening news. The buildup to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq goes without saying. Sleet is “slashing” outside on this “bitter evening,” while C. K. Williams’s attention wanders to the hearth.¹ There he sees a plastic coffee cup teetering “on a log for a strangely long time, / as though uncertain what to do” (7–8). The hesitation and subsequent collapse of this strange “creaturely” thing calls forth a series of meditations on<br>

  CHAPTER THREE  War in the Air from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7t6rs">War at a Distance</a><br>
  Abstract: Poets of the late eighteenth century ask us to see in the snows of winter a history of warfare, with its anesthetizing threat to both history and writing. They conjure prospect poems where the view looks out upon total annihilation. Yet in their mining of the literary tradition and the resources of figuration, they disrupt that prospect, insisting that beneath and within the snow we recognize something still surviving. So much is written into the snow that these poems suggest the value of, indeed the need for a wartime rereading of that most romantic trope, the weather. To the precise<br>

  IV  On the Very Idea of a Metaphysics of Right from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7t8mt">Politics and the Imagination</a><br>
  Abstract: Since the very idea that there could be a “metaphysics” of “right” is by no means self-evident, what would motivate someone to think it was possible, advisable, or necessary to develop such a thing? One suggestion is the following: We notice that conceptions of “right” change dramatically from one society and era to another. Thus Roman law was based on a distinction between free persons and slaves. Slaves were considered to be “in the power” of their owners: they had no legal personality at all (

  Author(s) ALEXANDER AMIR<br>
  Abstract: Sometime in the fifth century BC, the Pythagorean philosopher Hippasus of Metapontum proved that the side of a square is incommensurable with its diagonal. The discovery was quickly recognized to have far-reaching implications, for it thoroughly challenged the Pythagorean belief that everything in the world could be described by whole numbers and their ratios. Sadly for Hippasus, he did not live long enough to enjoy the fame of his mathematical breakthrough. Shortly after making his discovery, he traveled aboard ship and was lost at sea.<br>

  Abstract: Every mathematical argument tells a story. But where is that story located? Do the chapters open in Plato’s heaven, outside time, outside the cave of mere human projection? Is the true story of mathematics something so far beyond spelunking materiality that intuitions and mere images must be left behind?

  Author(s) LA NAVE FEDERICA<br>
  Abstract: The story of a mathematical discovery is often presented as a linear succession of events corresponding to a series of logical steps leading up to the moment of discovery by proof. The discovery itself takes on the character of a “truth revelation.” Such an accounting is cathartic. It makes us feel good about ourselves; it gives us confidence in the power of our mind. But is a sequence of logical steps all there is behind proving something in mathematics? When telling a story, one naturally lapses into a linear mode. But when trying to locate the history of a discovery,<br>

Its challenge to maximalist, bipolar thinking and its argument for the middle ground makes meta-utopian fiction very much of a piece with current social, literary, and philosophical discourse.

Benjamin Haydon, for instance, said that though Wordsworth was a “great Being,” he could use his intense feelings only “as referring to himself.”² Coleridge, indeed, observed as early as 1799 that “Wordsworth appears to me to have hurtfully segregated & isolated his Being/Doubtless, his delights are more deep and sublime;/but he<br>

None of Darwin’s reading seems to have been in vain. It was all useable, and used, though relatively little of it was undertaken in a utilitarian spirit. We might apply the remarks of one of his favorite authors, Sir Thomas Browne, who wrote in the

  Abstract: In the preceding chapter, I argued that we can retain the broad genre-concepts as interpretive models, provided that we regard those concepts as reflexive. The concepts themselves are fully interpreted only in the act of interpreting particular works. It follows from the reflexivity of the genre-concepts that the concepts by themselves are insufficient to “prove” that some particular work is a lyric, an epic, or a drama. We

  Abstract: Adopting any model of literary interpretation plunges one at once into enormously involved philosophical problems. I have provisionally put forward a model on Heideggerian lines. But the model is Heideggerian
                  onlyin that it accepts Heidegger’s crucial notion that interpretation is a making-explicit of what is already grasped (“understood”), but not fully articulated, in our encounters with literary works. What concerns me here is something I have previously mentioned in passing—namely, the fact that a Heideggerian model might seem to lead inevitably to a strict relativism, and, therefore, to the conclusion that knowledge in the human studies is impossible.<br>

  CHAPTER IV  Gestures Toward a Literary History of Lyric from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zttcz">The Three Genres and the Interpretation of Lyric</a><br>
  Abstract: It is time to ask how our model can help to articulate interpretations. Our discussion of genre suggested that to read a poem as lyric is to read it as creating a reciprocal relation between mind and world. Such reflections do not by themselves suffice to ground a hermeneutic theory or a program of interpretation. In one sense, the model is hostile to anything that resembles a program, for we have insisted that interpretation is the making-explicit of what is already understood.

  6  Labor from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztzd7">The Social Vision of William Blake</a><br>
  Abstract: The opposite of liberty, Christian or civil, is slavery, but slavery is also the antithesis of creative labor. When we allow a tyrant to get control of our spirits or our cities, the first thing he will do is put us to work at backbreaking and stultifying tasks. Blake felt the tyranny of the English Church and state not only in its censorship and prosecution of radical writers but also in the way it governed public taste, driving radical artists to drudgery for the market. The Hebrew slaves built pyramids for the Egyptians; Blake engraved other people’s designs for other<br>

  7  Time, Eternity, and History from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztzd7">The Social Vision of William Blake</a><br>
  Abstract: For the realm we enter when our imagination is fully awake, Blake at first preferred the term “infinite.” “He who sees the Infinite in all things sees God.” Ezekiel wanted to raise men “into a perception of the infinite.” The Atlantic Ocean has already barred out the “infinite mountains of light” (of Atlantis) and now threatens to overwhelm America, “another portion of the infinite.” Oothoon tells how her “infinite brain” was inclosed in a circle by those who instructed her in Lockean philosophy (E 3, 39, 56, 47).

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv117">Eros the Bittersweet</a><br>
  Abstract: There is something pure and indubitable about the notion that eros is lack. Moreover, it is a notion that, once adopted, has a powerful effect on one’s habits and representations of love. We can see this most clearly in an example: consider Sappho’s fragment 31, which is one of the best-known love poems in our tradition.<br>

  My Page Makes Love from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv117">Eros the Bittersweet</a><br>
  Abstract: A few examples are in order. The novelist Longus (second-third century a.d.) prefaces his novel
                  Daphnis and Chloewith a bold statement of the triangular tension that is its structure and raison d’être. He was moved to write the tale, he tells us, because he encountered “a painted image of the history of Eros” that struck him as the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. Longing (pothos) seized him to “create a rival image in writing” and he set to work on the novel. There are three components in Longus’ opening conceit. There is the painted icon of Eros,<br>

  Realist from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv117">Eros the Bittersweet</a><br>
  Abstract: It is nothing new to say that all utterance is erotic in some sense, that all language shows the structure of desire at some level. Already in Homer’s usage, the same verb (
                  mnaomai) has the meaning ‘to give heed, to make mention’ and also the meaning ‘to court, woo, be a suitor.’ Already in ancient Greek myth, the same goddess (Peithō) has charge of rhetorical persuasion and the arts of seduction. Already in earliest metaphor, it is ‘wings’ or ‘breath’ that move words from speaker to listener as they move eros from lover to beloved. But words that are written<br>

  Something Serious Is Missing from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv117">Eros the Bittersweet</a><br>
  Abstract: The static blooms of Adonis provide us with an answer to our question ‘What would the lover ask of time?’ As Plato formulates it, the answer brings us once again to the perception that lovers and readers have very similar desires. And the desire of each is something paradoxical. As lover you want ice to
                  beice and yet not melt in your hands. As reader you want knowledge tobeknowledge and yet lie fixed on a written page. Such wants cannot help but pain you, at least in part, because they place you at a blind point from<br>

  Then Ends Where Now Begins from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv117">Eros the Bittersweet</a><br>
  Abstract: On the observable facts of erotic experience Sokrates and Lysias are in rough agreement, but there is a world of difference between the readings they give to those facts. The facts are that eros changes you so drastically you seem to become a different person. In conventional thinking, such changes are best categorized as madness. What is the best thing to do with a mad person? Write him out of your novel, is Lysias’ answer. It is an answer that would make some sense to his contemporaries, for his version of eros proceeds from thoroughly conventional premises. It conceives of<br>

  Abstract: It is perhaps only a literary critic’s wishful thinking that Herman Melville’s transcendentalist confidence-man, Mark Winsome, resembles a portrait of Emerson. Yet Melville’s character from
                  The Confidence-Manpoints out how easily the Emersonian rhetoric of power and self-reliance, a rhetoric that empties itself of practical meanings and references, could be taken up by the industrialists to justify their materialism.¹ Or we may want to see Ahab, glorying in his “inexorable self,” as another parodic echo of Emersonian idealism as he exclaims, “What things real are there but imponderable thoughts.”² My point is not that there is some recoverable line of<br>

  TWO  The Body of the Sign from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv1rc">Shakespeare</a><br>
  Abstract: All shifts in modern sympathies notwithstanding, the perplexing thing about late medieval theater is still its radical union of drama with doctrine. I do not mean that there is trouble believing in the orthodoxy of the nonliturgical religious stage: despite a resurgence of Marxist criticism, and our increasing awareness of the dialogic character of all texts, I would not want to claim that the plays embody a dialectical tension between official teaching and popular expression or entertainment.¹ The difficulty, rather, is the absence of such a contradiction, and of any other obvious opposition in these texts between earnest and game,<br>

  Abstract: Though the novel’s title focuses the reader’s attention on what he may well expect to be its central subject, such expectations are frustrated from the start, since the opening chapters focus on Charles, not Emma. Nor is this narrative focus a stable one, as soon becomes evident when other disconcerting hurdles are encountered. Through jarring contrasts and shifting perspectives, Flaubert’s reader is soon drawn into a more active, hermeneutic reading; the central question is no longer “What will happen next?” but, rather, “Why are things told that way?” This heightened attention to narrative form takes us beyond the story world<br>

  CHAPTER 5  INVENTING SECULAR HISTORY: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv52h">Shakespeare and the Dramaturgy of Power</a><br>
  Abstract: When Elizabethan playwrights turned to their own history, they had no classical models to guide them and therefore no ascribed social expectations to meet in shaping their material. If Shakespeare was the first in this field, as he may well have been, he had to find a pattern of his own. The anonymous popular play,
                  The Famous Victories of Henry V, may have preceded theHenry VIplays, but if it did, Shakespeare eschewed it as a model, though he learned some important things from it, which he put to use when he wrote his own series of plays about<br>

  CHAPTER 6  THE ELIZABETHAN HAL from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv52h">Shakespeare and the Dramaturgy of Power</a><br>
  Abstract: Shakespeare did not abandon his critical interest in Elizabethan power when he dramatized the reigns of the three kings preceding Henry VI; if anything, he made it clearer. The topicality of one these plays,
                  Richard II, seems to have been recognized at once, not only by the censor, who prudently refused to permit publication of the deposition scene, but by the followers of the earl of Essex, who daringly commissioned a revival of the play on the eve of Essex’s rebellion, and by the queen herself, who ominously claimed to know that she “was” Richard II.¹ This is not to<br>

  AFTERWORD: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv52h">Shakespeare and the Dramaturgy of Power</a><br>
  Abstract: The difference between Shakespeare’s early romantic comedies and his late romances can be understood, to a very considerable extent, as a difference in the ruling taste. The static dramaturgy and rhetorical virtuosity of
                  Love’s Labors Lostare a response to the fashion created by John Lyly, whose linguistic preciosity, in turn, sums up the Tudor endorsement of literacy as an innovative sign of social privilege. Evidence of a similar preoccupation with language appears in the mature romantic comedies as well, particularlyAs You Like It and Much Ado about Nothing. The spectacular dramaturgy of the romances, on the other hand,<br>

  Abstract: HE RANGE of works typed as “commentary” may vary widely.

  Tapping the Roots: from:

  Author(s) Barnwell Kathryn<br>
  Abstract: “The Dreamers” was probably the first story of Seven Gothic Tales tohave been written after Dinesen returned to Rungstedlund, having left her African life behind her. And since she did nothing to discourage a comparison between herself and Pellegrina Leoni, the story’s mysterious central figure, we might suppose that this particular tale had a special significance for its author. Like Pellegrina, Dinesen had suffered loss by fire, had attempted suicide¹ and was forced to leave behind a life which had seemed perfectly resonant of her deepest self. Also like her heroine,Dinesen ever after mistrusted investing herself fully in one persona.In<br>

  Isak Dinesen Among the Victorians: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvc7">Isak Dinesen and Narrativity</a><br>
  Author(s) Stambaugh Sara<br>
  Abstract: In 1985 I participated in the Karen Blixen/Isak Dinesen InternationalConference hosted by Poul Houe at the University of Minnesota. As I recall, of the opening speakers (not listed on the program), three, including Robert Langbaum, emphasized that reading Dinesen had shifted their perceptions and changed their way of reading. Like Malli in Dinesen's “Tempests,” I was struck, because Isak Dinesen had done the same thing tome. In this paper, therefore, I want to explain how Dinesen illustrates the reading of British Victorian literature and vice versa. In fact, my paper could perhaps be subtitled “An Apologia for a Victorian Scholar's<br>

  Abstract: In a review of the Rockefeller Foundation report on
                  The Humanities in American Life, Hilton Kramer remarks that “we are a long way here from Matthew Arnold’s notion of trying ‘to know the best that is known and thought in the world.’ ” And he ruefully observes that “Arnold’s name … is never mentioned in this report, which so systematically avoids any mention of our classic writers that one is left wondering what this committee has in mind when it speaks of the humanities.”¹ Once the inspiration of humanistic study in England and America, Arnold has now become something of<br>

  Chapter 4  FROM ONE RENAISSANCE TO ANOTHER from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvdgf">History as a Visual Art in the Twelfth-Century Renaissance</a><br>
  Abstract: The premise that historical writing was an instrument of cognition depended on abstract ideas about cognition. Those ideas concerned the process of coming to know, rather than particular things that were known. The difference in literary form between historical texts of the twelfth century and those of the fifteenth and later indicates a profound change, not only in style, but also, at a far deeper level, in the ways in which the conditions, possibilities, and limits of cognition were conceived. I have two tasks in this chapter. The first is to trace some lines of continuity in modes of representation<br>

From the sentence, we moved to patterns of interpretation, including a strategy of proof, that made the sentence possible. Those patterns circled around two common paradigms, the biological and esthetic, both dealing with the formal coherence of separate things, and with the dynamic by which it becomes possible for many individuals to participate in the same coherence and thus to become one.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvn6q">Neverending Stories</a><br>
  Author(s) Hoesterey Ingeborg<br>
  Abstract: The analysis of narrative technique in fiction has generally been considered something of a craft, practiced at times with painstaking descriptive precision and analytic power, and predominandy used in the service of interpretation. Narratology has often been mentioned in the same breath with structuralism, for both aspire to systematic comprehensiveness and attempt to identify and classify mechanisms and structures that generate, respectively, cultural and textual meaning. To be sure, “low structuralism” (as Robert Scholes was to call Genettean narratology) could not have matured in the sixties and seventies without the tradition of close textual analysis inaugurated by New Criticism.¹ Structuralist<br>

  Abstract: I am concerned with the logic of justification informing Robert Musil’s first novel,
                  Young Törless(1906).¹ The novel appears to do everything in its power to ward off moral criticism. It is doubly, triply insulated against it. I shall discuss the various strategies of narrative and persuasion by which the novel achieves a certain dandylike countenance of impassiveness and superiority. I do not believe that Musil consciously set about constructing fortifications around his work in order to defend against scandal, yet it is as ifYoung Törlesshad in fact been constructed that way.

  Abstract: The juniper tree” has long been recognized as one of the most powerful of all fairy tales. Its widespread dissemination across the map of European folklore—one monograph identifies several hundred versions of the tale—suggests that there must be something especially attractive or at least compelling about the tale.

  Abstract: Western philosophy since Descartes has been marked by certain seminal books whose concern is the nature and scope of human knowledge. After Descartes's

  Abstract: Kripke first became known for technical work on modal logic, the logic of necessity and possibility, much of it done in the late 1950s as a high-school student, and summarized in Kripke (1963). (Among other things this work popularized a revival of the picturesque Leibnizian language according to which necessity is truth in all possible worlds.) Under the influence of Kripke's later work philosophers have come to distinguish several conceptions of necessity and possibility, in a manner to be described below; but Kripke’s early technical work was not tied to any special conception.

His Islam, to be sure, did end antiquity—and in so doing, initiated something epochally new.

  Author(s) MANGANARO MARC<br>
  Abstract: This anthology is born out of a number of critical developments in the past twenty-five years that have brought about, among other things, a coalescence of anthropology and current theories on discourse emerging from literary and other cultural studies. Perhaps most important, recent anthropological writing has called into question the legitimacy with which we represent the “Other” in cultural written accounts. Indeed, insights gained into the nature of representation and power relations have made impossible the comfortable assumption that other cultures can be grasped, categorized, and put on paper. The recognition that cultural representation is inherently problematic is of course<br>

  Abstract: This book began with an image of the writer writing, an icon for a concept of literature based on a commonplace concept of human action. It is a concept of literature that situates agency in an individual human being. Texts, in this perspective, are the actions of individual writers. They can be understood in the same way that we understand other human actions undertaken by individuals. Writing, looked upon in this way, is one of a range of things that people do. It is better documented than many other human activities, but it is not isolated from them. On the<br>

  Author(s) BRADDOCK GLENN<br>
  Abstract: In the space of one paragraph at the end of
                     The Humanism of Existentialism, Jean-Paul Sartre makes two apparently conflicting claims. He says in one sentence that, “Existentialism is nothing else than an attempt to draw all the consequences of a coherent atheistic position.” Three sentences later, he tells us that existentialism “declares that even if God did exist, that would change nothing. There you’ve got our point of view. Not that we believe thatGod exists, but that we think that the problem of His existence is not the issue.”¹<br>

  Abstract: In the conclusion of his major treatise,
                  Being and Nothingness, Jean-Paul Sartre announces that his next endeavour will be to deal with ethics. In the last section, “Ethical Implications,” he tells of how ontology and existential psychoanalysis can inform the individual that he or she is free and the source of all values. However, ontology and existential psychoanalysis cannot give moral prescriptions. All questions relative to freedom and how this freedom will deal with its situation are questions “which refer us to a pure and not an accessory reflection, [and] can find their reply only on the ethical plane.

  Abstract: The first thing that comes to mind when I hear the term “transdisciplinarity” is problem-centered investigations in contrast to “discipline-centered investigations.” Disciplines provide methods of investigation and therotical frameworks that inform the methods of inquiry. The questions asked are based on what has been accomplished in the past. Natural science is largely incremental. We build on prior work. The lattice of concepts and theories is self-reinforcing. It is only during periods of major paradigm shifts or scientific revolutions when one experiences the collapse of the entire structure. That may mean the theory has been replaced, but it doesn’t necessarily implied<br>

  Abstract: Architectural design entails the conscious enactment of a comprehensive decision-making endeavour, which necessitates, on the part of the architect, a never-ending sequence of value judgements. In all cases, the formulation of judgements requires the explicit use of criteria. In this context, a criterion may be understood as a standard by which a thing is assessed. Whether explicitly expressed or not, the validity of the criteria depends upon how well they conform to corresponding human values, which, in turn, underpin judgements.

                  The Antichristas the deification of nothingness, the will to nothingness pronounced holy (section 18). No thinker in history has been so obsessed with God as was Nietzsche, nor has any other thinker, with the possible exception of his deepest predecessors, Spinoza and Hegel, so fully known and envisioned the totality of God, a totality which is finally inseparable from consciousness itself. But it was Nietzsche who discovered the nihilistic identity of the<br>

  Author(s) Strong Tracy B.<br>
  Abstract: Even for our grandparents, a “home,” a “well,” a familiar tower, their very clothes, their coat, were infinitely more, infinitely more intimate; almost everything a vessel in which they found the human and added to the store of the human. Now … empty indifferent things are pouring across … sham things, dummy life …; a house [now], … an apple or a grapevine, … has nothing in common with the house, the fruit, the grape into which went the hopes and reflections of our forefathers. …<br>

  Author(s) Brown Richard S.G.<br>
  Abstract: In
                  Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche makes the rather categorical claim: “… the awakened and knowing say: body am I entirely, and nothing else; and soul is only a word for something about the body” (part one, 4). In a work which is replete with exaggeration couched in poetic, figurative, and metaphoric language, one fact might easily be overlooked. Nietzsche is making this claim literally and takes this claim very seriously: “Body am I entirely.” Within the context ofZarathustra, a book which is addressed to “all or no one,” Nietzsche attempts to persuade those few who are capable of actualizing<br>

  Abstract: In spite of notable efforts by medieval theologians and modern constitutional lawyers to render their respective crafts esoteric, some things remain fundamentally simple. That is to say, their essentials can be understood by lay people possessing a little detachment and good will. Among these simple matters we may rank the basic relationship between Francophones and Anglophones in Canada, which appears reasonably clear to most informed observers outside the country, but which is obscured for many Canadians by the shadows and myths of the cave society in which they pass their lives. My main argument in this paper is that the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt807k6">Mind in Creation</a><br>
  Author(s) KNEALE J. DOUGLAS<br>
  Abstract: According to certain recent publications, the figure of apostrophe or
                  aversiohas become something of an “embarrassment.” Jonathan Culler, in an essay entitled “Apostrophe,” claims that whatever else apostrophes may be, “above all they are embarrassing: embarrassing to me and to you.” Because it is allegedly so embarrassing, the figure, Culler asserts, has been “systematically repressed or excluded by critics”; more specifically, Mary Jacobus argues, it has been “regularly ignored by writers on the ode.”¹ In another essay Culler repeats his thesis: “Apostrophes are awkward and embarrassing. ... Critics either ignore them or transform apostrophe into description.”² And once more,<br>

  Abstract: A comparative study of Wallace Stevens and T.S. Eliot might be seen as an unpromising enterprise since one of the most notable things about the relationship between them is that it was virtually non-existent. When William Van O’Connor claimed in
                  The Shaping Spiritthat Stevens knew Eliot “only slightly and principally through correspondence,” Stevens took the trouble to write to him: “As a matter of fact, I don’t know him at all and have had no correspondence whatever with him ...

  Abstract: Eliot regretted the failure of the belief that had permeated European and American culture, but he did not evidently share Stevens’ distaste for having “to think all these things over,” and persisted in a search for an unqualified belief. Like many converts, once baptized, Eliot led a much more pious and dutiful religious life than most of his fellow Anglicans. He apparently needed a degree of certainty that, as he told Montgomery Belgion,¹ his study of Bradley had not provided.<br>

  5  Eliot, Stevens, and “Pale Ramon” Fernandez from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt809f7">The Modern Dilemma</a><br>
  Abstract: Like Eliot, Stevens flirted with Humanism as a response to the modern dilemma, and like him he found it wanting. As we have seen, poems like “Sunday Morning,” “Le Monocle de Mon Oncle,” and “The Comedian as the Letter C” express a disbelief characteristic of Humanism. The nearest thing to an admission that he was once attracted to Humanism is Stevens’ remark on his disaffection with Arnold in the letter of June 1953 to Barbara Church, cited above. Referring to Arnold’s Humanism, he remarked: “Anyhow, it may be that I don’t belong to that church anymore, or that I don’t<br>

  Abstract: Métis stories are something like the Rigoureau, the shape-changing wolf-man character which often appears in those stories. The Rigoureau is an amalgam of European werewolf legendry and Oji-Cree shape-changer narratives, and perhaps because of this it is a creature of liminality, a dangerous passe-partout, a trickster, a traitor, a folk hero, an outsider. In other words, it is the perfect metaphor for the slipperiness of Métis identity itself. I grew up hearing Rigoureau stories, and I was even told once that my Uncle Vic

  Abstract: NAMES, ACCORDING TO PLATO, ARE INSTRUMENTS that help us distinguish and teach the essence of things.¹ With a similar notion in mind, many of us architects wonder from time to time about the meaning and origins of our architectural expressions. Tracing back terms to their origins offers a way to reach an initial, and perhaps authentic, state of things, to rediscover threads of continuity and to reaffirm their importance. Words such as “architect,” “architecture,” “tectonics,” “technology,” “technic,” “dome,” and “domicile” are among many architectural terms of Greek origin.

Not that he did not yearn and seek after unity, and find it in the experience of Christian faith/love. But his fundamental conviction was that any unity, however arrived at, which erased, “annulled,” or even blurred “life's doubleness” would lead to the loss of freedom and to the absorption and destruction of the human individual, of human “existence.” This duality is at the base<br>

  Abstract: What is Kierkegaard saying about freedom in this formulation? Clearly, he is rejecting the idea that human “freedom” is nothing more than the immanent, inferential, necessary working out of the inherent potentialities of one’s given finitude. And, as already noted above, freedom is something more, something

  CHAPTER FIVE  The Uriage Network, 1941: from:

  Abstract: The school would remain the fixed point to which they could return to recharge their spiritual batteries when they were badly treated by life’s realities. They would think healthily again, and see things simply; once again they would shed the egotism and cupidity of modern life and experience that same state of spirit in which, at the end of their course, they had taken their oath at the foot of the flag.¹<br>

  CHAPTER NINE  De Gaulle, the Network, and the Liberation from:

  Abstract: While the Free French in London knew very little about Pierre Dimoyer de Segonzac, the Uriage community, or the Order,¹ their informers in France sent strong warnings about the youth organizations that promoted the fascistic regimentation of French young people. An anonymous young intellectual of the Gaullist resistance, describing the state of the leading legal youth organizations in spring 1942, saw the French Scouts as “the conscious or unconscious, admitted or unacknowledged inspiration for everything that the RN did in the area of youth.” He noted that Father Doncoeur’s

  Abstract: Various Miracles, the title of Carol Shields’s first collection of short stories, encapsulates her attitude towards the everyday: she sees it as a mix of the ordinary and the extraordinary – “various” usually refers to different things but often within the same general category, while, in contrast, “miracles” hints at the religious and the sacred.

  3  Terre des hommes from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt80wsr">Aphorism in the Francophone Novel of the Twentieth Century</a><br>
  Abstract: It is not surprising that Antoine de Saint-Exupéry would demonstrate a penchant for aphoristic discourse, in light of his early attraction to Nietzsche and his lifelong admiration for Pascal. Whether it is a question of influence or simple affinity matters little for our purposes here; suffice it to say that we are often reminded of the sententiousaphoristic style of these two predecessors as we read Saint-Exupéry’s text. The most clear-cut manifestation of the style in question occurs in Saint-Exupéry’s highly aphoristic

  Author(s) Woods G.A.<br>
  Abstract: The second volume of a series, especially if it deals with a very young girl, is the hardest for me to write—because the public and the publisher won’t allow me to write of a young girl as she really is. One can write of children as they always are; so my books of children are always good; but when you come to write of the “miss” you have to depict a sweet, insipid young thing—really a child grown older—to whom the basic realities of life and reactions to them are quite unknown.

  Abstract: The presence of a contingent of Jewish Socialists in La France libre was a source of concern to de Gaulle, not because of any personal antipathy (he had great respect for Léon Blum) but because it caused deep resentment among many of the officers who had rallied to his cause and because it offered an easy target to Vichy propagandists, who tried to fix the blame for France’s collapse on Blum’s Popular Front administration (as well as on Jews in general).

  CHAPTER TWO  Phenomenology from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt81dhr">Philosophy of Merleau-Ponty</a><br>
  Abstract: Many philosophers influenced the direction of Merleau-Ponty's thinking, as was shown in Chapter 1, but the single most significant influence was that of Edmund Husserl (1859-1938) and the “phenomenological” school that he founded. If we are to understand Merleau-Ponty properly, we have to see him above all in relation to phenomenology. At least in his major works, he certainly saw himself as a phenomenologist, and even the other influences on his thought were filtered through his conception of phenomenology. And, clearly, if we are to understand Merleau-Ponty's relationship to Husserlian phenomenology, we must first say something about Husserl's own thought.<br>

                  objectivistpicture of the world (including even our own bodies) as existing entirely independent of ourselves and interacting with our experience in a merely causal fashion. There is nothing wrong with this picture in its own context; if we are to study the world scientifically, then we need to set aside<br>

Cosmology develops fast: numerous conferences, workshops, and public lectures are held constantly, resulting in further publications of collective volumes, and numerous new studies, academic and popular, appear daily on the Internet and in bookstores.

  7  The Universe as a Saturated Phenomenon from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0sq9">The Sense of the Universe</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the tasks of the dialogue between theology and science is to elucidate in the modern scientific and philosophical context the sense of what is meant by creation of the world out of nothing (
                  creatio ex nihilo). As is often argued in current discussions on the theme, the adequate theological appropriation of the scientific approach to the study of the natural universe is possible only if nature and the universe are treated not as an “environment” for physical and biological existence, but as creation. This implies not only a dispassionate study of the universe which is contingent upon God,<br>

                     Sermones, then, is their ability to portray something of what Augustine thought about ordinary human relationships.

                  somethingabout the multifaceted forms of human difference seems self-evident. However, feminist theology has been squeamish about the biblical creation narrative, not only because of certain masculine notions of the Creator God,¹ but also because of the particularities of male and female in the creation account. There is the difficulty of the Yahwist creation account in Genesis 2—especially the provision of woman to man—and the overwhelming binary force of<br>

  Abstract: Does language simply reflect the world in which we live, or instead shape it so that we see things differently as a result of using one language to express ourselves rather than another? On the basis both of personal experience and of the conclusions reached by some major European philosophers, I would say “yes” to the second alternative. With respect to personal experience, for example, in the 1960s after being ordained a priest at a Jesuit seminary here in the United States, I received permission from my religious superiors to do a final year of spiritual reflection and pastoral training<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0vjs">The World in the Trinity</a><br>
  Abstract: Part One of this book was basically philosophical in its orientation. In chapter 1, I proposed that our understanding of the world around us is at least partly conditioned by the language we habitually employ. Given our Western emphasis on the priority of nouns to verbs in sentence construction, we tend to see the world in terms of individual things with various contingent relationships to one another. An emphasis on verbs, however, might lead us to the belief that physical reality is in flux and seems to be constituted by coordinated processes or systems. Moreover, contemporary scientists tend to think<br>

  Book Title: The Future of the Word-An Eschatology of Reading<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Kriner Tiffany Eberle<br>
  Abstract: In scripture, Jesus promises a future that potentiall infuses all texts: "my words will not pass away" (Matt 24:28). This book argues that texts--even literary texts--, have an eschatology, too, a part of God's purpose for the cosmos. They, with all creation, moves toward participation in the new creation, in the Trinity's expanding, creative love. This eschatological future for texts impacts how we understand meaning making, from the level of semiology to that of hermeneutics. This book tells he story of how readers participate in the future of the word, the eschatology of texts. If texts have a future i the kingdom of God, then readers' engagement with them--everything from preservation and utterance to translation, criticism, and call and response--can cultivate those futures in the love of the Trinity. Kriner explores how the fallenness and failures of texts, alongside readers' own failures, while seeming to challenge the future of the word, ultimately point to reading as a posture of reconciliation, in which reader and text meet in the Maranatha of all text.<br>

  Author(s): Kriner Tiffany Eberle<br>
  Abstract: In scripture, Jesus promises a future that potentiall infuses all texts: "my words will not pass away" (Matt 24:28). This book argues that texts--even literary texts--, have an eschatology, too, a part of God's purpose for the cosmos. They, with all creation, moves toward participation in the new creation, in the Trinity's expanding, creative love. This eschatological future for texts impacts how we understand meaning making, from the level of semiology to that of hermeneutics. This book tells he story of how readers participate in the future of the word, the eschatology of texts. If texts have a future i the kingdom of God, then readers' engagement with them--everything from preservation and utterance to translation, criticism, and call and response--can cultivate those futures in the love of the Trinity. Kriner explores how the fallenness and failures of texts, alongside readers' own failures, while seeming to challenge the future of the word, ultimately point to reading as a posture of reconciliation, in which reader and text meet in the Maranatha of all text.<br>

  Author(s) Teman Elly<br>
  Abstract: Surrogate motherhood,¹ a practice in which a woman agrees to carry a child to term for a couple who will then keep the child as their own, has emerged from the academic literature as an extreme case study for feminist, ethical, legal, and social concerns. With respect to matters of ethics, scholars have asked if there is not something intrinsically immoral about surrogacy (Brennan and Noggle 1997), and some have denounced the practice as depersonalizing or even dehumanizing of women’s reproductive labor and mutating it into a form of alienation (van Niekerk and van Zyl 1995).

  CHAPTER 1  Internal Rhetorics: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qcj2p">Culture, Rhetoric and the Vicissitudes of Life</a><br>
  Author(s) Nienkamp Jean<br>
  Abstract: Internal rhetoric is my term for the way that we persuade ourselves – talking ourselves into (or out of) things, arguing with ourselves, berating ourselves. It is taken for granted in common parlance, but little studied in academia. Such self-talk is rhetorical insofar as it affects our actions, attitudes or beliefs, consciously or unconsciously. I thus coin the term ‘internal rhetoric’ as a deliberate ‘terministic screen’¹: to call attention to the persuasive or rhetorical nature of much of our thought.<br>

  Author(s) Biesele Megan<br>
  Abstract: A rhetorical subtitle for this paper might be ‘The Ubiquity of Persuasion in Medicine’. As in most other areas of human life, it is difficult, in healing performance and discourse, to get away from the primacy of nuanced communication about socialized belief. Thinking back some twelve years after my original writing in light of both anthropological work on Ju/’hoan San texts of many kinds and the complex indigenous politics which increasingly inform their production and use, I feel that social anthropology is nothing if not combined with rhetorical awareness.<br>

  Author(s) Johnson Christopher<br>
  Abstract: If there is an intellectual in France who has achieved an iconic status at least comparable to that formerly enjoyed by Jean-Paul Sartre, it is Claude Lévi-Strauss. An anthropologist by training, author of works whose technical complexity exclude all but a small group of specialists, everything would seem to confine this figure to the rarefied sphere of academic exchange. And yet Lévi-Strauss’s reputation extends far beyond his own area of specialisation. In France, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, he has assumed the status of the elder of the tribe, a respected sage, a ‘living national treasure’ (Clément 1993:<br>

  Abstract: The act of remembering does not necessarily relate to what has actually taken place; it has a peculiar, intrinsically metaphorical quality of “as if.” Remembering is a process of representing that does not merely involve calling up data as if playing back a tape recording or running a CD-ROM. Rather, representing something by remembering it creates an experiential context along the lines of “Things are just like they were back then.” Genuine remembering is a process of transporting oneself back, of retrieving a past emotional situation.

  Author(s) Rapport Nigel<br>
  Abstract: The two essays in Part III find human actors immersed in worlds of categories and things, of identities and relationships that take on classificatory forms. Indeed, in these chapters ethnographic attention is focused on the very thing-iness of human social existence: on our seeming modern fetish of inventing new things – ‘entifying’ – whereby life can become further specialized and commodified (Chapter 6); and on people treated as kinds of things, valued according to where they happen to have been born (Chapter 5). But it is also true to say that here are the human capacities to reflect on the<br>

                  Les Formes élémentaires de la vie religieusewhere the term is a key to the definition of religion: “A religion is a solidary system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is, things that are separated and forbidden, beliefs and practices that unite in a single moral community, called a Church, all those who adhere to them” (Durkheim 1991 [1912]: 108–9).

  Abstract: In endeavoring to explain the fact that the Durkheimian religion cluster primarily wrote about primitive societies while other important members of the Durkheimian team, e.g., Maurice Halbwachs and François Simiand, concentrated on Western society, W. Paul Vogt argues that the religion cluster studied primitives in part because they had an attitude of “despair” regarding the modern world. They perceived something troubling about the contemporary situation in the West and attempted to use primitive societies as a means for pointing to what had been lost in the move to modernity (Vogt 1976: 43). According to this account, the religion cluster believed<br>

  Book Title: Practicing the Faith-The Ritual Life of Pentecostal-Charismatic Christians<br>

  Author(s): Lindhardt Martin<br>
  Abstract: Over the past decades, Pentecostal-charismatic Christianity has arguably become the fastest growing religious movement in the world. Distinguishing features of this variant of Christianity include formal ritual activities as well as informal, experiential, and ecstatic forms of worship. This book examines Pentecostal-charismatic ritual practice in different parts of the world, highlighting, among other things, the crucial role of ritual in creating religious communities and identities.<br>

  Author(s) Percy Martyn<br>
  Abstract: Dating from 1994, the “Toronto Blessing” is the name for a phenomenon that is associated with the Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship. From its very foundation, the Vineyard Christian Church in Toronto had experienced many of the things that would be typical for Christians within the fundamentalist-revivalist tradition: miracles, healings, an emphasis on deliverance, speaking in tongues, and a sense of the believers being in the vanguard of the Holy Spirit’s movement as the millennium neared. However, what marked out the Toronto Blessing for special consideration were the more unusual phenomena that occurred. A number of followers trace the initial outpouring<br>

  Author(s) Lindhardt Martin<br>
  Abstract: It is common knowledge among members of the Evangelical Pentecostal Church (EPC) in Valparaíso, Chile, that good things only happen when God makes them happen. A fundamental theological principle in this church is an understanding of human powerlessness and total dependence upon an almighty God as the source of all good things. According to Anthony Giddens, distinguishing features of modernity include a basic trust in the transformative potential of human agency and social institutions as well as new perceptions of determination and ambiguity that leave little room for religious cosmologies (1994: 36). But in the EPC, secular notions of transformative<br>

  Author(s) Pfeil Gretchen<br>
  Abstract: Attempts to discuss the central ritual forms of American Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity, among them conversion narrative and sermon, are troubled by a seeming conflict. They seem to be ritual forms, and at the same time, to be something more, even opposed to ritual action. The urgency and personal quality of these forms of devotional practice lead, sometimes, to readings of them as transparent statements of fact. Conversion narrative, for example, is both clearly a form of devotional practice and also “real,” compelling as autobiography and a source of information about practitioners’ lives. This chapter unpacks this paradoxical quality to<br>

  Abstract: This chapter foregrounds the circumstances under which a resentment of Albanians’ newfound wealth (at least for a certain section of the Albanian population in Kumanovo) among Macedonians translated into a strong expression of suspicion of Albanians in general. This arguably echoes the habit of blaming “the other” for a downfall in status, something that has been noted across Europe, as analyzed by Douglas Holmes, Andre Gingrich, and Hastings Donnan, among others (Donnan 2002, 2010; Gingrich 2006; Gingrich and Banks 2006; Holmes 2000).<br>

  One  Road to Autopia: from:

  Abstract: This chapter will consider the road movie as a trans-contextual or parodic form, mainly through an analysis of
                  Les Valseuses. However, just as it is proved important to reconsider the road movie’s historical flow of influence, it will be equally important in this instance to consider the workings of parody. Parody, I suggest here, is positioned ambivalently between the thing it derides and a fascination with that same thing. The objects of desire that are the perennial targets of parody, in other words, may prove more significant than the act of parodying itself. As I argue in this chapter, this<br>

  Abstract: In

But fascinating above all since for most Western readers Ghosh’s book will be like the exploration of a strange and unknown territory. They will discover in this book the account of a relationship to the past that is wholly unlike anything familiar to them.<br>

The same operations simultaneously negotiate understandings of cultural practices and social knowledge.

  Book Title: The Train Journey-Transit, Captivity, and Witnessing in the Holocaust<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Gigliotti Simone<br>
  Abstract: Deportations by train were critical in the Nazis' genocidal vision of the "Final Solution of the Jewish Question." Historians have estimated that between 1941 and 1944 up to three million Jews were transported to their deaths in concentration and extermination camps. In his writings on the "Final Solution," Raul Hilberg pondered the role of trains: "How can railways be regarded as anything more than physical equipment that was used, when the time came, to transport the Jews from various cities to shooting grounds and gas chambers in Eastern Europe?" This book explores the question by analyzing the victims' experiences at each stage of forced relocation: the round-ups and departures from the ghettos, the captivity in trains, and finally, the arrival at the camps. Utilizing a variety of published memoirs and unpublished testimonies, the book argues that victims experienced the train journeys as mobile chambers, comparable in importance to the more studied, fixed locations of persecution, such as ghettos and camps.<br>

  Abstract: In his article, “German Railroads/Jewish Souls,” Raul Hilberg asked: “How can railways be regarded as anything more than physical equipment that was used, when the time came, to transport the Jews from various cities to shooting grounds and gas chambers in Eastern Europe?”¹ The railroads were a formative scholarly preoccupation for Hilberg, who trawled the archives, “pondering the special trains, the assembly of their rolling stock, their special schedules, and their financing.”² He concluded that in the hands of bureaucrats and technocrats, the railroads metamorphosed, becoming a “live organism” that “acted in concert with Germany’s military, industry, or SS to<br>

  Book Title: Culture and Rhetoric-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Tyler Stephen<br>
  Abstract: While some scholars have said that there is no such thing as culture and have urged to abandon the concept altogether, the contributors to this volume overcome this impasse by understanding cultures and their representations for what they ultimately are - rhetorical constructs. These senior, international scholars explore the complex relationships between culture and rhetoric arguing that just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric. This intersection constitutes the central theme of the first part of the book, while the second is dedicated to the study of figuration as a common ground of rhetoric and anthropology. The book offers a compelling range of theoretical reflections, historical vistas, and empirical investigations, which aim to show how people talk themselves and others into particular modalities of thought and action, and how rhetoric and culture, in this way, are co-emergent. It thus turns a new page in the history of academic discourse by bringing two disciplines - anthropology and rhetoric - together in a way that has never been done before.<br>

  Abstract: It is commonly held that France, and in particular Paris, was the leading center in the development of European dance and ballet. To be sure, this is true for most of the Baroque period (the seventeenth and the first half of the eighteenth century). The new intellectual climate of the Enlightenment, however, which brought about a decisive change of social and cultural conceptions and ideas around the middle of the eighteenth century, led among other things to a change of focus in the development of theatrical dance.

  Book Title: Academic Anthropology and the Museum-Back to the Future<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Bouquet Mary<br>
  Abstract: The museum boom, with its accompanying objectification and politicization of culture, finds its counterpart in the growing interest by social scientists in material culture, much of which is to be found in museums. Not surprisingly, anthropologists in particular are turning their attention again to museums, after decades of neglect, during which fieldwork became the hallmark of modern anthropology - so much so that the "social" and the "material" parted company so radically as to produce a kind of knowledge gap between historical collections and the intellectuals who might have benefitted from working on these material representations of culture. Moreover it was forgotten that museums do not only present the "pastness" of things. A great deal of what goes on in contemporary museums is literally about planning the shape of the future: making culture materialize involves mixing things from the past, taking into account current visions, and knowing that the scenes constructed will shape the perspectives of future generations. However, the (re-)invention of museum anthropology presents a series of challenges for academic teaching and research, as well as for the work of cultural production in contemporary museums - issues that are explored in this volume.<br>

                  Genealogy of Morality,¹ pointed out that our perception of things – and thus also of the past – has always been colored by our perspective. Because we are biologically situated in a specific spatial (social and cultural) and temporal (historical) context, we can do nothing other than look from a specific standpoint (casu quo perspective) at what lies behind us.

  Author(s) Smeyers P.<br>
  Abstract: In several Western societies we witness today an increasing tendency to “educationalize” social problems. As an institution, the school is, among other things, held accountable for solving social inequalities (related to class, race, and gender); for reducing traffic deaths, obesity, teenage sex, and environmental destruction; and for enhancing public health, economic productivity, citizenship, and even performances in sport contests such as the Olympic Games. Pushing these kind of “social” responsibilities on schools is a process that has been under way for a long time and coincides with the role of education in the formation of the modern nation-state.

The latter reason will lead us to consider the toolbox concept we deploy here in order to enrich our understanding of Belgian constitutional case law relating to federalism.<br>

  Abstract: Broadly generalized, there are two strains of literature on legal services lawyers. One strain takes an explicitly normative stance regarding what outcomes, relationships, or processes are “good.” Scholarship in this genre provides advice about how legal services lawyers should act in order to optimize the assistance they provide to their clients. They advise on everything from choosing cases and clients from disparate community interests to empowering clients and avoiding paternalism. Such literature is not purely instrumental, as much of it provides a rationale for the underlying values promoted. These authors share the espousal of value-based practice, even when they are<br>

Underlying such advice is the presumption that observers of public interest lawyering know better than lawyers and clients engaged in practice about everything from the nature of the client-professional relationship to the goals they should pursue and their chances of achieving them.

Langdell’s casebook ushered in the modern era because it offered a new methodology and pedagogy for law study that was nothing more than an expression of faith in the scientific method.

  Author(s) Hunt Peter<br>
  Abstract: “Children’s literature” is a term used to describe both a set of texts and an academic discipline—and it is often regarded as an oxymoron. If “children” commonly connotes immaturity, and “literature” commonly connotes sophistication in texts and reading, then the two terms may seem to be incompatible. Henry James, in “The Future of the Novel” (1900b), observed that “the literature, as it may be called for convenience, of children, is an industry,” but not one to be taken seriously: “the sort of taste that used to be called ‘good’ has nothing to do with the matter; we are demonstrably<br>

  Author(s) Kidd Kenneth<br>
  Abstract: In her study of comparative children’s literature, Emer O’Sullivan (2001) notes that children’s classics come from three sources: (1) appropriations of adult works; (2) adaptations from traditional (usually oral) narratives; and (3) works written specifically for children. A classic, then, could be a text adopted by children as well as a work written for them. But, as O’Sullivan’s study also makes clear, things are not so simple. “Classic” is an overdetermined and elastic term, one encompassing very different ideas and attitudes. The notion of a children’s classic amplifies the contradictions of the term, especially to the degree that children’s literature<br>

  Abstract: The term “science fiction” denotes a genre of imaginative literature distinguished from realism by its speculation about things that cannot happen in the world as we know it, and from fantasy by abjuring the use of magic or supernatural. In science fiction, all phenomena and events described are theoretically possible under the laws of physics, even though they may not at present be achievable. Stated in this way, it would appear that works belonging to the genre would be easily identifiable. However, critics of science fiction have struggled to find an adequate definition almost since the term was coined and<br>

  Abstract: Historically, “story” is probably one of the most frequently employed words in relation to children’s literature. Yet despite its constant use by reviewers and critics over much of the history of fiction written specifically for young people, it has rarely been defined or analyzed. In its apparent simplicity, taken-for-grantedness, and resistance to deconstruction, the term establishes itself as something unquestioned, like the nature of “childhood” or “the child” itself. “Story” is missing from the index of numerous works where one might reasonably expect to find it—such as Katherine Nelson’s

He traces its origins back to the Greektheoros, meaning “spectator,” with its root inthea, for “sight,” which also gave us “theater.” As more recent commentators put it, “[T]he literal sense of looking has then been metaphorized to that of contemplating or speculating” (Wolfreys et al. 2006).

  Abstract: The work of Raymond Brown in the study of the Johannine literature has been nothing short of remarkable. When he died in 1998, many of us felt a great light had passed from the church and the academy. Brown made Johannine studies fascinating, and I can tell you from one vantage anyway, his work inspired my career as well as a host of others.<br>

  Author(s) DE REGT HENK W.<br>
  Abstract: In 1948, physicist Erwin Schrödinger delivered the Shearman Lectures at University College London. In 1954, these lectures were published as
                  Nature and the Greeks. In this book Schrödinger argues that science, since it is a Greek invention and is based on the Greek way of thinking, is “something special,” that is, “it is not the only possible way of thinking about Nature.” Schrödinger then poses the following question: “What are the peculiar, special traits of our scientific world-picture?” and he answers it immediately by stating: “About one of these fundamental features there can be no doubt. It is the hypothesis<br>

  Author(s) GRIMM STEPHEN R.<br>
  Abstract: If we are fortunate, at some point while pursuing the answer to one of our explanation-seeking why-questions we will experience a sense of understanding. In other words, we will seem to “grasp” or “see” what it is that accounts for the thing we want to explain, a moment of “grasping” or “seeing” that is often accompanied by a distinctive phenomenology—perhaps even a phenomenology along the lines of the celebrated “aha” experience.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qh59s">Scientific Understanding</a><br>
  Author(s) DIEKS DENNIS<br>
  Abstract: Physics is the paradigmatic example of a successful science. One of its great successes is its impressive track record of giving explanations of natural phenomena, by which these phenomena are made understandable. This much is generally granted, but things become less clear when one asks what these physical explanations exactly consist in. Philosophers of science have proposed a variety of analyses of explanation (nomological-deductive, causal, unification, to mention but a few), and it is not immediately obvious which of these proposals best captures physical practice.<br>

  Abstract: THE NUMBER OF articles, books, films, pictures, paintings, and theatrical productions concerning the women assassinated in Ciudad Juárez grows steadily.¹ This is due not only to the bemusing and menacing nature of this massive event that bewilders scholars but also to the intuition that it constitutes a symptom of overriding importance of events to come and constitutes one of the patterns of governmentality in the postmodern world. Without packing everything into a convenient catchall explanation, it can be said that evidence of this menace can be found in the murders of women in other areas of Mexico, such as Baja<br>

  Author(s) DELGADO MARIA M.<br>
  Abstract: The iconography of Barcelona is bound up with performance. The city has been conceptualized – as the epigraph, from the
                  New York Times, makes clear – around performative paradigms. While all cities, as the director Tim Etchells notes, function in the same mode as theatre, as a model of ‘dynamic relativism … where everything means more than one thing’ (2009, p. xii), in Barcelona performance serves as a mode of conceptualizing self and other, of reinforcing the transformative potential of the city – not insignificant in a city that has re-envisaged its own architectural landscape in the past thirty years.<br>

  Abstract: A journey takes one to new places and allows one to see new things. Travel broadens horizons, changes perspectives, forces new points of view through the unavoidable confrontation with previously unknown geographies, environments, and peoples through the simple act of perception. Seeing is therefore a form of knowledge. Travel (whether actual or virtual) and acquisition of knowledge about the world are indelibly linked. We tend to forget that before the twentieth century, individuals who were not members of the ruling class rarely traveled and had few concepts of what the world looked like beyond their own horizon.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.cttq46qk">Externalism</a><br>
  Abstract: Sartre’s attack on the idea that consciousness has contents is, in effect, an attack on the idea that the mental possesses features that are hidden, inner and constituted or revealed by the individual’s inwardly directed awareness. This attack is continued by the Austrian philosopher, Ludwig wittgenstein.¹ Although developing wide-ranging arguments concerning mentality in general, the focus of Wittgenstein’s concern is items such as meaning and understanding – meaning something by one’s use of a sign and understanding something by way of someone else’s (or indeed your) use of a sign. Accordingly, I shall focus, at least initially, on these.<br>

  CHAPTER 7  The scope and limits of content externalism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.cttq46qk">Externalism</a><br>
  Abstract: Chapter 6 examined the arguments for content externalism and an essentially defensive reaction to those arguments – a reaction that is Cartesian in spirit – based on the dual component theory, along with the associated idea of the mental state narrowly individuated. It was argued that this Cartesian reaction to the arguments for externalism faces serious difficulties. Nonetheless, we have not yet worked out the implications of the arguments themselves. If an essentially Cartesian strategy to limit their scope does not work, we have, as yet, done nothing to work out what that scope is. This is the task of this chapter.<br>

  CHAPTER 11  Externalist axiology from:

  Abstract: The Cartesian tradition yields a very definite conception of what
                  value– moral, aesthetic and so on – must be. Or, rather, it yields a specific framework of possibilities for the sort of thing value must be. The view of the mind as essentially an interiority – something located entirely inside the skins of mental subjects – presents us with a stark choice when trying to understand the nature of value. Either value must derive from the inside – from the activities of the mind – or it must exist on the outside, objectively present in the world independently of those activities. Broadly speaking, the former<br>

Judaism receives what Christianity calls the Old Testament as “the Torah.” But the Torah encompasses not only the Scriptures, it also includes an oral component, which comes down from Sinai in oral formulation and oral tradition, only to be written down much later on in the Mishnah and Midrash compilations, and two Talmuds, of the first seven centuries A.D.

  Abstract: Yesterday we reached the problem of certitude of judgment that is raised when one attempts to integrate the modern notion or fact of science with the ancient ideal. And we had something to say about the nature of the act of judgment, the nature of sufficient evidence, the objectifications of intellectual light, of the light of intelligence, in logic and method, and the remainder that never succeeds in being objectified. In other words, intelligence is something more than simply what can be objectified in logic or a method, no matter how elaborate. Not all problems are the same, and yet<br>

It will help you in the question periods to have some idea of the things that are better to leave until later and the things that can be handled right away in the question period each day. The first part of the book consists of six chapters, and the titles are, first, Method; second, Functional Specialties; third, Horizons and Categories; fourth, The Human Good, Values, Beliefs; fifth, Meaning; and sixth, Religion. It will mainly be with those six chapters that we will be concerned. Perhaps<br>

How do I ever know that, when I accept something on the authority of God, this is an act of supernatural faith as distinct from a natural acceptance of something on the authority of God. If we’re going to reflect on our being Christian, how can I ever know that I’m authentically a Christian?

  Abstract: The origins of this book are rooted in my childhood. My father worked for the United Nations, so we moved from one country to another every three or four years. I came to be fascinated by the manner in which people differed from one place to another. In the British school, we were sent to the principal if we were caught using a ballpoint instead of a fountain pen. In the American school, we were forbidden from using fountain pens. In the French school, we could use anything we wanted to just as long as we didn’t forget to stand<br>

  L’Envoi: from:

  Abstract: The early avant-garde in Canada responded to the arrival of foreign cultural models at first by learning and imitating but eventually by translating cultural practices into the Canadian context. The Cosmic Canadians borrowed European models of idealism, occultism, and mysticism, as well as American models of transcendental idealism and poetic form, but developed these influences into a distinctly Canadian r/evolutionary node. The cultural products that emerged from this Anschauung remain marked by idealism, occultism, and mysticism, but became something else, something entirely new, as they colluded with the rising national spirit, the ideas of Richard Maurice Bucke, the general North<br>

  What is a political program? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/j.ctt1gxxrms">The Vigil of Quebec</a><br>
  Abstract: Our society may be working out a serious kind of political thinking, but we are still groping, as it is particularly difficult to relate together such disparate requirements as our economic weakness and our desire for independence, our democratic aspirations and our socialist inclinations. These difficulties are reflected in the program of the Parti québécois. Not surprisingly, it gives rise to a type of thinking that, though committed, is still critical. Combining political conviction and free inquiry, unconnected with election-time manoeuvring, is no doubt one indication among others that things can change in Quebec’s political life.<br>

  4  The eclipse of the middle way from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/j.ctt1h1hq7v">Merleau-Ponty and Marxism</a><br>
  Abstract: Sartre called Merleau-Ponty’s understanding of Soviet and world politics during the immediate post-war period ‘one-eyed’ while everyone else’s was blind.¹ Yet his recognition of the hazy and ambiguous forces at work in the world only prompted vilification from blind men who thought they saw things clearly.
                     Humanisme et Terreur, Merleau-Ponty’s first extended reflection upon public affairs, provoked hostility from both left and right, a preview of how virtually all his political writings were to be received. Often, though, the criticisms of his contemporaries were the result of gross and perhaps wilful misunderstanding.<br>

  Chapter Two  TIME, SUICIDE AND DEATH from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/j.ctt1vxm95x">French Existentialism</a><br>
  Abstract: All the existentialists are united in their opposition to idealist philosophies which ignore space and time as necessary conditions of the human existence. In no way is the finiteness of the human creature more evident than in the fact that he must live an earthly existence, and, since things in time have a beginning and an end, that he must be subject to the mysteries of birth and death. Ignoring these fundamental facts, the idealists sought to transcend the time process by rational system and they imposed a rational pattern upon the course of historical events. In other words, they<br>

  Abstract: In his Introduction to
                  L’Etre et l’essence,Professor Gilson seeks to shed light on some of the ambiguities that have developed concerning the word “being.” The French word “être” is used both as a verb and as a noun. As a verb it signifies that a thing “is” and, as a noun, it signifies one of the things which one says they are. Ifxis a being (unêtre), it does not follow thatxis, becausexmay be a real or only a possible being. For the sake of clarity, therefore, in order to say in French<br>

  Abstract: Seldom in the history of thought have men made such absolute declarations of an atheist position as those made by the French non-Christian existentialists. Nietzsche declared that “God is dead” and a whole philosophy has been built up contingent upon that. Sartre writes in
                     Existentialism and Humanism(p. 56): “Existentialism is nothing else but an attempt to draw the full conclusions from a consistently atheistic position.”<br>

  Author(s) Zevi Bruno<br>
  Abstract: IT is QUITE EVIDENT that I would not be discussing such a controversial subject as “Architecture 1967: Progress or Regression?” were it not for a fortuitous but significant coincidence. The year 1967 is not only the Canadian Centennial, a very happy event, but also the third centenary of a tragic episode in architectural history. In 1667 Francesco Borromini, perhaps the greatest architect of the Baroque period, committed suicide. Why? we ask ourselves. Was he neurotic, sexually frustrated, unhappily married? Actually he killed himself because he felt and knew that everything he had been struggling to accomplish during his life was<br>

  Abstract: Fifteen years ago, historian Kerwin Lee Klein issued a scathing report on what he termed the advent of the “memory industry” – the exponential growth of memory as a key vector of concern in the arts and humanities. And indeed, a collective turn to memory – variously referred to as an industry, a boom, an avalanche, and a crisis – undeniably began to materialize in both Western culture and critical discourse in the late 1990s.¹ As elaborated by Andreas Huyssen, this turn can be mapped along three trajectories: the rejection of modernity’s blind trust in progress and development, the articulation of anxiety around<br>

  Abstract: Is each of us the main character in a story we tell about ourselves, or is this narrative understanding of selfhood misguided and possibly harmful? Are selves and persons the same thing? And what does the possibility of sudden death mean for our ability to understand the narrative of ourselves?For the first time, this collection brings together figures in contemporary philosophy and Kierkegaard studies to explore pressing questions like these in the philosophy of personal identity and moral psychology. These essays will both advance important ongoing discussions of selfhood and expand the light that, 200 years after his birth, Kierkegaard is still able to shed on contemporary problems.<br>

  Abstract: Today when my wife announced that she had invited Miss Fulton to dinner a spark of joy electrocuted me.

She had a way of moving as if her feet didn’t touch the ground and could enter a room without sound.

But there was no sadness in that, for down below there was such fine green of so many vibrantly different kinds, and so many sturdy boughs and trunks beneath that, silver sinews and august umbers, some gymnastically betrothed, some straight and stoic.

  Abstract: People come up with all sorts of ideas. Some even think it might be interesting to make a film director meet another film director. How nice would it be for two people to meet who have such a thing in common! In fact, it would be quite burdensome for a filmmaker. This is because we have nothing to talk about.

  Author(s) Jameson Fredric<br>
  Abstract: The easier way to explain our failure to grant Theo Angelopoulos the position he deserves in modern cinema – that he is less theoretically experimental than Godard or less politically ostentatious than Pasolini we can grant, but why we fail to love seeing his films more than those of Antonioni or Fellini remains something of a mystery – clearly lies in the character of modern Greek history, which is far less familiar than that of the western European countries. Greece has gone through a collective experience of which most other modern nations have only known bits and pieces: revolution, fascism, occupation, civil<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1bgzcz6">The Cinema of Theo Angelopoulos</a><br>
  Author(s) Karalis Vrasidas<br>
  Abstract: Theo Angelopoulos’ trilogy of History consists of Μέρες του ’36 (
                  Days of ’36, 1972), Ο Θίασος (The Travelling Players, 1975) and Οι Κυνηγοί (The Hunters, 1977). In Ο Μεγαλέξανδρος (Megalexandros, 1980), the last film of this period, Angelopoulos adopts the idea of representation not as a reconstruction of things past but as the visualisation of their ability to lose their historicity and be transformed into legends and epic tales. Some scholars (see Bordwell 2005: 143) and the editors of this book consider the film to be the logical offspring of the aforementioned films and they see it as an addition<br>

                  The Dust of Time, 2008) is an unsuccessful attempt ‘to break new ground by transferring the paradigm of discontinuous collective temporalities to the drama of individuals’, doing so in such a way that the historical terrain Angelopoulos once charted so heroically persists only on a distant horizon. The director himself concedes the objective basis of this transformation. He insists that, in his final films, ‘history becomes something of a fresco in the background. Put another<br>

  Abstract: It would be arguable that the gold standard of commercial narrative film, the ‘affection image’ or facial close-up, is a fatal error for any cinema of the Left; that Griffith’s pioneering innovations in the conventions of close-up cinematography were nothing less than a capture of the fledgling discourse of narrative cinema for the forces of sentimental reaction, leaving a legacy of bourgeois individualism lodged within the very grammar of the form. The conventions of eye-line matching and shot-reverse-shot montage, and the anchoring of emotional catharsis in the fetishised face as such, have tended to predispose commercial film narrative towards an<br>

  CHAPTER 17  ‘Nothing Ever Ends’: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1bgzcz6">The Cinema of Theo Angelopoulos</a><br>
  Author(s) Grønstad Asbjørn<br>
  Abstract: In February 2005, Theo Angelopoulos came to the Cinémathèque in Bergen, which screened a retrospective of his work. During an interview session before Ο Μελισσοκόμος (
                  The Beekeeper, 1986) he said something that has stayed with me: ‘Everything that has existed will always exist. Nothing fades away, nothing dies’. Everything that has existed will always exist. Experiences. Actions. Feelings. Suffering. Love. Ideas. Thoughts. People. The discursive tenor of the director’s statement is philosophical, or perhaps poetic, but it seems that it is also embodied by his film aesthetic, which functions to bracket temporality itself. There is the impossible spatial coexistence of<br>

  CHAPTER 4  Stealing the Scene: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1bh2kpq">Border Crossing</a><br>
  Author(s) Orr S. Ceilidh<br>
  Abstract: Robert Bresson’s 1959 film
                  Pickpocket, ostensibly based onCrime and Punishment, begins with the declaration, “This is not a detective story.”¹ And it is not. The titular thief, Michel (Martin LaSalle), confesses in the opening scene, so that viewers learn “whodunnit” before ever witnessing a crime. The only mystery left is motive: What drives Michel to steal, and to pick pockets, in particular? And how does it become so compulsive that he will drop everything, even romance, when a stranger with a handsome watch walks by? Studies of Bresson andPickpocketare full of references to the inscrutability of the<br>

  Chapter 1  About Time from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0501b">Lyric Cousins</a><br>
  Abstract: At dusk, the afternoon ‘Express’ from Bucharest to Budapest travels slowly through Transylvania, on a curving route that allows the passenger who leans out of the window to see the other carriages running ahead and behind across the plain. As it rattles past remote villages, the train starts storks from their nests and startles small boys from the trackside scrub. It’s a noisy business. The rolling stock is left over from Cold War days, and the whistle sounds like something from a black-and-white movie.<br>

  Chapter 2  Abstract Form from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0501b">Lyric Cousins</a><br>
  Abstract: For a poet, the notion that abstract form – not ‘meaning’, but pure
                  shape– can play a key role in what she writes is seductive. On the one hand, it implies the possibility of developing and experimenting with the kinds of sophisticated formal patterning that we traditionally associate with verse, such as the way stanzas ‘chunk’ a ballad’s story, or a rhyme scheme creates a network of meanings that crisscross and link up within a poem. On the other, it also appeals to something more primitive. For it suggests that poets can – and perhaps even should – do<br>

  Chapter 6  The Meaning of ‘Meaning’ from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0501b">Lyric Cousins</a><br>
  Abstract: We resist new forms of meaning. We’re even resistant to the
                     ideaof them. It simplyisdifficult to conceptualise ways of understanding that we haven’t thought through before, or that differ from our usual ways of thinking. This is something we have toworkat: as all school pupils can attest. To ‘get your head round’ something: even the cliché conveys a sense of effortful rearrangement. From such practical difficulty flow the many religious, philosophical or ‘commonsensical’ beliefs – some of them notorious – which in turn reinforce these resistances.¹<br>

  Author(s) Bankston Samantha<br>
  Abstract: Before all else, we need to acknowledge a previously held, reprehensible position: for a long time Deleuze’s book on Foucault² seemed to consist of a dogmatic rigidity that did not manage to break into the enthusiasm of what Foucault said. From cover to cover the book seemed
                  ridiculousto us. It seemed far, so far from Foucault’s actual work, and with a menacing sort of passion we thought aboutdemonstratingthat in his book Deleuze had committed nothing more than a work of fiction. The reception of Deleuze’s presentation at the conference, “Michel Foucault, Philosopher,”³ only reinforced these poorly conceived<br>

  Abstract: The first page of Michael Ondaatje’s
                  The Collected Works of Billy the Kidfeatures famous frontier photographer L. A. Huffman’s caption to a picture of Billy he allegedly took. Where the picture should be, however, there is nothing but an empty frame. The text thus starts with a forceful problematisation of representation as, contrary to Huffman’s statement, Billy isnotdepicted. In addition, the Huffman caption is fictional.The Collected Works of Billy the Kidthus immediately signals that the status of the image, that representation will be an issue both formally and in terms of content.

  Abstract: In its emphasis on verisimilitude and its depiction of social relations, Colson Whitehead’s
                  The Intuitionistis a realist novel and thus deviates substantially from the more experimental set-ups of Castillo’s and Ondaatje’s narratives discussed in Chapters 1 and 2. WhileThe Mixquiahuala Letters’ andThe Collected Works of Billy the Kid’s respective forms emphasise and enact incompleteness, processuality, and divergence (a series of disconnected narrative and poetic vignettes in Ondaatje’s case; a set of letters that present the reader with three divergent story variants in Castillo’s), nothing like that holds for Whitehead’s novel.The Intuitionistcan be described as a<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g09v6s">The Edinburgh Companion to Poststructuralism</a><br>
  Author(s) Lumsden Simon<br>
  Abstract: The relation of poststructuralism to modern philosophy is an enormous topic. The sheer number of poststructuralist figures and the even more diverse range of modern philosophers make it difficult to do justice to the complex and diverse nature of the relation. One thing that is central to poststructuralist thought, as it is in the other great strand of twentieth-century European thought, hermeneutics, is a mindfulness that the concepts and approaches it has developed cannot be understood in isolation from the philosophical tradition.

  Author(s) Phillips John W.<br>
  Abstract: The problem of the relationship between words and things and, within the word, the difference between word and idea, has exercised more than twenty-five centuries of thought. The problem in grasping what is at stake in these relations and the differences that animate them lies in the fact that the only way to approach them is through the inherited concepts themselves: word, thing, idea. Couplings like form and matter, form and meaning, syntax and semantics, signifier and signified all owe their senses (we must not I suppose exclude sense and reference) to this ancient framework.

  Author(s) Buchanan Ian<br>
  Abstract: There is no straightforward way to say what schizoanalysis is. The problem is not so much that the question is not answered by Deleuze and Guattari or that it is somehow unanswerable; rather the problem is that it has several answers. Unwilling to provide any kind of ‘formula’ or ‘model’ that would enable us to simply ‘do’ schizoanalysis as a tick-box exercise in which everything relates inexorably to one single factor (e.g. the family), which is what they thought psychoanalysis had become, Deleuze and Guattari observe a quite deliberate strategy of providing multiple answers to the questions their work raises.<br>

Further, other critics such as Searle and Habermas have, Anderson argues, unfairly labelled Derrida’s work as perpetuating indeterminacy and nihilism.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g09xfc">The Edinburgh Companion to Twentieth-Century Philosophies</a><br>
  Author(s) Morris David<br>
  Abstract: The most distinctive feature of philosophy of mind in the Continental tradition is that for the most part there has been no such thing. While the Continental tradition richly contributes to the study of mind, it has not considered the topic a separate department of philosophy. Indeed, the Continental tradition’s foremost results challenge typical projects of philosophy of mind.<br>

  Feminist Philosophy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g09xfc">The Edinburgh Companion to Twentieth-Century Philosophies</a><br>
  Author(s) Angelova Emilia<br>
  Abstract: Continental feminist philosophy is a movement of thought unified by the theme of the difference of woman and the difference of the feminine. But it is by no means monolithic in method or content. It begins with Simone de Beauvoir’s existentialist feminism in the 1940s. For de Beauvoir, the free transcendence of the ‘independent woman’ wrests her from linear history and orients her to something more than equal rights for man and woman, something more than egalitarian ideals. With May 1968 a new phase of French feminist theory began, bringing along with it aesthetic experiences, influences from deconstruction, psychoanalysis and<br>

  Anglo-American Neo-Idealism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g09xfc">The Edinburgh Companion to Twentieth-Century Philosophies</a><br>
  Author(s) Rescher Nicholas<br>
  Abstract: Historically, idealists have emphasized and indeed often prioritized the role of our human mind-guided modus operandi over that of nature-at-large as basis for the philosophical understanding of ourselves and our place in the world’s scheme of things. Idealism has many versions. To begin with, there is the
                  causalidealism that looks to the productive role of mind or spirit in the constituting of nature.¹ Then, too, there is theaxiologicalidealism that assigns a formative role to values.² There is also theabsoluteidealism which, despite Hegelian kinship, found its root inspection – at least among English-speaking philosophers – in<br>

  Postmodernism from:

  Author(s) Scott Charles E.<br>
  Abstract: As I begin this chapter, I confess to having reservations about the term, ‘postmodernism.’ My reservations have less to do with the philosophical irrelevance of the term that some scholars have alleged, and more with the suffix, -
                  ism; the ways of thinking and writing that ‘postmodern’ names are characterized by departures from thought that is governed by categories and their classifications. This tradition emerged in part as a critique of the ability of categorical thinking to recognize and address appropriately many of the perceptions, processes of thought, experiences, and things that we encounter. This chapter will discuss alternatives to such<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b1vg">The Edinburgh Critical History of Nineteenth-Century Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Blackledge Paul<br>
  Abstract: The word ‘revolution’ was first used in an unmistakably modern sense in the eighteenth century to describe the American and French Revolutions. And although it had begun to gravitate towards something like this modern meaning in England in the wake of her seventeenth-century revolutions (Williams 1976; Hill 1991; Hobsbawm 1962: 74–5), John Dunn is right that ‘in a few short months, in the year of 1789, the people of France set their stamp ineffaceably on a political idea which has loomed over the history of the world ever since’ (Dunn 2008: 17).

  Author(s) Lerma Mónica López<br>
  Abstract: Combining black humour, thriller and horror film, Alex de la Iglesia’s
                  La Comunidad (Common Wealth2000) tells the story of a gruesome community of neighbours who have signed a contract to share the money that another of their neighbours has won in thequiniela(football pools) after his death. However, their plans are frustrated when a new arrival, the estate agent Julia, finds the dead man’s money and decides to keep it for herself.

  Author(s) Stamp Richard<br>
  Abstract: In a 1971 article for
                  American Cinematographer, the monthly publication of the American Society of Cinematographers, an experimental filmmaker explains how he started developing ‘animation mechanisms’ over a decade earlier. These machines are conceived as tools capable of ‘drawing’ with precisely controlled incremental variations that might match the ‘precise incremental stepping process’ that underpins the cinematographic apparatus of celluloid film and its machines (the camera, the editing table and the projector). Although he claims that he began his work with the aim of making something ‘useful’, he then confesses, with wry self-deprecation, to a feeling of disappointment when his first<br>

  Author(s) Robson Mark<br>
  Abstract: The editor of this volume insists that I make my contribution. The problem is that several contributors have already shown perfectly the principles that guide my approach to cinema and what consequences follow from them. Since I have no reason to contradict them and no wish to repeat them, the only path remaining to me is one of transposition. They have gone about things in an orderly way and argued with a subtlety that leaves nothing to be desired. It remains to me to punctuate in a crude and disorderly way the points that they have brought to light.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b2nv">Research Methods for Cultural Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) Nightingale Virginia<br>
  Abstract: Observation-based research relies on interactions and exchanges between researcher and research participants, and it is this expanded vision of observation – observation that explicitly designs and accounts for the impact of the research process on the fieldwork experience and the data it produces – that the chapter explores. It is based on the premise that communication is a material process in the sense that it is something that can be observed, recorded, documented, analysed and written about.

  Abstract: The seemingly inexorable rise of the concept of ‘discourse’ has made it almost unavoidable for cultural studies researchers, particularly since its invitation to theorise culture as ‘like a language’ coincides with so many impulses within our field. But not without substantial costs. Looking at the cultural studies field from my angle as an audience researcher, some troubling features within discourse work come into view.

  CHAPTER ONE  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b4vx">Poetic Language</a><br>
  Abstract: The argument of this book is that poems encourage their readers to experience language as a dual-aspect phenomenon, as something known and understood in two different ways simultaneously. Poems make the language in which they are made appear contingent, and necessary, at once: they make their writers and readers feel a justness or truth in the poem’s language, at the same time as making those writers and readers question just how that part of the poem’s language (a rhyme, an image, the weight on a syllable, and so on) could produce the reactions it produces.

  Abstract: Walter Ralegh’s ‘Farewell to False Love’ is a poem of eighteen lines and around twenty metaphors describing the nature of false love. False love is an ‘oracle of lies’, ‘A way of error, a temple full of treason’, ‘a nest of deep deceit’, ‘A fortress’, ‘A siren song’, ‘A ranging cloud that runs before the wind, / A substance like the shadow of the sun’. The metaphorical elaboration of the nature of false love is, by the end of the poem, reduced to comparisons that are themselves only approximate (like) to ephemeral and insubstantial things (shadows).

  Abstract: Picking up on the discussion of identity and difference in ‘Measure: William Wordsworth’, this chapter focuses on deviance, a related topic. In order for a phrase to be deviant, it must be different from a more ordinary way of saying something similar or of employing the same construction. A similitude within dissimilitude is required here, as, if one were to see no resemblance between the ordinary and the deviant phrase, they would stand in no relation to each other at all, the one would not be recognised as a deviant form of the other (I shall go on to qualify<br>

  Author(s) Steedman Carolyn<br>
  Abstract: Archives and ‘the archive’ now have a wider range of meanings and potential meanings attached to them than at any point since the inauguration of European and North American state archives in the early nineteenth century.¹ There is, for a start, Jacques Derrida’s compelling philosophy of the archive in
                  Mal d’archive(Archive Fever, 1995) in which thearkeof the Greek city state is named as the place where things begin, where power originates, with power’s workings inextricably and for all time bound up with the authority of beginnings, origins, starting points.² Those who make their way throughArchive Fever<br>

  Author(s) Cook Jon<br>
  Abstract: The idea of creativity or creative writing as a research method may seem a contradiction in terms. Long-held beliefs about the nature of creativity identify it as something that is outside or beyond methodical thought. Plato presented his philosopher, Socrates, as charmed by poets, but sceptical about the latters’ capacity to be governed by reason: ‘a poet is a light and winged thing and holy, and never able to compose until he has become inspired, and is beside himself, and reason is no longer in him’.¹ Romanticism is often taken to reinforce these beliefs in its account of the poet<br>

  Abstract: Since the first version of this volume appeared, much has changed in the uses of digital methods in the humanities, and what was previously known variously as humanities computing, digital scholarship, or ICT in the humanities has been broadly subsumed under the newer term, digital humanities.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b6rb">The Edinburgh Companion to the History of Democracy</a><br>
  Author(s) Sadiki Larbi<br>
  Abstract: Nothing is more perilous than trying to wed Islam and democracy, or engaging in endless discussions on Islam’s compatibility with democracy via a framework designed within the Western episteme. This episteme assumes that Islam and democracy are two distinct and autonomous systems and, in its worst iterations, it asserts that they are antithetical to one another. Since the European Enlightenment, the scholarly discussion of Islam and democracy has been one-sided. Western intellectuals condemn religion to the margins and Enlightenment’s singular practice of rationality denounces religious foundationalism. Fixity, singularity and determinacy have all been attributed to religion, especially Islam, and cited<br>

  Author(s) Lyon Ann<br>
  Abstract: The English Parliament is the subject of much mythology, both in its origins and in its development. It is often suggested that prior to the Norman Conquest, rather than having government imposed from above, the English governed themselves through local assemblies often referred to as folk moots (Oman 1919). The best evidence for pre-Conquest folk moots comes from place names such as Thingwall on the Wirral peninsula, Merseyside, and a lost

  Author(s) Anderson James<br>
  Abstract: Transnational democracy is an idea whose time has come, but it does not, as yet, have much substance. It is a thing of the future more than the present, but its future is far from assured. Such democracy as we presently enjoy it is mostly national, rather than transnational, and representative, rather than participatory. It is largely monopolised by elected ‘representatives’, rather than politically active citizens and almost entirely circumscribed by the territoriality of national state borders. The social communities, relations and processes beyond and across state borders that would constitute transnational democracy largely elude democracy’s remit. ‘Globalisation’ and<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b74h">Form and Object</a><br>
  Abstract: A kind of ‘thingly’ contamination of the present was brought about through the division of labour, the industrialisation of production, the processing of information, the specialisation of the knowledge of things, and above all the desubstantialisation of these things. In Western philosophical traditions, things were often ordered according to essences, substrata, qualities, predicates,
                  quidditasandquodditas, being and beings. Precluding anything from being equally ‘something’, neither more nor less than any other thing, thus becomes a rather delicate task. We live in this world of things, where a cutting<br>

  Part I  Thing from:

  Abstract: The first question concerns the nature, identity, or mere definition of what concerns principles, what is primary, primitive, or elementary, or the irreducible component of everything that is. If a wall is made of bricks, an organism of cells, a sentence of words, a word of letters, an atom’s nucleus of particles bound by forces, then what

                     something(since nothing is something, even if it is only a word, a false concept, or the union between a before-thing, the negative contemporaneous with a thing, and the absence following the thing).<br>

  Chapter I  Universe from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b74h">Form and Object</a><br>
  Abstract: Objects in each other form big things. The biggest possible thing is what we call the
                     universe. While the world is the reverse side or the form of each thing, the universe is a big thing, the identity of which is variable. The universe is always defined with a superlative: ‘the biggest thing’. Thus, we cannot conceive of a more important thing at the present moment, and we do not know if we will find a means to augment it further in the future.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b74h">Form and Object</a><br>

Even though living things are local events, which are mere fractions of the objective universe, living things are also events that considerably intensify the universe. Living things augment the universe more than formally (by simply adding new things). Living thingsgive valueto the universe (by adding<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b74h">Form and Object</a><br>
  Abstract: It seems that a rule is a paradox, a seemingly blatant contradiction. In order for a rule to exist, one must claim that it is impossible to do certain things that can be done. For example, it is
                  impossible, in French, to combine a verb conjugated in the second person with a first person subject; it isimpossible, in English, to write word ‘bird’ as ‘burd’. Of course these rules, by definition, vary with use, context, register, and through all the regular and irregular articulations which a linguistic theory can shed light on.¹ To modalise<br>

  Abstract: Death is the end of an individuated life’s presence. Some parts of an organism can live or be maintained even though the individual is or will no longer be living. This end does not entail the destruction of what lived, which is still something as a body, as a memory, or as an author of residual traces in the physical universe. Rather, it denotes the absence without return of what lived.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1n7qj2j">Immanence and Micropolitics</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, I argue that Sartre’s philosophical system instigates the ontology of ‘pure’ immanence that underpins micropolitics and that is carried forward by Merleau-Ponty, Foucault and Deleuze. But is there indeed such a thing as a Sartrean system, a total
                  Weltanschauung?¹ This question touches on one of the foremost debates afflicting Sartre scholarship. A number of interpreters have portrayed Sartre as a sporadic philosopher, void of any underlying and continuous ontology or philosophical and political engagement. His oeuvre, it is said, is punctuated by a series of divergent and conflicting views. In particular, with its emphasis on consciousness, Sartre’s<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r1z12">The Edinburgh Companion to Shakespeare and the Arts</a><br>
  Author(s) Holbrook Peter<br>
  Abstract: Of course Hotspur is speaking in character, as a bluff soldier – in a non-trivial sense these are his not Shakespeare’s words. Nevertheless it is always something of a shock to come across, in the greatest poet of the English language, such a memorable expression of the hatred of poetry. Glendower has been wittering on about his supernatural and poetic endowments, and Hotspur has had enough. The bombastic Welshman assures Hotspur he has “framèd to the harp / Many an English ditty lovely well, / And gave the tongue a helpful ornament – / A virtue that was never seen in you”<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r1z12">The Edinburgh Companion to Shakespeare and the Arts</a><br>
  Author(s) Bevington David<br>
  Abstract: Can one learn or surmise anything significant about Shakespeare’s own life from his writings? The film 
                  Shakespeare in Love (dir. John Madden, 1998) has recently brought the question into focus, even though – or perhaps especially because – that film deliberately plays fast and loose with what we know about Shakespeare’s life. The film more or less accurately places him in London as a young man, eager to succeed in the theatre, keenly aware of the success of his great rival, Christopher Marlowe. This Shakespeare lives apart from his wife and children, having left them in Stratford. And thereby hangs a tale.<br>

  11  SHAKESPEARE, BALLET AND DANCE from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r1z12">The Edinburgh Companion to Shakespeare and the Arts</a><br>
  Author(s) Edgecombe Rodney Stenning<br>
  Abstract: When in 
                  Much Ado About Nothing Beatrice claims “there was a star danced, and under that [she] was born” (2.1.293– 4), our immediate sense is of energy and mobile spontaneity. But for Shakespeare’s audience, of course, any illusions of free, wilful movement would have been contained and centred by the structural geometry of the Ptolemaic system. Much the same tension subsists within the art of ballet, which is nothing if not rigorous and enclosing, however much its protagonists seem to move without a care in the world. Frederick Ashton studied Euclid before he began choreographing his Scènes de Ballet, and<br>

  Author(s) Munro Lucy<br>
  Abstract: At the end of Shakespeare’s 
                  The Taming of the Shrew, a triumphant Petruccio declares, “Why, there’s a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate!” (5.2.184), underlining through his demand the domination over Katherine Minola that he has been asserting since their first meeting, when he told her, “We will have rings, and things, and fine array, / And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o’ Sunday” (2.1.315–16). Within twenty years, however, Petruccio’s dominance was to be undermined and Shakespeare’s narrative reshaped in a new play by John Fletcher, The Woman’s Prize or The Tamer Tamed.

  Author(s) Blake Erin C.<br>
  Abstract: This chapter explores Shakespeare in paintings and prints by looking at pictures of Shakespeare himself and at pictures that illustrate the words he wrote. In essence, both types of image are portraits. They attempt to represent a pre-existing entity, whether a real person like Shakespeare, or the people and places he brought to life in his plays. Portraiture is supposedly about verisimilitude, but a successful portrait is less about replicating someone or something in another medium than about meeting expectations. Portraits depict what we want to see or what we expect to see, otherwise they prove unsatisfying. Shakespeare has meant<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r1z12">The Edinburgh Companion to Shakespeare and the Arts</a><br>
  Author(s) Purcell Stephen<br>
  Abstract: “I don’t believe I’ve ever seen a memorable Shakespeare on television,” wrote 
                     The Guardian’s Nancy Banks-Smith in 1994; “or, if I have, I’ve forgotten it” (7 November 1994).¹ Indeed, televised Shakespeare productions have rarely been as high-profile or as widely-discussed as their cinematic counterparts, and certainly academic discussion of screen Shakespeare has been emphatically weighted towards the latter. One might be surprised, then, to observe that according to the BUFVC’s International Database of Shakespeare on Film, Television and Radio, television Shakespeare productions outnumber films on a ratio of something like 8:5.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r22rz">The World, the Flesh and the Subject</a><br>
  Abstract: For much of the last century philosophy of mind has been dominated by the attempt to give an account of mental states that does not have recourse to the Cartesian picture of them as essentially private, in the sense of being only providentially connected with the behaviour through which they are expressed. The states that have seemed particularly recalcitrant to such attempts are our experiences in perception and bodily sensation; for these paradigmatically have a subjective character – a something it is like to have them, as Thomas Nagel puts it¹ – that apparently eludes explanation in terms of the<br>

  Abstract: Let us suppose that we reject the ‘myth of the given’ or the idea of ‘contents’ of consciousness whose character explains what it is like to have our experiences, and adopt instead an account in terms of the ways things can become intentional objects of experience through the manner of our bodily interactions with them. This may still leave us with the uneasy feeling that something the ‘given’ was meant to suggest has dropped out of our story, namely, the way in which our perceptions and especially our bodily sensations are not only what we

  Introduction from:

  Abstract: Everything that lives, dies. Equally – for it doesn’t follow – everything that dies will have lived. Rather than being opposites, therefore, it’s fairer to say that living and dying depend on each other, each the other’s condition. Although we might think of death as standing at the end of life, as its destination or terminus, it had to be there from the start – life wouldn’t have been able to get going unless it had agreed to come to an end. Life and death make up the two sides of a same coin – not two different coins –<br>

  Abstract: ‘Once is never’ – this phrase, according to Peter Szondi, encapsulates the golden rule of science and all verifiable knowledge in general. What occurs only once poses something intolerable and indeed impossible for scientific thinking: it cannot be verified and so escapes the order of knowledge as the ground of certainty. How can we be certain of what happens only once?
                  Einmal ist keinmal– scientific thinking views the particular only as a specimen, a species implicitly or explicitly belonging to a genus. Knowledge is derived by inference from specific cases in respect of a general order. In the essay<br>

If this element of language has aroused such interest, it is because there has been increasing recognition that all of our concepts are framed within metaphorical terms. Rather than a model of language based upon the linguistic sign (a model which implies that words designate things in the world outside of language), linguists today are more inclined to accept that there exists a figurative substructure to concepts. This in turn helps us to understand that concepts are not extra-lingual<br>

  Abstract: I must have been about seventeen. From the hallway I could hear two of my older brothers talking very enthusiastically about things they were beginning to explore in their studies at university. They were talking about something called ‘semiotics’. The door to the room was open as usual and I moved closer, cautiously approaching my spirited brothers inside. At the doorway I asked for an explanation, but whatever I was given just hung in the air and left me out of the charmed circle of my brothers’ talk.

  Abstract: If what the postwar gulf-seekers in the analytic movement would have liked to have expelled from the midst of philosophy in the Englishspeaking world really had been fully expelled (
                  qua actuality as it were) the story of Continental philosophy would perhaps already be a piece of analytical philosophy’s mythological folklore (‘There used to be some people who read that kind of stuff, but not any more, not round here anyway’). Of course, the fundamental argument of the last chapter is that what answers to the idea of Continental philosophy (the risk of ‘sophistry and illusion’) is not something that can<br>

  Abstract: John McCumber claims that there has been no success in construing the ‘split’ between analytic and Continental philosophy ‘in philosophical terms’.¹ In this book I have attempted to succeed where others have failed. However, I have not tried to do so by showing ‘how, after all, the analytic/Continental distinction [can] be drawn’² but, rather, by showing why, after all, it cannot. Yet so pervasive is the 
                  de facto distinction, so serious the breakdown in communication, that we find it hard to resist the idea that there must be something to the distinction. This is where it gets hard to keep<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r26hc">Philosophy and Friendship</a><br>
  Abstract: Friendship, Cicero tells us, ‘is a kaleidoscope and complicated thing’.¹ We might add a fascinating thing; a kind of love perhaps and an enigma to us. Unlike love, which, on some accounts, is regarded as involuntary, friendship maintains an element of freedom of choice. In common with love, it involves a relationship between two beings and so draws us into the mystery of the difficult notion of the individual in himself or herself. The history of the philosophical literature on friendship reveals a changing semantic paradigm in relation to this notion. We are curious about friendship because as social creatures<br>

  Chapter 3  The Other Self as Friend from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r26hc">Philosophy and Friendship</a><br>
  Abstract: Cicero believed that human beings find it hard to make light of power and will cast friendship aside in the interests of attaining power and influence. His most scathing commentary on this tendency is that those who engage in this kind of defection from the duties of friendship assume that their behaviour will not be open to serious criticism; such men take it that others will assume that only an extremely important reason could have led them to cast friendship aside. Cicero presents power, influence, manipulation and weakness as factors both intimately related and antithetical to the practice of friendship.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r288w">The Lacanian Left</a><br>
  Abstract: Although our contemporary world is marked throughout by the importance of questions of identity, something increasingly reflected in the directions of contemporary social–scientific research, in the general field of nationalism studies the issue of the attraction and salience of national identities has not been sufficiently examined. This is partly due to the hegemonic position of modernist and constructionist approaches in the relevant literature.² In opposition to the common doxa reproduced by nationalist myths, contemporary research on the nation tends to stress the constructed character of national identity: the nation is primarily understood as a modern social and political construction.<br>

  Abstract: At the Walter Scott conference in Oregon in 1999, Jerome McGann pronounced Scott to be the first postmodernist,¹ a judgment based on Scott’s deployment of various metafictional techniques and on his ironic combination of contradictory genres. The proposal was less surprising (to some, at any rate) than it might have been, given how regularly another Scottish novel of the early nineteenth century – James Hogg’s 
                  Confessions of a Justified Sinner – is cited as prophetic of postmodernism in its use of multiple and conflicting narratives. Taken together, the implications of these prescient texts might suggest that there is something inherently postmodern about<br>

  Author(s) Gilbert Michelle<br>
  Abstract: In the Akwapim kingdom of southeastern Ghana,¹ clothing is used as a form of communication to make statements about personhood and status; to conceal or reveal identity; to express desires and impulses. It may do so directly or indirectly, conventionally or rebelliously. Clothing is owned, bestowed and gives identity. The clothed body expresses the person of the wearer and society’s image of that person. As a result, clothing absorbs the particular times in which it has been worn² and becomes like a relic of these past events.<br>

I am thinking of a sign sent, not to a person (even if she is captivating), but rather to the objects that swirl around her – to her themes, her style and mannerisms, her concepts, or, if you prefer it, to the ‘mist that she brings to the room’ of your life when she writes,<br>

  Abstract: To be ‘Deleuzian’ represents for me a sign, not of recognition between accomplices in the context of something that could function as a ‘Deleuzian school’, but rather a sign of conniving or a ‘sign of intelligence’, according to the expression that Janicaud liked to use. I am thinking of a sign sent, not to a person (even if she is captivating), but rather to the objects that swirl around her – to her themes, her style and mannerisms, her concepts, or, if you prefer it, to the ‘mist that she brings to the room’ of your life when she writes,<br>

  Chapter 1  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r2bq2">Scandalous Knowledge</a><br>
  Abstract: It has been said that knowledge, or the problem of knowledge, is the scandal of philosophy. The scandal is philosophy’s apparent inability to show how, when and why we can be sure that we know something or, indeed, that we know anything. Philosopher Michael Williams writes: ‘Is it possible to obtain knowledge 
                  at all? This problem is pressing because there are powerful arguments, some very ancient, for the conclusion that it is not . . . Scepticism is the skeleton in Western rationalism’s closet’.¹ While it is not clear that the scandal matters to anyone but philosophers, philosophers point out<br>

  Chapter 2  Pre-Post-Modern Relativism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r2bq2">Scandalous Knowledge</a><br>
  Abstract: If ‘relativism’ means anything at all, it means a great many things. It is certainly not, though often regarded that way, a one-line ‘claim’ or ‘thesis’: for example, ‘man is the measure of all things’, ‘nothing is absolutely right or wrong’, ‘all opinions are equally valid’, and so forth.¹ Nor is it, I think, a permanent feature of a fixed logical landscape, a single perilous chasm into which incautious thinkers from Protagoras’ time to our own have ‘slid’ unawares or ‘fallen’ catastrophically. Indeed, it may be that relativism, at least in our own era, is nothing at all – a phantom<br>

  Abstract: Truth, or the diverse types of situation to which we give that name, is, for the most part, a good thing to have. It is good, certainly, when friends are loyal, lovers faithful, their tears authentic, vows earnest, stories trustworthy. It is generally in our interest to know what’s up and what really happened. Not always, of course, or only: fiction and flattery, artifice and illusion, duplicity and pipe-dreams are also important, sometimes necessary, perhaps even, in their various ways, truthful, indeed sometimes supremely so – or so the poets have told us, though it’s not clear they’re to be trusted<br>

  Abstract: Evolutionary psychology, a recently constituted but already broadly extended programme in the study of human behaviour, is notable for, among other things, the unusually pre-emptive character of its claims. According to its major proponents, ‘reverse engineering’, the method that defines and distinguishes evolutionary psychology, permits identification of the underlying, innate mental mechanisms that govern all human behaviour, from incest-avoidance and femaleadolescent anorexia to past-tense formation and a taste for Victorian novels. In supplying these identifications, it is said, evolutionary psychologists provide genuinely scientific explanations for human behaviours and cultural practices that, up to now, have been improperly or inadequately explained<br>

  Chapter 1  Scotland and the places of memory from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r2cd5">The Scots Imagination and Modern Memory</a><br>
  Abstract: A fictional Scots detective gives fleeting pause for thought, stubs out his Silk Cut, moves on quickly to more pressing, practical matters, the conundrum lingering only as long as the pause in his conversation with a disagreeable colleague. The plot moves on. I finished the novel, but marked the page, wanting to dwell some more on the frisson where ‘loss and permanence had mingled and become some new entity’. What, quite, could this ‘something extraordinary’ be and what was new about that ‘new entity’? A momentary reverie points to a difficult issue: memories link people with places in enigmatic ways.<br>

  Abstract: Bert Hardy’s ‘Gorbals Boys’ is an iconic image.¹ It depicts two lads aged about ten, strolling arm-in-arm and glancing pertly at the camera. From their clothing and hairstyles, the rain-washed pavement and tall buildings framing them, the casual spectator would conclude that they are working-class, the period is sometime between 1930 and 1950 and the setting is an industrial city with a cool climate. Rendered ‘sepia’, the picture adorns the cover of the first volume of an autobiography by Ralph Glasser, as it does the front of a monograph about Hardy, and it is also available from numerous outlets as<br>

  Abstract: The cultural history of film has often been rooted in the shifting conceptions of and metaphorical uses of light. Film produces life, movement and action from light, making it seem organic (as light produces life and growth in the natural world), but also uncanny (the creation of life and movement from nothing). That the world is reproduced through the effects of light in photography and film has led numerous critics recently to reassert the uncanny and occult status of the media (Gunning 1995). Indeed light has many occult resonances, from Emanuel Swedenborg, through theories of vitalism, to the metaphorical uses<br>

  Introduction: from:

  Abstract: Psychoanalysis is an antiphilosophy. Despite the precision of this concept and this claim, their implications remain controversial. This book thus introduces the concept of antiphilosophy, speaks of its constitution and pertinence with respect to psychoanalysis, and examines the consequences of such a determination through a sequence of case-studies. Although the concept has some highly abstract aspects and a somewhat forbidding intellectual history, it is deployed here, first, as a kind of corrosive of received ideas, and, second, as an affirmative means of characterising psychoanalysis that captures something essential, if often elided, about the peculiar status of the practice.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I will reread an overdetermined and complex event in the prehistory of psychoanalysis: Sigmund Freud’s so-called ‘cocaine episode’ from the 1880s, in which, prior to entering private practice as a psychiatrist, Freud attempted a kind of reputational ‘get-rich-quick’ scheme, staking his scientific credentials on what has appeared to many subsequent commentators as unethical drug experimentation. While I re-examine this event by drawing on the requisite historical facts and secondary literature, my aim is different from that of a standard revisionist account. In fine, I wish to show something quite counter-intuitive: how Freud came to imagine the possibility<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapter ended with a dilemma: if the human is that ‘living being’ which can actually be separated from what once was held to be its essence, that is, ‘language’, what possible effectivity – whether of diagnosis or treatment – is left to psychoanalysis? The ongoing psychiatric, pharmaceutical and philosophical assault against psychoanalysis is one thing; the loss of its very basis for being is quite another. The first, as I have shown throughout this book, is hardly the threat to psychoanalysis that it is often supposed to be; but the second would be fatal. The second, in fact,<br>

  Abstract: ‘Welsh modernist poetry’ would seem to be something of a category error. The term has almost no critical currency – unlike, say, Irish or Scottish modernism – and there might seem at first glance to be little need for it. Who would it include? How would it be configured? What would be its distinctive features – its equivalent of MacDiarmid’s
                  ‘Caledonian antisyzygy’or Joyce’s forging of ‘the uncreated conscience of my race’? So readily is Welsh writing subsumed in English or British writing that answers to these questions will not occur readily to most students of modernism. In the last ten years, however,<br>

  Abstract: In the Massim way of sensing the world, the sense that is subject to the most restrictions is that of taste. In this chapter, we first examine how the repression (or constant deferral) of gustation is related to the centrality of exchange in Massim society, with the result that foods are classified and valued by reference to their presentability rather than their delectability. It also shows how Massim food preferences are ordered by a principle of likeness to humanity, as in the case of pork, which is reputed to be the next best thing to human flesh—at least in<br>

And second, the law wishes in its distinctness to be perspicuous; that is, it desires that the components of its autonomous existence be self-declaring and not be in need of piecing out by some supplementary discourse; for were it necessary for the law to have recourse to a supplementary discourse at crucial points, that discourse would be<br>

  Abstract: In this essay I examine “empathy” insofar as it is a possible audience response in live theater. In particular I attend to empathy not merely as an emotional response but as something possessing cognitive function as well. My main concern will be with the idea of a theatrical experience that evokes empathy, that makes use of empathetic responses as part of the mechanism of artistic comprehension, and that emphasizes emotional responses as a unique, as well as a rational, activity.

At one level this should not be surprising; writing any academic paper usually is—and should be—a challenge.

  Abstract: The scene: a hero in an early modern romance is on a journey. The stakes are high; at one point, the prospects for future happiness seemed enormous, and perhaps success is still within reach, but nothing is certain. Along the way, there have been disappointments, delays, and reversals, suffering and doubt. But now the hero finds himself (or herself) in some extraordinary setting—perhaps he enters an ancient library; or has a vision, while in prison, of long-lost parents and descending gods; or discovers an enchanted theater—and he chances upon a book.

  Abstract: The previous chapter surveyed the expository portion of certain representative texts in string theory technical discourse in their development of a scientific imaginary. The content of this exposition is best understood as an imaginary because it is primarily concerned with substantiating an abstract theoretical space as that which is natural. Theorists attempt to expose this abstract theoretical space as something physically coherent by means of a procedural space that intersects with the theoretical space. At the nexus of theoretical and procedural spaces, what the theorists construct gives way to an encounter with natural phenomena in the form of the strings<br>

  Abstract: This chapter sets out the theoretical model for the book: a model explaining the conditioned power of theories. In order to establish my theory, I aim to use hermeneutics—though with a slight twist. Hermeneutics is usually understood as the art of reading and interpreting texts. I want to stress, however, the dual nature of hermeneutics. Although hermeneutics indeed interprets texts, it is also a more active intellectual endeavor of interpreting reality once reality is conceived as an unwritten text. That is not to say that reality is nothing but a text or even to claim it is a text<br>

  Book Title: Traces of the Past-Classics between History and Archaeology<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassi Karen<br>
  Abstract: What are we doing when we walk into an archaeological museum or onto an archaeological site? What do the objects and features we encounter in these unique places mean and, more specifically, how do they convey to us something about the beliefs and activities of formerly living humans? In short, how do visible remains and ruins in the present give meaning to the human past? Karen Bassi addresses these questions through detailed close readings of canonical works spanning the archaic to the classical periods of ancient Greek culture, showing how the past is constituted in descriptions of what narrators and characters see in their present context. She introduces the term protoarchaeological to refer to narratives that navigate the gap between linguistic representation and empirical observation-between words and things-in accessing and giving meaning to the past. Such narratives invite readers to view the past as a receding visual field and, in the process, to cross the disciplinary boundaries that divide literature, history, and archaeology.Aimed at classicists, literary scholars, ancient historians, cultural historians, and archaeological theorists, the book combines three areas of research: time as a feature of narrative structure in literary theory; the concept of "the past itself" in the philosophy of history; and the ontological status of material objects in archaeological theory. Each of five central chapters explores how specific protoarchaeological narratives-from the fate of Zeus' stone in Hesiod's Theogony to the contest between words and objects in Aristophanes' Frogs-both expose and attempt to bridge this gap. Throughout, the book serves as a response to Herodotus' task in writing the Histories, namely, to ensure that "the past deeds of men do not fade with time."<br>

  Abstract: In his scathing essay on the coup d’état that brought France’s Second Empire to power, Karl Marx produced some of his most memorable (or at least quotable) musings on the nature of history. “Men,” he wrote, “make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances encountered, given and transmitted from the past.”¹ Focused on material conditions, Marx’s criticism did not extend to the Archives, where Louis Napoleon’s imperial government sought to control the conditions for men to write French history.

If people no longer have to imprint within their mind the images of things they want to remember, they will diminish their memory capacity.

The study of material culture, which grew out of anthropology and the study of preliterate cultures, has had only a minor influence in the historical profession. Texts and, to a lesser degree, visual evidence have been the primary sources for the reconstruction of the historic past. What can the study of material culture offer the study of history?<br>

  Abstract: This essay is about the colonial order of things as seen through its archival productions. It asks what insights about the colonial might be gained from attending not only to colonialism’s archival content but to its particular and sometimes peculiar form. Its focus is on archiving as a process rather than archives as things. It looks to archives as epistemological experiments rather than as sources—to colonial archives as cross-sections of contested knowledge. Most important, I want to suggest that colonial archives were both transparencies on which power relations were inscribed and intricate technologies of rule in themselves. The essay’s<br>

For that reason, instructions were sent from the Communist Party’s national office to district organizers such as Junius Irving Scales (1920–2002), who supervised North and South Carolina, to interview each member during the annual registration.

She finds knowledge more seductive than flattery as the serpent tempts her through the power of speech and his capacity to rationalize. Listening to the serpent, Eve imagines how she too might possess greater knowledge, augmenting her own “inward powers.” She discovers the “virtues” of a fruit that makes her mind “capacious,” suddenly capable of discerning “things” erstwhile “visible” only “in heaven.” While recognizing how her actions violate God’s command, she nonetheless momentarily relishes the reward.

  Abstract: To perform is a transitive verb. Grammatically, this means that the verb perform takes a direct object, relating one element or property to another. One performs something, a theater piece (a drama, a comedy, a farce, a tragedy), a musical score, a ritual, a critique, a sales spiel. And this piece, this work, is performed by someone—an actor, a man, a woman, an herbalist, a hermaphrodite, a queen, a slave. Relating subject to object, to perform is also to facilitate transition. There is an agentive quality to performance, a force, a playing out of identities and histories. ʺEverything in<br>

  Abstract: Like the word 
                  folklore, the word text is something folklorists can control only partially. I prefer to think of any object of interpretation as a text. But just as the general public has its own understanding of folklore, no matter how academic folklorists may define it, many constituencies are involved in constructing definitions of text. In this essay I review what I consider to be the more important meanings of text, and then I consider the special contributions that folklorists can make to an understanding of text. Although text is an exceedingly important concept for folklorists, the folklore text by<br>

  CHAPTER 5  FINDING JOY IN THE HISTORY OF EMOTIONS from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/j.ctt3fh5m1">Doing Emotions History</a><br>
  Author(s) McMAHON DARRIN M.<br>
  Abstract: Are historians of emotions a negative lot? Do they give greater weight to angst and animosity, sadness and fear than they do to the positive human emotions? Indeed, might the field of the history of emotions as a whole suffer from something of a “negative bias,” a tendency to accord greater prominence to the role played by negative emotions in constituting the human past? Consider the titles of a recent, semester-long speakers’ series at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of the History of Emotions in Berlin:¹ “Sorrow carved in stone: Expressions of grief and suffering in Ottoman Muslim<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctt17xr4vt">Cannibal Metaphysics</a><br>
  Author(s) Skafish Peter<br>
  Abstract: Can anthropology be philosophy? Can it not just contribute to but do, and even aid in reinventing philosophy, in the sense of constructive, speculative metaphysics? And what, in that event, would philosophy be, since most of its best instances begin, end with, and never abandon Western categories? Such questions might be lamely disciplinary were it not for the symmetrically unimaginative, joint response they still receive. For the philosophers, things are often quite simple: anthropology is a source of empirical specifications or exemplifications of matters conceived more universally by themselves, but only rarely does it accede to such a broad level<br>

  Abstract: I once had the intention of writing a book that would have been something of a homage to Deleuze and Guattari from the point of view of my discipline; it would have been called
                     Anti-Narcissus: Anthropology as Minor Science. The idea was to characterize the conceptual tensions animating contemporary anthropology. From the moment I had the title, however, the problems began. I quickly realized that the project verged on complete contradiction, and the least misstep on my part could have resulted in a mess of not so anti-narcissistic provocations about the excellence of the positions to be professed.<br>

  Abstract: It was emphasized above that the double author of
                     Anti-Oedipusargued that “nothing is changed” by the fact that the primordial energy is one of affiliation—in other words, it would just be a contingent fact. We then asked whether it would not be legitimate to conceive of another intensive order where the primary energy would be an “energy of alliance.” The problem, we concluded, was to determine the conditions for the construction of a concept of alliance qua disjunctive synthesis.<br>

  Abstract: We will return once more to the passage from Lévi-Strauss already cited several times in these pages, the one where the dean of the Americanists connects “critical analyses” of the notion of affinity (which Brazilian ethnologists led the way in
                  113) to the uncovering of an indigenous philosophical problematic. All of this derives, at the end of the day, from Lévi-Strauss himself, and I think that he knew it perfectly well. That South American affinity is indeed not a sociological category but a philosophical idea was something Lévi-Strauss had observed in a premonitory way in one of his very first works,<br>

  Abstract: Is there such a thing as contemporary art history? The contemporary, after all-as much as we may want to consider it otherwise-is being made history as it happens. By what means do we examine this moving target? These questions lie at the center of Jane Blocker's

  Book Title: Exchanging Clothes-Habits of Being II<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): RABINOWITZ PAULA<br>
  Abstract: The second in a four-part series charting the social, cultural, and political expression of clothing, dress, and accessories,
         Exchanging Clothesfocuses on the concept of transnational "circulation and exchange"-not only the global exchange of material commodities across time and space but also of the ideas, images, colors, and textures related to fashion. Essays examine the parade of heroes past, from Homer and Virgil to Dante and Ariosto, wearing armor or nothing; the social power of a tie or of a safety pin sprung from punk fashion to the red carpet; a Midwestern thrift store, from cheap labor to cheap purchase, as a microcosm of global circulation; and lesbian pulp fiction as how-to-dress manuals.<br>

  Author(s) Montani Laura<br>
  Abstract: The most ancient definition of the word “accessory,” together with the meaning it commonly has in current usage, suggests a unique spatial configuration where center and periphery are confused and intertwined. Anything that is marginal is, indeed, also a pathway required or necessary to get to a given point, a destination, taken to be a hypothetical center.<br>

  Author(s) Mandelli (Krizia) Mariuccia<br>
  Abstract: In my opinion, accessories are small, portable talismans of our well-being. They make up that framework of meaning that we construct about ourselves; they are invaluable indicators of taste, character, style, and behavior. I can understand a lot more about people by looking at their shoes or their watch than the clothes they wear or the things they say. Walter Albini, one of my first assistants who went on to become an almost legendary name in fashion, used to say that accessories are ten times more important than clothes. I agreed then—and I agree now.<br>

  Author(s) Barile Nello<br>
  Abstract: If fashion is a language, albeit one marked by a low semantic level, then accessories can be taken as special indicators of the meaning of clothing. Idiosyncratically arranged, they are able to create both stable structures and variations on a theme. As a starting point I would like to use Mikhail Bakhtin’s concept of “multiaccentuality” and its appropriation by Stuart Hall, who adopts it as a benchmark for his encoding/decoding model.¹ His analysis of these modes of arrangement reveals decisive turning points in the social history of the tie.² Hidden within this accessory, in fact, is a symbolic potential that<br>

  Author(s) Dib-Marouf Chafika<br>
  Abstract: Within Algerian culture, the semiology of clothing and, more generally, the code of jewelry as it encompasses all aspects of ornamentation constitute a privileged mode of expression. In the feminine universe of Tlemcen,¹ this code marks the events of festivals and ceremonies, and at the same time, delimits moments of daily life, more permissive because more anonymous.² However, even important occasions of ceremony are not rigidly prescriptive because the ritual space permits a wide range of possible choices, whose thresholds are nevertheless defined by rules of avoidance (at the lower limit) and rules of designation or exemplarity (at the upper<br>

  Abstract: “The artist may be known rather by what he omits,” as Eisenstein quotes Schiller in a diary entry dated June 20, 1947, almost exactly six months before his death in February 1948.¹ The quotation might strike us as incongruous, coming from the master who was never shy to voice his opinion or illustrate his points—in both his directorial work and his theoretical commentaries. Yet at this late stage of his career, Eisenstein becomes preoccupied with the issue of what he termed “great nothingness”—the opposite, the emptiness, the nonidentity against which we can define what is present and given.<br>

  Author(s): Sayers Jentery<br>
  Abstract: In
         Making Things and Drawing Boundaries, critical theory and cultural practice meet creativity, collaboration, and experimentation with physical materials as never before. Foregrounding the interdisciplinary character of experimental methods and hands-on research, this collection asks what it means to "make" things in the humanities. How is humanities research manifested in hand and on screen alongside the essay and monograph? And, importantly, how does experimentation with physical materials correspond with social justice and responsibility? Comprising almost forty chapters from ninety practitioners across twenty disciplines,Making Things and Drawing Boundariesspeaks directly and extensively to how humanities research engages a growing interest in "maker" culture, however "making" may be defined.<br>

In digital humanities (DH), we see this turn in Matthew Kirschenbaum’s (2007) forensic analysis of computer hard disks; platform studies that investigate the relationship between computing culture, consoles, and other hardware (Monfort and Bogost 2009); and maker cultures that explore the humanities through practical experimentation (Dieter and Lovink 2014).

According to Wendell Berry in “Conservation Is Good Work,” “The idea that we live in something called ‘the environment’ … is utterly preposterous.” The prime position accorded to this noun in “the language we are using to talk about our connection to the world” signals, for Berry, both the anthropocentrism and the “inadequacy” of twentieth-century ecodiscourse.

Instead, it is something that is socially constructed and socially situated—not only incubated in the shared desire to preserve that which is worth remembering but also fashioned in such a way as to connect it to an “eternal present.” Collective remembrance is absolutely essential for connecting the past with the future.

  Abstract: With these two phrases, as is often the case in his writings on Heidegger, Derrida opens up a perspective that is at the same time a breach. It has been said over and over again that the existential analytic recoils from thinking about the political, that it treats the political as an ancillary and derivative question. But Derrida’s two remarks suggest something else. They invite us to ask more specifically if this wavering before the political might not be what is playing itself out in the sections

  Abstract: It only remains in these opening remarks to say something about the structure of
                  Meeting Placeand the style. To call this an essay is not to be coy; all meetings proceed by way of trial and error, and if we could circumscribe and regulate them, they would hold little attraction. The short sections into which the arguments are organized are imagined like the rapid succession of graffitied walls, suburban streets in perspectives, sudden outfannings of rivers, and the loftier parallax of high-rise offices as one finalizes the journey. They conjoin different topics, perspectives, and speeds of approach. This can<br>

  Abstract: Another way to think about the meeting place is acoustically. In the classical model of the meeting place, the agora, forum, or square is a place for public talking. They are designed so that some members of the community at least can make themselves heard. To win the attention of neighbors, speeches were rhetorically amplified and distinctive kinds of storytelling developed. Something corresponding to Habermas’s communicative reason was being cultivated, and the conventions of public debate established in these classical settings continue in the structuration of modern parliamentary democracy. At the same time, the harmonization of voices, opinion, and architectural<br>

  In Passing from:

  Abstract: Obviously, not everyone meets in the meeting place. Most people pass through remaining strangers to one another. The meeting place legitimates the social value of not meeting. It creates scope for solitude: not everyone is lonely in the crowd. Even in the meeting place meeting is exceptional. In fact, in a way, the intention of the informal choreographies that characterize the collective movement form of the public is to avoid a face-to-face encounter. If you watch the sea of heads bobbing up and down as people stalk into the distance, it resembles nothing so much as an undulating sheet of<br>

  Abstract: Here I want to stage a meeting between two terms. One of them,
                  hedra, is a Greek word that survives in our word polyhedron. The other is an Arrernte word,utyerre, whose connotations are explained in a recent book by Margaret Kemarre Turner. These are words about pigeonholes, the natural locations for things, but they are also terms that are pigeonholed, like their cultures, thought to be of merely local or anthropological interest. A discussion of them illuminates what might be meant by characterizing the meeting place as “a more convenient place.” At the same time, it also illuminates another<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctt5hjjn9">Meeting Place</a><br>
  Abstract: Let’s try to enter the meeting place by another route. The meeting place is neither people nor place; it is some kind of algorithm of sociability, which from a material thinking point of view must be manifest in some palpable expression, whether fleeting glance, parallax of legs, or other unforeseen juxtaposition of formerly strange things. The meeting place is a matrix for the production of metaphors, figures of transport joining unlike things. When it incubates encounter, it not only facilitates and multiplies opportunities of exchange but also sets the exchange rates. Both stable and unstable, it can be characterized as<br>

  Abstract: The problem with Brownian motion, at least as a model of human sociability, is that it does not lead anywhere. The incessant agitation of the particles succeeds in keeping them out of one another’s path. There is much ado, but it is much ado about nothing. Although such physical energy may be cognate with the dynamical nature of, say, a colloid suspension, it proves limited in the human situation. After a while a certain fatigue sets in if the meandering leads to no change of state. I suppose this is why in sports they introduce goals, touchdowns, and points; these<br>

  Abstract: Another way to approach the enigma of the meeting place is historically. Perhaps the reason why it is so difficult to reconcile its desirable properties with anything remotely suggested by contemporary urban space is that love of any kind is irreconcilable with enclosure. The meeting place inhabited by de Tocqueville’s contradictory crowd, at once hypersociable and neurotically individualistic, produces these dysfunctional social forms because it intensifies the oscillation between Lack and Plenty (which, in the Platonic myth, are the parents of Eros)—but what if Eros has different parents, or like the “bastard reasoning” associated with Pothos is ignorant of<br>

  Abstract: Perhaps the question of the meeting place has been wrongly framed. Instead of bringing things together, perhaps it is an art of arrangement or redistribution. Take Leibniz’s thought experiment, according to which the order of events is as follows: a random distribution of points exists, and an equation is found, an algorithm, that joins them into a single line. This two-step process implies a third: the elimination of the need for points. In the future, the instantaneously produced, self-consistent line neutralizes time and space. Leibniz’s calculus seems to make it possible to draw together the most unlike positions: it resolves<br>

  Abstract: In this scenario the wall intercedes on behalf of the experience of encounter. Materializing the place of meeting/not-meeting, it capitalizes on an originary sociality and gives it the face of sociability. The face is not a fascinating, phallocentric positivity. It is an imaginary one, in the sense that Arjun Appadurai lends that term when he writes, “The image, the imagined, the imaginary—these are all terms which direct us to something critical and new in global cultural processes: the imagination as social work.

  Abstract: From Aurora, the Roman goddess of the dawn, comes aurora borealis and aurora australis, winds of the north and south that speak of beginnings. I have never felt more attracted to a subject I have never seen. From a scientific standpoint, my desire makes sense: auroras are places where light and magnetism meet.

  Author(s) YATES JULIAN<br>
  Abstract: Waxing lyrical on the figure of the rainbow, bringing us back from the brink of an abstracting adulthood to a childhood in which color manifests as substance, Walter Benjamin posits something on the order of a prismatic materialism in these lines. Color morphs and moves. Insector angel-like, it “flits from one form to the next,” rendering each lively if not alive. This undifferentiated relation to color as substance radicalizes perception. It ties color to the objects that play host to it such that the visual becomes tactile. Color becomes transitive or transactional. Color happens. It happens to you, through you.<br>

  Abstract: Grey is the fate of color at twilight. As the sun’s radiance dwindles, objects receive less light to scatter and absorb. They yield to the world a diminishing energy, so that the vibrancy of orange, indigo, and red dull to dusky hues. A grey ecology might therefore seem a moribund realm, an expanse of slow loss, wanness, and withdrawal, a graveyard space of mourning. Perhaps with such muted steps the apocalypse arrives, not with a bang but a dimming. Or maybe ashen grey is all that remains after the fires of the world’s end have extinguished themselves, when nothing remains<br>

  Abstract: Like the story of Adam and Eve where hominids once lived in paradise and were then exiled for disobeying God’s commandment not to eat from the tree of knowledge, the story of contemporary green ecology either seems to be that once there was an idyllic and harmonious nature that was then destroyed through the advent of humans, or that once nature and hominids lived in harmony only to have this harmony destroyed by the advent of modern science, technology, and capitalist economy. The story runs that something has upset the balance of nature and that we must return to equilibrium.<br>

Twin components of the industrial machine of public imagination, both promise escape, pleasure, and all the sensations and prerogatives of mobility.¹ From the outset, film offered experiences of virtual travel, cashing in on the modern fascination for motion and the hunger to “bring things ‘closer’ spatially and humanly,” if only by their likeness.² Tourism, meanwhile, found in film a promotional idiom and instrument that turns places into destinations, and destinations into bundles of affect, story, image, and sensation that circulate globally, inviting the audiences they touch to travel in turn.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttsk90">Atavistic Tendencies</a><br>
  Abstract: Atavism demonstrates, sometimes quite poignantly, that the body does not coincide with its present. It dramatizes the past as in communication with the present; it insists that the past and the present are temporal spheres fused in continuity. By making manifest a disordered temporality, the atavistic body demonstrates something of the nature of cultural preoccupations in late modernity. At the same time, the epistemological projects orbiting around this body demonstrate something of the nature of the formal procedures exercised in the scientific pursuit of corporeal mastery. If those procedures may be seen in psychoanalysis and medical photography, they also emerge<br>

  Abstract: “There is but one thing to say: ‘There it is; go see it for yourself,’” Charles F. Lummis told readers of his 1892
                  A Tramp across the Continent. “It is a crying shame that any American who is able to travel at all should fail to see nature’s masterpiece upon this planet before he fad abroad to visit scenes that would not make a visible scratch upon its walls.”¹ Such words were indicative of Lummis’s fervent nationalism and promotion of the Grand Canyon and the Southwest.

  Abstract: We live in an era of collectors. We record and save everything: pictures from childhood and souvenirs from grandmothers in private and family life, newspaper and magazine clippings referring to issues or events of interest, making up official and private archives of all kinds. The past is an object of cult in the West, and this displays itself in the marketing and consumption of various “retro” styles, in the boom of antiques and of historical novels. In the public sphere, archives are growing in numbers, commemorative dates proliferate, and there is a never- ending demand for memorial plaques and monuments.¹<br>

  Abstract: A certain loss is always entailed in representation. Indeed André Bazin, for whom realism was central to valuing cinema as an art, nevertheless observed: “Some measure of reality must always be sacrificed in the effort of achieving it,” for the more real it appears, the less it signifies the contingent reality it is the record of.¹ Similarly, Lacan notes that something must be lost—broken away—in the making of what he termed the

  Abstract: In a theoretical age often enamored of the “playfulness” of the sign and the “pleasure” of the text, Paul de Man’s last writings stand out as darkly sobering, driven as they are by an almost ascetic desire to bring thinking into proximity with what he calls, after Walter Benjamin,

  Author(s) Kritzman Lawrence D.<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between the exemplum of cripples and the theme of causality is central to Montaigne’s representation of the monster in the essay “On Cripples” (III, n).¹ If the question of causality is discussed early in the chapter, it is in order to set in motion an epistemological critique whose target is the weakness of human reason. Montaigne focuses specifically on the defects of human understanding and our need to shift attention away from things
                  (“chases”)in order to reflect more closely on their causes(“causes”).Nevertheless, by engaging in this wordplay the essayist ironically links things to causes and<br>

  Abstract: In the medieval Icelandic culture of the supernatural, one who recrossed the boundary from death to life was called
                  aptrgangr(revenant) ordraugr,derived from the Indo-European rootdhreugh(harm, deceive). In thedraugr,spirit is not breathed into matter so much as material corporeality is retained by the restless spirit. The collected evidence, literary and folkloric, medieval and later, gives a consistent picture of physically active dead beings who bear the earth of the grave or the sodden clothing of death at sea. Not only are their bodies uncorrupted, but in the cases of the physically most active and<br>

  Abstract: Marco Denevi is one of Argentina’s most influential and important prose writers. One of the most distinctive features of his writing is the creation of a situation in which a presumed truth has been concealed with a mask. Consequently, in Denevi’s work there always seems to be an uneasy tension, a nagging suspicion that something is definitely not what it appears to be. As the reader proceeds through the narration, the numerous false facades that hide the unexpected and sometimes shocking truth lying underneath are slowly chipped away. Denevi’s numerous

It is about a practice of close reading that oscillates rapidly between domains—the literary-aesthetic, the social, the cultural, and the political—in order to explore the mutually illuminating heterogeneity of these domains when taken together. It does this not to assert the often repeated postmodernist view that there is nothing outside the text, but to outline a reading practice I call

  Abstract: In a sense, to speak of foreign policy presupposes the availability of a given spatialization of the world in terms of us and them. Conventionally, foreign policy is the set of actions by “us” out “there.” In the modern, post-Westphalian world of nation-states, foreign policy constitutes the actions of state elites who try to maintain, at minimum, something called “our national security” and to further at every opportunity something called “our national interest.” This discourse of foreign policy is amnesiac about the relative novelty of its central identities and the dialectical character of its antinomies. It exemplifies the Nietzschean dictum<br>

  Abstract: The discipline of art history has always aimed to do justice to the complexity of works of art in their compelling visuality, taking the relationship between particular works of art and their individual beholders as the field’s primary object of investigation. In this respect, this book is no different from any traditional art historical inquiry. The following essays, however, articulate questions that contemporary art historians generally dismiss as ahistorical or anachronistic or—worse yet—philosophical, implying that “anything goes” when a work of art is approached “philosophically.” In her contribution to this volume, Michael Ann Holly cogently articulates the conundrum<br>

This regular confinement to bed tended to put me out of touch with things, which led my parents to allow me to travel more or less with my bed through the whole house, which in turn often brought me to their bedroom.

  Abstract: The disruption of linear chronology in
                  Pulp Fiction(1994) allows Quentin Tarantino to emphasize the contingency of the events that take place and to hint at the existence of other possible worlds in which things took a different course. The use of the atemporal mode to explore multiple possible worlds becomes explicit, however, in Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber’sButterfly Effect(2004). WhereasPulp Fictionlinks alternate possibilities to the temporal nature of subjectivity,Butterfly Effectuses possible worlds to insist on the trauma that resists the ameliorative effects of temporality.

The two are distinct to such an extent that they demand different forms of description: one should never employ the term “is” when talking about the temporal world in which everything becomes, just as one should never use “was” or “will be” when speaking of eternity in which nothing changes. Careless deployment of verb tense, according to Plato, leads to blurring the absolute nature of the distinction. Yet Plato nonetheless envisions a relationship between eternity and time in which time is “a moving image of eternity.”¹ Eternity<br>

  Book Title: Labor of Dionysus-A Critique of the State-Form<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Negri Antonio<br>
  Abstract: “Labor is the living, form-giving fire,” Marx wrote. “It is the transitoriness of things, their temporality, as their transformation by living time.” How is it, then, that labor, with all its life-affirming potential, has become the means of capitalist discipline, exploitation, and domination in modern society? The authors expose and pursue this paradox through a systematic analysis of the role of labor in the processes of capitalist production and in the establishment of capitalist legal and social institutions. Critiquing liberal and socialist notions of labor and institutional reform from a radical democratic perspective, Hardt and Negri challenge the state-form itself.<br>

In this way, Benhabib associates the Utopian impulse with what Ernst Bloch calls our “principle of hope”—our ability and desire to imagine something other and better than our existing conditions. At the same time, however, the Utopian impulse is characterized by a set of conservative logics and gestures that are increasingly seen as<br>

  Abstract: Possessing a disempowered position within society, oppressed groups need something more than a stabilizing of the social space that consolidates their position on the margins. The traditional utopian goal of projecting an ideal space free from ideological conflict, however, is incompatible with the goal of exposing and exploring the contradictions and double binds that inflect female subjectivity. If marginalized groups retain this strategy, challenges to the status quo tend to reproduce the logic of stable difference and create “utopias of reversal.” To the extent that contemporary feminists address the ways in which women have been denied the opportunity to establish<br>

What happens when we apply some of these recent reflexive considerations that have emerged in philosophical theory to particular anthropological practices and ethnographic inscription?

But Dante’s small book is forward-, rather than backward-looking; Dante saw his poetry as the culmination and fulfillment of his predecessors’ poetics, and as a promise of something greater, as completing their works in the same way that the New Testament was thought to have completed the Old—a figural reading of literary<br>

The eclectic iconography of the Quays’ cinematic world—its meandering narrative structures and unique cosmogony—hinders an assured or exclusive classification to a genre or a movement.

Husserl distinguishes between two fundamental kinds of signs: expressions (Ausdrücke), which mean (bedeuten) something or express a meaning (Bedeutung); and indications or indicative signs (Anzeichen), which do not express a meaning.

What does it mean to call expressions meaningful signs,bedeutsame Zeichen, signs that “want to say” (veulent-dire) something? Derrida spells this out in two major steps. The first (A) is dominated by the claim that meaning (Bedeutung) is a function of oral discourse.

It is the instantaneous moment of the blink, which closes the eye, not the glance, which opens up a field of vision.

                  cannothave much to say to these arts, not for accidental reasons of language and geography, but because this philosophy tends to be struck mute before anything as corporeal as the martial arts. Philosophy began in the West as a movement of nature rationalism, conceiving nature as a rational order, a cosmos with a principle that is both intelligible and intelligent.

  EPILOGUE from:

  Abstract: An aesthetic paradox of Asian martial arts is that something so warlike in conception should be beautiful to watch and joyful to perform. While designed for violence and visibly expressing that functionality, the martial arts are not practiced with a violent purpose and do no harm (although they certainly could). By suspending the dread of violence, the practice creates a theater in which to contemplate movements combining artful design with eloquent efficacy. But if you remove the training conventions and introduce unfeigned violence (as in boxing), the aesthetic serenity will vanish into the sometimes irrepressibly fascinating chaos of violence.<br>

Writing to Louise Colet in 1852, Flaubert reflected wistfully, “What seems beautiful to me, what I should like to write, is a book about nothing, a book dependent on nothing external, which would be held together by the internal strength of its style.”¹ In the first of his Clark lectures, given in 1927, E.

  Author(s) INGRAM JAMES D.<br>
  Abstract: Utopia, we might think, is nothing if not political. Its best-known examples, from Plato via More, Campanella, and Bacon to Owen, Morris, and Bellamy, present cities, the political form of life par excellence, organized to remedy the defects their authors perceived in their own. To this extent they offer up political solutions to political problems. At the same time, however, utopias are forever being criticized for seeking to escape or eliminate politics, and not without reason. For if utopias present solutions to political problems, by building the common good into the design of the worlds they depict, they do away<br>

  Author(s) KINNA RUTH<br>
  Abstract: For anarchists, utopias are about action. As Uri Gordon argues, utopias are “umbilically connected to the idea of social revolution.”¹ The kind of action utopia describes is a matter of debate. This essay examines how utopian thinking shapes anarchist thought and highlights some recent shift s in the political uses of utopia. Utopianism is not treated as an abstract concept or method, or as a literary genre or place—because that is not how anarchists have understood the idea. Utopia, Gordon notes, “has always meant something more than a hypothetical exercise in designing a perfect society.” As a revolutionary idea,<br>

  Abstract: Since the evolution of speech, writing has arguably been our species’ most consequential innovation. By “innovation” I mean any successful, alternative way of doing something. Some of these changes were the result of gene mutation, the prime factor in natural selection, as over time alternative procedures aided their users to survive and reproduce and were thereby passed along to their descendants. Other innovations, learned by imitation, were transmitted through cultural evolution. Nonhuman animals show little or no capacity for innovation.

  Book Title: The Force of the Example-Explorations in the Paradigm of Judgment<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Allen Amy<br>
  Abstract: Alessandro Ferrara instead launches an entirely different strategy for transcending the particularity of context without contradicting our pluralistic intuitions: a strategy centered on the exemplary universalism of judgment. Whereas exemplarity has long been thought to belong to the domain of aesthetics, this book explores the
         otheruses to which it can be put in our philosophical predicament, especially in the field of politics. After defining exemplarity and describing how something unique can possess universal significance, Ferrara addresses the force exerted by exemplarity, the nature of the judgment that discloses exemplarity, and the way in which the force of the example can bridge the difference between various contexts.<br>

  Abstract: Diverse and far apart though our cultures might be, the world that you and I inhabit is shaped by three great forces. The first and most powerful of them is the force of 
                  what exists, of what is already there, in place—the force of things. We experience this force in two fundamental ways. Sometimes we encounter it as the force of habit and routine, of tradition, of mores and custom, of culture, of convention, of usage, of established practice and received wisdom.

  Abstract: As the title suggests, something has changed in the relation between religion and politics as the twentieth century passed into the next. What precisely has changed is the subject discussed in this chapter. Is the demand emerging within Western democratic societies for a more conspicuous and visible “public role” to be played by religious faith, or at least for deprivatization of religious affiliation and conduct, justified and legitimate? What are the implications of acknowledging this transformation of our public space for our understanding of the nexus of religion, modern society, and politics?<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, I argued against the notion of “depth” in depth psychology and similar forms of humanistic inquiry. It serves little purpose when we use it to think about progress in the humanities. I have not concluded, therefore, that there can be no progress in humanistic enterprises. On the contrary, we can point to numerous moments of humanistic success. They are not cumulative in the way that science is. This demarcates something important about humanistic enterprises, namely that they begin anew with each new generation.<br>

  Abstract: Standing in the twenty-first century, it’s clear that the “age of anxiety” that W. H. Auden declared in 1947 is still with us. But some things have changed. In the wake of World War II, writers looked to the inventions of total war, notably to nuclear weaponry, when composing their visions of technological anxiety. In the last decades of the millennium, nuclear worry does not disappear, but it cedes some ground to concerns about techniques for radically altering so-called nature. Biotechnologies that transform life take center stage; they change the world not through the spectacular blast but through gradual reconfiguration<br>

But there is no agreed definition of Marxism. There used to be something more or less official called Marxism-Leninism, and, as opposed to it, there was something called Western Marxism, which had its roots in the Hegelian and Weberian rereading of Marx that was initiated by Georg Lukács in

  Abstract: In this book I have argued that the dominant approach to cosmopolitanism in contemporary political philosophy is undermined by what could be described as a lack of realism. That approach proceeds as though, by developing the best moral arguments and normative visions, it will be able to persuade people—presumably those in a position to change things—to bring about a better world. This practical presupposition is seldom defended explicitly; rather, it is taken to be self-evident—simply what one does when one does political philosophy. Occasionally, it is true, cosmopolitan theorists ask whether the ends or schemes they develop<br>

  Abstract: Today’s world is full of paradoxes, many of which could be summarized by the idea that it is a world belonging to everyone and to no one. There are many issues that are everyone’s (they affect all of us and demand coordinated actions), but at the same time, no one can or wants to be in charge of them (either there is no competent authority or no one shoulders the responsibility). What is the difference between something held in common and something that is ungovernable, between shared responsibility and generalized irresponsibility?

  Abstract: As Ulrich Beck says, unlike other previous civilizations, we cannot attribute everything that threatens us to external causes; societies are in conflict with themselves, with the production of that which they do not desire. Explaining this characteristic contrasts with our common sense, which tends to establish net causalities, distinguishes subjects from objects, thinks in terms of hierarchy, and explains the idea of defense in terms of spatial protection. To identify and understand the nature of threats in a world that belongs to everyone and to no one, we have no choice but to make a “metaphorological” effort. I am going<br>

  Abstract: The current transformation of many of our borders into walls is a clear indicator of the ambiguity of the process of globalization, which combines opening and fragmentation, delimitation and closure. This issue places crucial aspects of our humanity at stake since borders and boundaries are linked to the realities of inside and outside, inclusion and exclusion, questions of identity and difference. The current tendency of multiplying strategies for closure reveals that we have significant difficulties when it comes to different ways of configuring everything that has to do with the legal-political realm, citizenship, identity, or security.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/juda14774">Situating Existentialism</a><br>
  Author(s) Aronson Ronald<br>
  Abstract: Albert Camus, a master of unforgettable images in his fiction and philosophy, left us none more striking than that of Sisyphus. Condemned to forever roll his rock up the hill only to see it roll back down, then to descend and begin again, Sisyphus incarnates a twentieth- (and now twenty-first-) century sense of life’s absurdity, its “futility and hopeless labor.”¹ Yet there is something triumphant in his endless effort, his intense consciousness. He is the absurd hero: “His scorn of the gods, his hatred of death, and his passion for life won him that unspeakable penalty in which the whole<br>

  11  Rethinking the “Existential” Nietzsche in Germany: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/juda14774">Situating Existentialism</a><br>
  Author(s) Bambach Charles<br>
  Abstract: In an idiom from his philosophical autobiography 
                  Ecce Homo that betrays the marks of both prophecy and irony, Nietzsche proclaims: “I am a destiny.” “My truth is dreadful,” he writes. “I am by far the most terrible human being there has ever been.” As the herald of this dreadful truth, Nietzsche positions himself as the thinker of both ascent and decline, the one who prepares “a decision evoked against everything that until now has been believed in, demanded, sanctified.” “Have I been understood?” Nietzsche asks. “The unmasking of Christian morality is an event [Ereignis] without equal, a real catastrophe.

  Abstract: The social and political history of Lebanon—despite occasional manifestations of consensus, balance and harmony—has always been characterized by successive outbursts of civil strife and political violence. The brutality and duration of almost two decades of senseless bloodletting might have obscured some of the earlier episodes. Consequently, observers are often unaware that much of Lebanon’s history is essentially a history of intermittent violence. Dramatic episodes such as the peasant uprisings of 1820, 1840, and 1857 and the repeated outbreaks of sectarian hostilities in 1841, 1845, 1860, 1958, and the protracted civil war of 1975–92, reveal, if anything, the<br>

  Abstract: Why has evil become such a hot topic these days? Although there could be many reasons, it seems to me that the most important one—the most interesting—has to do with our growing concern with how this age-old problem has entered more and more into our consciousness. In other words, in spite of our failure to cope with human cruelty, we possess a clearer, more moral way to analyze what we call “atrocities.” Our last century was plagued by horrific actions of human cruelty; nevertheless, something about our understanding has been transformed.

  Book Title: The Disclosure of Politics-Struggles Over the Semantics of Secularization<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lara María Pía<br>
  Abstract: For Lara, secularization means three things: the translation of religious semantics into politics; a transformation of religious notions into political ideas; and the reoccupation of a space left void by changing political actors that gives rise to new conceptions of political interaction. Conceptual innovation redefines politics as a horizontal relationship between governments and the governed and better enables societies (and individual political actors) to articulate meaning through action -- that is, through the emergence of new concepts. These actions, Lara proves, radically transform our understanding of politics and the role of political agents and are further enhanced by challenging the structural dependence of politics on religious phenomena.<br>

  Author(s) JEN-TO YAO<br>
  Abstract: As alien rulers who hardly knew anything about Taiwan before they landed on the island at the end of the nineteenth century, the members of the Japanese colonial government inevitably encountered two fundamental difficulties, which can be encapsulated in the universal questions posed by Bruno Latour in another context: “how to be familiar with things, people and events which are distant,” and, in turn, “how to act at a distance on unfamiliar events, places, and people” (Latour 1987:220, 223). Latour’s answer to these questions is, of course, already well known: by appealing to “some mobile, stable and combinable means to<br>

  Abstract: More than a quarter-century after its initial publication, Fredric Jameson’s controversial essay “Third World Literature in the Era of Multinational Capitalism” retains something of an unfortunate relevance to Anglophone fiction from India. The central claim in that essay—that all Third World cultures are characterized by a fusion of private and public lives and that this fusion ensures that all narratives (especially the novel) from such cultures are structured on the paradigm of the national allegory—still continues to resonate with an overarching trend of Indian English fiction.

  Book Title: The Highway of Despair-Critical Theory After Hegel<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Marasco Robyn<br>
  Abstract: The Highway of Despairfollows Theodor Adorno, Georges Bataille, and Frantz Fanon as they each read, resist, and reconfigure a strand of thought in Hegel'sPhenomenology of Spirit. Confronting the twentieth-century collapse of a certain revolutionary dialectic, these thinkers struggle to revalue critical philosophy and recast Left Hegelianism within the contexts of genocidal racism, world war, and colonial domination. Each thinker also re-centers the role of passion in critique. Arguing against more recent trends in critical theory that promise an escape from despair, Marasco shows how passion frustrates the resolutions of reason and faith. Embracing the extremism of what Marx, in the spirit of Hegel, called the "ruthless critique of everything existing," she affirms the contemporary purchase of radical critical theory, resulting in a passionate approach to political thought.<br>

  Abstract: No single thinker has done more to shape the idea of critical theory in the postwar period than Jürgen Habermas. As I see things, Habermas turns away from a potential project opened up by the thinkers considered in this study—not just Adorno, to whom his connection is obvious, but also Bataille, of whom he is substantially more critical, and Fanon, about whom he says nothing. In recent years, Habermas has turned his attention to questions pertaining to philosophy and religion, the relationship between reason and faith, and the connection between postmetaphysical thinking and theological endeavors. These inquiries are exciting,<br>

  Abstract: The idealist tradition manifests in an ad hoc way. Plato practiced a schizophrenic pedagogy: he had an oral esoteric discourse intended for elites, while offering an exoteric teaching to a greater number of people. This is an aristocratic practice of philosophy. The Academy professes that Plato is for everyone, that nothing prohibits us from taking a course on Plato.

  Abstract: Most people say they are atheist these days, but they are fooling themselves. Most atheisms are overtly nihilistic. What makes them so? European nihilism—so well described by Nietzsche—presupposes the end of the universe and the difficulty of finding another one. In the meantime, atheistic nihilism struggles between two visions of the world: the Judeo-Christian and something not yet defined, which we’ll call post-Christian, for lack of a better term—we do not fool ourselves with that, it is for lack of a better term. Only time and progress through the century will permit us to discover it. For<br>

Why are we obligated to admire something on a pedestal that we would despise outside of the limited context of the artistic world (confines considered sacred these days, just as religious spaces were for so long)? How can we explain this kind of schizophrenia? We condemn liberal capitalism, criticize the domination of the market, and fight against American imperialism, while simultaneously adoring symbols, icons, and emblems produced by that very world we supposedly execrate.

  Abstract: Every existence entails an emergence from nothing, and the only prospect is to return to it someday. Life unfolds between two nothings. But the boundaries are blurred; it is very difficult to speak clearly about later, previously, down the way, before, and after. Nobody denies that a being comes from a spermatozoid and an ovum, but what are the philosophical statuses of those two separate objects? Half-alive things? Things that are potentially alive? Are there two complementary forces that are alive, but that must come together to produce another living being, one that is finally real, finally true?<br>

The pope had nothing to do with it, nor did Western leaders, still less European intellectuals. The drive behind it came not from the outside, but from the inside. The Soviet system did not explode; it imploded like a machine whose internal parts had corroded.

Even liberal capitalism has renounced the coup d’états theorized by Malaparte.¹ There is zero credence in the Marxist idea that changes to the economic infrastructure automatically lead to modifications of ideological superstructures.

  Abstract: In a review essay published in 1996 entitled “Modernism and Postmodernism in the Study of Religion,” Catherine Bell off ered a provocative diagnosis of two chronic methodological debates afflicting the study of religion. Both, she says, are “variations of a fundamental polarization between ‘insider’ claims to experience something in one set of terms and ‘outsider’ claims to explain that experience in very different terms.” The first debate pits “modernists,” those who endorse methods for studying religion that explain religion in naturalistic and social-scientific terms, against phenomenologically oriented scholars who are wary of methods that “explain away” religion and who seek<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/thom14778">The Death of Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: the need to teach the history of the discipline (and to preserve the memory or celebrate the cult of a certain number of great figures . . .) constitutes about the only thing that still justifies the existence of a good number of philosophy departments in French universities . . . [and] 
                     is what maintains the idea of philosophy as a distinct and autonomous discipline.¹<br>

  INTRODUCTION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/van-16618">Flight Ways</a><br>
  Abstract: How else could a book about birds and extinction begin, but with the tragicstory of the Dodo? In death, this bird from a small island in the western Indian Ocean has taken on a strange celebrity, becoming something of a “poster child” for extinction. And yet, many of the specific images and ideas about the Dodo that circulate in people’s imaginations are highly speculative. Ultimately, a great deal remains unclear about what kind of a bird the Dodo was, how it lived, and when it passed from the world. While reports, sketches, and paintings of the Dodo survive from<br>

  Three  URBAN PENGUINS: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/van-16618">Flight Ways</a><br>
  Abstract: There is something remarkable about a shoreline, a place where water meetsland and gives rise to a sense of productive confusion between two worlds. For most humans, one of these worlds—the place of earth, of firm land beneath our feet—is home. The other is a place for occasional visits, where we cannot really expect to live our lives, to survive for long periods of time. For penguins, this littoral zone must surely also mark a transition between two worlds, each with its own threats and possibilities. But while penguins are undoubtedly more comfortable, more agile, less vulnerable<br>

  Abstract: THE ITALIAN TITLE of a recent book of mine, translated into English as 
                  Belief,¹ was Credere di credere (believing that one believes). It was a difficult title to translate, though it contained the meaning I wanted to convey in the text. The expression “believing that one believes” sounds paradoxical in Italian, too: to believe means having faith, conviction, or certainty in something, but also to opine—that is, to think with a certain degree of uncertainty. To clarify the title, then, I would say that the first believing has the latter meaning, while the second use of the term has<br>

  Abstract: IT IS NOT too difficult to fill with meaning this title, whose intention stimulates curiosity and eventually provokes, because it evokes too many things often in conflict with each other. It is not so much a matter of filling the title with meaning as of emptying it, at least in part, by reducing it to a set of coherent and intelligible terms. The multiple meanings we immediately assign to this linked pair indicate at the very least that we take it as a natural, granted, and unquestionable fact, though we cannot spell out why this is the case, as always<br>

  Abstract: This may seem incredible, but if you work through Heidegger you can easily get to Marx. Heidegger’s forgetting of Being can be likened to Marx’s alienation and Lukács’s reification. In at least two ways: you can’t change anything by yourself, so to sort things out you have to make a revolution; and the forgetting of Being as Heidegger thinks it is what Marxism explains with the division of labor: you yourself don’t enjoy all the fruits of your labor, and a society is erected in which everything is commodified, including you as a worker.<br>

Your conceptual instruments are different—anthropological for Girard, philosophical for Vattimo—but you wind up saying more or less the same thing: that modernity, as constructed and understood by the European West, is substantially an invention of Christianity. Your research has led you to the apparently paradoxical result that Christianity is responsible for the secularization of the world. The end of the religions was brought about by a religion.

  Abstract: Responsibility is now a fashionable concept in political theory, philosophy, and critical theory, and,
                  ceteris paribus, that is a good reason not to write about it. Large bodies of work exist expounding its various connotations and meanings, ranging from questions of accountability and guilt to the need to respond to alterity. And yet there is something rather elusive about the political connotations of contemporary invocations of responsibility within the context of the turn to ethics in the humanities and social sciences, an elusiveness that at first glance seems largely due to hyperindividualized, abstract, and unhistorical thematizations of responsibility. Indeed, recent<br>

  3  AUTONOMY, ETHICS, INTRASUBJECTIVITY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/vazq17484">Political Responsibility</a><br>
  Abstract: One upshot of the contemporary ethical turn is the proliferation of solipsistic philosophical accounts of responsibility. If discussions of political and ethical responsibility historically emphasized social and intersubjective relations, the dominant philosophical formulations of responsibility privilege autonomy and
                  intrasubjectivity, even when abstract invocations ofintersubjectivity are adduced. Modalities of solipsism that engage in Platonic soul-crafting and dwell on the inner life of the subject, her mental reality, over consideration of the predicaments of power she inhabits, or how these are historically constituted, politically sanctioned, and socially reproduced situations that thoroughly mediate that subjectivity. But these modalities of solipsism suggest something<br>

  Abstract: If the problems inherited from the Kantian tradition, including the critique leveled by Nietzsche, contributed to
                  intrasubjective ideas of responsibility, it is Emmanuel Levinas’s work that has mediated the prevalence of the concept in efforts to overcome the “autonomous subject” and thus presumably formulateintersubjective theories of responsibility that give primacy to the Other. Indeed, Levinas is the sage in most transatlantic theorizations of ethical responsibility as “responsibility to the Other.” He is credited with formulating the overcoming “of the very horizon of egology,” an overcoming that paves the way to “re-conceptualize responsibility as a being ‘for the other,’” something<br>

  Author(s) Zacchetti Stefano<br>
  Abstract: All the various bodies of scriptures evoked by the name “Buddhist canon”—such as the Pali canon, the Tibetan canon, the Mongolian canon, and the Chinese canon, just to mention those surviving in a more or less complete form—are in fact very different things from the viewpoint of their internal structure and formative principles. They were shaped by different historical forces, in response to different cultural and political conditions. All these differences are partly masked by the use of unifying terms such as “canon,” “Tripitaka,” etc., to refer to these collections. If taken uncritically, all these designations are potentially<br>

  Abstract: Heidegger reformulated as an ontological question Hegel’s judgments on the end of art by asking: “Is art still an essential and necessary way in which that truth happens which is decisive for our historical existence, or is this something that art no longer is?”¹ In doing so, he was trying to overcome the emergency of aesthetics. This emergency does not lie in the “end of art” proclaimed by Hegel but rather in the reduction of art to representable objects to be felt, contemplated, and reproduced as we please. These objects are not simply forms corresponding to the world but also<br>

Such interest can lead to interesting musical encounters that give rise to new rhythmic expressions; it can tell us something, too, of distributional paths governed by global capitalism. However, just like the dominant trend in approaches to the study of the self, society, language, translation, and cultural phenomena thus far discussed, so here too we see an enduring presence of a philosophical idealism.

There are not, in fact, many examples of the parallelism between “doing the thing that we are commenting on” in the performance of, and commentary on, most other forms of human activities. Another such example is the closely related activity of talking; that is, we

It carries, on the one hand, a sinister meaning, for the eating of beauty denotes its frightening, mythic consumption, whether by cunning serpents, monstrous beasts, cannibals, or machines. It recalls the vicious abuse of food and drink and the concomitant destruction of health and humanity, emblematically represented in the gaping glutton and the drunkard sprawled on the sidewalk. Finally it evokes the devouring mouth of the grave, the sepulcher that swallows every beautiful person and thing (in Latin,

  Abstract: The historical origins of hermeneutics as a self-conscious discipline from the study of texts together with our typographical fixation on texts have occluded general awareness, even among scholars, that all use of language, not just textual use, is hermeneutic. This is the center point of this work. Hermeneutics, in the sense earlier described, the making clear to a given audience or milieu something in a manifestation that is not evident to this audience or milieu, was being practiced tens or even hundreds of thousands of years before writing was even thought of as a possibility.

  Abstract: Our text-centered mentality, and especially our print-centered mentality, can and does create special illusions about the nature of “facts” which affects concepts of interpretation or hermeneutics. By habituating us to visually fixed representations of spoken words texts can lead us to overvalue fixity itself. We tend to think of a “fact” as in some sense something fixed. Yet its fixity is paradoxical, for a fact can only be identified by the use of words. And words are not fixed, for they are events in time. Moreover, there is no one thing to say about anything—a fact which seems to<br>

  Abstract: A thesis of these reflections is that there are two encompassing and complementary movements significantly dominating the development of world culture today, digitization and hermeneutics—which is to say (as will be explained more fully throughout the work)—a fractioning movement and a holistic movement, and that these movements explain something of what has been going on in the development of human beings’ intellectual relationship and concomitant relationships to the world around them, chiefly in highly technologized societies but indirectly through all the world.<br>

  Abstract: Our text-centered mentality, and especially our print-centered mentality, can and does create special illusions about the nature of “facts” which affects concepts of interpretation or hermeneutics. By habituating us to visually fixed representations of spoken words texts can lead us to overvalue fixity itself. We tend to think of a “fact” as in some sense something fixed. Yet its fixity is paradoxical, for a fact can only be identified by the use of words. And words are not fixed, for they are events in time.

  Abstract: “It’s a remarkable [eigentümlicher] piece of apparatus,” reads the first prophetic sentence of Kafka’s 1914 story “In the Penal Colony” (161, 140).¹ It is the officer who speaks this first sentence to the explorer, and in a way, Willa and Edwin Muir’s mistranslation in the Schocken edition is “remarkable” in itself in that, though wrong, they got it just right. For

  Abstract: Concerned with preserving the dignity of humanity, the term “humanitarian” encompasses constraints, or things that individuals and governments must not do, and obligations, or things that they should do. International humanitarian law imposes limits on permissible behavior during war; human rights law sets the minimum standards to which individuals are entitled by virtue of their membership in humanity; and humanitarian action seeks to restore some of those rights when individuals are deprived of them by circumstance. Hence the “duty” to provide humanitarian assistance occurs only once the duty to avoid depriving and to protect from deprivation have failed to be<br>

  Abstract: I first started to understand the extent to which literacy activism is really a form of cultural work, not simply a matter of teaching people how to read and write, one evening in a seaside village. It turns out that many villagers were taught to desire literacy and they learned a number of other things about themselves and their place in the world along the way.

  Abstract: The text 
                     Contributions to Philosophy is one of Heidegger’s thought experiments.¹ One does not refute a thought experiment; one pursues it imaginatively and sees where it leads, without giving up one’s critical awareness. It would be inappropriate to treat Heidegger’s inquiry as nothing but a set of claims to be defended or attacked. Instead, we have to follow the paths it opens and decide as best we can which ones are promising, without assuming in advance that any are dead ends.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt7v6gk">Outlaw Rhetoric</a><br>
  Abstract: In considering the ancient art of rhetoric’s passion for classification, Roland Barthes observes, “
                  tell me how you classify and I’ll tell you who you are.” This gnomic promise suggests that we can discover a certain truth of identity in the taxonomic decisions made by different rhetorical cultures. Barthes clarifies this declaration by writing that “the taxonomic option implies an ideological one: there is always a stake in where things are placed,” and he later calls taxonomic variation the “place of place.”¹ I have been arguing that the “place” of vernacular rhetoric must be understood as England, and Barthes’ reflections on<br>

  Abstract: Violent crime in popular entertainment is first and foremost a question of storytelling. On the most basic level, violence demands more story than does sex. Consider, for example, the extreme cases in popular entertainment directed at roughly the same demographic (men): in pornography, storytelling is kept to a minimum, since anything that is not overtly sexual is simply a distraction, and thus sex scenes can be strung together with the flimsiest of narrative threads (“Is that the delivery boy?”). In stories of violence, there is no precise narrative equivalent to pornography, as graphic violence tends to be much more motivated<br>

  Abstract: Anyone who set out to write a history of the concept of truth, in a strictly terminological sense aimed at definitional stringency, would have little to show for his efforts. The most popular definition, purportedly lifted by Scholasticism from Isaac ben Salomon Israeli’s book of definitions—
                  veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus [truth is the match of thing and intellect]¹—provides leeway for modification only in the shortest of its elements, in the neutrality of the ‘et’. While the definition should be understood, in keeping with its Aristotelian origins, as leaning toward the adaequatio intellectus ad rem [match of the<br>

  Abstract: The Fontenelle text from which I have just quoted implies a distinction, germane to our typology of metaphor histories, which confronts us with a final ‘transitional’ phenomenon, that of 
                  metaphorics and symbolism. Here we must be wary of formulating all too subtle definitions, tailored to the specifications of some system or other, that risk narrowing the basis of fulfilling intuitions in advance. The concept of symbol, richly shaded by its application to everything from aesthetics to formal logic (at the very least!), has already done much to obscure the expressive phenomena it was called on to illuminate.

  Book Title: Artifice and Design-Art and Technology in Human Experience<br>

  Author(s): ALLEN BARRY<br>
  Abstract: The topics covered in
      Artifice and Designare wide-ranging and interdisciplinary, drawing from evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, and the history and anthropology of art and technology. The book concludes that it is a mistake to think of art as something subjective, or as an arbitrary social representation, and of Technology as an instrumental form of purposive rationality. "By segregating art and technology," Allen writes, "we divide ourselves against ourselves, casting up self-made obstacles to the ingenuity of art and technology."<br>

A giggling chain of Snow Whites and Cinderellas snaked out of Felix’s clothing store holding hands and ran (as fast as possible considering the crowds) up the sidewalk to the next store on the block. The sidewalks were swarming with children of all ages, including some teenagers. It was a scene of unmitigated collective glee.<br>

  Abstract: What did the existence of these three groups of people and their distinctive styles of community making mean for life in Viroqua? How permeable were these group boundaries? Could members of these groups get along well enough to get things done together if they needed to? In this chapter I examine how Viroquans’ tastes for different cultures of community played out in their interactions with one another. In general, these cultures of community did not hamper forming cross-group ties as individuals, but it sometimes made it hard for Viroquans to get things done together as groups.<br>

  Abstract: By 2009 many things had changed in Viroqua, though much was the same as well. The locally owned pharmacies closed after the arrival of a Walgreens. The Macasaet family transformed the Clark/Peterson building into an indoor “European style” market in which a number of local entrepreneurs opened new businesses. The Blue Diamond Café closed, and the building was reopened as a Mexican restaurant. Controversy was stirred by the proposal of an Illinois company to place a high-density dairy operation on sites relatively close to residences and smaller farms near Viroqua’s border with Westby.<br>

  Abstract: We saw in the previous chapter that according to historicism, the nature, essence, or identity of a thing lies in its history. The unprecedented intellectual revolution effected by historicism in the early decades of the nineteenth century endowed all of human existence with a temporal dimension, with irreversible ramifications for how we conceive of ourselves and of our world even today. Historicism rolled out all things in time, as one might roll out in space with a rolling pin a crust for the bottom of a pie. All things human were now perceived to be subject to a development in<br>

  Abstract: For two reasons the notion of “presence” now needs to be discussed.¹ First, the etymological meaning of the word “representation” already compels us to do so: representation is a making present of, or the granting of presence (again), to something that is absent. This is what our representative assemblies do: they make the people present because the people themselves cannot be present in such assemblies. A portrait may make present to the spectator somebody who has been dead for centuries. Similarly, the writing of history gives presence again to an absent past, and its very raison d’être is to do<br>

  Abstract: As far as I know, the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga (1872–1945) has until now been the only theorist of historical writing to take seriously the notion of historical experience.¹ This is not surprising, since there seems to be near-unanimous agreement that the experience of the past is of no use for a proper explanation of historical writing and of how it came into being. Or, to be more precise, all that the existing philosophy of history has on offer is a theory 
                  denying that there could be such a thing as an experience of the past at all. A<br>

  Abstract: Throughout this book my compass has been the claim put forward in chapter 3 that representation/aesthetics is prior to interpretation/hermeneutics and that it is better to investigate the writing of history from the perspective of representation than from that of interpretation. Interpretation is something one does with texts that already exist, and the phrase “interpreting 
                  the past ” can therefore never be more than a deconstructivist metaphor. So when the linguistic (or, rather, rhetorical) turn in contemporary philosophy of history put a premium on interpretation at the expense of representation, the result was what one might call an “etherealization” of<br>

Since no moderately alert person who notices bookstalls or the habits of persons around him could possibly believe that books have disappeared, the asking of the question becomes itself interesting. Something besides the facts is disturbing him. Television and the whole of electronics must be doing something, he feels. What is it that they are doing?<br>

  Book Title: A Companion to the Works of Johann Gottfried Herder-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Koepke Wulf<br>
  Abstract: Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) is one of the great names of the classical age of German literature. One of the last universalists, he wrote on aesthetics, literary history and theory, historiography, anthropology, psychology, education, and theology; translated and adapted poetry from ancient Greek, English, Italian, even from Persian and Arabic; collected folk songs from around the world; and pioneered a better understanding of non-European cultures. A student of Kant's, he became Goethe's mentor in Strasbourg, and was a mastermind of the Sturm und Drang and a luminary of classical Weimar. But the wide range of Herder's interests and writings, along with his unorthodox ways of seeing things, seems to have prevented him being fully appreciated for any of them. His image has also been clouded by association with political ideologies, the proponents of which ignored the message of Humanität in his texts. So although Herder is acknowledged by scholars to be one of the great thinkers of European Enlightenment, there is no up-to-date, comprehensive introduction to his works in English, a lacuna this book fills with seventeen new, specially commissioned essays.

  Author(s) Trabant Jürgen<br>
  Abstract: After Bacon’s discovery of the non-scientific semantics of natural language as
                  idola fori,“idols of the marketplace” and the most serious obstacle to true knowledge, and after Locke’s attempt to integrate language into a theory of human understanding in hisEssay Concerning Human Understanding(1690), and after his proposals for coming to terms with the epistemological problem of language (which is “a mist before our eyes”), language was on the agenda of the philosophy of the eighteenth century — at least of its empiricist current. Rationalist philosophy generally speaking has no problem with language, and, hence, nothing interesting to say about<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt14brrn7">A Companion to the Works of Johann Gottfried Herder</a><br>
  Author(s) Norton Robert E.<br>
  Abstract: To an extraordinary and perhaps even singular degree, Herder’s life and work are defined by the practice, function, and meaning of criticism. Despite the numerous other roles he occupied — and there were many: theologian, philosopher, linguist, historian, ethnographer, to name only a few — it was in his activity as a critic that Herder revealed his greatest strengths and arguably produced his most lasting achievements. Indeed, one might reasonably argue that Herder approached virtually everything he did
                  asa critic, that his thinking and expression as a whole are a reflection or product of a fundamentally critical habit of mind. It<br>

  Author(s) GUNN CATE<br>
  Abstract: We know nothing conclusive about Julian’s early life, but she indicates that she had been devout since her youth; if Julian’s childhood and youth had been spent in Norwich, how would the experiences of her early life have fed her devotional life and possibly informed her visions? Among the evidence that Norman tanner cites in support of his claim that Norwich may have been ‘Europe’s
                  most; religious city’¹ is the number of hermits and anchorites supported by the city in the high middle Ages. Pre-eminent among these anchorites is Julian herself, the ‘star attraction’² of the spiritual life of Norwich.<br>

  Author(s) JONES E. A.<br>
  Abstract: That we know next to nothing about our author has long been a truism of Julian studies. Serenus Cressy tells us that, for all his searching, he ‘could not discover any thing touching her, more than what she occasionally sprinkles in the Book it self’.² For Colledge and Walsh she is ‘an enigmatic figure’; for Grace Jantzen she is likewise ‘an enigma’; for Christopher Abbott she has ‘a certain “disappeared” quality’, and in their recent edition Watson and Jenkins are able to offer only ‘a fragmentary biography’.³ The fragments for such a biography are admittedly few, as McAvoy also points<br>

  Abstract: For the Romantics the canvas and the written page were sites of contestation, spaces on which ephemeral experience was said to be represented in the material world. Art, understood in these terms, became the middle point or stage upon which something absent and intangible was made to appear present and graspable. It was, in other words, a material invocation of a sphere unavailable to the senses. In the following chapter I attempt to reconstruct the model of aesthetic perception in the work of Wackenroder and Tieck in light of the epistemological and perceptual categories laid out by Lessing’s essay on<br>

  Book Title: Edinburgh German Yearbook 9-Archive and Memory in German Literature and Visual Culture<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Osborne Dora<br>
  Abstract: In recent years, the discourse of memory - and of German memory culture in particular - has become increasingly concerned with questions of the archive. An archive can refer to a physical place, the material found there, or the system that orders this material; in its broadest sense, it might refer to something public (records housed in a municipal building), or something private (photographs in a family album). The material and documentary qualities of the archive confer on it an authenticating function attributed only cautiously to memory, but theories of the archive have questioned the status of material, documentary vestiges of the past. Memory and the archive are inextricably linked, but how does this affect the mediation of the past? This volume explores the changing relationship between memory and the archive in German-language literature and culture since 1945. Contributions approach this topic from a range of perspectives (film, visual culture, urban culture, digital technology, as well as literature) and offer illuminating studies of Harun Farocki, Anselm Kiefer, Thomas Demand, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Jürgen Fuchs, Stefan Wolter, and Sasa Stanisic. Contributors: Priyanka Basu, Carol Anne Costabile-Heming, Regine Criser, Tobias Ebbrecht-Hartmann, Diana Hitzke and Charlton Payne, Caitríona Leahy, Dora Osborne, Annie Ring, Lizzie Stewart, Simon Ward.

  Author(s) Ward Simon<br>
  Abstract: Writing in 1982, the photographer and curator Janos Frecot claimed that “die Stunde Null in ihrer Offenheit scheint aktueller denn je” (the Zero Hour in its openness seems more urgently contemporary than ever).¹ If, given the manifold continuities in societal and political structures that followed the end of the war, particularly in West Germany, the caesura of the “Zero Hour” (or “Stunde Null”) is a myth rather than a historical fact, its value as the emblem of a missed opportunity was nevertheless something that was invoked, as here by Frecot, in attempting to imagine an alternative German society.

  Abstract: In the

It isthe general system of the formation and transformation of statements.”¹ Because statements emerge as meaningful discourse at a given time, their appearance is accompanied by the possibility that they might not appear. They thereby point to the ways in which language is an event, the possibility of something being said or not said, a matter of whether enunciations even take place<br>

  Abstract: This book is questioningly titled ‘Engaging Heritage, Engaging Communities’. Let us think about some of the everyday meanings of ‘engagement’ for a moment.¹ If a toilet is engaged, then it means someone is using it and you cannot; you must wait your turn. If you are engaged to be married, you cannot marry anyone else, and you wear a ring to show this exclusiveness to others. An engaged person is not open to others, or other romantic or sexual possibilities. To want

  Abstract: The parodic poetry written by Luis de Góngora and Lope de Vega at the end of their professional careers and in the winter of their years unquestionably brings forth something new, built from the bricks of ancient and contemporary poetic monuments. These poets utilise parody as a process that, paradoxically, ends and begins simultaneously in order to engage with the literary past, question its legacy, and redirect future poetics. Góngora’s mytho-parodic trajectory and comic culmination, and Lope’s final theatrical extravaganza as Tomé de Burguillos, reveal a wealth of common practices.

  Abstract: Franz Kafka once claimed that all human beings were caught between two competing technological systems: one sponsoring “ghostly” absence (the postal system, telegraph, and telephone) and one encouraging “natural” presence (trains, planes, and automobiles). To humanity’s woe, the ghostly side was winning: “To attain a natural intercourse, a tranquility of souls, [humanity] has invented the railway, the motor car, the aeroplane — but nothing helps anymore: These are evidently inventions devised at the moment of crashing” (

  Abstract: How strong the pull toward closure is, toward “something finally attained,” may be proved by the desire to somehow end on a decisive note, to weave all the bifurcating strands into some meaningful formula or design, a form fixed at least for the moment.

She was also saying something about the literature that was, according to her, most appropriate for the French national–political context of her day.

  Book Title: Becoming John Updike-Critical Reception, 1958-2010<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Mazzeno Laurence W.<br>
  Abstract: When John Updike died in 2009, tributes from the literary establishment were immediate and fulsome. However, no one reading reviews of Updike's work in the late 1960s would have predicted that kind of praise for a man who was known then as a brilliant stylist who had nothing to say. What changed? Why? And what is likely to be his legacy? These are the questions that "Becoming John Updike" pursues by examining the journalistic and academic response to his writings. Several things about Updike's career make a reception study appropriate. First, he was prolific: he began publishing fiction and essays in 1956, published his first book in 1958, and from then on, brought out at least one new book each year. Second, his books were reviewed widely - usually in major American newspapers and magazines, and often in foreign ones as well. Third, Updike quickly became a darling of academics; the first book about his work was published in 1967, less than a decade after his own first book. More than three dozen books and hundreds of articles of academic criticism have been devoted to Updike. The present volume will appeal to the continuing interest in Updike's writing among academics and general readers alike. Laurence W. Mazzeno is President Emeritus of Alvernia University. Among other books, he has written volumes on Austen, Dickens, Tennyson, and Matthew Arnold for Camden House's Literary Criticism in Perspective series.<br>

  Abstract: The 1190 events in York make a powerfully moving tale, especially when recounted by thoughtful and articulate Yorkshiremen like William of Newburgh and Barrie Dobson. Nothing remotely comparable in savagery had previously occurred in this first century of the medieval English Jewry.¹ Every historian experiences a kind of pull to see this as a watershed moment in the limited presence of Jews in England. It has seemed to cry out to be fitted into the once familiar opposition between the ʹopenʹ twelfth century and the ʹclosedʹ thirteenth.² The contrast between the relatively accommodating regimes before 1200 and the harsher atmosphere<br>

  Abstract: The worst ʹEgyptian dayʹ suffered by the Jews of twelfth-century England was undoubtedly the massacre at York in 1190 – an event that stunned contemporary onlookers, Jews and Christians alike.² Of contemporary chroniclers who discuss the violence at York, William of Newburgh provides the most elaborated detail. He identifies the Egyptian day of Richardʹs coronation as something new for the Jews: events, he writes, were ʹsuddenly changed against themʹ.

  Abstract: The events surrounding the violent death of the Jews of York in March 1190 continue to exert a strong fascination: accounts of these events demand a radical and troubling act of empathy and imagination. How could something so horrible, so bloody, and so resonant in its foreshadowing of future horrors, happen 
                  in this place, at this sturdy bailey under grey northern skies? The setting is at once familiar, a corner of a beautiful small city, and obscene: a Yorkshire Masada, a place where a lethal combination of lucre, zeal and vengeance made a perfect deadly storm.

  Author(s) Donovan Siobhán<br>
  Abstract: Reading Hanslick’s autobiography 
                  Aus meinem Leben (1894), one could be forgiven for thinking that both a public discourse on gender and the women’s movement were completely absent in Vienna during the latter part of the nineteenth century;¹ for nowhere does Hanslick refer to this socially and politically rousing topic.² Events such as the Prater massacre in August 1848, which witnessed the brutal suppression of a protest by female workers against a 25 percent pay cut, go completely unmentioned. Had this been pointed out to Hanslick, presumably he would have retorted that his job as music critic had nothing to do<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt2tt1n8">The Civil Wars after 1660</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the most important consequences of the public furore occasioned by revelations of a ‘popish plot’ to assassinate Charles II in 1678, the dissolution of the ‘long’ Cavalier Parliament in January 1679, the subsequent lapse of licensing the press, and a crisis over the succession that pitted some members of Parliament against the Court and its allies, was the explosive growth of popular printed literature.¹ A great many texts invoked the national past as part of their arguments for, among other things, the undesirability of a Roman Catholic successor, the importance of Parliament as a bulwark against Stuart pretensions<br>

  Abstract: Francisco de Quevedo’s remarkable love poetry has finally begun to speak to us on its own terms: as poetry. For too long its voice struggled to be heard under the considerable weight of alternative critical displacement activity; that is, engagement with the still unresolved issues of chronology, dating, and corpus definition that are inevitably dominant when a poet does not publish his work in his own lifetime. However, there are some things that we do know for certain: the first posthumous edition of Quevedo’s poetry was compiled and edited by his friend, José Antonio González de Salas, in 1648, under<br>

  Abstract: Johan Huizinga was right: play is central to life. In his seminal and much-praised 
                  Homo Ludens, first published in 1938, Huizinga argued that play had an essential role in the development of civilization. To understand humanity in any rounded sense, it had to be taken into account. And of course, one key latter-day manifestation of play was the rise of organized sports from the nineteenth century on.¹ It is thus surprising that until relatively recently mass sport was not thought an appropriate topic of research for serious social scientists.

  Abstract: Anthropologists of art have a problem: how to define the central term of their sub-discipline? Their quandary is how to compare something across cultures without the particular definition chosen predetermining the answers arrived at. If they choose too restrictive a definition they exclude a host of potential objects of study and end up producing generalizations which are neither novel nor representative of human endeavour. If they choose a very open definition they run the risk of including such a broad range of different types of objects that meaningful comparison is turned into a near impossible ideal.

  Abstract: Suffering and death are universal. They are the basal experience that tragic art addresses. But is tragic art in one form or another also universal? Are there times and places on which tragic thinking can have no purchase? If so, is our anti-mythic age of science and reason, of democracy and rapid technological progress an era unsuited to tragic art? The modern world is largely optimistic despite the massively destructive violence of the last century. Terrible things still happen to individuals, to families, to whole peoples. Yet when no wrong seems fully beyond prevention—an unforeseen possibility that with due<br>

Goethe’s (and Mephisto’s) power over language is anything but “schwach.” Linguistic dexterity may seem to presuppose no ideology or epistemology. Fun is fun.

Duncan discusses, among other things, contemporary late eighteenth-century reactions to Werther, biographical, religious, psychological, and political approaches to Goethe’s novel, as well as interpretations of Werther that focus on reading, writing, gender, and/or sexuality.

  Book Title: A Companion to Friedrich Nietzsche-Life and Works<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Bishop Paul<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche looms over modern literature and thought; according to Gottfried Benn, "everything my generation discussed, thought through innerly; one could say: suffered; or one could even say: took to the point of exhaustion - all of it had already been said . . . by Nietzsche; all the rest was just exegesis." Nietzsche's influence on intellectual life today is arguably as great; witness the various societies, journals, and websites and the steady stream of papers, collections, and monographs. This ‘Companion’ offers new essays from the best Nietzsche scholars, emphasizing the interrelatedness of his life and thought, eschewing a superficial biographical method but taking seriously his claim that great philosophy is “the self-confession of its author and a kind of unintended and unremarked ‘memoir’.” Each essay examines a major work by Nietzsche; together, they offer an advanced introduction for students of German Studies, philosophy, and comparative literature as well as for the lay reader. Re-establishing the links between Nietzsche's philosophical texts and their biographical background, the volume alerts Nietzsche scholars and intellectual historians to the internal development of his thought and the aesthetic construction of his identity as a philosopher.

How Nietzsche chose his path through life, abandoning the zig-zag of his academic, Wagnerian, decadent path for the straight line of his philosophy, which says “yes” (and hence also says “no”: by affirming one thing, it also “renounces” another), and how he did so in an exemplary fashion, is<br>

  Abstract: Biographies and museums both lie in a grey area of knowledge and affect; they tell us about what happened, but also form emotionally compelling and satisfying narratives. They mediate the academic and the popular, spanning the physical and imaginary worlds. They are linked by an ability to tell us about ourselves and our world as moving through time, but also serve to immortalise, to freeze in time. Above all, when museums and biographies come together or overlap, what we get is relationships: between people, between people and things, and between people and buildings. Moreover, museums and biographies together highlight questions<br>

In providing proof of the thesis that the main representatives of sociological thought in Europe converged on a solution for this problem, Parsons (1937/1968) did two things. First, he built upon the classical phase of sociological theory to bring it to a remarkable completion, and second, he established the foundation for the dominance of a normatively oriented functionalism in American<br>

  Abstract: If there is anything like a great tradition in social theory, it must be the multigenerational effort to come to terms with what has been called “modernity.” For well over a century prior to World War I, members of the lineage of classical social theorists posited some inexorable direction of modernization that sooner or later would encompass the human world. Their formulas ranged from Comte’s law of ineluctable stages to Alexis de Tocqueville’s irresistible trend toward social equality to Karl Marx’s dictum of de te fabula narratur to Herbert Spencer’s law of evolution to Max Weber’s thesis of world-historical rationalization.<br>

  Abstract: The German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once said that all the clever ideas have already been had; it is only a matter of thinking them again. There is hardly any other intellectual field that would provide more evidence for Goethe’s dictum than sociology and the history of ideas associated with our discipline. In this sense, the following considerations do not claim to present something really new. Following Goethe’s invitation, they are directed toward a reconstruction. It will be a matter of calling to mind an important intellectual tradition that nevertheless became largely submerged in the collective memory—as we<br>

  Author(s) COLLINS RANDALL<br>
  Abstract: Robert Bierstedt, in his lucidly written
                     American Sociological Theory(1981), comments that Durkheim, Weber, and Marx were known by American sociologists before 1940 but not especially adulated. They were just three names among many who made up the history of the field, and not among the most important or interesting. We see the same thing in Pitirirn Sorokin’sContemporary Sociological Theories,published in 1928. Here Durkheim, Marx, and Weber get a few pages, but relatively superficial ones, and far less space than that devoted to Le Play, Pareto, or Otto Ammon.<br>

  Author(s) STINCHCOMBE ARTHUR L.<br>
  Abstract: My general argument is that the development of sociology as a discipline led us systematically away from the study of humans acting in society. The higher the prestige of a piece of sociological work, the fewer people in it are sweaty, laughing, ugly or pretty, dull at parties, or have warts on their noses. Field work is the lowest status in methodology, because surprising humans keep popping out and bewildering us by doing things we do not understand; much better to have people answering closedended questions so that they fall neatly into cross-classifications to be analyzed by loglinear methods. Similarly,<br>

  Abstract: Harrison White:In describing the fierce competition of the new German university system, Ben-David spoke of the fact that one of the things going for the experimentalists was, after all, that they were doing lab work, and he seemed to take it for granted that lab work was more communicable. I found that a fascinating puzzle because in my own experience, lab work is one of the least communicable things in the world. It is not at all easy to replicate experimental work or lab work. I would argue that the advantage of experimentalists is a paradox. You have to<br>

  Abstract: The behavior of most individuals is, of course, influenced to some degree by the social groups to which they belong. The information and beliefs to which children are exposed obviously vary from one social group to another. Since it usually costs something to acquire new information, the theory of my discipline of economics leads one to predict that the behavior of individuals will sometimes be influenced by the beliefs and perceptions they inevitably absorb in the social groups in which they happen to have been raised. For the sociologist such a prediction must be utterly banal, for the influence of<br>

  Author(s) Heller Agnes<br>
  Abstract: One of the fundamental hopes of the silent opposition against communist regimes in Eastern Europe had always been the coming about of a synchronized effort toward reform. in 1968 things did not fare better than usual. Within a bloc of seemingly stable communist system, one could hardly anticipate a transnational, common voice that would challenge their legitimacy. In 1968 things did not fare better than usual. In Romania, the nationalist dictatorship of Ceauşescu seemed to be solidified. In Poland, a chauvinist, populist, and anti-Semitic wave gained momentum, in the aftermath of which almost all the leading intellectuals of Poland chose<br>

  Abstract: There are moments in history that indelibly mark the memories of their contemporaries. The balcony scene on August 21, 1968, when Nicolae Ceauşescu, general secretary of the RCP, addressed a crowd of over 100,000 from the Central Committee building in one of Bucharest’s main squares and vehemently condemned the invasion of Czechoslovakia a few hours after the Warsaw Pact intervention, a scene that became a national-communist legend, was eulogized by many as a gesture of heroic proportions: the Romanian david valiantly defying the Soviet Goliath. it was in fact nothing but a skillful masquerade, but it worked: a power-obsessed neo-Stalinist<br>

  Abstract: When all was said and done, there were two lingering problems that at times were posed directly, at other times were present only obliquely. One was the archeologists’ question why all the noise when nothing could be proven categorically. For them, once it was clear that a definitive conclusion could not be accepted or imposed about the remains of Skeleton No. 95, this made the whole discussion immaterial and a waste of time. After all, science deals only with proven theses. In a charitable version, this question can explain part of the implicit passivity of some among the archeologists. In<br>

  Abstract: In what follows, I will review the concepts of “objectivity” and “truth” in Bulgarian historical scholarship on the basis of my historiographical research and observations. As will be seen, there is a great difference between theoretical-methodological statements and historiographical practice. However, my purpose is not to blame the presumably “objective” historiography for “lack of objectivity” (especially since I do not believe in this ideal), but to see how things stand on particular issues of the “objectivity and truth” complex. Hence the account is somewhat fragmented. The question will also be posed: why were there, until recently, no relativizations of the<br>

  Abstract: About 60 km from Bulgaria’s capital, Sofia, lies a small town which currently represents the primary case of what can be described as a “museum of Socialism in the country.” The town has nothing that can be compared to Budapest’s Statue Park, nor is it a place where the heritage of the socialist period is put on display, decontextualized and recontextualized in a post-socialist mode. It would be wrong to suggest that the town was once the location of a labor camp or a prison for the socialist regime’s opponents. The town is not, or at least not directly, related<br>

  Abstract: It was a cold Monday in early December 2006. On the way to work I passed a tram stop. A black and white poster with heavy red lettering “Thou Shalt not Kill” hung on the wall of a tram shelter. It hung between two colorful posters, one with a girl saying “I am looking for a mummy and a daddy”—part of a social campaign for adoption—and another “Apocalypto by Mel Gibson”—a movie advertisement. My first idea was that the black and white poster must relate to the fairly controversial antiabortion debate. Yet, a closer inspection explained everything:<br>

  Book Title: Hybrid Renaissance-Culture, Language, Architecture<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burke Peter<br>
  Abstract: Hybrid Renaissance presents the Renaissance in Italy, elsewhere in Europe and in the world beyond Europe as an example of cultural hybridization. It is impossible to give a clear definition of either of the two key concepts used in this book, “hybridization" and “Renaissance". Roughly speaking, hybridity refers to something new that emerges from the combination of diverse older elements. The term “hybridization" is preferable to “hybridity" because it refers to a process rather than to a state, and also because it encourages the writer and the readers alike to think in terms of more or less rather than of presence versus absence. The book begins with a discussion of the concept of cultural hybridity and a cluster of other concepts related to it. Then comes a geography of hybridity, focusing on three locales: courts, major cities (whether ports or capitals) and frontiers. There follow six chapters about the hybrid Renaissance in different fields: architecture, painting and sculpture, languages, literatures, music, philosophy and law and finally religion. The essay concludes with a brief account of attempts to resist hybridization or to purify cultures or domains from what was already hybridized<br>

Journal Title: Ethics<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: et.2001.112.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 2001<br>
Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Abstract: In the course of the book, no real convergence is achieved; each one ends where he started, asserting his own beliefs, visions, and concerns. Has anything been gained in the process? The intense and occasionally pointed dialogues bring forth an incremental, but substantial clarification of the issues at hand, the issues at stake, and their potential (but not actual) interaction. The fact of the matter is that neuroscience has no privileged bearing on human affairs simply because it deals with the brain. Why push it to realms in which it does not belong?<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: Theories are always, in some way, about their theorists. While Luhmann’s variant of mutant functionalism is not palatable to American tastes, his theories are as reflective of late‐20th‐century European sensibilities as Parsons’s were of mid‐20th‐century America or Bellah and Geertz’s of the upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, some art critics have warmed to Luhmann’s book as an exemplar of one of the newer “cool” theories of art; that is, those that challenge more subject‐centered and humanist theories and aim to accommodate the growth of new mediums such as digital art and cyberspace. But in any conception of art that includes culture, the medium is only as good as the meaning it conveys. And it is the meaning of art that is sorely lacking in Luhmann’s appraisal. Paul Ricoeur once wrote that “materialism is the truth of a world without truth.” It might then be said of Luhmann’s conception of the art system that it is the truth of art without meaning.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”
            Theological Studies47 (1986): 44–45.<br>

Abstract: Scholars and their students interested in the field would do well to begin with these studies, despite some unevenness in period, place, and theme. Developments in the twentieth century, for example, are not well served, especially as their globalization bursts all traditional boundaries in the discipline, making a historical perspective essential to an understanding of ongoing transformations in literate life everywhere, not just in the West. Similarly, the absence of illustrations undermines the potential value of these books as introductions to the history of reading. Much of the work here depends on the material objects that readers actually had; without images of them, the reader develops less of a sense of the field. Finally, the exclusion of the essays on correspondence from the original collection is deeply regrettable; Chartier’s summary of their implications in the introduction hardly does justice to them, especially to the important study of the 1847 postal survey by Dauphin and two other colleagues. The translations are generally accurate, but the indexes are barely adequate.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since his 1962
   Introduction to Husserl’s “The Origin of Geometry.”The real difference between the thought of Ricoeur and Derrida is the distinctive way each thinker supplements phenomenology to take into account the creativity of meaning at the boundary of reason. For Derrida, it is thedifféranceof deconstruction; for Ricoeur, the graft of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: Hence, our choice of philosophies should not be limited to the two main philosophies identified by Budd but rather could take up ideas from process thinking, which is a quieter but nevertheless relevant philosophy to which LIS should attend. By valuing the processes and articulating this with better abstractions more congruent with our action, we not only further our own project; we also sustain a vital engagement with the projects of individuals. We more clearly articulate the library in the life of the user, to use the words of Wiegand [
      2].<br>

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Abstract: Professional self‐awareness is widely considered a necessary condition for competent social work practice. Alternate prescriptions for self‐awareness rely implicitly on varying definitions of what it means to be a “self” and what it means to be “aware.” I will review three approaches to professional self‐awareness conventionally adopted in the literature: (
         a) simple conscious awareness (awareness of whatever is being experienced), (b) reflective awareness (awareness of a self who is experiencing something), and (c) reflexive awareness (the self's awareness of how his or her awareness is constituted in direct experience). Strengths and limitations of these three epistemological approaches are discussed. An alternate framework, based on Anthony Giddens's “structuration theory,” is developed and advanced as a more macro‐level and less exclusively psychological understanding of practitioner self‐awareness. The article concludes with illustrations from practice.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

ROSEMARY MITCHELL University of Leeds J. G. A. POCocK. [[END 06A00070]] [[START 06A00080]] Barbarism and Religion: Volume Three, The First Decline and Fall. New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the last hundred pages of Pocock's volume and therefore serves as both a climax to the Pocockian story so far, and a bridge to the next volume. Volume one of Barbarism and Religion situated Gibbon intellectually within a number of different European "Enlightenments"; volume two located him on a different axis, among the various writers of "narratives of civil government" in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. (We are still missing the parallel vector running through ecclesiastical histori- ography, although Eusebius, Augustine, Orosius, and Otto of Freising figure prominently here. Christianity only begins to signal its importance with chapter fifteen of Gibbon; where he used ecclesiastical author- ities, up to that point, it was to document civil rather than sacred history.) Volume three moves in a third, diachronic dimension, tracing the transformations of key themes, in particular the idea of "decline and fall" itself, from very ancient origins up to the Scot Adam Ferguson's Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic (which appeared seven years after Gibbon's first volume and is thus offered for comparison rather than direct influence). The flight of concepts and motifs is dizzying, the lengthy quotations apposite, and as with the previous volumes, one can scarcely miss a sentence without losing a nuance or a parenthetical qualification. The theme of decline and fall, which informs the conception and beginning of Gibbon's book, would eventually yield to "barbarism and reli- gion" as its principal causes in later volumes (along with over-taxation, which Gibbon mentions at the close of chapter fourteen). But behind that idea, which only gradually emerged from Polybian political cycles via medieval notions of the translatio imperii, lay much else, including sequential recognitions of crucial turn- ing points in Roman history going back to Gracchan land reforms in the late second century B.C.E. The core problem, historiographically, remains how to explain why Gibbon, committed from an early stage to a Tacitean narrative, chose to begin his account not with the Julio-Claudians but instead at the "Antonine moment" of imperial zenith achieved by Trajan. (As he once did with cinquecento Florence, Pocock inclines to define major turning points or episodes, both historical and intellectual, in terms of "moments"-a historical Constantinean and historiographical Zosiman moment lie ahead, and the Machiavellian version even puts in a cameo appearance when this volume reaches the early eighteenth century.) Gibbon knew intimately the char- acter of Augustan rule and the flaws of the late republic; he had read his Sallust as well as Tacitus. The later imperial historians, especially Appian of Alexan- dria and Ammianus Marcellinus, also figure in this account as historians of decline, but of a decline that takes a great deal of time-all the way to the "Illyrian" recovery of the late third century-really to become unmistakeable. The subjects confronted by Gibbon's nearly two millennia of predecessors include the military problem of restless troops settling in an empire that has con- quered all its rivals and closed itself off from further expansion; the civic conflict between virtue and cor- ruption (or rather, the way in which virtue leads to military conquest and empire, which in turn produce an oriental softness); the role of the soldiers in making emperors and especially the legions' realization, in the Year of Four Emperors (68/69 C.E.), that emperors could be made "elsewhere than Rome"; the place of the Augustinian-Orosian "two cities" view of history; the vicissitudes in republicanism (an issue revived in the fifteenth century by Leonardi Bruni, who as a non-Roman concerned mainly with Florence was able to see the empire's longue duree for the first time as declinatio rather than translatio and to initiate, though not complete, a gradual transition in historiography from the latter to the former); and the extension of citizenship to the provinces, along, soon, with the capacity of provincials to be proclaimed emperor. All of these streams converge, not entirely satisfactorily AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 470 APRIL 2004 [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors.

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary.

The academic career of one Galway student, H. Fitzwalter Kirker, is traced in its entirety, but only in a footnote. The reader gets at least something approximating a lifeline in the piece by McBride on the young reader and the teaching and learning of Irish history. That "young people are by nature curious" (p. 114), however, seems an inade- quate point on which to hang a conclusion. The book is at its strongest in the essays by Jose Lanters and Gregory Castle, which focus on the work of T. W. Rolleston and Standish O'Grady, respectively. Both historians are examined in the context of their contemporaries; both essays actually attempt to fulfill the claims they make for themselves in their opening pages. The same cannot be said, however, for Eileen Reilly's piece on J. A. Froude. Its bland rehearsal of his life is punctuated with references to his visits to Ireland and quotations from some of his more offen- sive diatribes on the Irish people. She offers little or no comment on the bigotry that billowed forth from his pen. For example, one is told of Froude's dislike for Daniel O'Connell but not the reason why. Novick's piece on the military education of the Irish Volunteers begins with an interesting description, but it is rather disappointing thereafter. Although the material is fascinating, the author's conclusions are not. At one point, he deduces that "The pattern of military education seen in the Irish Volunteer and the Workers' Republic lends weight to the idea of the Rising as blood sacrifice, since the key strategist, Joseph Plunkett, never wrote military columns for the Irish Volunteer" (p. 198). At no point does it occur to Novick that the rebels might not have printed their plans in the paper because letting the authorities in Dublin Castle know in advance was not really part of the plan. How useful, indeed, is an examination of the Irish Volunteer's role in the training of the rebels when even the author concedes that details of training on urban insurrection were "left to the writers of the Workers' Republic" (p. 210); when the author gives approximately nine lines of consideration to what he adjudges to be the more important source? Through- out there is little sense of the eye of Dublin Castle watching over what was published and curtailing what could be written. This is a worthy but a frustrating book. There is a lot of value in each essay in terms of the material that is brought to light, but there is also the crushing weight of the artificial framework under which the essays are forced to labor. Like Froude, it is perhaps this book's "portion in life to please no one faction" (p. 140). ANNE DOLAN Trinity College Dublin [[END 06A00090]] [[START 06A00100]] COLIN NEWBURY. Patrons, Clients, and Empire: Chief- taincy and Over-Rule in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. New York: Oxford University Press. 2003. Pp. xii, 328. $72.00. It is a brave historian nowadays who admits that his or her current academic preoccupations began in the 1950s, but an unrepentant Colin Newbury tells us that imperial history at Oxford University is peculiarly marked by continuity. He says that literary theory has dominated the study of discourse for too long (al- though presumably not at Oxford), and it is time to get back to the study of political discourse using the time-honored model of patron-client relations. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of African and Pacific imperial history, with the addition of material on South and Southeast Asia, Newbury presents a well researched and cogently argued case for the persis- tence of precolonial clientage networks in certain British and French colonies. Patron-client modeling was refined by social scientists in the 1960s and 1970s, when it became a useful way of explaining why inde- pendence had brought relatively little change to the administrative systems of former colonies. That polit- ical and economic relations in some colonies can be analyzed effectively using this theory is clear; whether the exercise speaks to wider debates about empire is another question. The omission of colonies of settle- ment, along with almost all of the Portuguese, Dutch, and German empires, weakens the case considerably. Newbury draws on a wide, although extremely selec- tive, range of secondary literature to supplement his own research, wisely conceding that authors may not like the use he makes of their material. He feels no need to address the epistemological and methodolog- ical concerns raised by authors whose work he mines for empirical detail. He excludes pioneering cross- disciplinary studies, such as Jean and John Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution (1991) and Nicholas Thomas, Colonialism's Culture: Anthropology, Travel and Government (1994), which have done so much to shape current debates in postcolonial anthropology. Newbury calls for more interaction between social scientists and historians, but he does surprisingly little to encourage it. If patron-client brokerage really is the best model, Newbury should be able to tackle other theories with confidence, demonstrating their inade- quacies through constructive engagement. Instead he revives battles won long ago, such as the critique of "collaboration" and "indirect rule" analysis. There are still some historians who work with these terms, but far more interesting is the much larger number of scholars tackling more recent debates. This book's contribution to imperial historiography is therefore difficult to assess. Newbury hopes that it will help to determine whether imperial rule suc- ceeded or failed "in 'preparing' [its colonies] for the exigencies and responsibilities of devolved govern- ment" (p. viii). One wonders whether this is still a pressing question, however. It has been a long time since independence for many of the countries Newbury discusses. Scholars posing broader questions about colonialism's legacy will wonder about the cost of Newbury's ruthlessly exclusive approach.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] I wish to thank the editors of the AHR, first, for inviting me to consider the issues in this essay, second, for the helpful comments of Acting Editor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, and, third, for the quite stimulating commentary of several anonymous reviewers. 1 See Eric Foner, ed., The New American History (Philadelphia, 1990); Foner, ed., The New American History, rev. and expanded edn.

Beard.4 But during the 1970s, the claims being made for a national mind or culture were challenged by social historians. Intellectual history was chastened and transformed by the confrontation with social history. Eschewing their former embrace of synthesis, intellectual historians pulled back to study more precisely defined themes and thinkers.5 Not only intellectual history but other subfields accommodated social history's provocation to rethink conventional gen- eralizations. In addition, a professional, even "social-scientific," concern for precision and specificity of reference collaborated-sometimes with forethought, often not-with a sharpened awareness of difference and conflict that came from social movements outside the academy to undermine older composite narratives. Neither the frame supplied by Charles and Mary Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927), with its dramatic narrative of conflict between the "people" and the "interests," nor the consensual pluralism that succeeded that interpretation in the 1950s survived.6 If the consensus historians underplayed conflict, the Beards' approach, for all of its sympathy for the dispossessed, was found to be inadequate as well. Their narrative revealed little feel for the diversity of Americans, and it paid scant attention to non-whites. Most important of all, while their narrative voice was sympathetic, one did not discover the quotidian life or hear the voices of those groups that have found voice in more recent historiography. Judged by newer historiographical expectations, The Rise of American Civilization seemed "thin," compared with the increasingly popular "thick" description that was built, in part, on the enormously influential anthropological work of Clifford Geertz.7 In the past quarter century, there has been a proliferation of exciting new research, much of it bringing previously overlooked or explicitly excluded groups and events into the light of history. The number and variety of American stories multiplied. Suddenly, there were histories where there had been none or where the available histories had not been attended to by professional historians: histories of African Americans in the era of slavery and beyond; of Native Americans; of workers at home in their communities, at work, and at play; of women at home and outside of the home and of gender relations more generally; of consumption as well as production; of ethnic minorities and "borderlands"; of popular culture and other "marginal" forms of cultural production; of objects and material culture; of whites and whiteness as historical subjects; of non-state international and intercultural relations; and much more. [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 4Frederick Jackson Turner never completed a major synthesis, but one can see how he might have done that work in his posthumously published The United States, 1830-1850 (New York, 1935); Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (1927; 2 volumes in 1, New York, 1930).. In fact, the Beards participated in this shift with the publication of The American Spirit: A Study of the Idea of Civilization in the United States (New York, 1942). 5 For an early anticipation of this development-from the point of view of intellectual history-see Lawrence Veysey, "Intellectual History and the New Social History," in Paul K. Conkin and John Higham, eds., New Directions in American Intellectual History (Baltimore, Md., 1979), 3-26. See also, in the same volume, David A.

These developments were occurring at a moment when the number of American historians was expanding to an unprecedented degree. Disciplinary expansion both allowed and prompted increased specialization. And that worried some, who began to speak of hyperspecialization and fragmentation. The structure of specialization derived in large part from the impact of a social history that often fused the group-based particularity of focus with ideological commitments to class and identity-based social movements. This pattern of work discouraged the integration of particular histories into some kind of synthesis.8 Traditionalists, perhaps not surprisingly, were unnerved by these develop- ments.9 But even some proponents of the newer history worried. Early on, Herbert G. Gutman, one of the leading figures in the movement to write a history that included all Americans and that recognized differences-class, ethnic, racial, gender-was concerned that instead of enriching and enlarging the usable history of the United States, the new scholarship was failing to do that, perhaps making it in fact less usable. The "new social history," he wrote in the introduction to his collection of pioneering essays in the field, "suffers from a very limiting overspe- cialization." Take an Irish-born Catholic female textile worker and union organizer in Fall River involved in a disorderly strike in 1875. She might be the subject of nearly a dozen sub-specializations, which would, he feared, "wash out the wholeness that is essential to understanding human behavior."10 Later, in the wake of a national meeting of writers at which historians and history seemed to be largely ignored in discussions of the political and cultural situation in the aftermath of Richard Nixon, Gutman mused aloud in the pages of The Nation over whether the failure of historians to incorporate social history's findings into a new synthesis had seriously diminished, even evacuated, history's possible contribution to public debate."1 In the mid-1980s, in what turned out to be a controversial pair of articles, I raised a related question: how might one construct the (to my mind) needed synthesis of recent historiography on the United States.12 There was considerable negative reaction to those articles, coming from two different positions.

These arguments were equated with a carelessness about scholarly rigor.13 The other, and more widespread position, focused on the risks of a national narrative itself. It was evidently feared that such a narrative would, by definition, re-exclude those groups and themes that had so recently been brought under the umbrella of history and would re-inscribe a "master narrative" dominated by white, elite males.14 By the end of the 1980s, however, the question of synthesis had become less controversial. The issue became more practical, more professional in some sense: how to do it and how to do it within the parameters of inclusion that had been central to the discussion from the beginning. It was on this note that Alice Kessler-Harris, the author of the chapter on social history in The New American History (1990 edition), addressed the question. In the last section of her essay, with the section title of "The Problem of Synthesis," she acknowledged the problem and explored various possible ways to overcome "fragmentation" and move toward synthesis.15 A different issue emerged in the 1990s. Poststructuralist literary and cultural theory, sometimes broadly and even more vaguely characterized as postmodernism, was and is suspicious of any aspiration toward a comprehensive narrative. It is to this body of theory that we owe the commonplace use and misuse of the epithet "master narrative."16 These theories have been rather slow to penetrate workaday historical practice among American historians. Levels and types of awareness of them vary: from shocked indignation at the whole idea, to vague awareness and thoughtless dismissal, to intellectual fascination largely in isolation from the making of one's own histories. In his recent book, Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (1995), Robert Berkhofer seeks to force more attention to these issues. Insistently, but not always consistently, he urges historians to recognize the dimensions of the postmodern crisis that surrounds them. He seems more interested in sounding the alarm about the quicksand before us than in guiding us [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 13 Eric H.

But either way, he intends to challenge the very possibility of narrative synthesis.17 While these worries, proposals, and polemics were being fashioned, the daily work of historians proceeded. Among the products of that work have been a good number of explicitly synthetic volumes. There is, of course, no clear or settled notion of what defines a work of synthesis. I have used a rather generous definition. Some of the books I am calling synthetic might alternatively be designated as monographs-archivally based but exceptionally ambitious books that tackle big questions and seek to frame a large field or to provide an interpretation for an audience well beyond specialists. Others are more obviously synthetic, relying heavily on secondary literature to establish the state of the art in a broad field for a wide audience, including, often, students and the general public. With this diversity of form, purpose, and audience in mind-as well as a concern for a reasonable distribution of fields and periods-I have, with the help of the editors of the American Historical Review, selected a few recent synthetic works for examina- tion.18 The very existence of these books mutes the question of whether we need synthetic works or whether, under the constraints of present historiographical practice, synthesis is possible. In fact, the seeming proliferation of syntheses at present-and their variousness-suggests that the field of American history is at a formative (or reformative) moment that invites synthesis: the quest for new understandings that has undermined established narratives has now, perhaps, prompted new efforts at crystallizing a very unstable body of historical writing into new syntheses. A different question, however, provides the focus of this essay. What strategies for narrative synthesis are available to historians today? How might we think about the relation between a particular structure of narrative synthesis and the author's purpose or interpretation? How do these different strategies relate to current historiography? What particular work do they do, within the profession and beyond it? And finally I want to ask some questions about the firmness of the boundaries (mostly geographical) that define what is and is not captured in synthetic narratives of U.S. history. These works do not, of course, cover the whole field of synthetic works. More and other books could have been chosen, but these eleven books (and several others mentioned along the way) at least represent different kinds of history, different [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 17 Robert F.

Hine and John Mack Faragher (TheAmerican West). In fact, I have recommended each to non-historians asking for a literate one-volume history of the United States.

Together, the eleven total nearly 6,000 pages of outstanding historical writing. If nothing else, I can conclude that synthetic narrative invites long books. Because I cannot claim special knowledge in any of the fields being synthesized in these books, I do not propose to do the kind of analysis one would find in specialized reviews. Such criticisms that I have will be framed from the position of my interest in synthetic narrative. I say that in part to be honest about my own limitations in appraising these books but also for another, more positive reason. I want to insist that narrative synthesis is a form of knowledge, indeed, a particularly powerful form of creating, not simply summarizing, knowledge. I hope to get past or under the story enough to probe the implications of different modes of structuring a narrative synthesis. The way different narrative strategies construct that knowledge is important. While inclusion is one of the tests our generation will rightly ask of synthesis, there are other important historiographical issues that are embedded in the question of narrative synthesis.19 The more seriously we consider possible narratives of American history, the more we may be prepared to ask questions that press beyond inclusion. We may even be both bold enough and hopeful enough to worry a little about the language of inclusion, if not the principle. Is there perhaps more than a hint of dominant culture noblesse oblige in the language of inclusion? Might not a more sophisticated notion of the temporal and geographical boundaries of American history, including an awareness of the diasporic stories within American history, complicate and enrich the notion of inclusion?20 Can the historical and historiographical terrain be opened a bit more in a way that enables a deeper, denser, and more complex historiographical exploration of justice and difference at the center of American history? Might democracy be the word, the concept, the commitment that will move us in that direction? As I examine the stack of books before me, I propose to keep these issues in mind and to return to them at the end of this essay. JON BUTLER'S Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (2000) covers the whole mainland British colonial space and history, and it addresses a wide range of themes. In fact, themes, not time or chronology, organize his story. His brief, often one-word, chapter titles reveal a very distinctive type of synthesis, one immediately accessible to the reader, whether professional or lay: Peoples, Economy, Politics, Things Material, Things Spiritual. It is a reasonable progression, and in each case he brings together a good deal of material. Although his theme is transformation, Butler also claims (following recent historiography) a more inclusive geography, making more of the middle colonies than would have been the case a generation ago. In some ways, his manner of organizing the material topically bears a relation to [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 19 I do not propose to go into theories of narrative or even my own notions, but I will here indicate that my understanding has been greatly influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative, Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, trans., 3 vols. (Chicago, 1984-88). 20 Such thinking is not restricted to specialists in the profession exploring the theme of diaspora. The novelist Russell Banks has recently argued that the focus for a synthesis of American history ought to be the African diaspora. See "The Star-Spangled Novel," Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2000.

If Hofstadter's book was intended to provide a snapshot that would serve as a starting point, Butler's title ("Becoming America") and his stated intentions announce change as his theme. He means to persuade the reader of a broad pattern of transformation that produced a distinctive and modern society in advance of 1776 and that in turn spawned the first modern revolution. Such an argument demands more complex and careful attention to process and cause than his framing of the book seems to allow. While he has surely gathered together a considerable body of material (his notes run to fifty pages), he has not produced a synthetic narrative of change over time, one that sketches a develop- mental sequence that integrates disparate elements in the interest of a causal interpretation. By bounding each unit of synthesis, Butler is stuck with a structural isolation of topics that undercuts narrative explanation. Given that Butler's theme is transformation, this narrative structure is crippling. For reasons related to structure and style of argument, Butler's claims for American modernity are quite vulnerable. While there are doubtless some specific ways in which the British North American colonies became "modern" before independence, they were not uniformly modern-over space or in all aspects of life. Many historians would readily grant numerous anticipations of modernity by the middle of the eighteenth century, but few would insist, with Butler, that so much modernity had been achieved so soon, implying that only a few pre-modern anomalies remained on the eve of revolution.22 Most give a significant role to the revolution.23 But the most serious problem is not with the phenomena he notices or does not notice, even if there is some real unevenness on this point. Rather, it is Butler's teleology of the modern, combined with his exceedingly loose, elusive, and, as is so often said today, undertheorized definition of modernity. Add to this an unneces- sary but apparently irresistible tendency to claim American uniqueness and "firsts" for nearly everything he identifies as modern in America. He names a number of phenomena that he considers evidences of the modern-polyglot, slaves, cities, market economy, refined crafts and trades, religious pluralism, and "sophisticated politics." Without further historical specification and theoretical precision, one can indulge in reductio ad absurdum. With the exception of religious pluralism, all of these qualities probably described Athens in the age of Aristotle at least as well as the British colonies. In fact, I suspect that Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, relying on their recent book The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (2000), would argue that the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 21 Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (New York, 1971). 22 Jon Butler, Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (Cambridge, Mass., 2000), 1. 23 See, for example, Gordon S. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York, 1992). Long before, Bernard Bailyn suggested certain developments that Butler would consider modern had developed in the eighteenth century, but he emphasized the unevenness and even paradoxical character of this proto-modernity.

In the end, however, it is diversity, which he tends to equate with multiculturalism, that for Butler makes Americans modern. But if we look around, we cannot but wonder about his claims for a uniquely polyglot society. This assertion may be quite vulnerable from any sight line approaching a global perspective. Can he fairly claim that New York City harbored a level of diversity "never before gathered together"?25 Might not this be as plausibly said of Constantinople during the period covered by Butler's book? And did not the Ottoman Empire-of which Constantinople was the capital-far exceed the religious and ethnic diversity of the British colonies? My point here is partly one of fact, of care in making comparative statements without comparison. More important, however, are the criteria of the modern. Few, if any, major political bodies in the past half millennium more successfully accommodated diversity than the Ottomans, yet that achievement has never brought them recognition for a precocious modernity. One needs greater defini- tional and descriptive specificity to make the argument he claims. Because of the breadth and generality of synthetic narratives, it is especially important to be clear about key concepts. Similarly, he tends to claim the realization of "Americanness"-here equated with some vague notion of modernity-for events that, however interesting in themselves, hardly sustain his assertion that they designated "the American future."26 For example, writing of the French Huguenots, a group he knows well, he notes their assimilation, and he calls this "American."27 Well, of course it is, but so are the endogenous marriages that continue for various groups well into the twentieth century-sometimes because of racial difference and even legislation (as in the case of African Americans) or out of choice, as in the case of Scandinavians in the upper Midwest. Or to take a more ominous subject, it seems a bit fatalistic to say that colonial encroachment on Indian land "predicted" nineteenth-century relations with the Indians.28 Oddly, such a claim, while taking the moral high ground, nonetheless erases the postcolonial history of the United States by denying contingency and thus diminishing both the capacity and moral responsibility of all later actors or potential actors. The twin and linked teleologies of "modern" and "American" produce a distorting and de-historicizing synthesis. If there is a problem with the sort of synthesis Butler has written, what precisely is it? He makes historical claims about patterns and meanings of development on the basis of a narrative structure that effectively isolates and de-historicizes his themes. By not constructing a developmental narrative that integrates the various themes now separated in distinct chapters, the process and complexity of develop- ment is obscured.

In the absence of a narrative of change to explain and interpret, he resorts for a theme to repeated assertions of "modernity." The issue is not so much the claim for an eighteenth-century American modernity-although I am myself drawn to much more complex, nuanced, and contradictory discussions of that theme-as it is the incapacity of the particular model of synthesis he deploys to advance that theme or argument. Philip D. Morgan's Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (1998) is at once similar to Butler's and quite different. Both focus tightly in each chapter on a particular topic or theme; there is little play among the different themes in both cases. While Butler's themes propose a reorganization of material, thus giving an impression of freshness, Morgan's quite important questions are phrased in well-established ways. While Butler's structure works against his theme of transformation, Morgan's similar structure better fits his goals for the book, partly because transformation plays a smaller role in his analysis than one might expect. Slave Counterpoint addresses nearly all the issues raised by a half century of vigorous scholarship on the beginnings of slavery, the practices of racial slavery as a labor and social system, and the nature of African-American culture in early America. It is a book of enviable learning: with a seeming total command of the historiography and an impressive knowledge of a substantial archival base, Morgan proceeds to pose (or re-pose) difficult historiographical issues. Again and again, he offers compelling answers. Want to know what scholarship has disclosed about slavery and African-American culture in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and Lowcountry? Look to Morgan's synthesis of a generation of scholarship. To have done that is to have done a great deal, and he has done it magnificently. Yet one gets the sense of a summary volume, a volume driven by the past, by past questions. Synthesis can either cap a phase of scholarship or initiate another. I think Morgan's book falls into the former category, while Ira Berlin's new book, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (1998), which also relies on a generation of scholarship and addresses many of the same issues, has the potential to become a new starting point. Berlin has captured the shift to an Atlantic perspective that has increasingly characterized scholarship by early modern Europeanists, Africanists, Latin Americanists, and historians of British North America. In this sense, his work, at least the early parts that sketch out and populate the Atlantic littoral, points forward.29 In a dramatic opening section, Berlin, relying more on secondary literatures than does Morgan, locates his story in very broad understandings of time (periodization) and space (the Atlantic world), the dimensions of which are shadowy, almost invisible, in Morgan's account. He locates Africans in an Atlantic history connecting four continents and in a rich and growing historiography reaching out from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America.30 One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 29 Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge, Mass., 1998). 30 Berlin's powerful evocation of the Atlantic builds on many predecessors. At minimum, mention should be made of Philip D. Curtin's The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (Madison, Wis., 1969); and The AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 138 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] wishes Berlin had sustained this perspective in the later sections. But even if he narrows the story to the territory that later became the United States and loses the multiple histories implied by his portrait of the Atlantic world, the beginnings of stories, whether novels or histories, are heavy with intention and implication that can, I hope, be built upon.31 In fact, the four Atlantic continents remain an always changing aspect of American and African histories. Attending to, or at least recognizing, that larger and continuing extended terrain of American history would enrich the story of the making of African Americans and America, a historiography that is at present too much captured by an implicit and too simple assimilation or "Americanization" model. Nonetheless, Berlin has provided a powerful image of the creation of the Atlantic world and of the origin of modern slavery within it. Morgan has a quite different strategy. His domain is not the Atlantic but the South, or two regions of the South, which he is anxious to reveal as differentiated. Thus his is a comparative history, comparing two regions within the South. Suggesting a certain scientific aspiration, he refers to his delimited space as a kind of laboratory, a site for an "indirect experiment."32 This approach offers him much. He is able to focus tightly on his questions and generally achieves sharply phrased answers. Yet, like any good scientific laboratory, his field of inquiry is almost hermetically sealed. A two-hundred-page part of the book titled "The Black World" begins with a fifteen-page section on "Africans." Yet it is in only one paragraph at the beginning and a few other scattered references that one reads anything about Africa. His story rarely strays east (or south or north or west) of the Maryland/ Virginia and South Carolina boundaries. His comparative method has impressive rigor. Yet one senses that not only does his approach trap him within a particular place, he is also caught within a very confining net woven from the existing historiography. As Walter Johnson pointed out in a review of the book in this journal, his questions are smaller than the stories he has unearthed.33 Much like another important book on African-American history, Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), this book, for all its synthetic aspirations, cannot capture some of its best material within the tightly bounded historiographical questions and issues that frame it.34 As in the case of Berlin's book, Morgan's is quite explicit about time and space. There is a well-thought-out chronology of change, and one of his major arguments is that the South, and thus the black as well as white experience, was not uniform over space. He shows real and important distinctions between the experience of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex (New York, 1990; 2d edn., 1998); and John K.

Yet by treating both the temporal and spatial aspects of the story as sites (and very limited ones) rather than as processes of historical making, he weakens the capacity of his local analyses to explain change over time and, to a lesser extent, space. His major explanatory claims appear in the introduction. They are not only brief but also separate from the rich stories he tells and the analyses he makes of historiographical questions.35 The expansiveness of Many Thousands Gone, by contrast, evokes a strong sense of change, of process. It achieves a narrative synthesis of the movement of Africans onto the Atlantic and into the Western hemisphere. The difference between this approach and the tightly controlled analysis crafted by Morgan is striking. Like Morgan's, Michael Schudson's book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998), is organized around fairly established questions- especially one big question. Has American civic life deteriorated over the course of the past three centuries? Naturally, the question is of a different order than those driving Morgan's analysis. It has not been generated by disciplinary scholarship. It arose out of American public life. Schudson thus draws on history and other disciplines to address directly a public question, one endlessly repeated today and, as he shows, in the past. Schudson himself, we should note, is not a historian. He was trained as a sociologist, and he teaches in a Department of Communication. While he reveals an impressive command of the relevant historiography, historians are not his primary reference group or audience.36 Although I am sure specialists will find some of his formulations to be of considerable historiographical significance and likely to encourage new lines of research, his intention, again, is different: his audience is a general one, and he seeks to bring historical knowledge to bear on a civic issue. What he is doing points toward the most important work that one kind of successful narrative synthesis can do, for the profession and for the public. By openly declaring his address to a public issue and for a public audience, Schudson participates in a very important tradition of historical writing. Some of the very best professional historians of the United States in this century have done precisely that: Frederick Jackson Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Beard, and Richard Hofstadter all focused on issues, worries, or preoccupations of fairly general interest to write synthetic works that importantly rephrased fundamental themes in American history. This mutual enrichment of public and professional discourse is perhaps the ideal cultural work of narrative synthesis. Let us hope that historians can do this more often and more effectively. Yet as I make this point, I realize that all of the historians just named, including Schudson himself, were either trained as social scientists or did not recognize a significant boundary between history and the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 35Morgan, Slave Counterpoint, xv-xxiv. I should note that my concerns about boundary setting in Morgan's book do not apply nearly so much to Philip D. Morgan, "The Black Experience in the British Empire, 1680-1810," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, Vol. 2: The Eighteenth Century, P. J. Marshall, ed. (Oxford, 1998), 465-86. 36 This command is at once impressive and sometimes puzzling. In discussing the Founding and the Constitution, he does not mention Gordon Wood's The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969). Nor, in writing about the first decades of the nineteenth century, does he mention either of two key books by Robert H. Wiebe, The Opening of American Society: From the Adoption of the Constitution to the Eve of Disunion (New York, 1984); and Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy (Chicago, 1995). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 140 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] (other?) once more expansive social sciences. Is this a mere coincidence, or is it an issue to be addressed by the profession? While I would not place Schudson's book in the same class as the scholarship produced by the short list of great historians, he has written a fine book. It is a book about change over time, and he establishes three eras of citizenship and participa- tion, each clearly defined. He does not devote much attention to how each configuration changes into the next, but he effectively characterizes their differ- ences, even in some very brief summaries, as in the following paragraph from early in the book: Another way to characterize the past three hundred years of political change is to say that the type of authority by which society is governed shifted from personal authority (gentlemen) to interpersonal authority (parties, coalitions, and majorities), to impersonal authority (science, expertise, legal rights, and information) ... The geographical center of politics has shifted from the countryside to the cities to the suburbs and perhaps, today, to "technoburbs," "postsuburbs," or "edge cities," or whatever we name our newer habitations. Correspondingly, the kind of knowledge a good citizen requires has changed: in an age of gentlemen, the citizen's relatively rare entrances into public discussion or controversy could be guided by his knowledge of social position; in the era of rule by majorities, the citizen's voting could be led by the enthusiasm and rhetoric of parties and their most active partisans; in the era of expertise and bureaucracies, the citizens had increasingly to learn to trust their own canvass of newspapers, interest groups, parties, and other sources of knowledge, only occasionally supported by the immediacy of human contact; and in the emerging age of rights, citizens learn to catalog what entitlements they may have and what forms of victimization they may knowingly or unknowingly have experienced.37 This paragraph reveals the argument and the narrative strategy that Schudson uses to undercut the widespread notion of civic decline: rather than a story of decline, it is one of restructuring, one that recalibrates citizenship and civic practice in relation to changing values and social experiences. What some, including me, see as the erosion of our public life and the thinning of American political culture, he presents as a complex rearticulation of expectations and institutions. Whether one fully agrees with Schudson or not, the book and the point of view it ingeniously argues constitutes an important contribution of contemporary civic life. And a narrative strategy of restructuring (as opposed to the usual rise or fall scenarios) deserves a place in the historian's menu of narrative types. "Presentist" purposes may, however, carry the danger of anachronistic readings. Schudson is vulnerable on this score, especially in his consideration of the colonial period. He too easily asks how democratic any phase of political life was. A commitment to explore the fate of democracy in our past-something I endorse- surely includes recognizing when democracy is not an available concept. He might better have asked how the legitimation and exercise of power worked. Indeed, such a deeper historicism would complement his anti-anti-Whig approach. Similarly, while a then-and-now binary invites sometimes interesting questions and offers some illumination of past and present, it also invites problems. Again, one sees this risk in Schudson's work. False categories of judgment are explicitly or implicitly brought to bear.

Voters then were expected to have "local knowledge-not of laws or principles, but of men."38 The binary obscures the role of principles in the past and knowledge of men in the present. Most important of all, it diverts our attention from the principles that it was thought would aid voters in judging character.39 Sometimes, by focusing so much on the party system that we worry about today, he overlooks those important issues that eluded the parties or that parties avoided. Substantive issues-the reason citizenship and civic life are important-are marginalized in his account of the different concepts and patterns of public life. The result, whether intended or not, is a form of consensus history.40 "Progress or decline is not the real question," Schudson concludes.41 He converts that question into one of restructuring that points to his core argument: there must be a fit between forms of citizenship and forms of everyday life, between values and institutions, between aspirations and commitments. It is that historically informed understanding that allows him in his conclusion to speculate in quite promising ways about an evolving pattern of citizenship that may yet serve our collective hopes and needs. Still, his conclusion leaves me uneasy. Like the journalistic coverage of politics today, the substance of political conflict is subordinated to discussion of the "health" of the system, of the institutions and practices. By contrast, the tensions, conflicts, and substantive issues that made politics so important in the development of the United States and in the lives of individuals are at the center of Eric Foner's The Story of American Freedom (1998). Foner's book has an uncanny resemblance to one that at first glance might seem utterly unrelated: Richard Hofstadter's The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It.42 Of course, Foner inverts the point Hofstadter sought to make. If Hofstadter famously played down conflict and (less remarked upon) paid little attention to the social making of political ideologies, Foner emphasizes conflict and the changing historical construction and reconstruction of the idea and ideology of freedom. Foner's work is much more explicitly sensitive to social history, even if it parallels Hofstadter's in its interest in ideology and the limits and possibilities of American political culture. While Hofstadter was alternately comic and ironic, bitterly so at times, in The American Political Tradition, Foner's Story of American Freedom is strikingly fair and straightforward. Yet the underlying hope is similar.

Both appraised American political culture and its prospects from the position of a richer, more textured liberalism than we usually recognize in current debates.44 In thinking about the core issue in Foner's narrative, therefore, it seems fair to consider it to be the quest for a democratic liberalism, insisting on the relevance and indispensability of the modifier inserted before liberalism. One might thus characterize Foner's as a democratic synthesis, which, as I suggested above, offers a stronger and more egalitarian standard of judgment than commonplace invoca- tions of inclusion. It offers as well the implication of voice and empowerment. To Foner, as he indicates in his introduction, "abstract definitions" of freedom are not the focus. His concern is "with the debates and struggles through which freedom acquires concrete meanings, and how understandings of freedom are shaped by, and in turn help to shape, social movements and political and economic events."45 The result is a narrative that is at once focused yet always open to an examination of larger issues, structures, and events that intersect with and often drive his story. It is a dynamic story, filled with actors, with agents making freedom and using freedom. He selects key events or controversies of different eras, events that are widely contested (slavery, labor and property, the role of the state, social movements). Of course, coverage is selective; the gain is the richness deriving from a series of concentrated focal points. In each case, he examines the conflict, the parties contending, and the stakes. He does not hesitate to declare justices and injustices, to name winners and losers, and he does so from a consistently democratic perspective. Foner thus achieves inclusion without the dilution conse- quent with the faux openness characteristic of talk radio and without the postmod- ern hesitations that undermine moral judgment.46 The American West: A New Interpretive History (2000) by Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher spans the whole of American history, from "the European invasion" until the present.47 The book is written in the spirit of Frederick Jackson Turner. Instead of lamenting the ambiguity of Turner's conception of the frontier, which after Turner got reduced by rigorous historians to a place, the West, Hine and Faragher embrace its fullness.

That openness allows them to tell the history of the United States as a story of successive frontiers, including a fascinating rethinking of American regionalism as urban-centered at the end of the twentieth century.48 In fact, the chapter on the postwar era is a tour de force-imaginative, original, and quite compelling. In Turnerian fashion, they argue that "westering defined America's unique heritage."49 To a very impressive degree, they give substance to this claim, but recent historiography makes that claim, even for western history, problematic. As Hine and Faragher show, in the nineteenth century as well as today, the West (and the United States) was formed by migrations from west to east and south to north, and even in a limited way north to south, as well as east to west. The notion of westering is so strong in American and European history and culture, it is difficult to construct an alternative narrative structure, though no less important for the difficulty.50 This worry does not, however, undercut another summary point they make: the "frontier is our common past."51 The book is grounded in social history. Of all the books under consideration here, The American West is probably the most sensitive to the categories of experience and groups previously excluded from mainstream narratives of Ameri- can history. Their work goes well beyond mere representation of such groups and categories; previously invisible groups, whether Native Americans, migrating women, African-American settlers, working people, or the people of the border- lands, are actors who contributed to the shaping of history. But there are limits to this achievement. While there are multiple positions and voices represented in their narrative, only rarely does their narrative bring the reader inside group life. There is not much inquiry into the interior experience and subjective meanings shared by the various groups identified and recognized.52 While the story could have been situated in a wider context, one that revealed the global reach of the empires or, later, the importance of global markets, in its particular geographical focus the book consistently avoids privileging the English line of settlement. Other settler efforts are considered and sometimes compared. As is often the case with synthetic histories, however, there is a tendency to do the work of inclusion at a particular moment, and then lose the group at issue.

At times, the transnational themes they develop are extremely illuminating. They refer to what would later be characterized by theorists of the global cities as a "dual economy" in describing the role of foreign migrants, especially Chinese, in the nineteenth-century California agricultural economy.53 Likewise the interplay of national and international in their discussion of the Zimmerman telegram inviting Mexico to ally with Germany in World War I and in their discussion of San Francisco's "commercial hinterland."54 But, as in the case of Butler's book, there is a bit of parochialism in making claims of distinction. Perhaps such assertions can be demonstrated, but more rigorous definitions and empirical research than we have here are required to establish, for example, that the United States is today the world's most multicultural society.55 How would it compare with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, whose citizens speak more than 100 languages and live on almost numberless islands? The social-history approach, whatever its success in representing difference, has in this instance under-represented national political institutions and policies. The development of the West, as Richard White and other historians of the West have pointed out, was profoundly indebted to what western Republicans now call "big government," for water, transportation, Indian removal, and, more recently, direct investment, as in defense contracts and installations and aerospace industries.56 The political economy and the role of markets, as has already been suggested, do not get the attention they deserve. We often overlook how much industry was in the West, and how much western industries-from milling and meatpacking to mining-were integral to the industrial system of the United States. And we forget how much the astonishing productivity of western agriculture enabled the formation of a large urban industrial labor supply. More of these dimensions of western history might have been included if only in the interest in enabling the story better to tell the national experience. If Hine and Faragher encompass both the full geographical and temporal dimensions of western history, Linda Gordon's microhistory builds out from a very delimited western space, the Sonoran highlands of Arizona, to develop a highly innovative narrative synthesis that locates itself at the various and causally interrelated scales of town, region, nation, and the transnational. Her work reminds us that there is a difference between a mere local study and a microhistory. The local histories of villages, towns, and cities, so common in the 1970s, tended to use global concepts but within artificially bounded fields of inquiry. One of the most famous of them all, Kenneth Lockridge's study of Dedham, Massachusetts, offered an isolated inwardness as a principal finding, although it was a finding that derived [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 53Hine and Faragher, American West, 358-60. 54 Hine and Faragher, American West, 395-97, 414.

Mostly, her account is the story of the arrival and fate of Catholic orphans from New York who were to be placed in Catholic homes. The homes were Mexican as well as Catholic, and that was the problem and the focus of conflict. The conflict played out along class, ethnic, religious, and gender lines, and it eventually reached the Supreme Court. It is a compelling and very human narrative, but one that also addresses a whole range of analytical and interpretive issues of broader interest to historians. Bringing the issues of gender, class, and race into relation with each other allows for an appraisal of their relative importance in this particular historical explanation. I think that her story reveals class to be more important than her conclusion argues, but the real point to be made is that only a narrative synthesis that brings diverse threads together will enable the historian and the reader to make this kind of judgment. These complex ends are achieved in part by her adoption of an imaginative literary strategy. Gordon's book is constructed of two types of chapters. One is quite often a broad frame for local events. In these chapters, her perspective as narrator is exterior to the action. The issues addressed are frequently structural and, as often as not, extend beyond the community. Here, one gets an analytical explanation of the relation of local experience to larger national and international cultural, political, and economic developments. Between these chapters, she has crafted others that get inside the culture of the community, providing wonderfully rich, thick descriptions of daily life and the development of the conflict. With oral histories as well as fragmentary documentary evidence, she brings the reader very close to the experience and voices of the community. The play between these accounts and the more conventional chapters produces an unusual but powerful synthesis. Whether a microhistory qualifies as a synthesis, even by my generous definition, may be debated. But the singular relevance of this book for the discussion of synthesis concerns not scale but its literary ambition, the literary experiment that gives structure to the book. Those who would write other syntheses-at various scales-will, I hope, be encouraged, even inspired, to experiment with novel narrative strategies in the interest of more powerful representations of the past. Quintard Taylor presents a third version of western history, In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990 (1998). He offers a broad synthetic account that characterizes the experiences of African Americans over a very long period of time.

Drawing on a substantial body of scholarship, most of it published in the past quarter century, he aims to "reconstruct the history of African American women and men" in the West over five centuries, although mostly his focus is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Taylor's central themes are the quest for community by blacks and the relative degrees of freedom and opportunity they find in different times and places. The conjuncture of the map of African-American presence and the conventional history of the West that his story brings out compels rethinking of both African-American and western history. He makes the point, for example, that the issue of Texas independence in 1836 was not simply, as myth, even the more recent multicultural version, would have it: Anglos and Tejanos in Texas confronting a despotic government in Mexico. It was also an Anglo effort to preserve slavery.60 More broadly, the map literally reveals that African Americans in the West were overwhelmingly city and town dwellers, and it is that fact that unifies their experience. The kind of synthetic narrative that he has constructed provides an invaluable service at a particular moment, crystallizing a generation of scholarship, making generalization possible. His work not only informs the public of the dimensions of previously unrecognized histories, it also provides a base for the next generation of scholarship. In a similar way, another recent synthesis, one that focuses on a more narrowly defined but also more developed area of scholarship, reveals the harvest of recent scholarship on work and workers. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and Vhite Labor (1998) by Jacqueline Jones at once brings this rich scholarship to a wider audience and proffers a fresh way of framing the field.61 If The American West, In Search of the Racial Frontier, and American Work cover very long chronological spans, books by David M. Kennedy and Fred Anderson address short periods. Their focus is also quite different, since both concentrate on political and military history. Kennedy's Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) addresses what might well be called "high politics," while Anderson's The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 (2000) brings social history and high politics into fruitful play, finding in that interaction the terms of his central argument about the nature of power in the British Empire. At the outset, both books locate their stories in a broad international context. Kennedy's book begins at the close of World War I, and the first character introduced is Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler, who was in a military hospital recovering from a poison gas attack when he heard the news of Germany's surrender. The international context thus suggested is obviously central to the half [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 59He explicitly recognizes the issue of intergroup relations, but he equally explicitly indicates that such is not his aim here.

The geography of Washington, D.C., even that of the White House, and the biographies of three men-Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Hitler-are more important to Kennedy's story than the world beyond the borders of the United States or, for that matter, than the American people of his subtitle. One of Kennedy's aims is evidently to urge upon Americans a greater attention to and sense of responsibility in the larger world, yet with the exception of the excellent discussion of the differing explanations of the economic crisis offered by Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt, there is surprisingly little incorporation of inter- national elements into the dynamic of the story. For all the importance of the larger world, for Kennedy, as for many Americans, whether professional historians or not, the international is a sort of "other," something "over there," if I may reverse the title of one of Kennedy's earlier books.62 Kennedy- also pays little attention to social history, not even to social histories that have sought to better explain the politics of the interwar years.63 Nor does the book address intellectual history, the history of science and technology (except briefly in connection with war production), the states, education, urban history, and much more. In fact, the book would have been more accurately described by the title of William E. Leuchtenburg's classic, F.D.R. and the New Deal, 1932-1940, which is here superseded and extended into the war years.64 So titled, adding the war to the New Deal, one could have no objection to this extraordinarily well-written, deeply researched, and compellingly argued book. But is it a history of "the American people"? Freedom from Fear is a masterful narrative on the terms it has assumed for itself. Yet having said that, historiographical questions remain. Kennedy apparently assumes that three voices are the important ones; not many other voices are heard, even though each of a small clutch of additional figures is presented very effectively as a full human being: Lorena Hickok, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Raymond Moley, Herbert Hoover, John L. Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph, among a few others. History for Kennedy, unlike for the other authors of these syntheses, is made by select leaders, not by ordinary people. What is remarkable, therefore, is the illusion of synthesis that is achieved. The book was published in a series that promises narrative syntheses of the defining periods of American national history. Most so far published accept traditional definitions of periods, and they are framed as political history, but none is so severely restricted as this one, which won the Pulitzer Prize in part because it was recognized as a work of grand synthesis. Dramatic changes in the historiography of the American field make it seem anachronistic. Yet its success makes the point that political history in the grand [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 62 David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (New York, 1980).

Fred Anderson's Crucible of War again engages us with the question of elites and ordinary people, and it provides -a promising approach. While Kennedy seems quite confident of the importance of a few leaders, Anderson seems to be ambivalent, and that ambivalence enriches his history. Although I think the principal contribution of Crucible of War to our understanding of the British Empire is grounded in the social history of the political and military experience of ordinary Americans, the dramatic focus, as with Francis Parkman's great nineteenth-century narrative, is on two great leaders of the French and Indian War, the marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe.65 Yet, as Alan Taylor has insightfully insisted, Anderson has rewritten the story of their confrontation in a way that diminishes these actors, especially Wolfe.66 To be sure, Anderson's book goes beyond Parkman in its respect for Native Americans, their agency, and their role in the empire (and the role of the empire and war for them). He also modifies Parkman on a point that is central to the book's contribution to imperial history: unlike Parkman, Anderson not only notices but makes much of the division between English colonials and English metropolitans. These differences in expectation and experience make the war in his view a "theatre of intercultural interaction."67 Like Butler, Anderson seeks to diminish the role of 1776 in understanding the development of what became the United States. Historians, he argues, will better understand the creation of the United States by closely examining the Seven Years' War and, more generally, by challenging the usual tendency to "take as our point of reference the thirteen rebelling colonies, not the empire as a whole."68 Yet, even as he argues the importance of getting behind the Revolution of 1776 so that one can discover the eighteenth century as it was experienced, the revolution remains a touchstone for him. More than anything else, he wants the reader to recognize that the shots fired in the Seven Years' War were the ones with implications around the world. But he keeps de-historicizing his story to use it to diminish the shot of lesser implication (in his view) heard 'round the world in 1775. When one begins the book, there is a sense of excitement. Here is a history of the United States ready to take the globe as its context. Before the narrative even begins, the reader is presented with a portfolio of maps. Only two of eight describe the British colonies; no more than four of them consider North America at all. The portfolio begins with a world map, revealing the global distribution of the battles that marked the Seven Years' War. There are also maps of the Indian subcontinent, Central Europe, and the Caribbean. The introduction promises a book that will make the world, or at least the full extent of the British Empire, its context and subject. We are told that "if viewed from Montreal or Vincennes, St. Augustine, Havana, Paris or Madrid-or, for that matter Calcutta or Berlin-the Seven Years' War was far more significant than the War of American Independence."69 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 65 Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 6th edn., 2 vols.

We get very little of Asia (although Manila makes a brief but important comparative appearance), the Caribbean, Africa, and continental Europe. Of course, other European powers are part of the narrative, but they only have walk-on roles. We learn little of them at home or about the ways leaders or ordinary citizens interpret events, while we are, by contrast, led through elaborate accounts of high British politics. The preface, presumably written last, sketches an extraordinary agenda for what would be a stunning book. Unfortunately, Anderson did not write the book he there described. Still, judged in terms of what it did rather than what it proposed to do, it is an outstanding work of craft. It will no doubt be our generation's account of the Seven Years' War. As military history, it is superb, and it contributes importantly-but not so grandly as some of the opening rhetoric promises-to the non-controversial but still unclear issue of the causal relations that connect the Seven Years' War to the coming of the revolution. Anderson in fact offers a rich Anglo-centric narrative that explores and explains the different meaning of the war both as strategic event and as experience for the British of the metropole and in the colonies. It is written with verve and confidence-and a seemingly complete command of the materials, primary and secondary. One of its themes is the misperception of events by political elites; with the exception of William Pitt, surely Anderson's hero in this story, they fail to understand the different meaning of the war and empire for ordinary soldiers and colonial subjects. He thus makes cultural issues the heart of the book. Military and political elites play a dramatic role in the narrative, but causation for Anderson- and here he points to important newer developments in military and diplomatic history-is to be found in the culture of everyday life.70 In making this point, he not only offers an important interpretation of the war (building in part on his previous book on Massachusetts soldiers), he also reveals the empire to be less solid, more a matter of continuous negotiation, than historians often consider such entities, whether empires or nations or states.71 MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN ANDERSON, Ira Berlin, referring to the earliest history of Afro-European North America, and Daniel T. Rodgers, addressing the early twentieth century, incorporate the Atlantic, or at least the North Atlantic, into their narratives of American history. Berlin and Rodgers write very different kinds of history and focus on different periods. Berlin's is a social history, while Rodgers has written an intellectual history, or, perhaps, a history of political culture. Yet both Berlin and Rodgers recognize the complex webs that route movements-of people, of ideas, of money, of things-in the Atlantic world. The transnational terrains that Berlin and Rodgers evoke establish larger and truer frames for national histories than do notions of bounded and self-contained regions or nations. The first section of Berlin's Many Thousands Gone, a portrait of the Atlantic littoral, describes a world framed by cities and the sea, little divided by national [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 70 Anderson, Crucible of War, 453-54. 71 See Fred Anderson, A Peoples' Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the Seven Years' War (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1984).

Berlin's opening tableau describes the emergence of the Atlantic world as an ever- expanding historical terrain, where the African presence is pervasive on the sea and in the cities, including Lisbon, where they made up 10 percent of the population in the sixteenth century. He evokes a world defined by a network of cosmopolitan cities populated by creolized peoples. African people were not only omnipresent, they were often crucial cultural and economic brokers, helping to knit this new world together. Berlin lets go of this powerful frame and image in his later chapters, where he narrows the focus to regional difference within the bounds of British North America. Still, the book's protean beginning remains in the reader's mind, inviting others to realize its narrative logic and moral meaning.72 In Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998), Daniel T. Rodgers also achieves a richer historicism by expanding the space of analysis. One small indication is in the subtitle. He refers to "social politics," not the more usual "welfare state." His approach, examining relations in space as well as over time as fields of contingency, makes the welfare state a problematic common term. When he uses the more general and more mobile term "social politics," he effectively historicizes the concept, lineage, and practice of the welfare state. The development of a social politics has other possible paths and outcomes besides evolution into the national welfare state.73 The national welfare state thus becomes a historically and place-specific invention rather than a universal or, worse, the teleological endpoint of American liberal narratives-an endpoint surely upended by the politics of the last quarter of the twentieth century. Following the pioneering work of James T. Kloppenberg, who also assumed a Euro-American context for progressivism and social democracy, Rodgers ap- proaches this age of reform as at once a transnational and national issue.74 A variety of reforms-from urban planning to social insurance to regulation of capitalism- are examined as products both of general, transnational ideas and of particular, national political cultures. The complex narratives thus developed by Rodgers and Kloppenberg-ones that recognize, especially in the case of Rodgers, the historicity of the balance between national and transnational-are a major advance in the narrative synthesis of a national history. Both Rodgers and Kloppenberg impress on the reader that ideas could cross the Atlantic in either direction. This is salutary; American intellectual history is too often thought by Europeans and Americans as well to be either insignificant or derivative, not quite up to equal participation in an international world of ideas. This common point is handled differently in each book. While Kloppenberg notes [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 72 One hopes this extension of the historiographical terrain will continue and that connections as well as comparisons will be made between the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic and between the Atlantic slave trade and the slave trade that turned to the east, to the Muslim empires of the Mediterranean and today's Middle East. Big as it is, the Atlantic does not capture the logic and dimensions of slavery in this era. 73 See, for example, the argument (somewhat dependent on Rodgers's work) in Thomas Bender, "Cities, Intellectuals, and Citizenship in the United States: The 1890s and 1990s," Citizenship Studies 3 (1999): 203-20. 74 Daniel T.

Rodgers, by contrast, focuses on the specific transit of ideas and emphasizes the way intellectuals and reformers on either side of the Atlantic drew selectively on these ideas, depending on personal taste and local circumstance. The result is a fundamental and valuable reorientation of the way we might understand intellectual history. The conceptual opening they have created invites a yet more radical under- standing of the territory and movement of ideas. Let me go back to the title of Rodgers's book. I think that "Atlantic Crossings" projects too narrow an under- standing of the implications of the book. It emphasizes the movement of people and ideas back and forth across the Atlantic. To that extent, it recalls a much older Anglo-American historiography of "trans-Atlantic influences."75 Rodgers goes well beyond this historiography in showing that, in important respects, Europe was partly Americanized and the United States was partly Europeanized by the phenomena he describes. But his really important accomplishment is to get away from the "influence" model, to displace the linear A to B notion of intellectual history. But he could have gone farther yet. There is more to the circulation of ideas than this framing recognizes. It is more than an Atlantic crossing, more than a link between Western Europe and the United States. The whole Atlantic, South Atlantic as well as North Atlantic, and, indeed, increasingly, parts of the Pacific world better describe the extent of the intellectual network his book evokes. In regard to urban development and reform, an important theme in Rodgers's book, it is clear that there is a global conversation at work. Rather than the linearity of steamship crossings (the dustjacket illustration) between the port cities of Western Europe and New York, I imagine a Great Bazaar of urban ideas, technology, and aesthetics hovering over the Atlantic, with many traders and buyers. This exchange is not, of course, symmetrical, and that itself is an issue, but participation was nearly global in 1900. Progressive ideas, especially those dealing with urban reform and technologies, traveled through many circuits and with different voltage, but nearly the whole world was connected, not only Western Europe and the United States. Simply look at the cities of Eastern Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, Central and East Asia. Surely, they were part of an international conception of urbanism-and of urban commercial culture. The remnants of the era make it clear that New York and Chicago, no less than Lyons, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Shanghai, were local instances of a global process of city-making. THESE LAST COMMENTS SUGGEST what I take to be the next challenge of narrative synthesis. But before I conclude, let me briefly review what has been accomplished by the cohort of synthetic histories considered here. These books reveal, even verify, the capacity of narrative synthesis to achieve inclusion and to respect issues of identity. Moreover, it seems possible in synthetic narratives to combine structure [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 75 See Frank Thistlethwaite, The Anglo-American Connection in the Early Nineteenth Century (Philadelphia, 1959).

The volumes here examined reveal many narrative strategies and quite different relations to a wider reading public. There is no single model, and no one volume (yet) does all the things we might fairly expect in a realized synthesis. In addition, these books, both in what they do and do not do, suggest to me the value of embracing a narrative core that is a more explicit and deeper exploration of democracy and difference, freedom and empowerment, contest and justice. Such a focus promises a sharper analytical history, one more historical and less susceptible to teleology, whether of modernity or anything else. It seems plausible to propose that a wider canvas, a supranational context, may in fact enhance the examination of these issues. The work of Hine and Faragher, Berlin, Gordon, and Rodgers in particular enables one to imagine an even more radical synthesis of national history, one that operates on multiple geographical scales, from narratives smaller than the nation to supra-national ones-thus identifying the nation as a product of history as well as an object of historical inquiry. Such a framing of national history will increase awareness of the complexity of the multiple axes of historical interaction, causation, and identity formation. While I mean these concluding comments to suggest an ambitious new agenda for the discipline, we must not overlook an already existing and compelling example. Decades ago, David Brion Davis embarked on a multivolume history that considered all these issues. He brought them together in his majestic synthesis that explores slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world, a history of nearly global reach that is also-and I emphasize this fact-a history of the United States.76 My point, then, is that such histories can be written, have been written, and I trust that more will yet be written. The present moment seems especially propitious for such histories. The relation of the nation to both subnational and transnational solidarities is very much in question. It is a public concern as well as an object of interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry. Historians surely have an open invitation to rethink the boundaries of national histories.77 Colonial historians have been moving in this direction for some time, redefining their field as the Atlantic world long before the globalization talk. Likewise, Rodgers and Ian Tyrrell, both of whom work on the modern period, moved in this direction fairly early and for a different reason: their concern about the claims of American exceptionalism.78 With these various concerns at work, we may fairly expect a movement of American historians and other historians as well toward a wider sense of their fields. National histories will not be so firmly bounded, and the assumption of their national autarky will be softened by the recognition that national histories are [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 76 David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966); The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (Ithaca, 1975), with the final installment yet to come. 77 See Bender, Rethinking American History in a Global Age; and Thomas Bender, The La Pietra Report (Bloomington, Ind., 2000), also available on the World Wide Web at www.oah.org/activities/ lapietra/index.html. 78 Ian Tyrrell, "American Exceptionalism in an Age of International History," AHR 96 (October 1991): 1031-55; Daniel T.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau. For reading the current essay, my particular thanks to Catherine Desbarats, Eric Jabbari, James Ron, and Michael Wasser, as well as to Tim Rowse, Desley Deacon, Ann Curthoys, and John Docker for helpful suggestions. I am of course solely responsible for the content. The research for this essay was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. 1 Jean Comaroff and John L.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 437 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne political, economic, and cultural colonialism-fields the authors argue are in any case impossible to disaggregate.9 The programmatic claims that lend Of Revelation and Revolution its force also, however, cause some interesting tensions in the book. The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M. Larson, "'Capacities and Modes of Thinking': Intellectual Engagements and Subaltern Hegemony in the Early History of Malagasy Christianity," AHR 102 (October 1997): 969-1002; Richard Elphick and Rodney Davenport, eds., Christianity in South Africa: A Political, Social, and Cultural History (Berkeley, Calif., 1997); and many other works discussed in David Chidester, Judy Tobler, and Darrel Wratten, Christianity in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography (Westport, Conn., 1997). The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 443 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne does not fail to capture some aspects of social and political reality. This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject.

There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76.

Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman.

Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Sanneh, Translating the Message, emphasizes in contrast indigenous agency in the "translation" of Christianity from one culture to another. At a different end of the spectrum of debate might be those who see efforts to change the religious systems of indigenous peoples as a form (or as an element) of cultural genocide. A.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work. Taylor is of course a Christian Hegelian, whose view of the emergence of the modern self is certainly influenced by Hegelian dialectics, in however inexplicit a fashion.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: Theorizing for theory’s sake certainly has its place, and not every book needs to be focused on practical issues. Nonetheless, even the most gymnastic theoretician needs some grounding connection to relevant cases. Reynolds is profoundly uninterested in this level of analysis.

Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: Ibid., p. 111. Even Riffaterre's approach to the structuring unsaid of textual writing can be seen to represent on its own terms a shift from the ontology of narrative toward its epistemology at the level of form rather than content. By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific
            truth:a story's immanent signifying patterns in their subtextual disclosure.<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Hall sees that this argument as it develops across Ricoeur’s writings raises questions about the role of reciprocity in the Ricoeur texts he considers. He acknowledges that Ricoeur’s recognition that not all human relations are face‐to‐face leads him beyond a narrow call for solicitude and friendship at this level to a concern for the level of institutions as well. It is at this level of institutions that the question of justice really arises, and with it new questions regarding responsibility and possible reciprocity, particularly regarding our ability to respond to others who we may never meet face‐to‐face. As Hall says, “love often demands a dimension of self‐sacrifice, most notably in the form of renouncing a strict reciprocity” (150). His case could have been stronger here if he had incorporated Ricoeur’s discussions of the work of John Rawls and the antisacrificial notion of justice he saw there. Beyond this, Hall’s focal idea of a relation between love and justice marked by what he calls a poetic tension should also have included some discussion of what Ricoeur says in
   The Course of Recognition(Institute for Human Sciences Vienna Lecture Series, trans. David Pellauer [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005]; originally published asParcours de la reconnaissance[Paris: Éditions Stock, 2004]) about the limits of existing philosophies of recognition, which he saw as not getting any further than a notion of reciprocal recognition in just the sense Hall criticizes. Ricoeur’s own answer was to begin there to lay out the idea of mutual recognition beyond mere reciprocity, a higher form of recognition that stands closer, as Hall anticipates, to something like the reception of a gift that expects nothing in return but which may lead to a second gift given to others. Readers who wish to build on Hall’s argument will want also to look at this last major book from Ricoeur.<br>

Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Author(s): Eades Caroline<br>
Abstract: Readers without solid background knowledge of French film and colonial history may have some difficulty navigating through Eades's tightly packed, allusive prose, especially since no index of any kind is provided. This absence is difficult to understand in a work of serious scholarship aimed at academic readers, as is the press's decision to invest in numerous glossy still‐frame illustrations that add nothing substantive to the analysis. However, the extensive, thematically organized filmographies and bibliographies that conclude the volume should prove very useful to all readers by providing a starting point for further reading and research.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: In providing clarification of previous works,
   Reflections on the Justis exceptionally helpful. Of particular interest in this volume is the paradoxical nature of authority—What is authority? How is it legitimated? Is it claimed or granted?—the existence of vulnerability and passivity within autonomy and initiative, and the relationship between moral ideals and historical manifestation, questions that exist more on the margins ofOneself as Another. Those interested in Ricoeur’s religious thought will find little of direct interest here. Those who see a deep connection between his moral philosophy and his philosophy of religion will find some confirmation, but there are other places where the connections are more explicitly manifest.Reflections on the Justis best approached as a companion volume to earlier philosophical works, certainlyThe Justbut perhaps more importantlyOneself as Another. As such, it holds an important place in Ricoeur’s oeuvre.<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: Franke’s book has considerable merit, but I have a theoretical and a practical concern with his appropriation of negative theology. First, negative theology is never entirely negative, and while Franke recognizes that poetic language is both deconstructive and open, he nevertheless insists that our various theologies—literary or religious—finally have no positive content. Perhaps this is the postmodernism in his negative theology because this is not entirely consistent with the theological tradition. A good counterexample is Pseudo‐Dionysius, whose mystical theology seeks finally to overcome the limitations of both positive and negative speaking. Dionysius insists that God is love in a way that is both negative and positive. On this, Franke should consider the work of Jean‐Luc Marion and especially his response to Jacques Derrida on the subject of negative theology, and this omission is a considerable oversight. Second, many people of various faiths will never accept that their understanding of the transcendent has no positive content, and if this is a precondition for dialogue, then it is unlikely to occur. On this, the practical dimension of Franke’s study needs more development, as well as more traditional examples of poetic and theological openness from contemporary religious life.<br>

Author(s): Landy Joshua<br>
Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Abstract: In sum, this is one of the most important books on selves or the practical side of personhood in the last decade. It is also well written; the particular arguments are virtually always clear, and it is not too hard to keep track of their role within in the larger argument of the book. Some portions rise to an almost literary style and provide a rich survey of key ideas in twentieth-century French philosophy, while others engage quite originally with scholarship in moral psychology and theories of self-knowledge that will be more familiar to analytic readers. This work also complements the more detailed ethical theory on Larmore’s other books. Despite its relative inattention to volitional aspects of practical identity, and some questionable moves in the critique of authenticity, then, this work is still highly recommended.<br>

Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
Abstract: The Captivity of Innocencesuccessfully concludes an innovative study of primeval myth in J’s Genesis. Its argument about exilic authorship serves as a springboard for a free and erudite exploration of biblical concerns with name, exile, and the paradoxes of divine-human relations. Very few biblical scholars today can compass this range of biblical, literary, and philosophical literature with such finesse. At a time when biblical studies incorporate a wider range of methods than ever, LaCocque, like Roland Barthes (whom he cites), powerfully combines traditional and more contemporary intellectual paradigms. Advanced students and scholars will find inThe Captivity of Innocencea far-reaching and engaging reading of Genesis 11 by a virtuoso of biblical studies.<br>

Constructivists acquainted with theory will likely find it less so.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: Closely related to the philosophical problem of consciousness of time was the question of the meaning of time and duration in psychology and in literature. Although Mooij mentions William James's notion of “specious present” in passing, he fails to explicate James's perception of time, which attempted to provide an empiricist account of our temporal concepts through the influence of John Locke (p. 197). Apart from this caveat, the book's strength lies in its perceptiveness and breadth of interpretation of the history of the concept of time. Mooij's accuracy in comprehending and in transmitting the essence of such difficult and complicated philosophies is remarkable.<br>

Abstract: The very centrality of its questions to literary studies may be the greatest handicap for
   Translating Investments.Words That Matter, especially in its recovery of grammatical theory, had more surprises page-for-page. Here the big ideas are perforce more familiar, the innovations more incremental. The reward, however, is a fine sense of metaphor as a cultural project across an especially broad range of terrain in early modern England. Anderson insists, and teaches us to insist, on the local, historical conditions of metaphor’s torpor and vitality, how writers thought about and went about killing and quickening the trope she calls “the scaffolding of human culture” (216).<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines the novel
         Cementerio de Papel[Paper Cemetery] (2002), a detective thriller about a murder that took place under the dome of the Archivo General de la Nación [National General Archive] (Lecumberri). The relocation and opening of the files of the former Dirección Federal de Seguridad [Federal Security Bureau] in the former prison comes along with the return of victims and victimizers, only now they come back as ghosts of things past. The novel works with the binomial jail/archive, featuring Lecumberri as a live space from which to begin a search for justice and truth, without sinking into melancholy or victimhood.<br>

Abstract: Walter Pater's theoretical "come-back" over the past forty years or so has been dominated by the competing claims of the new historicism and deconstruction, both of which discover prescient forerunners of their own, seemingly mutually exclusive, theoretical concerns in Pater's aesthetic criticism and in his historical novel Marius the Epicurean (1885). Yet despite their obvious differences, both critical approaches share one thing in common: the same post-humanist denigration of the trope of metaphor in favor of the seemingly more ethically responsive (because inclusive) trope of metonymy. In this essay I observe how the new historicism's and deconstruction's privilegings of metonymy as the prime trope of difference poses an immediate problem for ethical thought that, largely under the influence of Alain Badiou, has become increasingly cognizant of the need for a workable conception of sameness (or universality), traditionally supplied by metaphor. Accordingly, this close reading of the metaphorical dialectic of one of Pater's surprisingly underread Imaginary Portraits, "Sebastian van Storck" (1887), explores the basic charge against metaphor-namely, that it is an essentially "theological" trope insofar as it invariably pre-posits the "identity" that it modestly claims to have merely discovered. Employing the central figure of Sebastian's idealism- equation-I venture that, once rethought as a relation not of identity but of equivalence, metaphor is capable of shouldering the rhetorical burden of similarity without relinquishing its ethical claim as a primary producer of new differences in the world and is, hence, deserving of a central place in a post-deconstructive ethics.<br>

Abstract: Abstract: Vico's theory of metaphor is best understood as a monster in the tradition of classical rhetorical invention. It is the mutant offspring of metaphor characterized as "necessary" (an "ear" of com, for example) and metaphor characterized in terms of analogy. From the perspective of his method. Vico marries these apparently incompatible forms inherited from Aristotle and thereby identifies a third type of linguistic metaphor. I argue that the metaphor identifies a stipulatory definition taken out of context. In order to situate this claim, I outline Vico's genetic analysis and elaborate in general terms what metaphor and definition share. Most importantly. Vico insists that beings, actions, and events are linguistically identifiedin some particular diseursive context. Indeed, in many cases that context alone determines whether the expression can be called a definition or a metaphor. Like Cicero's ideal jurist, Vico's hero employs motivated words and realizes possibilities available to common sense. Henee Vico's theory of metaphor is both "constructivist"—language has the power to makes things—and "humartist"—it must do so in a form appropriate to history and culture. Vico's theory is consequently important to us because it challenges the proper/figurative distinction championed in the philosophy of language and adds a pragmatic dimension to contemporary views of metaphor at work in literary theory.<br>

Abstract: Postmodern theory is often seen as a realm either of totally free play--where anything goes and there are no rules at all--or of despair where all visions of equality and democracy are equated with totalitarianism. Coherent ways of talking about "actors" or "responsibility" can appear to be entirely repudiated. Further perceived as elitist, obscure, convoluted, and entirely removed from any kind of practical reality, postmodernism is often viewed as having nothing relevant to say to teachers or those interested in concretely improving education. This paper attempts to show that these visions are not entirely fair to the ways many "postmodern" theorists strive to explore carefully the myriad tensions invariably involved in politics and pedagogy or to the (perhaps surprising) egalitarian commitments that generally undergird their projects. Taking advantage of the fluid and ultimately undefinable character of the idea of the "postmodern," this paper draws from an eclectic group of thinkers, teasing out a range of different perspectives that might inform, complicate, and contest efforts to "teach freedom."<br>

Abstract: History, like a vast river, propels logs, vegetation, rafts, and debris; it is full of live and dead things, some destined for resurrection; it mingles many waters and holds in solution invisible substances stolen from distant soils. Anything may become part of it; that is why it can be an image of the continuity of mankind. And it is also why some of its freight turns up again in the social sciences: they were constructed out of the contents of history in the same way as houses in medieval Rome were made out of stones taken from the Coliseum. But the special sciences based on sorted facts cannot be mistaken for rivers flowing in time and full of persons and events. They are systems fashioned with concepts, numbers, and abstract relations. For history, the reward of eluding method is to escape abstraction. (Barzun 1974, 95)<br>

Abstract: This paper follows two purposes: the first to unpack some of the artistic cargo of symbols as distinct from the more conventional aspects of them (e. g., their ability to refer to other things or events, and their ability to communicate ideas), and the second to show, by means of contrasts, the actual workings of Interpretation Theory as it could be applied to the analysis of art-making and art-viewing. For the first purpose, the author draws material from philosophy, dramatic writings, linguistic theory, and statements of artists in an analytic search for the often intractable character of the artistic image. For the second purpose, the author demonstrates, through the use of logic and the poetic metaphor, how a particular form of hermeneutic inquiry can be applied to assist an understanding of the assumptions upon which research is often built.<br>

Abstract: In recent years, the need for a critique of "reader" as rigorous as that which has been developed for "text" and for "author" has become increasingly acute. Whether in the study of religion as story and biography or in interpretative reading in general, a critical notion of reader is essential if the act of reading is to be anything other than mere consumption of texts. Some new way of understanding the hermeneutical circle is required to avert the narcissism latent in the Anselmian model. The notion of "genre" as developed by four recent theorists is helpful in the task of constructing a critique of "reader." E. D. Hirsch, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Tzvetán Todorov, and Paul Ricoeur have each surpassed the idealist notion of genre as a classificatory device and developed in its place the notion of genre as a generative pinciple. Todorov, for example, illustrates how "form" is a theoretical, as distinct from a descriptive or explanatory, issue. According to both Hirsch and Todorov, somewhere between empirical details and metaphysical thematizations lie generic formulations which can assist the reader to organize his/her response to the text and to recognize the probable understanding toward which the conventions of the text are directed. In Gadamer's theory of interpretation, the notion of genre acquires historicity. After Gadamer, genres can no longer be regarded as timeless a priori categories. Rather, because they are constituted by historical reflections, their rise and decline are intrinsic to text-interpretation. Finally, in Ricoeur's theory that generic considerations are correlative principles of production and interpretation, we find a basis for understanding genre as praxis. If we understand reading to be isomorphic to authoring, it becomes clear that the reader can no longer be regarded as the self-evident recipient of text-signification. Genre, in Ricoeur's theory, transforms "speech" into a "work" and points toward a new notion of "reader" as one whose reconstruction of the text is the condition for the possibility of its being a story that "gives life." This notion of "reader" makes possible a new model of the hermeneutical circle-one which signifies the essential roles of critical thought which follows naive reading and of informed understanding which follows after thought.<br>

Abstract: The thesis of this paper is that an absolute origin of evil, arising from the free will of a creature, must be incomprehensible. Although Augustine occasionally acknowledges this point, nevertheless in a number of better-known passages (chiefly in The City of God) he attempts to give a causal account of the fall of Adam and/or Satan. Much of the subsequent Christian tradition has unfortunately followed his lead, and major recent commentators routinely ignore or passively approve of his conceptual error. Augustine offers three unacceptable explanations of the fall, which conflict variously with his own doctrines of divine omnipotence, the goodness of creation, and creaturely free will and responsibility, as well as violating the canons of sound argumentation and explanation. First, his contention that free creatures made "out of nothing" inevitably fall makes the fall seem ontologically necessary (unfree) and thereby lays the ultimate responsibility for it on the Creator. Second, the appeal to pride as an explanation is a spurious causal account, for "pride" is only a synonym for "fallenness" itself and not a possible antecedent condition in a being created good and not yet fallen. Finally, his assertion that the first sin is intrinsically comprehensible, but not comprehensible to us because we are fallen, is an obfuscation masquerading as an explanation, for we have no warrant for supposing that this assertion is true or even meaningful. Instead of seeking causal explanation Augustine should have stayed with his own wiser observation that an evil will has no efficient cause. Theology of the Augustinian sort (which comprises much of the Christian tradition) ought to concede that the fall as a work of genuine freedom is an absurd "fact," an incomprehensible given which steadfastly and in principle resists causal explanation. The concluding section of the paper draws upon Ricoeur's insights to tell why the narrative structure of the "Adamic myth" (which has important positive functions of its own) begets as an unfortunate byproduct this tendency to spin out a causal account of the first evil, with the conceptual confusion resulting from it.<br>

Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first meaning. This event, really never-ending, is a basic condition of life; it stimulates the spirit in a posture of perpetual emergence.<br>

Abstract: The first part of the essay explore's three features of Wolterstorff's account of God as a performer of speech acts: (1) the claim that God literally speaks, suggesting that this claim needs something like a Thomistic theory of analogy as an alternative to univocity and mere metaphor; (2) the claim that speaking is not reducible to revealing; and (3) the political implications of these claims, especially in relation to Habermasian theory. The second part focuses on the theory of double discourse, which seeks to make sense of the notion that God speaks to us through the human voices of prophets, apostles, and especially of Scripture, and seeks to show that a fuller account of the speech act by which God deputizes or appropriates human speech is needed. The final section suggests that Ricoeur and Derrida are not the threat to his theory that Wolterstorff takes them to be and that their emphasis on the text, rather than the author, makes sense in contexts where we have only the text to consult.<br>

Abstract: This essay takes up the claim made recently by Simon Critchley in The Companion to Continental Philosophy that a "feature common to many philosophers in the Continental tradition" is the "utopian demand that things be otherwise." The general question I pursue has to do with whether or not such a claim includes movements within Continental philosophy that do not self-identify with the utopian (like critical theory). The particular question has to do with whether or not the movement of phenomenology is utopian or does it, because of its other commitments, view the utopian as the antithesis to its orientation, which makes that claim that phenomenology is utopian seem strange. My thesis is that phenomenology can be seen as a utopian tradition but that some account must be given that demonstrates this connection to the utopian. In particular, I argue that Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology provides an understanding of the utopian, which I call a non-conventional view, that is vastly different from the one assumed by most when they see or hear the word "utopian," which I lable conventional. I show that such a non-conventional understanding can be developed in a way that neither requires us to view the utopian solely as opposed to finitude and contingency, nor a form of thought and action from which we necessarily need to dissociate ourselves. It is this non-conventional view of the utopian that in the end enables us to understand how Continental philosophy in general and phenomenology in particular are important bearers of the utopian demand that things be otherwise.<br>

It works entirely within that domain and does not rely on anything outside it." In this article I pursue the metatheoretical goal of obtaining insight into the anthropological assumptions that have remained so far unacknowledged by Rawls and critics alike. My argument is that political liberalism has a dependence on comprehensive liberalism and its conception of a self-serving subjectivity that is far more binding as well as undesirable than it has been so far acknowledged. I proceed with a heuristic approach that introduces us to the possibility that political liberalism presupposes tacitly the Occidental metanarrative of reason harnessing rampant self-interest and subordinating it to a higher-order interest. As the presuppositions of political liberalism emerge, I draw from the debate between Rawls and Habermas in order to illustrate my argument for the existence of a dependence on these presuppositions. I outline some implications of the anthropological basis of political liberalism and conclude by exemplifying them with reference to Rawls's comments on the division of a cake.<br>

Abstract: Academia's mathematical metaphysics are briefly explored en route to an elaboration of the qualitatively rigorous requirements underpinning the calibration and unambiguous interpretation of quantitative instrumentation in any science. Of particular interest are Gadamer's emphases on number as the paradigm of the noetic, on the role of play in interpretation, and on Hegel's sense of method as the activity of the thing itself that thought experiences. These point toward and overlap with (1) Latour's study of the metrological social networks through which technological phenomena are brought into language as modes of being that can be understood, and (2) the way that Rasch's models for measurement comprise a potential beginning for metaphysically astute, qualitatively and quantitatively integrated, mathematical methods in the social sciences. The paper closes with observations on the general problem that is philosophy, the need to remain open to multiplicities of meaning even as clear understandings are sought and obtained.<br>

Abstract: Perhaps the greatest challenge to an existential phenomenological account of perception is that posed by the argument from illusions. Recent developments in research on the behaviour of subjects suffering from illusions together with some seminal ideas found in Merleau-Ponty's writings enable us to develop and corroborate an account of the phenomenon of illusions, one, which unlike the empiricist account, does not undermine our conviction that in perception we "reach the things themselves". The traditional argument from illusions derives its force from an uncritical assumption that the process of experience takes place in time conceived as an infinite series of distinct moments. Once this assumption has been bracketed we are able to recognise the paradoxical truth that in the disillusion something can become that which it has always been and can cease to be that which it has never been. Furthermore, through a reflection on our experience of others overcoming their illusions, and on psychological evidence, we are able to show that there is nothing to suggest that this description of the disillusion is a description of a private or subjective event.<br>

Abstract: In his philosophy of nothingness, Kitarō Nishida illuminates the matrix of transformation of the world "from the Created to the Creating" (tsukuru mono kara tsukurareta mono e) through shintai, or the body. In this matrix, shintai enters into the stage of an action-sensation continuum and emerges as the immaculate iconic tool of nothingness to create new figures as extended self. This idea of shintai has resonance with the development of postwar art in Japan. The "Space of Transparency" put forth by Ufan Lee, the leader of Monoha, is the principal example. This essay investigates Nishida's notion of shintai and its influence on Lee's theory of art.<br>

Abstract: In Sumatra's Angkola Batak culture, rituals celebrating major kinship-related events such as marriage have many layers of social and symbolic meaning; they have political, kinship, musical, mythic, and philosophical dimensions as lengthy, oratory-filled ceremonies that unite wife-giving lineages with wife-receivers. This article examines several ways that the interpretive approach that is discussed in the introduction can help students of Indonesian ritual grasp diverse aspects of Batak marriage rituals such as their hidden symbolic organization and their practical political implications. The article deals with a short sequence of adat dance staged for anthropological research purposes. (Adat, once translated as customary law, roughly means Angkola ceremonial life, kinship norms, and political thought; adat is eminently flexible, redefined by each Batak generation.) The choreography of the dance (wife-receivers dancing with wife-givers), songs, clothing, the political biographies of the participants, and the fact that the event was staged render the ceremony open to both structural and social contextual inquiry.<br>

Abstract: Chile's collective memory has been brutalized by state-implemented terrorism. This historical process has resulted in, among other things, a "torn collective memory." The history and memory of the period of so-called popular power (1970-1973) continue to be largely unknown. Oral history allows us to begin a slow process of historical reconstruction as well as to reflect on the construction of militant memories.<br>

Abstract: Children, who are composers of meaning rather than merely handlers of art materials, proceed by strategies of generative praxis that include fictive play and autobiography and involve judgment that is critically reflective and imagination that is productive. The view of things that leads an art teacher to believe that a child is making meaningful art is one in which a child's judgment is a sign, or even a criterion of thoughtful involvement. When this reflective judgment is manifested, you see that a child is guided by an inner critic of their work, and the claim that "Michael is making art" says it all. As I interpreted the long self-sustained efforts of children composing artist books, I became most aware of the way in which children's desire to represent their stories merged with drawing and a developing schema in the same way lived experience and metaphor interchange and generate each other. This interchange is the living ground of the inner critic in children's meaningful art.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mankind: The discovery of the unreality of man's existence apart from God, is the discovery at the same time of the fact that God is the ultimate ground of the unity of mankind. According to Jaspers the fact of life are to conform to the principle of that wider order of reality disclosed to us in the experience of communication in which the reality of each person's likeness to the image of God finds its practical application. The development of communication depends on the principle of correlation of Existenz and Transcendenz which is the property of no finite existential self, but manifests itself alike in all. Though we may be confronted with the question "Is it God or the devil who governs the world?", it remains equally true that even "failure is no argument against the truth that is rooted in transcendence". 3) Ultimate Dignity of Man: Jaspers' unequivocal emphasis on freedom, stating that "Freedom and God are inseparable" serves to assure this ideal its place in human society. Thus man's exercise of freedom knits him up into the transcendental design. The claim that certain facts and experiences yield a basis for the recognition of the ultimate dignity of man is justified precisely by this evidence that through God, as inseparable from freedom, we discern the ultimate significance of both man and humanity.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in confusing motives with causes; irrationalism, which advocates a "liberté d'indifférence", basing itself on the same premise as rationalism, and confusing motives with causes, is wrong in seeing the negation of the very existence of motives as the one way of saving human freedom. Both views disregard the fact that human action is impossible and cannot be understood without motives and that this, in turn, does not mean a determination of man in a mechanical way, for motives are not a part of nature but rather an organic element in a specific human situation—voluntary action. Human freedom is the freedom peculiar to a finite being immersed in time. Both those who stress passivity and receptivity and those who stress the dynamic creating ability of the self are wrong; both those who thought that freedom is possible only on the basis of clear and distinct motives and that action is nothing but the end of deliberation (St. Thomas) and those who thought that freedom is possible only by an irrational emergence of the vital ego (Bergson) or by negating the existence of any previous determination of the self (Sartre) are mistaken. A true human decision is composed of two elements; given motives and values on the one hand, and non-intellectualist spontaneous choice on the other. Duality is peculiar to human action. This is made more explicit in dealing with the more fundamental involuntary elements; character, sub-consciousness and life. Man acts freely from a finite and determined point of view; he acts in a clear and transparent way on the basis of confused and amorphous data; he lives his freedom when thrown into life. Necessity is inherent in man; it is one of his modes of being. There is no "inner freedom" on the one hand and "objective" causal necessity on the other. This conception of human action as both activity and passivity is reminiscent of Merleau-Ponty's statement in his "Philosophie du perception": "Le monde est déjá constitué, mais aussi jamais complètement constitué.... Il n'y a donc jamais déterminisme et jamais choix absolu, jamais je ne suis chose et jamais conscience nue". There is no dilemna between determinism and irrationalism, just as there is none between extended substance and thinking substance; there is dialogue.<br>

Abstract: This article breaks the poetic code in Agnon's A Guest for a Night by deciphering its system of lexical and semantic signs, which link this novel with the Talmud in numerous ways. The article reaches two conclusions: (1) Agnon did more than integrate traditional motifs and stories in this novel — he used agadic and halachic material to relink Modern Hebrew literature with the Talmud. (2) This novel is nothing less than an old-new key to the Talmud which Agnon wrought by blending its language and that of Modern Hebrew literature into a new style.<br>

Abstract: CONTEMPORARY HUMANITARIAN CRISES UNDERSCORE WHAT HANNAH Arendt called the "perplexities" of human rights; the very category "refugee" attests the failure of the global rights regime. Indeed, the "abstract nakedness of being nothing but human" belies the "right to have rights." In light of this criticism, I offer a reconstructive, communitarian interpretation of the rights of the forcibly displaced. The grammar of rights, I argue, presumes the communicative virtues of respect and recognition of the "concrete other." I conclude by showing how biblical narrative "re-inscribes" stateless persons/strangers precisely as neighbor (Lev. 19:18, 33—34) in "anamnestic solidarity."<br>

Abstract: We can distinguish two different kinds in the educational process, the one called «learning education» and the one leading to a possible «autonomous education» in which every-body's freedom is above everything else. The former is education for technoscientists. The later, the «autonomous education» is supported by the thesis that knowing oneself as «moriturus», forces one to provide a sense or meaning, technologies and educational sciencies not being enough. Death forces us to decide the possible, only opposed by the impossible.<br>

Abstract: Many contemporary liberals increasingly accept that plural societies must aspire to far more expansive and inclusive ideals of justice and citizenship than liberal doctrine would suggest. The dominant perception is that extending the set of rights is the most effective way to implement a just and stable multicultural society. In fact, this is not a very plausible description of what people seek in demanding greater respect for diversity. Nor does it offer a compelling vision of how things ought to be. First, social expectations regarding recognition are not uniquely linked to rights; they encompass intractable struggles over values, as well as ways of living and evaluating. For example, a central feature of feminist, black and multicultural politics is the attempt to change social culture into a medium through which personal integrity and self-esteem may be acquired. Second, liberalism cannot easily accommodate this type of struggle, since it takes for granted a narrowly constricted conception of politics that is based on instituting public laws that harmonize the freedom of everyone. Anyone who takes seriously the idea that recognition surpasses legal relations of respect will then surely wish to consider whether liberalism must not be corrected and extended to reveal the political significance of the social conditions that enable individuals to experience themselves as both autonomous and individuated.<br>

Abstract: This article argues that the concept of 'identity' is of limited heuristic value and proposes that it may instead be more useful to deploy the notion of narratives of location and positionality for addressing the range of issues normally thought to be about collective identity. Location and positionality (and translocational positionality) are more useful concepts for investigating processes and outcomes of collective identification — that is, the claims and attributions that individuals make about their position in the social order of things, their views of where and to what they belong (and to what they do not belong) as well as an understanding of the broader social relations that constitute and are constituted in this process. This enables a complete abandonment of the residual elements of essentialization retained even within the idea of fragmented and multiple identities so favoured by critics of unitary notions of identity. The article will draw on research into the ways in which experiences of 'race' and ethnicity were articulated in the narrations produced by British-born youngsters of Greek Cypriot background.<br>

Abstract: In this article, Levinas' ethical metaphysics is analyzed and his contribution to present-day philosophy is described. In his philosophy, ethics is not something that originates in the autonomous will, as Kant would have premised. It is, rather, the result of the traumatic rupturing of the I by the Other, a heteronomous event. The I's passivity in being opened by the Other is highlighted by Levinas in the words "substitution," "obsession," and "being elected." The I, in the critical Others' eyes, is guilty. The infinity in the Other's demand, regarding the I, is divine. It would be a fatal misunderstanding of Levinas to think that, with the insertion of the word "God," he becomes a theologian. In this article the relation between ethics and politics is discussed and their relation to God is pointed to. In this way, Levinas' discourse on God is demonstrated as being fitting for our time, after the crisis of humanism during the Holocaust. In the course of the article, the question of whether there "is" a God in the eyes of Levinas, and if man "needs" Him is answered. In other words, the logical status of the word "God" in Levinas' philosophy is defined.<br>

Abstract: The notion of text acquires a fundamental epistemological role in the disciplines of language in the second half of the XXth century. The analysis of some linguistic objects we have called semiological tools could highlight some epistemological issues in the use of the term text. From the Sixties we can observe that text has progressively acquired the general status of an object of analysis. Nevertheless, if linguistic text proves to be a common object of analysis for semiotics and hermeneutics, then it is necessary to reconsider their epistemological relations, to understand something new about what text is. Considering the interpretative problem in the hjelmslevian epistemology, a new perspective emerges between these complementary approaches to text. Comparing semiotics and hermeneutics we can also question the epistemological role that the notion of text embodies among contemporary disciplines of language.<br>

Abstract: In this essay, I argue that Penelope Fitzgerald's The Gate of Angels attempts to work out the difficulties that any intelligent, religiously inclined person must come to terms with in the twentieth, now twentieth-first, century. Fitzgerald sought not to shelter her religious belief behind a cloister wall, thinking like her uncle the Reverend Wilfred Knox, "that no cloister walls can be high enough to exclude the cares of the world." Among these cares is the desire to give a faithful report of the world to each other, to know this world as it exists in truth, and not to misrepresent it. Early twentieth-century investigations into the makeup of the physical world as well as the theoretical and intellectual advances possible with quantum physics were very much part of this desire; and in The Gate of Angels, set in and around Cambridge University's pre-war physics laboratories, Fitzgerald offers a beautiful rendering of the excitement engendered by these investigations. At the same time, Fitzgerald offers a picture, true to her own experience, wherein things that in the popular mind are often conceived of as opposite and irreconcilable—for instance, chance and necessity—are found to stand in a relation of sympathy, casting over The Gate of Angels "that sympathetic glow which," Henry James wrote, "forms half the substance of our genial impressions."<br>

Abstract: This forum gathers together a set of essays composed in response to the 2011 special issue of Religion & Literature 42.1–2, titled "Something Fearful": Medievalist Scholars on the "Religious Turn" in Literary Criticism, edited by Kathryn Kerby-Fulton and Jonathan Juilfs. The forum's ten authors reflect both on essays within the original volume and on the broader questions engaged by it and through its very publication; responsive remarks from Kathryn Kerby-Fulton and two contributors to that initiating volume conclude the conversation. Through conversation, response, and critical engagement, the forum's contributors weigh questions of the language of belief in scholarly discourse, of the continuities of religious practice across history, of the assumptions and beliefs undergirding critical work on religion and literature and culture, and of the acknowledgement of the religious convictions of medievalists' scholarly subjects, scholars, and the communities of both.<br>

Abstract: Having a voice, either at the level of the individual or the community, has been one of the atavistic ways of defining or asserting humanity. This allows for the inscription of the twin-capped hegemony of successes or victories and frustrations at both the private locus and the public sphere. The disruptions of this possibility by rifts between natives in pre-colonial South Africa were aggravated in the heat of the colonial suppression it suffered, and was compounded by the operation of apartheid rule. By reason of this misrule, voices were suppressed, with a few cacophonies of dissention breaking forth. The culmination of these disenchantments into the demise of apartheid significantly presaged the need for reconstruction and redefinition of citizenship and cohabitation, and hence the necessity for establishing a public sphere, or put alternatively, a public domain in the form of the Archbishop Desmond Tutu's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This paper, therefore, seeks to interrogate the dramatic world(s) created using the material properties of the TRC in John Kani's Nothing but the Truth and Zakes Mda's The Bells of Amersfoort. The paper argues that the domination and manipulation of this public realm by the state at the expense of the individual is not only counterproductive, but constitutes a denial of the relevance of such spheres. The paper, going by indices in the plays, therefore, concludes that every individual should not only be: given a voice, and be heard, but be allowed equal unbiased participation. Otherwise, the public sphere would not just be impotent, but the idea of nation-building and desirable citizenship would be a mere ruse. Avoir une voix, que ce soit au niveau individuel ou communautaire, a été l'un des moyens ataviques de définition et d'affirmation de l'humanité. Cela tient compte de l'inscription de l'hégémonie à double face des succés ou victoires et des frustrations tant au niveau de l'espace privé que de la sphère publique. Les parturbations de cette possibilité par des clivages entre les autochtones en Afrique du Sud précoloniale ont empiré sous le feu de la répression coloniale que ce pays a subie et ont été aggravées par le régime d'apartheid. En raison de cette mauvaise administration, des voix ont été réprimées, avec quelques cacophonies de dissension. Le paroxysme de ces désenchantements vers la fin de l'apartheid présageait significativement la nécessité de la reconstruction et la redéfinition de la citoyenneté et de la cohabitation, et donc la nécessité d'établir une sphère publique, ou sinon établir un domaine public, sous la forme de la Commission vérité et réconciliation de l'archevêque Desmond Tutu. Cet article vise donc à examiner le (s) monde (s) dramatique (s) créé (s) à l'aide des propriétés matérielles du TRC dans Nothing but the Truth de John Kani et The Bells of Amersfoort de Zakes Mda. L'article soutient que la domination et la manipulation de ce domaine public par l'État au détriment de l'individu n'est pas seulement nuisible, mais constitue un rejet de la pertinence de telles sphères. Cet article, en parcourant les indexes de ces pièces, conclut donc que tout individu doit non seulement avoir une voix et être entendu, mais aussi jouir de son droit à une participation égale impartiale. Sinon, la sphère publique ne serait impuissante et l'idée de construction de la nation et de la citoyenneté souhaitable ne serait rien d'autre qu'un simple stratagème.<br>

Abstract: The basic unit of Joyce's fiction is, arguably, the encounter, a reminder of the Dubliners story of that name. This essay explores the many occasions of self-encounter, as when Joyce's characters see themselves in mirrors, in the eyes of others, or in the guise of someone other than they are or appear to be: when Gerty MacDowell projects her "Lady Bountiful" self onto Bloom's erotic gaze, for instance. The regulating idea here (as in Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception) is that we perceive ourselves through our bodies, but this perception is not an empirical mirror-image; it is an image mediated (and thus transformed) by an array of intentions, memories, desires, and ongoing experiences of ourselves and others, including our experiences of how others see us (something to which Stephen is particularly subject). Joyce's mirror-experiences range from ironic unmasking—"The Dead"—to phantasmagorias—the "Circe" episode of Ulysses, where no image is unreal, and every misnomer (like "Henry Flower") has its moment of truth.<br>

Abstract: What is eco-phenomenology? This paper argues that eco-phenomenology, in which are folded both an ecological phenomenology and a phenomenological ecology, offers us a way of developing a middle ground between phenomenology and naturalism, between intentionality and causality. Our grasp of Nature is significantly altered by thinking through four strands of time's plexity — the invisibility of time, the celebration of finitude, the coordination of rhythms, and the interruption and breakdown of temporal horizons. It is also transformed by a meditation on the role of boundaries in constituting the varieties of thinghood. Eco-phenomenology takes up in a tentative and exploratory way the traditional phenomenological claim to be able to legislate for the sciences, or at least to think across the boundaries that seem to divide them. In this way, it opens up and develops an access to Nature and the natural, one which is independent both of the conceptuality of the natural sciences and of traditional metaphysics.<br>

Abstract: Ernst Troeltsch distinguished between naive, apologetic and evolutionistic absoluteness.
From the original spontaneity of 'naive absoluteness' and its artificial (partly super-
naturalistic, partly rationalistic) defence as 'apologetic absoluteness' (in the Middle Ages and
in the Enlightenment, respectively) there came forth in Hegel the idea of 'evolutionistic
absoluteness' — an ingenious but untenable attempt to reconcile the solid apologetic
conception of absoluteness of that day with the dynamics of history by presenting it as the
outcome and terminus of historical progression. See Troeltsch, Die Absolutheit des Christen-
tums, 87ff. Cf. J. Klapwijk, Tussen historisme en relativisme, 222-29. At present the belief in
progress and thus also the mix of it with the idea of absoluteness is no longer a subject of
discussion.<br>

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-
versed version of the structural features of evil. Resolving the evil I do toward the other re-
quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: In From Beast to the Blonde, Marina Warner studies the status of fairy tales as historical documents which
give an account of women's daily experiences, as they illustrate their particular rites of passage and the relevance
of maternal figures in their lives. The resonance of Mother Goose is taken by Warner "either as a historical source,
or a fantasy of origin" which she can trace into ancient traditions, like the Islamic or the Christian, and which
adds credibility to the stories (1994, xxiii).<br>

Abstract: The onset of dementia raises troubling questions. Does the person with dementia still recognize you? If someone cannot recognize you, can they still care about you? This essay takes such questions as the entry point for a broader inquiry into recognition, its linkages to care, and how claims to social and political "recognition" are linked to, or premised on, the demonstrated capacity to "recognize" people and things. In the words and actions of her severely impaired mother, the author finds guidance toward a better, more compassionate question to ask about dementia: how can we best strive to "keep the cares together"?<br>

Abstract: Agamben on the function of the pronoun in medieval grammatical thought:
"Inasmuch as it contains both a particular mode of signification and an indicative act, the
pronoun is that part of speech in which the passage from signifying to demonstrating is
enacted: pure being, the substantia indeterminata that it signifies and that, as such, is not in
itself signifiable or definable, becomes signifiable and determinable through an act of 'indi-
cation'" (31/22).<br>

Abstract: This essay examines how activists in rural southern India have sought to reshape the field of political communication by encouraging lower-caste women to submit written, signed petitions to district-level government offices, and so represent themselves to the state. I argue that contradictions between democratic recognition and the will to development that inhere to the political structure of contemporary governance in rural India correspond to tensions within the semiotic structure of signature itself, between constative representation and performative creation. Governmentality and the forms of communication that it requires often rest on the notion that written self-representation constitutes an act of political agency. But the limits of a governmental communicative reason that would conflate written subject and agent become especially clear in postcolonial contexts where the construction of those citizens that would be represented is in fact a product of the very act of representation. It is the narrative of development-as-pedagogy that holds out the promise of a future alignment of communicative frameworks, technologies, and participant roles, allowing for the transparent self-representation of an already-constituted citizen. By tracking the ambivalent experience of one group of women in particular, this account focuses on how the logic of signature as self-representation has served to recontextualize the marginality of petitioners as something within the state's broader field of power.<br>

Abstract: How places are made is at the core of human geography. Overwhelmingly the discipline has emphasized the economic and material forces at work. Neglected is the explicit recognition of the crucial role of language, even though without speech humans cannot even begin to formulate ideas, discuss them, and translate them into action that culminates in a built place. Moreover, words alone, used in an appropriate situation, can have the power to render objects, formerly invisible because unattended, visible, and impart to them a certain character: thus a mere rise on a flat surface becomes something far more-a place that promises to open up to other places-when it is named "Mount Prospect." The different ways by which language contributes toward the making of place may be shown by exploring a wide range of situations and cultural contexts. Included in this paper are the contexts of hunter-gatherers, explorers and pioneers, intimate friendship, literary London, Europe in relation to Asia, and Chinese gardening and landscape art. There is a moral dimension to speech as there is to physical action. Thus warm conversation between friends can make the place itself seem warm; by contrast, malicious speech has the power to destroy a place's reputation and thereby its visibility. In the narrative-descriptive approach, the question of how and why language is effective is implied or informally woven into the presentation, but not explicitly formulated or developed. Ways of making place in different situations-from the naming of objects by pioneers, to informal conversation in any home, to the impact of written texts-are highlighted and constitute the paper's principal purpose, rather than causal explanations, which must vary with each type of linguistic behavior and each situation.<br>

Author(s): Nielsen Richard P.<br>
Abstract: In this updated and revised version of his 2008 Society for Business Ethics presidential address, Richard Nielsen documents the characteristics and extent of the 2007–2009 economic crisis and analyzes how the ethics issues of the economic crisis are structurally related to a relatively new form of capitalism, high-leverage finance capitalism. Four types of high-leverage finance capitalism are considered: hedge funds; private equity-leveraged buyouts; high-leverage, subprime mortgage banking; and high-leverage banking. The structurally related problems with the four types of high-leverage finance capitalism converged in something of a perfect economic storm. Explanations for the crisis are offered in the context of the type of the high-leverage finance capitalism system that permitted and facilitated the economic crisis. Ethics issues and potential reforms are considered that may be able to mitigate the destructive effects of what Schumpeter referred to as the "creative destructive" effects of evolutionary forms of capitalism while realizing the Aristotelian economic ideal of creating wealth in such a way as to make us better people and the world a better place.<br>

Abstract: This article highlights two features of Qur'anic style and content: duality/opposition and typological figuration, which can be seen as providing a continuous and consistent 'narrative stream' through the Qur'an. It is of some interest that both of these features have been singled out as distinctive of apocalypse as a genre in the study of numerous religious and cultural traditions. As debate on whether or not the Qur'an is a bona fide example of apocalyptic literature quietly continues, the interplay of conceptual and substantive oppositions and dualities is discussed in order to highlight the importance of this prominent feature to both the form and contents of the Book. It is suggested that its function is profoundly related to the typological figuration indispensable to the Qur'anic depiction of, for example, the character of the prophets and therefore prophethood. Whether or not this represents a genuine instance of apocalyptic literature, it nonetheless remains that the prominence of the motif renders the Qur'an susceptible of a reading expressive of something called an apocalyptic imagination. It is hoped that this article succeeds in demonstrating that in fact these apparently familiar subjects are stimulated to new life by considering them as defining, interlocking, structural elements of a distinctive Islamic apocalypse. ‮تبرز هذه الدراسة خاصيتين لأسلوب القرآن ومادته: الثنائية/التقابل وتصنيف النماذج مما قد ينظر إليه على أنه يمثل تيارا مستمرا ثابتا في القرآن. ومن اللافت للنظر أنه قد جرى الترکيز على هاتين الخاصيتين على أنهما يختصان بالحديث عن أحوال الآخرة في کثير من الأديان والتقاليد الثقافية. وفي هذا المقال سندرس التفاعل بين الثنائية والتقابل لکي نبرز الأهمية الأساسية لهذه الخاصية بالنسبة لشکل القرآن ومحتواه. فنحن نرى أن وظيفتها تمت بقوة إلى ظاهرة تصنيف الأنواع في تصوير القرآن لشخصيات الأنبياء ثم النبوة نفسها. والأمل أن ينجح هذا المقال في التدليل على أن هذه الموضوعات المألوفة يمکن رؤيتها على أنها نمط إسلامي فريد في الحديث عن الأخرويات.‬<br>

Abstract: Twelve years after the genocide, nothing has been forgotten in Rwanda. The country resembles a multiplicity of experiences, words and silences. The aim of the article is to reflect on the representations – or absence of representations – of the past. The approach is based on the ambivalence of any reference to the past. It is not a question of making a judgement in the abstract about the more or less legitimate character of the attitudes observed, but to understand the dynamics at work. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first part recalls the specific aspects of the case under study. The second examines the silences that weigh upon Rwandan society. The third notes the main accounts of the past.<br>

Abstract: Dans cette perspective, toute pratique de lecture
peut être décrite comme un mouvement en trois temps :
«avant lire »/«lire »/«après lire». Des «intérêts
à la lecture » qui trouvent leur origine dans la situation
du lecteur - « avant lire » - incitent à un « faire » - « lire » -
qui porte à conséquences, immédiates ou différées
- «après lire» - et qui consolident en retour les «intérêts
à la lecture ». L'accent mis classiquement sur la seconde
phase (« lire ») - qui est aussi la plus difficilement
accessible à l'enquête - est alors déplacé sur les deux autres.<br>

Author(s): Boyd K. M.<br>
Abstract: Medical ethics, principles, persons, and perspectives is discussed under three headings: "History", "Theory", and "Practice". Under "Theory", the author will say something about some different approaches to the study and discussion of ethical issues in medicine–especially those based on principles, persons, or perspectives. Under "Practice", the author will discuss how one perspectives based approach, hermeneutics, might help in relation first to everyday ethical issues and then to public controversies. In that context some possible advantages of moving from controversy to conversation will be explored; and that will then be illustrated with reference to a current controversy about the use of human embryos in stem cell therapy research. The paper begins with history, and it begins in the author's home city of Edinburgh.<br>

Abstract: This essay deals with the relation between magic and the nature of words and things. On the one hand, it considers the ways that words confine and direct thought and desire; on the other hand it deals with how the undeniable essence of things provides both limits and reasons for the ways we think. Drawing on these properties of words and objects, magic can be appreciated as a creative and innovative feature of thinking more complex than earlier writers have claimed.<br>

Abstract: There is a curious tendency, particularly marked in American cultural anthropology, to combine elements of the post-modernist programme with a radical political engagement. Though insisting that nothing can be known for certain, and certainly that ethnographers have no independent authority, some argue that nevertheless authentic - and preferredm - native voices may be identified, articulating the genuine sentiments and aspirations of a people. This premiss opens the way for an obvious challenge: if it is true, then only the native can speak for the native. The foreign ethnographer would then be merely an interpreter, a medium. As the study of ethnicity moves to the centre of the anthropological agenda, these assumptions must be urgently questioned. That requires a reassessment of the nature and purpose of ethnography.<br>

Abstract: The article resituates Ricur's theory of métaphore vive in the contemporary context of the so-called "cognitive revolution." The latter denomination is highly misleading. There is nothing revolutionary about the cognitivist study of metaphor as a general pattern of thought; just like the discipline of rhetoric that was already on the decline in l8th century Europe, it is conservative in its validation of everyday, ideologically charged language as the model for all language, including that of poetry and art. Riceur’s conception of "live metaphor," on the other hand, does justice to the "revolutionary" character of poetic language, its function of breaking the order of "commonplaces we live by"—and are ruled by. A "poem in miniature," metaphor constitutes the model for any "poietic," creative imagination. Resulting from a clash, disturbing the common everyday language, live metaphor (and poetry in general) projects a world in such a way as to render strange and thus question the world we live in.<br>

Abstract: In his book, Art and agency, Alfred Gell presents a theory of art based neither on aesthetics nor on visual communication. Art is defined by the distinctive function it performs in advancing social relationships through 'the abduction of agency'. Art objects are indexes of the artist's or model's agency. This article examines Gell's use of agency, particularly in relation to the ritual art that is central to his argument. Focusing on Gell's employment of Peirce's term 'index' (out of his triad of index, icon, and symbol), I note that Peirce's approach deflects attention from signification towards the link between art works and the things to which they refer. I consider what Peirce meant by abduction, and conclude that while Gell makes a good case for the agency of art objects he does not explain the distinctive ways in which art objects extend their maker's or user's agency. Gell lacked the time to make detailed revisions before publication and I acknowledge that, given more time, he might have revised some parts of the book. / Dans son livre Art and Agency, Alfred Gell présente une théorie de l'art qui ne se base ni sur l'esthétique, ni sur la communication visuelle. Il définit l'art par sa fonction distinctive dans l'établissement de relations sociales, par «l'abduction de l'intentionnalité (agency)». Les objets d'art sont des index de l'intentionnalité de l'artiste ou du modèle. Le présent article analyse l'utilisation par Gell de l'intentionnalité, notamment dans le cadre de l'art rituel qui constitue un axe central de son raisonnement. En se concentrant sur l'usage par Gell du terme «index» de Peirce (dans la trichotomie index, icône, symbole), l'auteur note que l'approche de Peirce prête moins d'attention à la signification qu'au lien entre les œuvres d'art et les objets auxquels elles font référence. Il examine ce que Peirce entendait par «abduction» et en conclut que si Gell s'en tire bien sur l'intentionnalité des objets d'art, il n'explique pas de quelle manière distinctive ceux-ci prolongent l'intentionnalité de leur créateur ou de leur utilisateur. Gell n'a pas eu le temps d'apporter des révisions détaillées à son ouvrage avant publication, et l'auteur estime que s'il avait eu davantage de temps, il en aurait peut-être remanié certaines parties.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I develop a phenomenology of falling ill by presenting, interpreting and developing the basic model we find in Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1956). The three steps identified by Sartre in this process are analysed, developed further and brought to a five- step model: (1) pre-reflective experience of discomfort, (2) lived, bodily discomfort, (3) suffered illness, (4) disease pondering, and (5) disease state. To fall ill is to fall victim to a gradual process of alienation, and with each step this alienating process is taken to a new qualitative level. Consequently, the five steps of falling ill have not only a contingent chronological order but also a kind of logical order, in that they typically presuppose each other. I adopt Sartre's focus on embodiment as the core ground of the alienation process, but point out that the alienation of the body in illness is not only the experience of a psychic object, but an experience of the independent life of one's own body. This facticity of the body is the result neither of the gaze of the other person, nor of a reflection adopting the outer perspective of the other in an indirect way, but is a result of the very otherness of one's own body, which addresses and plagues us when we fall ill. I use examples of falling ill and being a patient to show how a phenomenology of falling ill can be helpful in educating health-care personnel (and perhaps also patients) about the ways of the lived body.<br>

Abstract: Although philosophers often focus on the essays of Leopold's Sand County Almanac, especially "The Land Ethic," there is also a normative argument present in the stories that comprise most of the book. In fact the shack stories may be more persuasive, with a subtlety and complexity not available in his prose piece. This paper develops a narrative ethics methodology gleaned from rhetoric theory, and current interest in narrative ethics among literary theorists, in order to discern the normative underpinnings of the stories in Part 1. The narrative ethics approach sidesteps the need to ground the land ethic in ethical theory—which has been a reconstructive and problematic task for the philosophical interpreters of Leopold—and suggests, instead, that it emerges in Leopold's very effort to narrate his, professional, personal, and practical experience with nature. The involves examining the stories in terms of their emotional, logical and performative aspects. The result is an analysis that shows not only how these stories express normative claims, but also justify them. One conclusion of the analyses is that, in the narratives, there is less emphasis on the problematic notion of an over-arching "community" than in the prose pieces, and more emphasis on the metaphor of other living things as "fellow travelers" in the "odyssey of evolution." Second, the narratives take on an ironic attitude toward the ecological order, less discernable in the prose essays. The order itself may not be ethically admirable, but should be preserved since it makes possible any ethical relations within it. Thus, the narrative reading suggests some temperance to the usual holistic interpretation of his land ethic and its concomitant criticisms especially the charge of ecofacism. We should not take the land ethic imperative at its face value, in the sense that the good of the order itself is an intrinsic good. In the narratives, individuals are shown not merely to be means to the ecological whole, but the focus of sympathy and concern, in a manner that demands their good should also be an object of moral consideration.<br>

Abstract: African American quiltmaking began to gain recognition as an expressive form distinct from European American quiltmaking in the countercultural climate of the 1970s. Representations of it since then have served to update the Eurocentric, patriotic image of quiltmaking in the United States with components ofmulticulturalism and cultural critique. These representations in turn caused tensions along the lines of class, race, gender, and scholarly discipline. This study shows the power of words and things when used together, as in museum exhibits, to affirm or challenge the existing social order.<br>

Abstract: The social production of the space appears like creation when elements are demonstrated that originate social relations and that are transformed as well by these relations. The purpose of the present text is to make a series of observations on some of the theoretical dimensions that approach the phenomenon of the territory and the memory through it temporary space in a vision that leaves from the geographic thing for the interdisciplinary thing. La producción social del espacio se presenta como creación cuando se evidencian elementos que originan relaciones sociales y que a su vez son transformados por estas relaciones. La finalidad del presente texto es hacer una serie de observaciones sobre algunas de las dimensiones teóricas que se acercan al fenómeno del territorio y la memoria a través de lo espacio temporal en una visión que parte de lo geográfico a lo interdisciplinar.<br>

Abstract: L'alternance entre les trois pôles de la formation (auto-hétéro-oïko) présente dans les pratiques de formation alternée (variété des situations d'apprentissage et des acteurs) renvoie à la différenciation des trois personnes pronominales (je-tu-il) du langage courant et s'inscrit dans l'épistémologie ternaire de la sémiotique initiée par Peirce. L'intelligence pratique et rusée (la métis des Grecs), repérée chez des artisans grâce à l'expression régionale « le biais du gars », met en scène une logique ouverte où transduction et abduction s'articulent à déduction et induction. Une « raison expérientielle » , dialogique, écologique, à visée éthique, est ainsi forgée. C'est une rationalité pratique cherchant à actualiser le potentiel de la situation. Elle est empreinte de sagesse et de « prudence » en action, au sens d'Aristote (phronésis). L'éc(h)oformation qui émerge de cette raison expérientielle, de ce regard interactionnel, est indissociable de la boucle étrange entre deux autres raisons : la raison sensible et la raison formelle, entre spontanéité et habitude. The tripolar concept of training (auto-hetero-oïko), foundation of alternating courses practice (with multiple learning situations and actors), draws us back to the differenciation between the three main persons singular (I, You, He) expressed in common language as the compound epistemology of semiotics put forward by Peirce... Practical intelligence (close to the "metis" of the Greeks) can be noticed among craftsmen when they refer to the "biais du gars" bespeaking an open logic where transduction and abduction are linked to deduction and induction. A constructive reasoning, interactive ans ecological, with ethical objectives, is created. It's a practical rationality aiming at actualizing the potentiality of the situation and marked by sagaciy and prudence in action in the Aristotelian sense (phronesis). The "ec(h)otraining" emerging from the wisdom of experience, this interactive vision of things is necessarily included in the chain linking two other thoughts : the intuitive thought and the formal thought, between spontaneity and habit.<br>

Abstract: Richard Rorty uses Nietzsche to show that people need to create themselves because there is no foundationalist language which they can establish as an anchor. Although this perspective is Nietzschean, it is not Jamesian, and so Rorty misappropriates James when he conflates James and Nietzsche as like-minded progenitors of the mythologizing of a privileged vocabulary. This essay evaluates Rorty's reading of James by considering whether truth in Rorty's textualist sense can abide by the stream of thought. Although James does mythologize privileged vocabularies, he believes that words need to reflect the world more accurately (something Rorty would never say) by abiding by the flux of experience. As such, James recognizes the value that old words have as tools. Whereas Rorty shows disdain for old words, James shows us the cash value those words have in helping us to do anything from paying our bills to constructing more practical and effective theories.<br>

Abstract: The Play About the Baby remains neglected by interpreters of Albee's work because its austerely schematic mode of presentation seems to keeps everything on the surface, making acts of interpretation seem superfluous. Therefore, rather than trying to interpret the play, it is more useful to ask, following the suggestion of Gilles Deleuze, what it does. The play is a dramamachine that produces loss and asserts the centrality of loss to the constitution of selfhood. This loss is achieved by the deployment of perversion, both sexual and linguistic, against Boy and Girl's innocence. The use of perversion ultimately even questions whether there was ever any state of presence that preceded loss. These tactics seem to suggest a wider set of sexual possibilities, but the tactics are ultimately subordinated to the production of melancholia though loss, a subordination that traps the work in a world of severely limited possibilities and encounters.<br>

Abstract: This paper seeks to outline and evaluate Pierre Bourdieu's work as it has appeared most recently in feminist studies and the field of gender and education. In particular, it suggests ways in which Bourdieu's theoretical insights could be seen to more effectively contribute to cutting edge debates in both social theory and feminist thought regarding concepts such as agency, identity and domination. It also argues that a more creative and empirical engagement with the recent work of Bourdieu, alongside an interdisciplinary reading of more recent cultural and social theories of power, would be a fruitful way forward in advancing a feminist sociology of education. In the present historical moment and against the tide of postmodern and post-structuralist feminist accounts, Bourdieu is often read as a determinist who has little to offer contemporary feminist debates or who argues that masculine domination is too tightly woven to social practices of a given field. In short, this paper argues that such a view is not only a misreading of Bourdieu's work on fundamental theoretical grounds, but fails to acknowledge the ways in which his more recent work on masculinity addresses both the cultural and social conditions underlying contemporary forms of symbolic domination. In short, the paper argues that Bourdieu's theory offers an analytical breadth and range beyond the scope of anything that a normative, liberal account of masculine domination could provide. Yet, in drawing from such diversity, Bourdieu's oeuvre is able to resist incomprehensibility. It stands as a highly focused, realistic and generative attempt (McNay, 1999; McLeod, 2004) to chart the problems of subordination, differentiation and hierarchy, and to expose the possibilities, as well as the limits, of gendered self-hood.<br>

Abstract: Individual behaviors, such as loss-coping and “grief work” are affected in organizational contexts. In everything pertaining to coping with trauma in general, and loss more particularly, the individual is “trapped” within a political psychology that enforces the habitus and expectations of institutional dominance on the ostensibly intimate and private response. Regimes have perceived bereavement over battlefield deaths as a form of social capital that can be mobilized to enhance national loyalty and political support. Employing both existential/hermeneutic and institutional analysis, this study examines three diachronic models of bereavement — hegemonic, political and civil — and their political ramifications in the Israeli context.Drawing on changing parental conceptual orientations towards fallen sons and their role as cultural and ideological agents in public sphere, the article traces the movement of bereavement from its capture by the hegemonic state institutions to its creations under the domination of others institutions: political and civic and ultimate use in critiquing the political and military echelon. The article indicates the powerful impact of the social institutional-organizational context on the intimate-psychological context of coping with loss, by illustrating this phenomenon in the Israeli society.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo analiza la disputa sobre cuál sería la representación literaria más eficaz que José María Arguedas establece con los autores del llamado boom latinoamericano en los Diarios de El zorro de arriba y el zorro de abajo. En una argumentación que desarrolla ideas semejantes a las propuestas por Walter Benjamin en su ensayo "El narrador", Arguedas destaca el valor de una narradora oral como Carmen Taripha sobre los logros literarios del más significativo escritor del boom, Gabriel García Márquez. Lo importante para la representación literaria en Arguedas será la transmisión de experiencia, algo que su última novela logrará bajo la forma del testimonio de su propia muerte. This article examines the dispute regarding what would be the most effective literary representation that José María Arguedas established with the authors of the so-called Latin American boom, in the Diaries of The Fox from Up Above and the Fox from Down Below. In an argument that develops ideas similar to those proposed by Walter Benjamin in his essay "The Storyteller," Arguedas stresses the value of the storyteller Carmen Taripha over the literary achievements of the most significant writer of the boom, Gabriel García Márquez. What is important for the literary representation in Arguedas is the transmission of experience, something that his latest novel achieved in the form of the testimony of his own death.<br>

Abstract: How best to avoid the Levinas Effect, as it has been called, the tendency to make Emmanuel Levinas everything to everyone? One way is to demonstrate that Levinas's thinking does not fit into any of the categories by which we ordinarily approach political theory. If one were forced to categorize Levinas's political theory, the term "inverted liberalism " would come closest to the mark. As long, that is, as one emphasizes the term "inverted" over "liberalism." Levinas's defense of liberalism is likely the strangest defense the reader has encountered. We should, argues Levinas, foster and protect the individual because only the individual can see the tears of the other, the tears that even the just regime cannot see. The individual is to be fostered and protected for the sake of the other individual. Whether this has anything to do with "real" liberalism, and whether it should, is the topic of this essay.<br>

Abstract: This study examines how deadlines and time limits for conference talks organize the discourse of consensus among collaborating experimental and theoretical physicists in a university laboratory. Six months of videotaped observations, including two cycles of conference talk preparation, indicate that, as the date of an upcoming conference nears, several things happen. (a) Co-authoring physicists usually have not achieved agreement on all aspects of the findings. (b) They nevertheless direct their energies to constructing a hybrid presentation rhetoric that satisfies the co-authors and fits the talk to the official conference talk time limit. (c) In the process of working through matters of rhetoric -- what to say, what to display visually, what to leave out, and in what order the information should be presented -- the physicists construct a working consensus on matters of physics: theory and experimental data explaining the properties and dynamics of the physical universe.<br>

Abstract: S'il déclame contre les deux principes qui sont ceux de Descartes, Sartre se réclame pourtant de lui. Sans doute n'est-il pas à un paradoxe près. Reste qu'il nous faudra ne pas l'être moins pour expliquer le sien. Car certes, le sens du texte qu'il intitule « La liberté cartésienne » et qui articule ce volume de morceaux choisis qu'est Descartes 1596-1650 confère quelque cohérence à cet apparent non-sens. Mais une fois présenté de cette oeuvre le paratexte, il nous faudra affirmer non seulement que celle-ci se lit avant L'être et le néant quoiqu'elle ait été publiée après, mais, plus encore, qu'elle est un ensemble d'écrits de Descartes sur Sartre quoiqu'elle soit un écrit de Sartre sur Descartes. C'est qu'outre l'analyse sartrienne des analyses cartésiennes de la Méditation quatrième, on y trouve une psychanalyse existentielle par l'auteur de son devancier, à l'occasion de laquelle a lieu non pas un transfert, mais un contre-transfert. Although Sartre denounces Descartes' two principles, he nevertheless draws inspiration from him. No doubt this is close to being paradoxical; we shall have to be no less paradoxical in our explanation. For although the text entitled "Cartesian Freedom," which introduces a volume of selections from Descartes, Descartes 1596Ί650, confers some coherence on this apparent non-sense, once the texts surrounding this work have been taken into account, we have to conclude not only that this text predates Beinjj and Nothingness, even though it was published afterwards, but that it is a collection of Descartes' writings on Sartre, even though it is a writing by Sartre on Descartes. For beyond the Sartrean analysis of the Cartesian analyses of the Fourth Meditation, we find Sartre's existential psychoanalysis of his predecessor, in which takes place not a transference, but a counter-transference.<br>

Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which people who work in and use a cancer genetics clinic in the UK talk about the 'gene for cancer'. By conceptualizing such a gene as a boundary object, and using empirical data derived from clinic consultations, observations in a genetics laboratory and interviews with patients, the author seeks to illustrate how the various parties involved adopt different discursive strategies to appropriate, describe and understand what is apparently the 'same' thing. The consequent focus on the ways in which the rhetorical and syntactical features of lay and professional talk interlink and diverge illustrates not merely how our contemporary knowledge of genes and genetics is structured, but also how different publics position themselves with respect to the biochemistry of life.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines reasoning and rhetoric about economic recession in selected newspapers. This is an interesting topic for discourse analysis because it is a site of argumentation. We begin by asking: (1) epistemological questions (e.g. What evidential basis is drawn on in rhetoric about recession?) and then (2) ontological questions (e.g. How is recession pictured? and How is recession coordinated with the social world?). We examine the management of evidence and definitions concerning whether or not there is a recession. We then examine the entities invoked, showing how (a) a range of metaphors depict the recession as either an uncontrollable agent or as a controllable thing; and (b) rhetorical strategies used by both critics and supporters of the government collude in picturing the economy as a realm abstracted from social life.<br>

Abstract: What distinguishes Woolf's prose is not her famous penchant for simile, but her constant use of the less ostentatious, though more radical, verb metaphor. Combining these figures in strings, in which the verbs are consistent but the implied nouns contradictory, Woolf deliberately unsettles the reader, forcing him or her to consider not only the tenuous relations between the word and the world, but the contingent nature of phenomenal reality itself. Thus the view of life as something at once "very shifting" and "very solid" (expressed in the diaries and dramatized in the novels), pervades the essays, captured in the paradoxical relation "it is and is not" that Paul Ricoeur claims lies at the heart of metaphor. A close study of a paradigmatic essay, "On Not Knowing Greek," and of manuscript drafts in New York and Sussex reveals that this tension between shifting and solid extends to the syntax, which manages to be both extravagant and firmly anchored, and to the developing structure of the essay as a whole, which traces a movement of mind (a strategy James Farrell defines as specifically "feminine"), remaining defiantly heuristic and resisting the inherent closure of the formal essay. Thus, like her novels, Woolf s reviews and essays engage us in the process of perception even while inviting us to explore critically the operations of language in that perception.<br>

Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and the extension of anthropological research into the urban and industrial heartlands of the ' developed' world. These substantive consequences have established incontrovertibly the appropriateness and potency of anthropology in the study of such societies; and have also provided a basis from which to inform the core debates and central concepts of the discipline. These developments are evident in recent studies of kinship, social identity and symbolism. The reflexivity which is an essential ingredient of research on these topics (until recently noted with more eloquence and alacrity in France than in Britain) calls attention to the inevitable, and desirable, intrusion of the Self into anthropological research. It also demands the explicit incorporation of the complex Self-Other opposition in the fomulation of anthropological 'problems' — not as a baring of the post-modernist soul, but as an interpretive resource. An important illustration of the power of this resource may be found in the study of ethnic and local identities which are thereby revealed to be a matter of internal discourse (among Selves, so to speak) as well as of relativistic counter-definition. It is in precisely this way that research in anthropologists' 'parochial' or local milieux will contribute to the maturation of anthropology generally.<br>

Author(s): Corner James<br>
Abstract: This essay is about the crisis of creativity and meaning in contemporary Western culture and how the use of modern landscape and architectural theory works to perpetuate an excessively "hard" or neutral world—a world in which culture can no longer figure or recollect itself. A brief critique of three predominant approaches toward contemporary theory is presented: positivism, the use of paradigms, and the Avant-Garde. In different ways, each approach derives from modern techno-scientific thinking and invariably seeks closure, certainty, and control. The built landscapes that result often suffer from an equally closed explicitude: a stifling immanence where all is exposed and nothing is left to imagination. The essay suggests an alternative strategy grounded in the tradition of hermeneutics. Here, theory is something ever-open, permitting a free association of ideas through the mechanics of situational interpretation and metaphor. Hermeneutics provides the basis for a landscape architectural theory that transcends pictorial image and historical style by critically engaging contemporary circumstance and tradition. The landscape itself is a hermeneutic medium and becomes the ground for such an endeavor, enabling the remembrance, renewal, and transformation of a cultural tradition. The author argues that a hermeneutic approach to the theory and practice of landscape architecture is a way of returning to our designed landscapes the powers of the everyday and the revelatory—the grounds of memory and hope.<br>

Abstract: If human beings were empirically shown to be irrational, would this finding destroy the foundations of economic science? We think not because we doubt that this postulate is needed as a foundation of economic science. We examine the laboratory experiments conducted by behavioral economists and experimental psychologists on human judgment and decision-making, using Bayes' Theorem and the Expected Value model We examine a number of issues: Can we base ourselves on experimenters' full rationality for doubting of human rationality? Are rational models anything else than handy tools? Do humans' minds function like rational tools or with rational tools? How an "irrational" human being could create anything "rational"? Should rationality be subordinated to reason? Nature being neither rational nor irrational, is there any point in applying the concept of rationality to one its constituents? If human beings were rational forms of life, would this specie have survived?<br>

Abstract: In this essay I argue that Carvers story "A Small, Good Thing" can be read as an illustration of Albert Borgmann's argument that contemporary technological society conceals grace by encouraging the illusion than an individual can exert total control over her environment. The story shows how radical contingency punctures this illusion and offers potential for grace-filled communion with others through humble acts of hospitality. These humble acts—the small, good things of life together—parallel the giving and receiving of grace that takes place during the Eucharist.<br>

Abstract: Les mathématiques, auxquelles on peut joindre la logique, et depuis 1960 une large part de l'informatique théorique, fournissent un témoignage sur une part essentielle du fonctionnement de l'esprit humain. Loin de fournir seulement des outils extérieurs, elles se sont faites mode de pensée nécessaire pour appréhender la réalité physique. Elles nous ont appris que ce que nous nommons raison, démarche rationnelle, est en réalité laborieusement construit. Un bref survol de l'histoire des mathématiques, anciennes, puis surtout depuis le XIXe s., montre en quel sens le concept ancien de « vérité scientifique » s'en trouve désormais modifié. Mathematics, to which one may add logic and, since 1960, a large section of theoretical computer technique, all furnish evidence concerning an essential part of the working of the human mind. Far from providing only external tools, they have evolved as a necessary mode of thought for the understanding of physical reality. They have taught us that what we call reason, or rational deduction, is in fact something we have ourselves laboriously constructed. A brief survey of the history of mathematics, ancient and modern but especially from and after the 19th century, shows ways in which the old concept of a 'scientific truth' must henceforth be modified.<br>

Abstract: The conflict between formalist thinking and theories that view texts in their historical contexts serves as a starting point for the introduction of a cognitive view of literature. From this perspective language has full referential powers. The "referent" splits into two entities, however: things-in-themselves (in their material identity), which we cannot know, and things in their coded form, which are perceptually accessible. Readers' mnemonic potentials, a consequence of the bonding of perception and language, are adduced to show that texts originate in past interpretations of other texts and in personal experience and that consequently social forces and historical events are subsumed in the individual memory. In the cognitive light, memory becomes the ultimate metaphor, and the epistemological claim of realism regains its compelling force.<br>

Abstract: This paper is an advocacy for the employment of psychoanalytical concepts within sociological theorizing about the individual. Through an exposition of Freud's views on the development of intra-psychic structure and a critique of Parson's reduction of psychoanalysis to a branch of learning theory, I attempt to show that the sociological approach to the individual is implicitly behavioural and imprisoned in a series of assumptions which, among other things, treats subjectivity as epiphenomenal and identity as an unmediated reflection of some external reality. In contrast, psychoanalysis presents to us a picture of the individual as flawed and ambivalent in his relation to society, formed by but at odds with the demands of culture. In particular, the psychoanalytic concept of identification reveals that the acquisition of identity is a hard-won achievement marked by the renunciation of lost and forbidden objects. I argue, following Freud and Lacan, that the ego, far from being an agency of reason, somehow directly 'plugged into' reality, constitutes itself in the fantasied image of another and that the quality of this identification crucially affects the way the world is experienced and believed by the individual. This argument is elaborated through a discussion of Peter Berger's remarks on the social causes of identity crisis which, when set against the work of object-relations theorists on those suffering from disturbances of identity such as, for example, schizoid personalities, are shown to be both superficial and misleading. I conclude the paper by arguing that while psychoanalysis can enhance our understanding of the way in which the individual is formed by and through culture it also cautions us against making simple generalizations about the impact of culture upon the person, showing that the individual never submits himself unequivocally to its demands and interdicts.<br>

Abstract: A properly sociological definition of the concept of discourse does not exist because the notion has never been detached from the linguistic sphere. Not only linguists and semiologists, but also sociologists, use the word primarily as a linguistic category. This article attempts to define the concept of discourse sociologically. It is argued that a sociologically defined notion should be dissociated from the linguistic realm. As a linguistic category, 'discourse' is either used as a synonym for language or text, or is closely associated with one of these notions. 'Discourse' in a sociological sense should refer to a class of texts. This definition confers upon the concept of discourse an intertextual dimension. Defined in this way, the category can not only become an operative sociological concept, but it also becomes autonomous and is no longer reducible to linguistic or paralinguistic conceptual entities, such as text or language. No longer confined to the linguistic realm, the concept can designate a particular entity which possesses its own existence. Discourse can become a thing in itself. The argument is presented in three parts. The first is a critique of the current definitions of the concept 'discourse'. The second proposes, as an alternative, a sociological definition of discourse. Finally the third part applies this new definition in a sociological analysis of journalism.<br>

Abstract: This article explores a paradox - the simultaneous cultivation and suppression of "healing dramas" by pediatric rehabilitation therapists. Dramatic moments are defined as ones in which the routine exercises and treatment activities of therapeutic practice are transformed into narrative plots. These improvisational plots involve multiple characters, risks, suspense, and above all, a heightened sense that something is at stake. Experience itself becomes the focus of attention for the patient. Based upon ethnographic research in Chicago and Los Angeles, this article offers an anatomy of two such moments, investigating not only how healing dramas are constructed between patients and healers but how and why institutional discourses and practices invite their abandonment.<br>

Abstract: In this study of Greek dreams at moments of illness and anxiety I explore the relationship between individual experience and cultural representation. Ethnographic data and textual sources show that the image of fields recurs in dreams, thus throwing into question the uniqueness of personal experience as well as the concept of "experience" as something separate from cultural narratives. Yet these same images might also be independently generated "from below" by the emotional, physical experience of distress and illness. This case points to the convergence of cultural and personal symbols and to their fusion in the moment of experience. Approaches from psychoanalysis, cognitive psychology, anthropology, and folklore studies all provide possible theorizations. None of these options excludes the others. The image of the field in dreams is overdetermined precisely because the historicocultural, the cognitive, the psychobiological, and the social all simultaneously figure in human experience.

Abstract: Résumé. Ce texte démontre le genre de questions qui se présentent aux études sur la condition des personnes handicapées informées par la sociologieen interrogent les interactions qui émergent autour des luttes pour «l'accès» dans un milieu de travail scolaire/ académique. Au cours de mes expériences dans un des plus grands édifices dans une des plus grandes universités au Canada, j'ai amassé des paroles quotidiennes qui justifient l'exclusion des personnes handicapées. J'ai rassemblé des narratifs représentants ce-qui-est possible-de-dire aujourd'hui sur la lutte pour l'accessibilité. En utilisant une approche sociologique interprétativiste, ce texte illustre la façon dont les significations de l'incapacité sont générés par un discours qui rends légitime la construction exclusive ainsi que les structures inaccessible de la vie universitaire. Dans ce texte, je démontre que l'accès n'est pas synonyme de justice mais, par contre, est un point de départ pour la réflexion critique où les relations sociaux entre corps et espace peut être considéré à nouveau. Ce texte contribue aux études sur la condition des personnes handicapées informées par la sociologie en analysant la façon dont la narration ordinaire et quotidienne de l'incapacité peut continuer à, en même temps que l'environnement physique change, agir comme pouvoir social qui reproduit le statuquo.<br>

Abstract: Pamela M. Yee is a doctoral candidate and Provost's Fellow in the English department at the University of Rochester. Her research interests include late-medieval romance and dream-visions, confessional narratives, medieval medicine, cognition, psychology, affect theory, trauma studies, and the medical humanities; a secondary strand of her scholarship includes all things Arthurian and a nascent interest in medievalism within pop culture. Her dissertation explores confessional tropes as narrative, dialogic, and patient-centered healing in late Middle English secular literature. She has recently published articles in
            ArthurianaandThe Once and Future Classroom, and has a forthcoming review inMedievally Speaking. In summer 2013, she curated an exhibit titled “Eugène Vinaver's MagnificentMalory” for the Rossell Hope Robbins Library. Her budding interest in Gower studies has resulted in a recent flurry of activity: her co-organizing of the 3rdInternational Congress of the John Gower Society in summer 2014 and her selection by JGS as the graduate student representative for the 2016 John Hurt Fisher Prize Committee. At her home institution, she serves as Assistant Editor of the TEAMS Middle English Texts Series, works as a library assistant for the Robbins Library, contributes to theCamelot Project, and teaches in the Writing, Speaking, and Argument Program.

Abstract: This article examines the formative role of the World War II experience in shaping politically relevant memories in postwar Italy. Rather than considering the past a legacy or a heritage—something abstract, malleable and susceptible to serving political interests—the focus here is on the meaning-giving power of memories and symbols in the historical evolution. The birth of Italian democracy after the war was preceded by disruptive events that could have divided the nation. This article illustrates how contested and fragmented interpretations of critical events were structured by and through the dimension of cultural memory, which sustained social and political imaginations, eventually shaping characters and outcomes of the Italian political transformation.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: The world is a large and various place. Those wishing to chart new planetary cartographies are finding many languages to study beyond the French–German–English triad that long dominated Western comparative studies, and they are developing new methods appropriate to the expanded scope of our field. The tough linguistic and political analyses that Emily Apter rightly wishes comparatists to pursue will best be carried forward by widening our cultural and linguistic horizons, and by employing the full variety of critical and theoretical approaches that can be included in our cartographic toolboxes today.<br>

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: Is SPEP the city of God? This would be going too far. Not even the theological turn in French Phenomenology would make this claim. Dick Howard already threw in a troubling question: “diversification that perhaps gives more breadth than depth?” he asked. And there are plenty more troubling questions. SPEP is now a big operation. It has committees and subcommittees, multiple simultaneous sessions, blind review. All these developments are signs, perhaps inevitable ones, of its success, but all have familiar downsides: bureaucratization, diversification for its own sake, what Habermas would call
   Unübersichtlichkeit. This is what happens when outsiders become insiders, the antis become their own sort of establishment. You can't blame some of us for feeling nostalgic for our long-lost innocence, even though we all know—you don't have to be a philosopher of history to know this—that we can't go there. History has rendered a judgment, but Dick Howard said, “Historywilljudge.” That's one problem with history: It's always rendering judgments, but they are never final. You'd have to be at the end of history for that, and despite the claim of some philosophers, we aren't there yet. The slaughter bench of history looks very different today from the early 1960s, but it's still in some ways a slaughter bench. So how will the SPEP of the early twenty-first century look to the philosopher-historians of 2061—or is it 2062?<br>

Abstract: In short, it is exposure to the experientially inspired and theoretically casual atmosphere of those early SPEP meetings—where neglected topics and unorthodox modes of thinking and speaking were encouraged in an undisciplined way—to which I owe the most. Of course, SPEP grew up. It has experienced its share of embarrassing upheavals, as the heavy presence of its own versions of the social and political prejudices in the larger culture became too obvious to ignore. But it is now a major event—the four-day anchor for a week-long convention that takes over hotels, runs multiple concurrent sessions, fosters satellite groups, and often follows established lines of discussion. Some even call it the alternative APA. Yet I am sure that as long as lifeworld experience continues to trump whatever it is currently fashionable to say about it, grown-up SPEP will retain enough of its original vitality and intellectual generosity so that another generation of aging academics will have cause to repeat our present thank-yous in another fifty years.<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: The point here is that whoever I am in terms of my personal identity and my capacity or incapacity to identify myself through sortal terms as a being in the world with others, I will have no doubt who is in pain or who will have the pain.

Abstract: No doubt the rise of religion has not only posed a particular dilemma for critical theory but also provided a curious place to end this reflection. Having started my career doing philosophy of religion it is somewhat surprising to meet religion again as I turn to what surely must be at least a later phase of my career. I am reminded of Antonio's line from the Italian film
            C'eravamo Tanto Amati, translated asWe All Loved Each Other So Much: “We thought we could change the world, but the world changed us.” “Philosophers only interpret the world, the point is to change it,” so said Marx. But in a curious way those who would change the world are changed by it.<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: I want to conclude with one more argument from my own work. I have very often argued that philosophers of technology, regarding the expectations of society and their own traditions and habits, may come “too late” to technologies. They too often undertake their reflections
            afterthe technologies are in place. Rather, I argue, they should reposition themselves at what I call the “R&D” position where technologies are taking developmental shape, in think tanks, in incubator facilities, in research centers. Only then can truly “new” and emerging technologies be fully philosophically engaged.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: It has been over ten years since anything significant has been published on D. H. Lawrence's critical prose, and nothing of note has ever been written on the subject of the short essays—“The Novel,” “Surgery for the novel—Or a Bomb,” “Morality and the Novel,” and “Why the novel Matters”—containing his theory of the novel. The rhetorical style Lawrence adopts is so informal, so comical, and often so bizarre that the impulse of critics, when they do refer to these essays, is to ignore the rhetoric and somehow extract a system of logocentric doctrine, a doctrine that does not bear scrutiny. To appreciate Lawrence's genre theory, one cannot ignore the style in which it is written but must instead focus on the dynamics of discourse comprising the rhetorical text. Grounding my reading in Bakhtin's
         carnival, I argue that Lawrence celebrates the novel in terms of its “joyful relativity” (Bakhtin's term), a theory that articulates itself performatively in different ways through its own deconstruction. Read deconstructively, Lawrence's genre theory offers an important contribution to modernist concepts of language, an area from which Lawrence has traditionally been entirely excluded.<br>

Abstract: Most scholars dealing with unreliable narration consider the unreliable narrator inferior to the reader in either knowledge or morality. This conception implies that the readers are more reliable than the unreliable narrator and, thanks to this difference, capable of identifying unreliabilty, with no consequences or ramifications for themselves. Although this view is not entirely wrong, the readers' superiority to the narrator may change if the readers either find out new details about the narrator that urge them to reevaluate their classification or discover something new about themselves that encourages them to reconsider their superiority. An interesting combination of these two possibilities is found in Camus's novella
         The Fall(La Chute). My interpretation ofThe Fallfocuses on the triad narrator-narratee-reader and the narrator's rhetorical manipulations, maintaining that the text both undermines the binary opposition between “unreliable narrator” and “reliable reader” and has some general implications on the position of the reader towards fiction.<br>

Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>

Abstract: Flush with the juices of adolescence, American philosophy declared independence from its European parentage in the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson and his generation. In 1837, Emerson addressed the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Society on the occasion of its inaugural meeting for the year, which he called a "holiday." Emerson began: I greet you on the recommencement of our literary year. Our anniversary is one of hope, and, perhaps, not enough of labor. We do not meet for games of strength or skill, for the recitation of histories, tragedies, and odes, like the ancient Greeks; for parliaments of love and poesy, like the Troubadours; nor for the advancement of science, like our contemporaries in the British and European capitals. Thus far, our holiday has been simply a friendly sign of the survival of the love of letters amongst a people too busy to give letters any more. Perhaps the time is already come when it ought to be, and will be something else; when the sluggard intellect of this continent will look from under its iron lids and fill the postponed expectations of the world with something better than the expectations of mechanical skill. Our day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close. The millions that around us are rushing into life, cannot always be fed on the sere remains of foreign harvests. Events, actions arise, that must be sung, that will sing themselves.<br>

Abstract: In contemporary Western culture, death is often made separate from life. The dying body is rendered invisible, even though sociocultural performances of death foreshadow and signify death and dying. This article challenges this signifying by arguing that death and dying are constituted performatively through the inscriptive surfaces of living, dying, and dead bodies, rendered visible by breath and breathing. The article begins by reflecting on the experience of witnessing the author's mentor's dying breath. Thinking through the dying breath, it then questions to what extent the separation of death from life is maintained by what is unspoken of the dying and dead body. Finally, the article considers the analytical implications of the argument for those who remain behind to grieve for, and remember, the dying bodies, and those to whom those bodies once belonged<br>Link: <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/culturalcritique.86.2014.0065">http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/culturalcritique.86.2014.0065</a>
