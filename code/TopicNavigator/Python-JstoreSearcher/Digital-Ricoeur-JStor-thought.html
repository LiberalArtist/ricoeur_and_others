  Book Title: Enigmas of Sacrifice-A Critique of Joseph M. Plunkett and the Dublin Insurrection of 1916<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Cormack W. J. Mc<br>
  Abstract: Enigmas of Sacrifice: A Critique of Joseph M. Plunkett and the Dublin Insurrection of 1916is the first critical study of the religious poet and militarist Joseph M. Plunkett, who was executed with the other leaders of the Dublin insurrection of 1916. Through Plunkett the author gains access to areas of nationalist thought that were more often assumed or repressed than publicly formulated.In this eye-opening book, W. J. Mc Cormack explores and analyzes Plunkett's brief life, work, and influence, beginning with his wealthy but dysfunctional family, irregular Jesuit education, and self-canceling sexuality. Mc Cormack continues through Plunkett's active phase when amateur theatricals and a magazine editorship brought him into the emergent neonationalist discourse of early twentieth-century Ireland. Finally, the author arrives at Holy Week 1916, when Plunkett masterminded the forgery of official documentation in order to provoke and justify the insurrection he planned. Mc Cormack analyzes Plunkett's significant texts and provides context through critical perspectives on his milieu.Enigmas of Sacrificeis unique in its effort to understand a major figure of Irish nationalism in terms that reach beyond political identity.<br>

  Author(s) MCARTHUR JO-ANNE<br>
  Abstract: The debate on animal souls and the problem of theodicy with respect to animal suffering, a discussion that has been a feature of European thought since the seventeenth century, became the perfect pillar for those philosophies that were born in the wake of scientific discoveries and that aimed to assert the unreasonableness of Christianity. Such philosophies questioned how a good and almighty God could let innocent animals undergo all the evils they endure daily. One solution was to deny to animals feelings and reason; for instance, Descartes’s theory of the animal-machine suggested that animals were unable to feel pleasure and<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy-The Living Art of Michael C. Leff<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Henry David<br>
  Abstract: What distinguishes the study of rhetoric from other pursuits in the liberal arts? From what realms of human existence and expression, of human history, does such study draw its defining character? What, in the end, should be the purposes of rhetorical inquiry? And amid so many competing accounts of discourse, power, and judgment in the contemporary world, how might scholars achieve these purposes through the attitudes and strategies that animate their work?
      Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy: The Living Art of Michael C. Leffoffers answers to these questions by introducing the central insights of one of the most innovative and prolific rhetoricians of the twentieth century, Michael C. Leff. This volume charts Leff 's decades-long development as a scholar, revealing both the variety of topics and the approach that marked his oeuvre, as well as his long-standing critique of the disciplinary assumptions of classical, Hellenistic, renaissance, modern, and postmodern rhetoric.Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy includes a synoptic introduction to the evolution of Leff 's thought from his time as a graduate student in the late 1960s to his death in 2010, as well as specific commentary on twenty-four of his most illuminating essays and lectures.<br>

  Abstract: This essay is in part an effort to influence the continuing debate about textual criticism and critical rhetoric and in part an exercise in self-criticism. Since I am a principal in the debate, I cannot pretend to assume a neutral or disinterested position, but my present concern is not polemic, or at least not explicitly polemic. Instead, following and extending a point made by Dilip Gaonkar,¹ I want to frame the debate in terms that differ from the prevailing conception and in fact differ from the way I have thought about it in the past.

  Author(s) Alison James<br>
  Abstract: René Girard’s complex and sophisticated theory of sacrifice offers insights into the workings of human society that transcend culture and time and, while privileging Christianity and modernity, claim a certain universality. This invites scholars of other cultures and religions to consider the applicability of Girardian thought to their own fields of study. As scholars of Buddhism we take up this challenge by bringing Buddhism into conversation with Girard. Instead of concentrating on a particular text (Schlieter 2009) or genre (Hahn 2009) or practice (Arifuku 2009), we aim for a more comprehensive and general engagement with Girard by suggesting how Buddhism<br>

  Author(s) Ell Theodore<br>
  Abstract: Research work in the humanities in general, and in philosophy in particular, is today looked at with a certain degree of suspicion, for various, and sometimes even opposed, reasons. On one hand, work on subtle epistemological questions and/or historical analysis of the thought of past philosophers is regarded as a navel-gazing activity, otiose at best, wasteful at worst. On the other hand, when philosophy and intellectual analysis come to focus on popular culture phenomena, such as comics, movies, and TV programs, they are regarded as trivializing ideas and as committing themselves to marginal and eventually unimportant work.

  Abstract: One rewrites in order to improve a text. Sometimes the result is thought to be the better expression of an original meaning; at other times, it extends the idea in a new direction. In any case, textual revision is a process characterized by imperfection, change, negotiation, and fallibility. Traditionally, realism has seemed to be above this process: One identifies the relations of power or suffers the consequences. This attitude is reflected in the standard invocation of the classics of realism, which are seen as equivalent statements of a core doctrine of universal truths.

  Abstract: This book is a study of epistemology, which I define as what people know in their daily lives. Becker and Laing are used as starting points for a general depiction of Hispano thought, which includes the study of how language develops an understanding of the world of everyday life. Language usage is the vehicle for understanding how people name events, interactions, attitudes, and values. Understanding how words are used to construct the edifice of everyday life is best accomplished by using concepts from phenomenology.<br>

  Book Title: The Thought of Music-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Kramer Lawrence<br>
  Abstract: What, exactly, is knowledge of music? And what does it tell us about humanistic knowledge in general?
      The Thought of Musicgrapples directly with these fundamental questions-questions especially compelling at a time when humanistic knowledge is enmeshed in debates about its character and future. In this third volume in a trilogy on musical understanding that includesInterpreting MusicandExpression and Truth, Lawrence Kramer seeks answers in both thoughtaboutmusic and thoughtinmusic-thinking in tones. He skillfully assesses musical scholarship in the aftermath of critical musicology and musical hermeneutics and in view of more recent concerns with embodiment, affect, and performance. This authoritative and timely work challenges the prevailing conceptions of every topic it addresses: language, context, and culture; pleasure and performance; and, through music, the foundations of understanding in the humanities.<br>

  Abstract: The title
                  The Thought of Musicmight seem to indicate a primarily conceptual orientation, something that has been strongly evident in the preceding chapters. Chapter 1 concerned itself with conceptual questions directly by focusing on ideas, and the succeeding two chapters continued that concern by focusing on language, which, insofar as it makes sense—and it doesn’t always—is permeated with conceptuality. But music is obviously also a sensory medium. Music thinks in feelings, and thinking about music and with music must take account of that. The sensory force of music—sensory knowledge, sensory memory—is also obviously a force<br>

  Book Title: Symposium of the Whole-A Range of Discourse Toward an Ethnopoetics<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Rothenberg Diane<br>
  Abstract: Symposium of the Wholetraces a discourse on poetry and culture that has profoundly influenced the art of our time, with precedents going back two centuries and more. Beginning with a reassertion of the complexity of poetry among peoples long labeled "primitive" and "savage," many recent poets have sought to base a new poetics over the fullest range of human cultures. The attempt to define an ethnopoetics has been significantly connected with the most experimental and future-directed side of Romantic and modern poetry, both in the Western world and, increasingly, outside it. As a visionary poetics and as a politics, this complex redefinition of cultural and intellectual values has involved a rarely acknowledged collaboration between poets and scholars, who together have challenged the narrow view of literature that has excluded so many traditions.In this gathering, the Rothenbergs follow the idea of an ethnopoetics from predecessors such as Vico, Blake, Thoreau, and Tzara to more recent essays and manifestos by poets and social thinkers such as Olson, Eliade, Snyder, Turner, and Baraka. The themes range widely, from the divergence of oral and written cultures to the shaman as proto-poet and the reemergence of suppressed and rejected forms and images: the goddess, the trickster, and the "human universe." The book's three ethnographic sections demonstrate how various poetries are structured and composed, how they reflect meaning and worldview, and how they are performed in cultures where all art may be thought of as art-in-motion.Among the poetries discussed are the language of magic; West African drum language and poetry; the Huichol Indian language of reversals; chance operations in African divination poetry; picture-writings and action-writings from Australia and Africa; and American Indian sacred-clown dramas and traditional trickster narratives. The cumulative effect is a new reading of the poetic past and present-in the editors' words, "a changed paradigm of what~<br>

  Book Title: Alef, Mem, Tau-Kabbalistic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfson Elliot R.<br>
  Abstract: This highly original, provocative, and poetic work explores the nexus of time, truth, and death in the symbolic world of medieval kabbalah. Demonstrating that the historical and theoretical relationship between kabbalah and western philosophy is far more intimate and extensive than any previous scholar has ever suggested, Elliot R. Wolfson draws an extraordinary range of thinkers such as Frederic Jameson, Martin Heidegger, Franz Rosenzweig, William Blake, Julia Kristeva, Friedrich Schelling, and a host of kabbalistic figures into deep conversation with one another.
      Alef, Mem, Taualso discusses Islamic mysticism and Buddhist thought in relation to the Jewish esoteric tradition as it opens the possibility of a temporal triumph of temporality and the conquering of time through time. The framework for Wolfson's examination is the rabbinic teaching that the wordemet,"truth," comprises the first, middle, and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet,alef, mem,andtau,which serve, in turn, as semiotic signposts for the three tenses of time-past, present, and future. By heeding the letters ofemetwe discern the truth of time manifestly concealed in the time of truth, the beginning that cannot begin if it is to be the beginning, the middle that re/marks the place of origin and destiny, and the end that is the figuration of the impossible disclosing the impossibility of figuration, the finitude of death that facilitates the possibility of rebirth. The time of death does not mark the death of time, but time immortal, the moment of truth that bestows on the truth of the moment an endless beginning of a beginningless end, the truth of death encountered incessantly in retracing steps of time yet to be taken-between, before, beyond.<br>

  Abstract: In considering languages of grief in relation to languages of certainty, there is a tension in the ways death can be thought of in connection to modern knowledge. On the one hand, we can consider death as that which underlies the possibility of knowledge, as that end point to the fostering or disallowing of life that stands for the modern configuration of power/knowledge (as Foucault [1978] had it). And on the other hand, we can imagine death as that which cannot be spoken in languages of modernity (as de Certeau [1986] suggested). Put differently, this is the distinction between death<br>

But I am yet to address the most difficult question: how can people intentionally adopt a set of religious beliefs and practices in order to confront life problems? The tradition of thought that defines religion and culture in contradistinction to individual rationalistic action can be traced to Durkheim if not earlier. But despite this long-term conceptual trend, the incompatibility of intention and belief has been built on as a presupposition, not established through argument.

  Abstract: Michael Jackson extends his path-breaking work in existential anthropology by focusing on the interplay between two modes of human existence: that of participating in other peoples’ lives and that of turning inward to one’s self. Grounding his discussion in the subtle shifts between being acted upon and taking action, Jackson shows how the historical complexities and particularities found in human interactions reveal the dilemmas, conflicts, cares, and concerns that shape all of our lives. Through portraits of individuals encountered in the course of his travels, including friends and family, and anthropological fieldwork pursued over many years in such places as Sierra Leone and Australia, Jackson explores variations on this theme. As he describes the ways we address and negotiate the vexed relationships between “I” and “we”—the one and the many—he is also led to consider the place of thought in human life.<br>

  Abstract: Our exploration of the complex relationship between literature and space began with a legendary account of the origin of Sanskrit literature and a literary-theoretical discourse on Sanskrit styles and their regional dimensions. Both perspectives are conditioned by a conceptual matrix fundamental to Sanskrit thought for ordering and explaining the diverse phenomena of culture and society as elements in a transregional network closely related to Sanskrit’s own nonlocalized mode of existence. But there are other, literary linkages between literature and space. Narrative has an internal spatial logic, a “semiotic domain around which a plot coalesces and self-organizes,” as one scholar puts<br>

  Book Title: Imagining Karma-Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): OBEYESEKERE GANANATH<br>
  Abstract: With
      Imagining Karma,Gananath Obeyesekere embarks on the very first comparison of rebirth concepts across a wide range of cultures. Exploring in rich detail the beliefs of small-scale societies of West Africa, Melanesia, traditional Siberia, Canada, and the northwest coast of North America, Obeyesekere compares their ideas with those of the ancient and modern Indic civilizations and with the Greek rebirth theories of Pythagoras, Empedocles, Pindar, and Plato. His groundbreaking and authoritative discussion decenters the popular notion that India was the origin and locus of ideas of rebirth. As Obeyesekere compares responses to the most fundamental questions of human existence, he challenges readers to reexamine accepted ideas about death, cosmology, morality, and eschatology. Obeyesekere's comprehensive inquiry shows that diverse societies have come through independent invention or borrowing to believe in reincarnation as an integral part of their larger cosmological systems. The author brings together into a coherent methodological framework the thought of such diverse thinkers as Weber, Wittgenstein, and Nietzsche. In a contemporary intellectual context that celebrates difference and cultural relativism, this book makes a case for disciplined comparison, a humane view of human nature, and a theoretical understanding of "family resemblances" and differences across great cultural divides.<br>

  Book Title: A Usable Past-Essays in European Cultural History<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): BOUWSMA WILLIAM J.<br>
  Abstract: The essays assembled here represent forty years of reflection about the European cultural past by an eminent historian. The volume concentrates on the Renaissance and Reformation, while providing a lens through which to view problems of perennial interest.
      A Usable Pastis a book of unusual scope, touching on such topics as political thought and historiography, metaphysical and practical conceptions of order, the relevance of Renaissance humanism to Protestant thought, the secularization of European culture, the contributions of particular professional groups to European civilization, and the teaching of history. The essays inA Usable Pastare unified by a set of common concerns. William Bouwsma has always resisted the pretensions to science that have shaped much recent historical scholarship and made the work of historians increasingly specialized and inaccessible to lay readers. Following Friedrich Nietzsche, he argues that since history is a kind of public utility, historical research should contribute to the self-understanding of society.<br>

  Abstract: Although Paolo Sarpi is one of the great figures of the seventeenth century, not only of Italy, but of all Europe, and although many historians, Italian and non-Italian, have studied his career and thought, he remains an enigma and a subject of controversy.

Obviously, there is also the well-known and well-trodden path from original self-interest.

  Book Title: The Fate of Place-A Philosophical History<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Casey Edward S.<br>
  Abstract: In this imaginative and comprehensive study, Edward Casey, one of the most incisive interpreters of the Continental philosophical tradition, offers a philosophical history of the evolving conceptualizations of place and space in Western thought. Not merely a presentation of the ideas of other philosophers,
      The Fate of Placeis acutely sensitive to silences, absences, and missed opportunities in the complex history of philosophical approaches to space and place. A central theme is the increasing neglect of place in favor of space from the seventh century A.D. onward, amounting to the virtual exclusion of place by the end of the eighteenth century. Casey begins with mythological and religious creation stories and the theories of Plato and Aristotle and then explores the heritage of Neoplatonic, medieval, and Renaissance speculations about space. He presents an impressive history of the birth of modern spatial conceptions in the writings of Newton, Descartes, Leibniz, and Kant and delineates the evolution of twentieth-century phenomenological approaches in the work of Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Bachelard, and Heidegger. In the book's final section, Casey explores the postmodern theories of Foucault, Derrida, Tschumi, Deleuze and Guattari, and Irigaray.<br>

  Book Title: Aspects of Alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the Contemporary Debate-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Every other is truly other, but no other is wholly other.This is the claim that Aspects of Alterity defends. Taking up the question of otherness that so fascinates contemporary continental philosophy, this book asks what it means for something or someone to be other than the self. Levinas and those influenced by him point out that the philosophical tradition of the West has generally favored the self at the expense of the other. Such a self-centered perspective never encounters the other qua other, however. In response, postmodern thought insists on the absolute otherness of the other, epitomized by the deconstructive claim every other is wholly other.But absolute otherness generates problems and aporias of its own. This has led some thinkers to reevaluate the notion of relative otherness in light of the postmodern critique, arguing for a chiastic account that does justice to both the alterity and the similitude of the other. These latter two positions-absolute otherness and a rehabilitated account of relative otherness-are the main contenders in the contemporary debate.The philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Gabriel Marcel provide the point of embarkation for coming to understand the two positions on this question. Levinas and Marcel were contemporaries whose philosophies exhibit remarkably similar concern for the other but nevertheless remain fundamentally incompatible. Thus, these two thinkers provide a striking illustration of both the proximity of and the unbridgeable gap between two accounts of otherness.Aspects of Alterity delves into this debate, first in order understand the issues at stake in these two positions and second to determine which description better accounts for the experience of encountering the other.After a thorough assessment and critique of otherness in Levinas's and Marcel's work, including a discussion of the relationship of ethical alterity to theological assumptions, Aspects of Alterity traces the transmission and development of these ~<br>

Again, while intending to provide a fair representation of Marcel’s work, the role played by these first two exegetical chapters—that of anticipating an engagement between Levinas and Marcel on the question of otherness—requires a more selective summary.<br>

  Book Title: Veiled Desires: Intimate Portrayals of Nuns in Postwar Anglo-American Film-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SABINE MAUREEN<br>
  Abstract: A provocative, interdisciplinary study of nuns on the big screen, from The Bells of St. Mary's (1945) to Doubt (2008), that shines fresh light on the cinematic nun as a woman and a religious in the twentieth century. Ingrid Bergman's engaging screen performance as Sister Mary Benedict in The Bells of St. Mary's made the film nun a star and her character a shining standard of comparison. She represented the religious life as the happy and rewarding choice of a modern woman who had a "complete understanding" of both erotic and spiritual desire. How did this vibrant and mature nun figure come to be viewed as girlish and naive? Why have she and her cinematic sisters in postwar popular film so often been stereotyped or selectively analyzed, so seldom been seen as women and religious? In Veiled Desires--a unique full-length, in-depth study of nuns in film--Maureen Sabine explores these questions in a groundbreaking interdisciplinary study covering more than sixty years of cinema. She looks at an impressive breadth of films in which the nun features as an ardent lead character, including The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), Black Narcissus (1947), Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957), Sea Wife (1957), The Nun's Story (1959), The Sound of Music (1965), Change of Habit (1969), In This House of Brede (1975), Agnes of God (1985), Dead Man Walking (1995), and Doubt (2008). Veiled Desires considers how the beautiful and charismatic stars who play chaste nuns, from Ingrid Bergman and Audrey Hepburn to Susan Sarandon and Meryl Streep, call attention to desires that the veil concealed and the habit was thought to stifle. In a theologically and psychoanalytically informed argument, Sabine responds to the critics who have pigeonholed the film nun as the obedient daughter and religious handmaiden of a patriarchal church, and the respectful audience who revered her as an icon of spiritual perfection. She provides a framework for a more complex and holistic picture of nuns on screen by showing h~<br>

  Author(s): PUTT B. KEITH<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal has been in the foremost ranks of philosophers who proclaim a new postsecular philosophy. By articulating an epistemology sensitive to the realities of cognitive finitude and moral weakness, he defends a wisdom that begins in both humility and commitment, one that always confesses that human beings can encounter meaning and truth only as human beings, never as gods.The present volume focuses on this wisdom of humility that characterizes Westphal's thought and explores how that wisdom, expressed through the redemptive dynamic of doubt, can contribute to developing a postsecular apologetic for faith.This book can function both as an accessible introduction to Westphal for those who have not read him extensively and also as an informed critical appreciation and extension of his work for those who are more experienced readers.<br>

Taking its point of departure from the problem of the gift as articulated by Jacques Derrida, who argues that the conditions of possibility of the gift are also its conditions of impossibility, Horner pursues a series of questions concerning the nature of thought, the viability of phenomenology, and, most urgently, the possibility of grace. For Marion, phenomenology, as the thought of the given, offers a path for philosophy to proceed without being implicated in metaphysics. His retrieval of several important insights of Edmund Husserl, along with his reading of Martin Heidegger and Emmanuel Lvinas, enables him to work out a phenomenology where even impossiblephenomena such as revelation and the gift might be examined. In this important confrontation between Marion and Derrida issues vital to the negotiation of postmodern concerns in philosophy and theology emerge with vigour. The careful elucidation of those issues in an interdisciplinary context, and the snapshot it provides of the state of contemporary debate, make Rethinking God as Gift an important contribution to theological and philosophical discussion.<br>

  Abstract: In accordance with both Christian tradition and his vision of phenomenology, Marion answers the question of how God might enter into human thought in terms of the gift. For Marion there is an essential coherence, if not a correlation, between what takes place at the outer limits of thought and what theology identifies as the inbreaking of God in human life. Derrida, on the other hand, is less convinced of the capacity of phenomenology to work at these outer limits, and is suspicious of what a theological hermeneutics promises to deliver. Nevertheless, as we find Marion more and more insistent<br>

  Book Title: Crossover Queries: Dwelling with Negatives, Embodying Philosophy's Others-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WYSCHOGROD EDITH<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the risks, ambiguities, and unstable conceptual worlds of contemporary thought, Crossover Queries brings together the wide-ranging writings, across twenty years, of one of our most important philosophers.Ranging from twentieth-century European philosophy-the thought of Heidegger, Foucault, Derrida, Levinas, Janicaud, and others-to novels and artworks, music and dance, from traditional Jewish thought to Jain andBuddhist metaphysics, Wyschogrod's work opens radically new vistas while remaining mindful that the philosopher stands within and is responsible to a philosophical legacy conditioned by the negative.Rather than point to a Hegelian dialectic of overcoming negation or to a postmetaphysical exhaustion, Wyschogrod treats negative moments as opening novel spaces for thought. She probes both the desire for God and an ethics grounded in the interests of the other person, seeing these as moments both of crossing over and of negation. Alert to the catastrophes that have marked our times, she exposes the underlying logical structures of nihilatory forces that have been exerted to exterminate whole peoples. Analyzing the negationsof biological research and cultural images of mechanized and robotic bodies, she shows how they contest the body as lived in ordinary experience.Crossover Queries brings together important essays on a remarkable range of topics by one of our most insightful cultural critics. Commenting on philosophical and theological issues that have shaped the recent past as well as scientific and technological questions that will preoccupy us in the near future, Wyschogrod consistently alerts us to the urgency of problems whose importance few recognize. To avoid the challenge these essays pose is to avoid responsibility for a future that appears to be increasingly fragile.-Mark C. Taylor, Columbia University<br>

  Book Title: Sounding/Silence: Martin Heidegger at the Limits of Poetics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SMITH DAVID NOWELL<br>
  Abstract: Sounding/Silence charts Heidegger's deep engagement with poetry, situating it within the internal dynamics of his thought and within the domains of poetics and literary criticism. Heidegger viewed poetics and literary criticism with notorious disdain: he claimed that his Erlauterungen ("soundings") of Holderlin's poetry were not "contributions to aesthetics and literary history" but rather stemmed "from a necessity for thought." And yet, the questions he poses--the value of significance of prosody and trope, the concept of "poetic language", the relation between language and body, the "truth" of poetry--reach to the very heart of poetics as a discipline, and indeed situate Heidegger within a wider history of thinking on poetry and poetics. opening up points of contact between Heidegger's discussions of poetry and technical and critical analyses of these poems, Nowell Smith addresses a lacuna within Heidegger scholarship and sets off from Heidegger's thought to sketch a philosophical "poetics of limit".<br>

  Book Title: Postmodern Apologetics?: Arguments for God in Contemporary Philosophy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: This book provides an introduction to the emerging field of continental philosophy of religion by treating the thought of its most important representatives, including its appropriations by several thinkers in the United States. Part I provides context by examining religious aspects of the thought of Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida. Christina Gschwandtner contends that, although the work of these thinkers is not apologetic in nature (i.e., it does not provide an argument for religion, whether Christianity or Judaism), it prepares the ground for the more religiously motivated work of more recent thinkers by giving religious language and ideas some legitimacy in philosophical discussions. Part II devotes a chapter to each of the contemporary French thinkers who articulate a phenomenology of religious experience: Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Michel Henry, Jean-Louis Chretien, and Jean-Yves Lacoste. In it, the author argues that their respective philosophies can be read as an apologetics of sorts-namely, as arguments for the coherence of thought about God and the viability of religious experience-though each thinker does so in a different fashion and to a different degree. Part III considers the three major thinkers who have popularized and extended this phenomenology in the U.S. context: John D. Caputo, Merold Westphal, and Richard Kearney. The book thus both provides an introduction to important contemporary thinkers, many of whom have not yet received much treatment in English, and also argues that their philosophies can be read as providing an argument for Christian faith.<br>

  Book Title: Finding God in All Things: Celebrating Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stagaman David<br>
  Abstract: Three of the most influential Catholic theologians of the twentieth century-Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-were all born in 1904, at the height of the Church's most militant rhetoric against all things modern. In this culture of suspicion, Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner grew in faith to join the Society of Jesus and struggled with the burden of antimodernist policies in their formation. By the time of their mature work in the 1950s and 1960s, they had helped to redefine the critical dialogue between modern thought and contemporary Catholic theology. After the dtente of the Second Vatican Council, they brought Catholic tradition into closer relationship to modern philosophy, history, and politics. Written by leading scholars, friends, and family members, these original essays celebrate the legacies of Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner after a century of theological development. Offering a broad range of perspectives on their lives and works, the essays blend personal and anecdotal accounts with incisive critical appraisals. Together, they offer an accessible introduction to the distinctive character of three great thinkers and how their work shapes the way Catholics think and talk about God, Church, and State.<br>

  Author(s): Burrell David B.<br>
  Abstract: How do Catholic intellectuals draw on faith in their work? And how does their work as scholars influence their lives as people of faith?For more than a generation, the University of Dayton has invited a prominent Catholic intellectual to present the annual Marianist Award Lecture on the general theme of the encounter of faith and profession. Over the years, the lectures have become central to the Catholic conversation about church, culture, and society.In this book, ten leading figures explore the connections in their own lives between the private realms of faith and their public calling as teachers, scholars, and intellectuals.This last decade of Marianist Lectures brings together theologians and philosophers, historians, anthropologists, academic scholars, and lay intellectuals and critics.Here are Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J., on the tensions between faith and theology in his career; Jill Ker Conway on the spiritual dimensions of memory and personal narrative; Mary Ann Glendon on the roots of human rights in Catholic social teaching; Mary Douglas on the fruitful dialogue between religion and anthropology in her own life; Peter Steinfels on what it really means to be a liberal Catholic; and Margaret O'Brien Steinfels on the complicated history of women in today's church. From Charles Taylor and David Tracy on the fractured relationship between Catholicism and modernity to Gustavo Gutirrez on the enduring call of the poor and Marcia Colish on the historic links between the church and intellectual freedom, these essays track a decade of provocative, illuminating, and essential thought. James L. Heft, S.M., is President and Founding Director of the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies and University Professor of Faith and Culture and Chancellor, University of Dayton.

  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: The book provides a series of approaches to the ancient question of whether and how God is a matter of experience,or, alternately, to what extent the notion of experience can be true to itself if it does not include God. On the one hand, it seems impossible to experience God: the deity does not offer Himself to sense experience. On the other hand, there have been mystics who have claimed to have encountered God. The essays in this collection seek to explore the topic again, drawing insights from phenomenology, theology, literature, and feminism. Throughout, this stimulating collection maintains a strong connection with concrete rather than abstract approaches to God.The contributors: Michael F. Andrews, Jeffrey Bloechl, John D.

  Book Title: Between Chora and the Good: Metaphor's Metaphysical Neighborhood-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BIGGER CHARLES P.<br>
  Abstract: Plato's chora as developed in the Timaeus is a creative matrix in which things arise and stand out in response to the lure of the Good. Chora is paired with the Good, its polar opposite; both are beyond beingand the metaphors hitherto thought to disclose the transcendent. They underlie Plato's distinction of a procreative gap between being and becoming. The chiasmus between the Good and chora makes possible their mutual participation in one another. This gap makes possible both phenomenological and cosmological interpretations of Plato. Metaphor is restricted to beings as they appear in this gap through the crossing of metaphor's terms, terms that dwell with, rather than subulate, one another. Hermeneutically, through its iswe can see something being engendered or determined by that crossing.Bigger's larger goal is to align the primacy of the Good in Plato and Christian Neoplatonism with the creator God of Genesis and the God of love in the New Testament.<br>

Nevertheless, the sun is said to have been begotten in its likeness. Patristic apophatic theology, working from this invisibility of the Good, spoke of it as “invisible in light”<br>

  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

Divine Enticement takes as its starting point that the meanings of theological concepts are not so much logical, truth-valued propositions-affirmative or negative-as they are provocations and evocations. Thus it argues for the seductiveness of both theology and its subject-for, in fact, infinite seduction and enticement as the very sense of theological query. The divine name is one by which we are drawn toward the limits of thought, language, and flesh. The use of language in such conceptualization calls more than it designates. This is not a flaw or a result of vagueness or imprecision in theological language but rather marks the correspondence of such language to its subject: that which, outside of or at the limit of our thought, draws us as an enticement to desire, not least to intellectual desire. Central to the text is the strange semiotics of divine naming, as a call on that for which there cannot be a standard referent. The entanglement of sign and body, not least in interpretations of the Christian incarnation, both grounds and complicates the theological abstractions. A number of traditional notions in Christian theology are reconceived here as enticements, modes of drawing the desires of both body and mind: faith as "thinking with assent"; sacraments as "visible words" read in community; ethics as responsiveness to beauty; prayer as the language of address; scripture as the story of meaning-making. All of these culminate in a sense of a call to and from the purely possible, the open space into which we can be enticed, within which we can be divinely enticing.<br>

  Abstract: Theology seduced me. I wanted to resist being drawn into its constant uncertainty and intellectual discomfort, but was enticed by its history of gorgeous writing (whether poetically extravagant or mathematically precise) and by the willingness of theological thinkers to take up thought at the limits of thinking, to say at the limits of language, to experience at the limits of the subject. My response has been to try to theorize that seduction—not as a defense, but as a response, as every seduction requires.

  Book Title: Thinking Through the Imagination: Aesthetics in Human Cognition-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Jones Jude<br>
  Abstract: Use your imagination! The demand is as important as it is confusing. What is the imagination? What is its value? Where does it come from? And where is it going in a time when even the obscene seems overdone and passe? This book takes up these questions and argues for the centrality of imagination in human cognition. It traces the development of the imagination in Kant's critical philosophy (particularly the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment) and claims that the insights of Kantian aesthetic theory, especially concerning the nature of creativity, common sense, and genius, influenced the development of nineteenth-century American philosophy. The book identifies the central role of the imagination in the philosophy of Peirce, a role often overlooked in analytic treatments of his thought. The final chapters pursue the observation made by Kant and Peirce that imaginative genius is a type of natural gift (ingenium) and must in some way be continuous with the creative force of nature. It makes this final turn by way of contemporary studies of metaphor, embodied cognition, and cognitive neuroscience.<br>

  Book Title: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Timothy<br>
  Abstract: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics presents a decade of thought about the origins and possibilities of political theory from one of contemporary Italy's most prolific and engaging political theorists, Roberto Esposito. He has coined a number of critical concepts in current debates about the past, present, and future of biopolitics-from his work on the implications of the etymological and philosophical kinship of community (communitas) and immunity (immunitas) to his theorizations of the impolitical and the impersonal. Taking on interlocutors from throughout the Western philosophical tradition, from Aristotle and Augustine to Weil, Arendt, Nancy, Foucault, and Agamben, Esposito announces the eclipse of a modern political lexicon-"freedom," "democracy," "sovereignty," and "law"-that, in its attempt to protect human life, has so often produced its opposite (violence, melancholy, and death). Terms of the Political calls for the opening of political thought toward a resignification of these and other operative terms-such as "community," "immunity," "biopolitics," and "the impersonal"-in ways that affirm rather than negate life. An invaluable introduction to the breadth and rigor of Esposito's thought, the book will also welcome readers already familiar with Esposito's characteristic skill in overturning and breaking open the language of politics.<br>

This question is not only legitimate but in certain ways quite unavoidable at a time when democratic culture is interrogating its own theoretical mandates and its own future.

  Book Title: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER THOMAS M.<br>
  Abstract: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence explores themes in classical American philosophy, primarily that of John Dewey, but also in the thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson, George Santayana, and Native American traditions. The primary claim is that human beings exist with a need for the experience of meaning and value, a "Human Eros." Our various cultures are symbolic environments or "spiritual ecologies" within which the Human Eros can thrive. This is how we inhabit the earth. Encircling and sustaining our cultural existence is nature. Western philosophy has not generally provided adequate conceptual models for thinking ecologically. Thus the idea of "eco-ontology" undertakes to explore ways in which this might be done beginning with the primacy of Nature over Being, but also including the recognition of possibility and potentiality as inherent aspects of existence. I argue for the centrality of Dewey for an effective ecological philosophy. Both "pragmatism" and "naturalism" need to be contextualized within an emergentist, relational, non-reductive view of nature and an aesthetic, imaginative, non-reductive view of intelligence.<br>

But, surprisingly, though translations of his writings have appeared in over 160 editions in 16 countries, his strictly philosophical work has hitherto been largely inaccessible to American audiences. Even where adequate English translations exist, the difficulties imposed by Jaspers' involved reasoning, intricate style, and ingenious neologisms are such that few unfamiliar with Continental philosophy can hope to acquire an understanding of his ideas on their own.<br>

  Book Title: Citizenship in Heaven and on Earth-Karl Barth's Ethics<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Massmann Alexander<br>
  Abstract: While Karl Barth is one of the most significant theologians of the twentieth century, his contribution to ethics is less well known and subject to controversy among interpreters. Barth combined his commitment to the church and its particular task in faith and theology with a concern for ethics and politics in wider society. By examining the historical development of Barth’s ethics, this study traces the vital influences and considerable shifts in Barth’s understanding of the ethical task, situating him within his political context. Alexander Massmann provides a comprehensive explication and assessment of the full scope of Barth’s ethics, from the first edition of the Romans commentary to the final volume of the Church Dogmatics. General questions of Barth’s methodology in ethics and case studies in applied ethics are both analyzed in their intricate connection to his dogmatic thought. The study highlights how an ethical approach emerged in which the freedom of the gospel allows for considerable openness to empirical insights from other disciplines. The author reevaluates Barth’s ethics in a constructive vision of the role of the church in the quest for a just society.<br>

  Book Title: Resisting history-Religious transcendence and the invention of the unconscious<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hayward Rhodri<br>
  Abstract: How can historians make sense of visions, hauntings and demonic possession? Do miraculous events have any place in a world governed by cause and effect? In Resisting history, Rhodri Hayward examines the cumulative attempts of theologians, historians and psychologists to create a consistent and rational narrative capable of containing the inexplicable. This lucid and provocative account argues that the psychological theories we routinely use to make sense of supernatural experience were born out of struggles between popular mystics and conservative authorities. Hayward’s lively analysis of the Victorian disciplines of Christology, psychology and psychical research reveals how our modern concept of the subconscious was developed as a tool for policing religious inspiration. He concludes his argument with a vivid study of the Welsh Revival of 1904-5, in which the attempt of thousands of converts to cast off their everyday identity was diffused and defeated using the language of the new psychology. By revealing the politics inherent in such language, Hayward raises questions about its deployment in the work of today’s historians. Written in a clear and accessible style, Resisting history provides a fresh and entertaining perspective for anyone interested in questioning the concepts that underlie historical writing and psychological thought today.<br>

  Book Title: The subject of love-Hélène Cixous and the feminine divine<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Renshaw Sal<br>
  Abstract: *The Subject of Love: Hélène Cixous and the Feminine Divine* is about abundant, generous, other-regarding love. In the history of Western ideas of love, such a configuration has been inseparable from our ideas about divinity and the sacred; often reserved only for God; and rarely thought of as a human achievement. This book is a substantial engagement with her philosophies of love, inviting the reader to reflect on the conditions of subjectivity that just might open us to something like a divine love of the other. Renshaw follows this thread in this genealogy of abundant love: the thread that connects the subject of love from 5th century B.C.E. Greece and Plato, to the 20th century protestant theology of agapic love of Anders Nygren, to the late 20th century poetico-philosophy of Hélène Cixous. This study will be of particular interest to academics and students of the history of gender, cultural studies, criticism and gender studies<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jb3s">The subject of love</a><br>
  Abstract: Throughout history theorists and philosophers of love have been preoccupied with the relationship between the subjects and objects of love. From Plato’s reflections on the divinity of a disembodied love of wisdom to the Christian ideal of loving our enemies, there is a recurring concern with understanding the mediating aspects of love. How should we think of the kinds of exchanges that love brings about? Whether thinking about love concerns relations between human beings, or relations between humans and the divine, the very notion of love as developed in Western thought presupposes that something is loved, while someone else, as<br>

  Abstract: The recent growth of interest in German Idealist and Romantic philosophy has tended to focus on Fichte and Hegel, and, to a lesser extent, on Schelling. However, given the philosophical motivation for the new attention to the thought of this period, it is actually rather strange that its main focus has not been the work of F.D.E. Schleiermacher (1768–1834). The contingent reasons for the neglect of Schleiermacher are, admittedly, quite simple. Schleiermacher’s theological work, as the major Protestant theologian of the nineteenth century, has largely determined his reputation, and he did not produce de fi nitive versions of his<br>

  Book Title: Time and world politics-Thinking the present<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hutchings Kimberly<br>
  Abstract: This book offers the first authoritative guide to assumptions about time in theories of contemporary world politics. It demonstrates how predominant theories of the international or global ‘present’ are affected by temporal assumptions, grounded in western political thought, that fundamentally shape what we can and cannot know about world politics today. The first part of the book traces the philosophical roots of assumptions about time in contemporary political theory. The second part examines contemporary theories of world politics, including liberal and realist International Relations theories and the work of Habermas, Hardt and Negri, Virilio and Agamben. In each case, it is argued, assumptions about political time ensure the identification of the particular temporality of western experience with the political temporality of the world as such and put the theorist in the unsustainable position of holding the key to the direction of world history. In the final chapter, the book draws on postcolonial and feminist thinking, and the philosophical accounts of political time in the work of Derrida and Deleuze, to develop a new ‘untimely’ way of thinking about time in world politics.<br>

As David Kelsey remarks, acknowledging the Bible as scripture lies at the very heart of participating in the community of Jesus Christ, and the decision to adopt the texts of Christian scripture as “canon” is not “a separate decision over and above a decision to become a Christian.”¹ Yet the past two centuries have seen considerable change in the nature and function<br>

In fact, Jesus progressively thought of himself as the "Son of Man" inaugurating the advent of the Kingdom of God on earth.<br>

  Abstract: From North to South brings together the interests in Edward Schillebeeckx of eight theologians from Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia. In each chapter, theologians dialogue from a southern context with one of Schillebeeckx’s themes or methods. Themes such as suffering and negative contrast experiences, political holiness, ecclesiology, God and the cross, resurrection and hope, and theology and culture are addressed. Attention to Schillebeeckx’s hermeneutics lies at the heart of several chapters but is generally woven throughout. Contributors bring their particular southern contexts into serious dialogue with Schillebeeckx’s northern thought. The book concludes with a response to the south from North American theologian, Kathleen McManus OP. In short, the book witnesses to the ongoing challenge and stimulation of Edward Schillebeeckx’s theology.<br>

  Abstract: The article focuses on the understanding of vulnerability that is found in the thought of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Emmanuel Levinas. For Bonhoeffer, vulnerability is best understood as a form of ‘vulnerable discipleship’, that is, a choosing to be vulnerable for the other which aligns with his understanding of costly grace. For Levinas, vulnerability is primarily concerned with the vulnerability of the other person and, later in his thought, the vulnerability of the subject who is responsible for the other person. In exploring the grounds for possible conversation between these two thinkers, we argue that Levinas has potential to offer a<br>

  Book Title: Opening the Bible-Selected Writings of Antony Campbell SJ<br>
  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Antony<br>
  Abstract: "When Tony Campbell, aged 75, asked the Council of Jesuit Theological College for Emeritus status and retirement from JTC, both were granted most graciously, along with a testimonial document which said in part: ‘His teaching has combined evocation and provocation in the best sense of those terms. He has mentored research students with scholarly exactitude and personal care. He has published books of the highest scholarly quality, of engaging readability, and of passionate conviction.’ When we at ATF were considering asking him for a volume of Collected Works or Selected Writings, we were well aware that ‘published books of the highest scholarly quality’ were likely to be found on the shelves of libraries and of specialised academics, but not with students and others generally interested. There may be a dozen or more of Tony’s books on the list from Amazon.com booksellers, along with another two or three that are not listed there. But most are heavy-duty specialist works, not easily accessible even to the educated public. We were equally well aware that there was a surprising number of essays and articles scattered in journals and proceedings of conferences that were, because of the scattering, often just as inaccessible. We thought that a collection of these in a single volume would be of great value to those interested. In the Introduction to this volume, Father Campbell has gone into some detail about the contents. Suffice for us to say that Job and the issues associated with suffering concern us all, that the interplay of history and narrative is a constant in the understanding of much biblical text, and that the nature of the Bible and its role in our lives is a major concern for most thinking Christians. While Father Campbell’s focus is on the Older Testament, pondering what he looks at throws light on much of the Newer Testament as well. The writings Tony Campbell has pulled together in this single volume address significant issues within the readable length ~<br>

  Book Title: Redemptive Hope: From the Age of Enlightenment to the Age of Obama-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Timothy C.<br>
  Abstract: This is a book about the need for redemptive narratives to ward off despair and the dangers these same narratives create by raising expectations that are seldom fulfilled. The quasi-messianic expectations produced by the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, and their diminution, were stark reminders of an ongoing struggle between ideals and political realities. Redemptive Hope begins by tracing the tension between theistic thinkers, for whom hope is transcendental, and intellectuals, who have striven to link hopes for redemption to our intersubjective interactions with other human beings. Lerner argues that a vibrant democracy must draw on the best of both religious thought and secular liberal political philosophy. By bringing Richard Rorty's pragmatism into conversation with early-twentieth-century Jewish thinkers, including Martin Buber and Ernst Bloch, Lerner begins the work of building bridges, while insisting on holding crucial differences in dialectical tension. Only such a dialogue, he argues, can prepare the foundations for modes of redemptive thought fit for the twenty-first century.<br>

This is intended to imply that the study of religions must think about religions as arising through, or possibly existing in, human behaviors. In this sense, religion does not exist independently of a human subject with causal or agentive powers in the world.

  Abstract: Whereas the previous chapter elaborated what might be thought of as a destiny to which we must be answerable, I now turn to another, more active face of skepticism or sin, namely violence. What is the connection between violence and my relation to the other? How can the motives behind violence be understood, and how is it entangled with religion? Levinas’s understanding of how violence is bound up with the face of the other provides a rich phenomenological account, one that I believe can be supplemented with Cavell’s subtle understanding of its motivation.<br>

  Book Title: Gadamer-A Philosophical Portrait<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Keane Niall<br>
  Abstract: Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900-2002), one of the towering figures of contemporary Continental philosophy, is best known for Truth and Method, where he elaborated the concept of "philosophical hermeneutics," a programmatic way to get to what we do when we engage in interpretation. Donatella Di Cesare highlights the central place of Greek philosophy, particularly Plato, in Gadamer's work, brings out differences between his thought and that of Heidegger, and connects him with discussions and debates in pragmatism. This is a sensitive and thoroughly readable philosophical portrait of one of the 20th century's most powerful thinkers.<br>

  Abstract: What are the challenges that Nietzsche's philosophy poses for contemporary phenomenology? Elodie Boublil, Christine Daigle, and an international group of scholars take Nietzsche in new directions and shed light on the sources of phenomenological method in Nietzsche, echoes and influences of Nietzsche within modern phenomenology, and connections between Nietzsche, phenomenology, and ethics. Nietzsche and Phenomenology offers a historical and systematic reconsideration of the scope of Nietzsche's thought.<br>

  Abstract: I think it is difficult for any commentator to declare with total conviction that he has got Nietzsche right in terms of identifying him with a single or specific philosophical movement or doctrine. My view is that naturalism, existentialism, phenomenology, and poststructuralism can all, with a degree of plausibility, claim themselves heirs to his thinking.¹ Nietzsche is a thinker whose texts open up “possibilities,” and all these modes of thought can be found prefigured and at work in the text I focus on in this paper,

  Abstract: How can the seemingly separate lives of philosopher, feminist, and follower of a religious tradition come together in one person's life? How does religious commitment affect philosophy or feminism? How does feminism play out in religious or philosophical commitment? Wrestling with answers to these questions, women who balance philosophy, feminism, and faith write about their lives. The voices gathered here from several different traditions-Catholic, Protestant, Quaker, Jewish, and Muslim-represent diverse ethnicities, races, and ages. The challenging and poignant reflections in Philosophy, Feminism, and Faith show how critical thought can successfully mesh with religious faith and social responsibility.<br>

  Abstract: When we try to answer the question whether philosophy, feminism, and faith can be reconciled, we see that many people have attempted the reconciliation, and quite a few have done so to their own satisfaction. Despite the multitude of personally satisfying accounts, no universally accepted reconciliation has ever been constructed. To argue for the compatibility of philosophy, feminism, and faith, then, is not a mathematical sort of task—one that can be completed to the satisfaction of some professionally constituted public. Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that neither philosophy nor feminism is a unitary body of thought.<br>

  Abstract: Throughout this book I have underlined an issue that accompanies the various discourses of liberation and decolonial thought in Latin America, namely, the issue of its aesthetic dimension. As we saw, Dussel’s philosophy of liberation is based on a pre-rational and pre-linguistic sensibility, a sense of radical exteriority, that distinguishes humans. Quijano exposes a pre-rational disposition or sensibility that sustains the coloniality of power and knowledge. Moreover, as he goes on to uncover and engage ana-chronic simultaneity in Latin American existence, Quijano turns to the writers, poets, and artists of Latin America, who articulate senses of existence beyond and otherwise<br>

Many thought that Aquinas had not sufficiently distanced himself from the heterodox interpreters of Aristotle in his appropriation of the philosopher for Christian doctrine. Today Aquinas’s work is again at the center of a crisis, but in many ways an opposite one. Since Pope Leo XIII, in the 1879 encyclical

Montesquieu, like many others, held that the main cause of Europe’s technological and scientific advances was the harsh climate, which required the inhabitants to be inventive and sharp-witted to survive.

  Abstract: Coming from the “wilds” of Luxemburg, and having completed training in theology before “converting” to philosophy, I consider that I am totally atypical, in the sense that I was not influenced by any tradition or by any French schools of thought. My relationship to Heidegger preexisted my encounter with the “French Heideggerian School” represented by Jean Beaufret, Henri Birault, and many others. Of course, I had read their works, but all this was in addition to a relation to Heidegger that had already been established. More significantly, I<br>

  Book Title: Recognizing the Gift-Toward a Renewed Theology of Nature and Grace<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortres<br>
  Author(s): Rober Daniel A.<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the Gift puts twentieth-century Catholic theological conversations on nature and grace, particularly those of Henri de Lubac and Karl Rahner, into dialogue with Continental philosophy, notably the thought of Jean-Luc Marion and Paul Ricoeur. It argues that a renewed theology of nature and grace must build on the accomplishments of the recent past while acknowledging that an engagement with the political is unavoidable for theology. Ultimately, the aim is to revive and broaden discussion of nature and grace by drawing together the insights of contemporary theologians and Continental philosophers. Too often these areas of inquiry remain quite separate, in part due to differing priorities. This work tries to open that conversation, in part by critically pointing out, in dialogue with Ricoeur, the need in Marion’s work for an acknowledgment of recognition, reciprocity, and the political. It thus argues for a theology of nature and grace in terms of recognition of the gift, drawing out the reciprocal and political nature of gift and givenness in opposition to those, including Marion, who would seek to avoid politics and reciprocity as a proper avenue of inquiry for theology.<br>

  Abstract: The relationship between nature and grace was arguably the most-debated topic in Catholic theology in the early to middle twentieth century, a period that is now largely seen as culminating in the change in ecclesial and theological atmosphere surrounding the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965). These midcentury debates are the inevitable historical and theological backdrop for any contemporary study of nature and grace. This chapter thus explores the development of Catholic thought on nature and grace beginning with the work of Maurice Blondel against the backdrop of the Modernist controversy, continuing with the contributions of Pierre Rousselot, and concluding with<br>

The sermons of Peter, Stephen, and Paul in Acts all draw on Old Testament texts. The book of Hebrews, thought by some to be a collection of early Christian sermons, draws on material across the Old Testament, especially the Psalms. This chapter provides you with a disciplined, prayerful, and scholarly process for engaging Scripture.

  Author(s): Jones Jude<br>
  Abstract: The Varieties of Transcendence traces American pragmatist thought on religion and its relevance for theorizing religion today. The volume establishes pragmatist concepts of religious individualization as powerful alternatives to the more common secularization discourse. In stressing the importance of Josiah Royce's work, it emphasizes religious individualism's compatibility with community. At the same time, by covering all of the major classical pragmatist theories of religion, it shows their kinship and common focus on the interrelation between the challenges of contingency and the semiotic significance of transcendence.<br>

By learning from James’s explorations of religious experience, and by critically reassessing and redimensioning James’s pragmatism in a “Peirceanized” manner,¹ Royce develops a community-oriented, postdialectically dialectical,² semiotically informed, “reflective” theory of interpretation.

With respect to the utopian tradition, however, as A. L. Morton, the Marxist scholar of English utopianism, wrote, the Land of Cokaygne survives “as an almost secret tradition under the surface, while the mainstream of utopian thought passed through other channels.”²<br>

  Book Title: Walter Benjamin and Theology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SYMONS STÉPHANE<br>
  Abstract: In the Arcades Project, Walter Benjamin writes that his work is "related to theology as blotting pad is related to ink. It is saturated with it." For a thinker so decisive to critical literary, cultural, political, and aesthetic writings over the past half-century, Benjamin's relationship to theological matters has been less observed than it should, even despite a variety of attempts over the last four decades to illuminate the theological elements latent within his eclectic and occasional writings. Such attempts, though undeniably crucial to comprehending his thought, remain in need of deepened systematic analysis. In bringing together some of the most renowned experts from both sides of the Atlantic, Walter Benjamin and Theology seeks to establish a new site from which to address both the issue of Benjamin's relationship with theology and all the crucial aspects that Benjamin himself grappled with when addressing the field and operations of theological inquiry.<br>

Originating within the intellectual Left and facing minimal opposition from it, antitotalitarianism rapidly marginalized Marxist thought and undermined the legitimacy of the French revolutionary tradition, paving the way for the postmodern, liberal, and moderate republican political alternatives of the 1980s and 1990s.

  Book Title: A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VENEMA HENRY ISAAC<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's entire philosophical project narrates a passion for the possibleexpressed in the hope that in spite of death, closure, and sedimentation, life is opened by superabundance, by how the world gives us much more than is possible. Ricoeur's philosophical anthropology is a phenomenology of human capacity, which gives onto the groundless ground of human being, namely, God. Thus the story of the capable man, beginning with original goodness held captive by a servile will and ending with the possibility of liberation and regeneration of the heart, underpins his passion for the more than possible. The essays in this volume trace the fluid movement between phenomenological and religious descriptions of the capable self that emerges across Ricoeur's oeuvre and establish points of connection for future developments that might draw inspiration from this body of thought.<br>

  Book Title: Irony on Occasion: From Schlegel and Kierkegaard to Derrida and de Man-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Newmark Kevin<br>
  Abstract: What is it about irony--as an object of serious philosophical reflection and a literary technique of considerable elasticity--that makes it an occasion for endless critical debate? This book responds to this question by focusing on several key moments in German Romanticism and its afterlife in twentieth-century French thought and writing. It includes chapters on Friedrich Schlegel, Soren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Thomas Mann, Jean Paulhan, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida, and Paul de Man. A coda traces the way unresolved tensions inherited from Romanticism resurface in a novelist like J. M. Coetzee. But this book is neither a historical nor a thematic study of irony. To the degree that irony initiates a deflection of meaning, it also entails a divergence from historical and thematic models of understanding. The book therefore aims to respect irony's digressive force by allowing it to emerge from questions that sometimes have little or nothing to do with the ostensible topic of irony. For if irony is the possibility that whatever is being said does not coincide fully with whatever is being meant, then there is no guarantee that the most legitimate approach to the problem would proceed directly to those places where "irony" is named, described, or presumed to reside. Rather than providing a history of irony, then, this book examines particular occasions of ironic disruption. It thus offers an alternative model for conceiving of historical occurrences and their potential for acquiring meaning.<br>

  Abstract: In all likelihood, bibliographies will one day reveal that none of the proper names, movements, currents, or themes comprising the many strands of French thought in the twentieth century solicited more or more varied attempts at description and definition than
                  deconstruction. No doubt, it also produced the most frustration, since it is increasingly clear that in every case such attempts at description and definition fail to achieve their goal in satisfactory fashion. The failure is built in to the extent that, even in French, the very worddéconstructionalready belongs to more than just one language, thus making any effort<br>

  Author(s) McKeane John<br>
  Abstract: Jean-Luc Nancy is without doubt a post-Marxist, post-Heideggerian and—I would add—post-Arendtian thinker.¹ His ontology bears traces of all three, but this ontology flows, above all, from an attempt to think creation ex nihilo after the death of the creator God. Even now, so long after Nietzsche, and so very long after Descartes set the process of secularization in motion, it is a thinking that is only uneasily, hesitantly under way. We have gone beyond God, as Nancy puts it, but in a direction still too much determined by the thought of his death and by the necro-monotheist tradition<br>

  Book Title: Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Ethical Self-Christology, Ethics, and Formation<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Elliston Clark J.<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s work has persistently challenged Christian consciousness due to both his death at the hands of the Nazis and his provocative prison musings about Christian faithfulness in late modernity. Although understandable given the popularity of both narrative trajectories, such selective focus obscures the depth and fecundity of his overall corpus. Bonhoeffer’s early work, and particularly his Christocentric anthropology, grounds his later expressed commitments to responsibility and faithfulness in a “world come of age." While much debate accompanies claims regarding the continuity of Bonhoeffer’s thought, there are central motifs which pervade his work from his doctoral dissertation to the prison writings. This book suggests that a concern for otherness permeates all of Bonhoeffer’s work. Furthermore, Clark Elliston articulates, drawing on Bonhoeffer, a Christian self-defined by its orientation towards otherness. Taking Bonhoeffer as both the origin and point of return, the text engages Emmanuel Levinas and Simone Weil as dialogue partners who likewise stress the role of the other for self-understanding, albeit in diverse ways. By reading Bonhoeffer “through" their voices, one enhances Bonhoeffer’s already fertile understanding of responsibility.<br>

  Abstract: Biblical Performance Criticism is a way of understanding the Bible. It is the result of many streams of thought meeting over the last century, including form criticism, oral-tradition studies, rhetorical criticism, narrative criticism, memory studies, media studies, and performance studies. In some way, each of these streams analyzes four elements: (1) someone speaking, (2) someone hearing, (3) a text, and (4) a social situation. Each has contributed to the understanding that the Bible should be read in terms of the interaction of those four elements rather than any one of them in isolation.<br>

  Book Title: Writings on Medicine-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Todd<br>
  Abstract: At the time of his death in 1995, Georges Canguilhem was a highly respected historian of science and medicine, whose engagement with questions of normality, the ideologization of scientific thought, and the conceptual history of biology had marked the thought of philosophers such as Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Pierre Bourdieu, and Gilles Deleuze. This collection of short, incisive, and highly accessible essays on the major concepts of modern medicine shows Canguilhem at the peak of his use of historical practice for philosophical engagement. In order to elaborate a philosophy of medicine, Canguilhem examines paramount problems such as the definition and uses of health, the decline of the Hippocratic understanding of nature, the experience of disease, the limits of psychology in medicine, myths and realities of therapeutic practices, the difference between cure and healing, the organism's self-regulation, and medical metaphors linking the organism to society. Writings on Medicine is at once an excellent introduction to Canguilhem's work and a forceful, insightful, and accessible engagement with elemental concepts in medicine. The book is certain to leave its imprint on anthropology, history, philosophy, bioethics, and the social studies of medicine.<br>

  Book Title: Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): McGrath Brian<br>
  Abstract: Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism takes its title and point of departure from Walter Benjamin's concept of the historical constellation, which puts both "contemporary" and "romanticism" in play as period designations and critical paradigms. Featuring fascinating and diverse contributions by an international roster of distinguished scholars working in and out of romanticism--from deconstruction to new historicism, from queer theory to postcolonial studies, from visual culture to biopolitics--this volume makes good on a central tenet of Benjamin's conception of history: These critics "grasp the constellation" into which our "own era has formed with a definite earlier one." Each of these essays approaches romanticism as a decisive and unexpired thought experiment that makes demands on and poses questions for our own time: What is the unlived of a contemporary romanticism? What has romanticism's singular untimeliness bequeathed to futurity? What is romanticism's contemporary "redemption value" for painting and politics, philosophy and film?<br>

On the other hand (even though he denies it), his argumentation has crypto-theological accents to it: being, which conceals itself in its own names, like the unutterable God of negative theology, safeguarding its truth in a meditative and almost religious experience.

  Book Title: Provocations to Reading: J. Hillis Miller and the Democracy to Come-J. Hillis Miller and the Democracy to Come<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kujundžić Dragan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a marker of the state of theorytoday. Its rich array of wideranging essays explores the dimensions and implications of the work of J. Hillis Miller, one of the most eminent literary scholars in America. For nearly half a century, Miller has been known for his close and imaginative engagement with the implications of European philosophical thought and for his passionate advocacy of close reading.Building on this intellectual legacy, the contributors instantiate and extend the practice and ethics of sustained close reading that is Miller's hallmark. The book culminates in a moving piece by Jacques Derrida, Miller's close friend of forty years, who engages Miller's readings of Gerard Manley Hopkins in a historic encounter between French philosophy and American reading practices.A provocation to reading for new generations of students and teachers, these essays offer important resources for grasping the question of language in historical perspective and in contemporary life-a task essential for any democratic future. Barbara Cohen is Director of HumaniTech at the University of California, Irvine. She is co-editor of Material Events: Paul de Man and the Afterlife of Theory.

  Abstract: Historians of political thought have argued that the real Machiavelli is the republican thinker and theorist of civic virtù.

Taking the rhetorical Machiavel as a point of departure, Victoria Kahn argues that this figure is not simply the result of a naïve misreading of Machiavelli but is attuned to the rhetorical dimension of his political theory in a way that later thematic readings of Machiavelli are not. Her aim is to provide a revised history of Renaissance Machiavellism, particularly in England: one that sees the Machiavel and the republican as equally valid--and related--readings of Machiavelli's work.<br>

  Book Title: A Practice of Anthropology-The Thought and Influence of Marshall Sahlins<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KELLY JOHN D.<br>
  Abstract: Marshall Sahlins (b. 1930) is an American anthropologist who played a major role in the development of anthropological theory in the second half of the twentieth century. Over a sixty-year career, he and his colleagues synthesized trends in evolutionary, Marxist, and ecological anthropology, moving them into mainstream thought. Sahlins is considered a critic of reductive theories of human nature, an exponent of culture as a key concept in anthropology, and a politically engaged intellectual opposed to militarism and imperialism. This collection brings together some of the world’s most distinguished anthropologists to explore and advance Sahlins’s legacy. All of the essays are based on original research, most dealing with cultural change - a major theme of Sahlins’s research, especially in the contexts of Fijian and Hawaiian societies. Like Sahlins’s practice of anthropology, these essays display a rigorous, humanistic study of cultural forms, refusing to accept comfort over accuracy, not shirking from the moral implications of their analyses. Contributors include the late Greg Dening, one of the most eminent historians of the Pacific, Martha Kaplan, Patrick Kirch, Webb Keane, Jonathan Friedman, and Joel Robbins, with a preface by the late Claude Levi-Strauss. A unique volume that will complement the many books and articles by Sahlins himself, A Practice of Anthropology is an exciting new addition to the history of anthropological study.<br>

  Book Title: The Idea of Wilderness-From Prehistory to the Age of Ecology<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): OELSCHLAEGER MAX<br>
  Abstract: Oelschlaeger begins by examining the culture of prehistoric hunter-gatherers, whose totems symbolized the idea of organic unity between humankind and wild nature, and idea that the author believes is essential to any attempt to define human potential. He next traces how the transformation of these hunter-gatherers into farmers led to a new awareness of distinctions between humankind and nature, and how Hellenism and Judeo-Christianity later introduced the unprecedented concept that nature was valueless until humanized. Oelschlaeger discusses the concept of wilderness in relation to the rise of classical science and modernism, and shows that opposition to "modernism" arose almost immediately from scientific, literary, and philosophical communities. He provides new and, in some cases, revisionist studies of the seminal American figures Thoreau, Muir, and Leopold, and he gives fresh readings of America's two prodigious wilderness poets Robinson Jeffers and Gary Snyder. He concludes with a searching look at the relationship of evolutionary thought to our postmodern effort to reconceptualize ourselves as civilized beings who remain, in some ways, natural animals.<br>

  Book Title: Wallace Stevens among Others-Diva-Dames, Deleuze, and American Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): JARRAWAY DAVID R.<br>
  Abstract: In Wallace Stevens among Others David Jarraway explores the extraordinary achievement of Wallace Stevens, but in contexts that are not usually thought about in connection with Stevens's work - gay literature, contemporary fiction, Hollywood film, and avant-garde architecture, among others. By viewing the poet among these "other" contexts, Jarraway considers the nature of self-reflection and pays special attention to the discrediting of self-presence as the principle of identity in American writing - a theme that reflects American authors’ abiding concern for subjectivities that engage the world from spaces of distance and difference. By returning to the work of Stevens, Jarraway seeks to refurbish this preoccupation by linking it to the literary theory of French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, whose work applies to American writers from Melville and Whitman to Fitzgerald and Cummings. Jarraway forges the link between Deleuze and Stevens by drawing out the female subjectivity found in each writer’s work to rethink the more static masculinist premises of being. Informed by a deep knowledge of and fluency with the work of Stevens and Deleuze, Jarraway uses these writers as a means of entry into American literature and culture, Wallace Stevens among Others is a sophisticated analysis that will open new directions for future scholarship.<br>

  Book Title: Archaeology and Memory-  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): Borić Dušan<br>
  Abstract: Memory can be both a horrifying trauma and an empowering resource. From the Ancient Greeks to Nietzsche and Derrida, the dilemma about the relationship between history and memory has filled many pages, with one important question singled out: is the writing of history to memory a remedy or a poison? Recently, a growing interest in and preoccupation with the issue of memory, remembering and forgetting has resulted in a proliferation of published works, in various disciplines, that have memory as their focus. This trend, to which the present volume contributes, has started to occupy the dominant discourses of disciplines such as sociology, philosophy, history, anthropology and archaeology, and has also disseminated into the wider public discourse of society and culture today. Such a condition may perhaps echo the phenomenon of a melancholic experience at the turn of the millennium. Archaeology and Memory seeks to examine the diversity of mnemonic systems and their significance in different past contexts as well as the epistemological and ontological importance of archaeological practice and narratives in constituting the human historical condition. The twelve substantial contributions in this volume cover a diverse set of regional examples and focus on a range of prehistoric and classical case studies in Eurasian regional contexts as well as on the predicaments of memory in examples of the archaeologies of 'contemporary past'. From the Mesolithic and Neolithic burial chambers to the trenches of World War I and the role of materiality in international criminal courts, a number of contributors examine how people in the past have thought about their own pasts, while others reflect on our own present-day sensibilities in dealing with the material testimonies of recent history. Both kinds of papers offer wider theoretical reflections on materiality, archaeological methodologies and the ethical responsibilities of archaeological narration about the past.<br>

  Book Title: Atheism for Beginners-A Coursebook for Schools and Colleges<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Palmer Michael<br>
  Abstract: The word ‘atheism’ is derived from the Greek: a meaning ‘not’ is conjoined with theos meaning ‘god’. So atheism may be defined as follows: it is the belief that there is no God. Unfortunately definition of terms is rarely this straightforward. In this educational book, Michael Palmer undertakes to analyse, develop and discuss the complex and too often reduced notion of atheism. In spite of the consciously atheist point of view adopted by the author, the volume remains critical and objective, making religious, philosophical and political concepts around atheism understandable. Even though the book clearly addresses a young audience, any kind of reader will find food for thought in this vivid and detailed work.<br>

  Abstract: This book has been a sustained attempt to revise John Howard Yoder’s sociological theology so that it might better avoid charges of reducing theology to sociology, method to ideology, and expansive Christian witness to narrow socio-political perfectionism. Pierre Bourdieu’s relational sociology has been the primary tool of revision, as it enables amendments to Yoder’s social theoretical assumptions that render them more clearly non-reductive. Several of Bourdieu’s key concepts were put into conversation with Yoder’s theology of the principalities and powers, his broader

  Author(s): Blanco Carlos<br>
  Abstract: Few questions exert such a great fascination on human conscience as those related to the meaning of life, history, and death. The belief in the resurrection of the dead constitutes an answer to a real challenge: What is the meaning of life and history in the midst of a world in which evil, injustice, and ultimately death exist? Resurrection is an instrument serving a broader, more encompassing reality: the Kingdom of God. Such a utopian Kingdom gathers the final response to the problem of theodicy and to the enigma of history. <CR><CR> This book seeks to understand the idea of resurrection not only as a theological but also as a philosophical category (as expression of the collective aspirations of humanity), combining historical, theological, and philosophical analyses in dialogue with some of the principal streams of contemporary Western thought.<br>

  Book Title: The Atheist's Primer-  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Palmer Michael<br>
  Abstract: In The Atheist's Primer, a prominent philosopher, Dr Michael Palmer, reinstates the importance of philosophy in the debate about God's existence. The 'new atheism' of Richard Dawkins and others has been driven by largely Darwinian objections to God's existence, limiting the debate to within a principally scientific framework. This has obscured the philosophical tradition of atheism, in which the main intellectual landmarks in atheism's history are to be found. With an analysis of atheistic thought from the Ancient Greeks to the present day, Palmer explains and comments on the philosophical arguments warranting atheism, discussing issues such as evil, morality, miracles, and the motivations for belief. The emphasis placed on materialism and the limitations of our knowledge might seem disheartening to some; but Palmer concludes on a positive note, arguing – alongside Nietzsche, Marx and Freud and many others – that happiness and personal fulfilment are to be found in the very materialism that religious belief rejects. Michael Palmer first addressed these issues in his student-oriented edition, The Atheist's Creed, of which The Atheist's Primer is a revised abridgement for the general reader. Palmer has now stripped out the primary texts and expanded his commentaries into fluent and concise analyses of the arguments. Free of philosophical jargon and assumptions of prior knowledge, this is an important introduction to a major cultural debate.<br>

  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Dearborn Kerry<br>
  Abstract: The Holy Spirit, as God’s abiding presence to draw people to Christ, can cleanse wounds and bring love and hope into our hearts. Kerry Dearborn’s insightful focus on the Holy Spirit transforming our moral imagination and putting us on the path of reconciliation with Jesus Christ is both profound and encouraging. Biblical analysis, historical surveys and references to acclaimed theological authors support Dearborn’s nuanced yet practical application of imagination as a tool for awakening, recovery, and dissolving intellectual or psychological barriers that isolate us from God. She considers effectively how imagination can be connected to reality, and is able to delve deep into this vein of thought with startling clarity. Drinking from the Wells of New Creation provides spiritual guidance for dealing with oppression in society; an issue that affects people both within and outside the Christian faith. The acknowledgement of reconciliation as a creative process provides a fresh outlook and will excite those delving into both theological and psychological studies, as well as those seeking to understand God’s unification of life, regardless of tribe, tongue and nation.<br>

  Book Title: The Gift of the Other-Levinas, Derrida, and a Theology of Hospitality<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Bouma-Prediger Steven<br>
  Abstract: We live in an age of global capitalism and terror. In a climate of consumption and fear the unknown Other is regarded as a threat to our safety, a client to assist, or a competitor to be overcome in the struggle for scarce resources. And yet, the Christian Scriptures explicitly summon us to welcome strangers, to care for the widow and the orphan, and to build relationships with those distant from us. But how, in this world of hostility and commodification, do we practice hospitality? In The Gift of the Other, Andrew Shepherd engages deeply with the influential thought of French thinkers Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida, and argues that a true vision of hospitality is ultimately found not in postmodern philosophies but in the Christian narrative. The book offers a compelling Trinitarian account of the God of hospitality—a God of communion who “makes room" for otherness, who overcomes the hostility of the world though Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection, and who through the work of the Spirit is forming a new community: the Church—a people of welcome.<br>

  Book Title: Sacramental Presence after Heidegger-Onto-theology, Sacraments, and the Mother's Smile<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Sweeney Conor<br>
  Abstract: "Theology after Heidegger must take into account history and language as elements in the pursuit of meaning. Quite often, this prompts a hurried flight from metaphysics to an embrace of an absence at the center of Christian narrativity. Conor Sweeney here explores the “postmodern" critique of presence in the context of sacramental theology, engaging the thought of Louis-Marie Chauvet and Lieven Boeve. Chauvet is an influential postmodern theologian whose critique of the perceived onto-theological constitution of presence in traditional sacramental theology has made big waves, while Boeve is part of a more recent generation of theologians who even more wholeheartedly embrace postmodern consequences for theology. Sweeney considers the extent to which postmodernism à la Heidegger upsets the hermeneutics of sacramentality, asking whether this requires us to renounce the search for a presence that by definition transcends us. Against both the fetishization of presence and absence, Sweeney argues that metaphysics has a properly sacramental basis, and that it is only through this reality that the dialectic of presence and absence can be transcended. The case is made for the full but restless signification of the mother’s smile as the paradigm for genuine sacramental presence."<br>

  Book Title: Jesus and the Cross-Necessity, Meaning, and Atonement<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Laughlin Peter<br>
  Abstract: According to the Nicene Creed, Christ died for us and for our salvation. But while all Christians agree that Christ’s death and resurrection has saving significance, there is little unanimity in how and why that is the case. In fact, Christian history is littered with accounts of the redemptive value of Christ’s death, and new models and motifs are constantly being proposed, many of which now stand in stark contrast to earlier thought. How then should contemporary articulations of the importance of the death of Christ be judged? At the heart of this book is the contention that Christian reflection on the atonement is faithful inasmuch as it incorporates the intention that Jesus himself had for his death. In a wide-reaching study, the author draws from both classical scholarship and recent work on the historical Jesus to argue that not only did Jesus imbue his death with redemptive meaning but that such meaning should impact expressions of the saving significance of the cross.<br>

An uncritical reaction to this type of question is to answer with an indignant affirmation, since there is more than a little audacity in the suggestion that Jesus’ intention is irrelevant to the Christian proclamation of salvation.

  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Goodwin Philip W.<br>
  Abstract: In his detailed and thought-provoking work, Philip Goodwin conducts a thorough analysis of the challenges facing the Biblical translator, with particular focus on the problematic dominance of the King James Version of the Bible in our imaginations – a dominance which has had a deleterious effect upon the accuracy and originality of the translator's work. Goodwin considers the first two chapters of the Lukan narratives in depth, comparing and contrasting a breadth of widely disparate translations and drawing on a rich body of Biblical scholarship to support his thesis. A wide-ranging discussion of other linguistic issues is also conducted, touching on such vital matters as incorporating the contextual implications of the original text, and the attempt to challenge the reader's pre-existing encyclopaedic knowledge. Goodwin evolves a fresh and comprehensive answer to the difficulties of the translator's task, and concludes by providing his own original and charming translation of the first two chapters of Luke's Gospel. 'Translating the English Bible' provides a fascinating insight into the processes of translation and will interest anyone seeking accuracy and fidelity to the Scriptural message. It will also enlighten readers seeking a challenging translation of Luke that casts off the shackles of the 'Holy Marriage' tradition of Biblical translation.<br>

  Book Title: From Faith to Faith-John Wesley’s Covenant Theology and the Way of Salvation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Noble T. A.<br>
  Abstract: The very title of this volume makes a claim and extends an invitation. Simply put, the claim is this: John Wesley was an adherent of covenant theology. Consequently, a proper understanding of his theological thought - and of his soteriology in particular - is impossible apart from accounting for the influence of covenant theology on him. The invitation then, is to investigate Wesley's thought in light of this claim. Having started his research simply as an investigation into a rather curious distinction Wesley made among those to whom he gave spiritual counsel (some people, he said, have "the faith of a servant"; others have "the faith of a son"), Rodes soon realised that covenant theology was an immensely powerful influence on Wesley's thought, and that he was even able to significantly and creatively adapted it to the template of his evangelical Arminianism.<br>

  Abstract: Despite the evidence of Wesley’s thoughtful distillation of the covenant theology mediated to him, we might yet be tempted to conclude that he appreciated its theological value only as a craftsman prizes and uses each tool in his toolbox. But suppose covenant theology was not just a tool in Wesley’s hands? Suppose it was a core feature of the infrastructure of his theological thought and consequently influenced the way he used each tool in his toolbox?<br>

  Abstract: The Baar Statement of the World Council Churches (1990) encouraged Christian theology to improve concern about other religions and take issue with interreligious dialogue in exploration of the theology of religious pluralism. The theology of religions has become more and more attractive, but also controversial in its encounter with postmodern thought and hermeneutic theory. In the circle of theology of religions, Martin Luther and Karl Barth have undergone intensive criticism for their conservative-evangelical attitude toward world religions.

  Book Title: Comparing Faithfully-Insights for Systematic Theological Reflection<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS MICHELLE VOSS<br>
  Abstract: Every generation of theologians must respond to its context by rearticulating the central tenets of the faith. Interreligious comparison has been integral to this process from the start of the Christian tradition and is especially salient today. The emerging field of comparative theology, in which close study of another religious tradition yields new questions and categories for theological reflection in the scholar's home tradition, embodies the ecumenical spirit of this moment. This discipline has the potential to enrich systematic theology and, by extension, theological education, at its foundations. This resource for pastors and theology students reconsiders five central doctrines of the Christian faith in light of focused interreligious investigations. The dialogical format of the book builds conversation about the doctrine of God, theodicy, humanity, Christology, and soteriology. Its comparative essays span examples from Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, Jain, and Confucian traditions, indigenous Aztec theology, and contemporary "spiritual but not religious" thought, to offer exciting new perspectives on Christian doctrine. The essays in this volume demonstrate that engagement with religious diversity need not be an afterthought in the study of Christian systematic theology; rather, it can be a way into systematic theological thinking. Each section invites students to test theological categories, to consider Christian doctrine in relation to specific comparisons, and to take up comparative study in their own contexts.<br>

  Book Title: The Wedding Feast of the Lamb-Eros, the Body, and the Eucharist<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hughes George<br>
  Abstract: Emmanuel Falque's The Wedding Feast of the Lamb represents a turning point in his thought. Here, Falque links philosophy and theology in an original fashion that allows us to see the full effect of theology's "backlash" against philosophy. By attending closely to the incarnation and the eucharist, Falque develops a new concept of the body and of love: By avoiding the common mistake of "angelism"--consciousness without body--Falque considers the depths to which our humanity reflects animality, or body without consciousness. He shows the continued relevance of the question "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" (John 6:52), especially to philosophy. We need to question the meaning of "this is my body" in "a way that responds to the needs of our time" (Vatican II). Because of the ways that "Hoc est corpus meum" has shaped our culture and our modernity, this is a problem both for religious belief and for culture.<br>

  Abstract: From an early age, Loren Eiseley lived his life betwixt and between various kinds of “two cultures” experiences: the two linguistic worlds of his parents’ disparate communication styles; the distinct realms of private thought and public expression; the separate but concentric spheres of personal and professional discourses; and the two intellectual and academic domains traditionally described as “

Over time, he developed vital skills of empathy and analysis<br>

  Book Title: Contemporary Comics Storytelling-  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): KUKKONEN KARIN<br>
  Abstract: Applying a cognitive approach to reading comics in all their narrative richness and intricacy,
      Contemporary Comics Storytellingopens an intriguing perspective on how these works engage the legacy of postmodernism-its subversion, self-reflexivity, and moral contingency. Its three case studies trace how contemporary comics tie into deep traditions of visual and verbal storytelling, how they reevaluate their own status as fiction, and how the fictional minds of their characters generate complex ethical thought experiments. At a time when the medium is taken more and more seriously as intricate and compelling literary art, this book lays the groundwork for an analysis of the ways in which comics challenge and engage readers' minds. It brings together comics studies with narratology and literary criticism and, in so doing, provides a new set of tools for evaluating the graphic novel as an emergent literary form.<br>

  Abstract: What constitutes “Frenchness”? Until recently we thought we knew. After all, France is regarded as “the oldest nation of Europe,” a recognizable geographic and political entity dating from the early Middle Ages. Fernand Braudel, arguably France’s most influential historian of the twentieth century, has located the essence of French identity in the deeper patterns of French geography, demography, and the environment that emerged over centuries.¹ France has been historically at the center of Europe in terms of power and the influence of its culture and civilization.

  Abstract: In this book, Jaime Rodr+¡guez Matos proposes the GÇ£formlessGÇ¥ as a point of departure in thinking through the relationship between politics and time. Thinking through both literary and political writings around the Cuban Revolution, Rodr+¡guez Matos explores the link between abstract symbolic procedures and various political experiments that have sought to give form to a principle of sovereignty based on the category of representation. In doing so, he proposes the formless as the limit of modern and contemporary reflections on the meaning of politics while exploring the philosophical consequences of a formless concept of temporality for the critique of metaphysics._x000D_ Rodr+¡guez Matos takes the writing and thought of Jos+¬ Lezama Lima as the guiding thread in exploring the possibility of a politicity in which time is imagined beyond the disciplining functions it has had throughout the metaphysical traditionGÇöa time of the absence of time, in which the absence of time no longer means eternity.<br>

The absence of the leader coincided with the reappearance of figures who had been in positions of power during some of the Revolution’s most repressive years.

In other words, theorization is understood as a form of neutralization of the historical context.

  Book Title: Indebted-Capitalism and Religion in the Writings of S. Y. Agnon<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Sagiv Yonatan<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book to examine the oeuvre of Shmuel Yosef Agnon, 1966 Nobel laureate in literature, through a reading that combines perspectives from economic theory, semiotics, psychoanalysis, narrative theory, and Jewish and religious studies. Sagiv outlines the vital role economy plays in the construction of religion, subjectivity, language, and thought in Agnon's work, and, accordingly, explores his literary use of images of debt, money, and economy to examine how these themes illuminate other focal points in the canonical author's work, excavating the economic infrastructure of discourses that are commonly considered to reside beyond the economic sphere.Sagiv's analysis of Agnon's work, renowned for its paradoxical articulation of the impact of modernity on traditional Jewish society, exposes an overarching distrust regarding the sustainability of any economic structure. The concrete and symbolic economies surveyed in this project are prone to cyclical crises. Under what Sagiv terms Agnon's "law of permanent debt," the stability and profitability of economies are always temporary. Agnon's literary economy, transgressing traditional closures, together with his profound irony, make it impossible to determine if these economic crises are indeed the product of the break with tradition or, alternatively, if this theodicy is but a fantasy, marking permanent debt as the inherent economic infrastructure of human existence.<br>

  Abstract: The form of tragedy and the traditional mode of expressing man’s tragic condition in the theatre were, as is well known, some of Bertolt Brecht’s most controversial targets.¹ There are two sets of reasons for this. The first is technical, because classical tragedy and the drama that derives from it belong, as Brecht saw it, to a kind of theatre that does not arouse the critical spirit and the dialectical attitude. The second is philosophical, because they are founded on an idea of destiny and the immutability or universality of human thought, in conflict with Brecht’s Marxian principles.²<br>

This chapter argues that the reason for this anomaly lies with Bourdieu’s theory of habitus (a central element of Bourdieusian thought) and the particular problems that this theory poses for researchers of new social movements.

  Abstract: Light figures being; darkness, death. Bridging mathematical science, semantics, rhetoric, grammar, and major poems, Judith H. Anderson seeks to negotiate writings from multiple disciplines in the shared terms of poiesis and figuration rather than as cultural opposites. Analogy, a type of metaphor, has always been the connector of the known to the unknown, the sensible to the infinite. Anderson’s study moves from the figuration of light and death to the history of analogy and its pertinence to light in physics and metaphysics, from Kepler to Donne, Spenser, and Milton. Topics proliferate: creativity, optics, the relation of literature to science, the methodology of thought and argument, and the processes of narrative, discovery, and interpretation.<br>

  Abstract: In ecological thought, thinking big is back in a big way. And why not? The twin problems of global warming and global pollution are intensified by an energy-reliant system of ACCUMULATION and dispossession that operates at a global scale. Thinking big seems to match the scale of solution-seeking to the size of the problem. Announcing the emergence of an interdisciplinary field they call “energy humanities,” Dominic Boyer and Imre Szeman frame this problem as an ecology-energy impasse: “It is not an exaggeration to ask whether human civilization has a future.

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

  Book Title: Placing Aesthetics-Reflections on the Philosophic Tradition<br>
  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wood Robert E.<br>
  Abstract: Examining select high points in the speculative tradition from Plato and Aristotle through the Middle Ages and German tradition to Dewey and Heidegger,
      Placing Aestheticsseeks to locate the aesthetic concern within the larger framework of each thinker's philosophy.In Professor Robert Wood's study, aesthetics is not peripheral but rather central to the speculative tradition and to human existence as such. In Dewey's terms, aesthetics is "experience in its integrity." Its personal ground is in "the heart," which is the dispositional ground formed by genetic, cultural , and personal historical factors by which we are spontaneously moved and, in turn, are inclined to move, both practically and theoretically, in certain directions.Prepared for use by the student as well as the philosopher,Placing Aestheticsaims to recover the fullness of humanness within a sense of the fullness of encompassing Being. It attempts to overcome the splitting of thought, even in philosophy, into exclusive specializations and the fracturing of life itself into theoretical, practical, and emotive dimensions.<br>

Heidegger’s approach falls in the line of his teacher, Edmund Husserl, the founder of Phenomenology. Husserl understood Phenomenology to be comprehensive philosophy; it is at least permanent prolegomenon, acknowledged or not, to any philosophy. Phenomenology comes from two Greek terms,phainomenon, appearance, andlogos, essence.

  Book Title: Prophetic Politics-Emmanuel Levinas and the Sanctification of Suffering<br>
  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): HAROLD PHILIP J.<br>
  Abstract: In
      Prophetic Politics,Philip J. Haroldoffers an original interpretation of the political dimension of Emmanuel Levinas's thought. Harold argues that Levinas's mature position inOtherwise Than Beingbreaks radically with the dialogical inclinations of his earlierTotality and Infinityand that transformation manifests itself most clearly in the peculiar nature of Levinas's relationship to politics.Levinas's philosophy is concerned not with the ethical per se, in either its applied or its transcendent forms, but with the source of ethics. Once this source is revealed to be an anarchic interruption of our efforts to think the ethical, Levinas's political claims cannot be read as straightforward ideological positions or principles for political action. They are instead to be understood "prophetically," a position that Harold finds comparable to the communitarian critique of liberalism offered by such writers as Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor. In developing this interpretation, which runs counter to formative influences from the phenomenological tradition, Harold traces Levinas's debt to phenomenological descriptions of such experiences as empathy and playfulness.Prophetic Politicswill highlight the relevance of the phenomenological tradition to contemporary ethical and political thought-a long-standing goal of the series-while also making a significant and original contribution to Levinas scholarship.<br>

Skillfully blending intellectual, political, and cultural history, Jan-Werner Müller elucidates the ideas that shaped the period of ideological extremes before 1945 and the liberalization of West European politics after the Second World War. He also offers vivid portraits of famous as well as unjustly forgotten political thinkers and the movements and institutions they inspired.Müller pays particular attention to ideas advanced to justify fascism and how they relate to the special kind of liberal democracy that was created in postwar Western Europe. He also explains the impact of the 1960s and neoliberalism, ending with a critical assessment of today's self-consciously post-ideological age.<br>

  Abstract: In a highly unusual combination of critical theory and analytic philosophy, the author sees all literary work, from novels to poems, as a strategy to contain a reality that seeks to thwart that containment, and in doing so throws up new problems that the work tries to resolve. The "event" of literature, Eagleton argues, consists in this continual transformative encounter, unique and endlessly repeatable. Freewheeling through centuries of critical ideas, he sheds light on the place of literature in our culture, and in doing so reaffirms the value and validity of literary thought today.<br>

  Book Title: The Spirit of Early Christian Thought-Seeking the Face of God<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilken Robert Louis<br>
  Abstract: In this eloquent introduction to early Christian thought, eminent religious historian Robert Louis Wilken examines the tradition that such figures as St. Augustine, Gregory of Nyssa, and others set in place. These early thinkers constructed a new intellectual and spiritual world, Wilken shows, and they can still be heard as living voices in the modern world.<br>

In such cases, it is my claim that the otherness of others is constitutive of his philosophy.

  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Krystal Arthur<br>
  Abstract: We disagree. From small questions of taste to large questions concerning the nature of existence, intellectual debate takes up much of our time. In this book the respected literary critic Arthur Krystal examines what most commentators ignore: the role of temperament and taste in the forming of aesthetic and ideological opinions. In provocative essays about reading and writing, about the relation between life and literature, about knowledge and certainty, about God and death, and about his own gradual disaffection with the literary scene, Krystal demonstrates that opposing points of view are based more on innate predilections than on disinterested thought or analysis.Not beholden to any fashionable theory or political agenda, Krystal interrogates the usual suspects in the cultural wars from an independent, though not impartial, vantage point. Clearly personal and unabashedly belletrist, his essays ask important questions. What makes culture one thing and not another? What inspires aesthetic values? What drives us to make comparisons? And how does a bias for one kind of evidence as opposed to another contribute to the form and content of intellectual argument?<br>

However, such a distinctive definition of eroticism seems to be compromised by the concept of pornography, which, at least over the last fifteen years, is increasingly thought to circumscribe the same semantic space.¹ This confirms that the concept of eroticism is highly subjective as it depends on a moral judgment, which, by virtue of its very existence, makes the theoretical use of the former concept unstable.

  Abstract: La presente Tesis estudia las relaciones entre la ciencia y la poesía. Nuestro trabajo aborda el modo en que el conocimiento científico modula la creación literaria, así como algunos de los procedimientos del pensamiento literario. Las hipótesis de investigación reposan sobre dos niveles de la escritura de Lorand Gaspar: la dimensión epistemológica del discurso poético y su valor cognitivo. A partir del análisis de un corpus literario se propone una metodología de estudio que atiende a la complejidad epistemológica y cognitiva de la enunciación poética. Tres apartados teóricos organizan la investigación de algunos de los procesos del pensamiento poético: percepción, emoción y metáfora. Lo anterior se enmarca en una argumentación que favorece la transdisciplinariedad mediante estrategias de análisis literario que integran consideraciones de carácter interdisciplinar.This thesis studies the relations between Science and Poetry. The research approaches the way in which the scientific knowledge modulates the literary creation, as well as some of the procedures of the literary thought. The hypotheses of investigation rest on two levels of Lorand Gaspar’s writing: the epistemological dimension and the cognitive value of the poetic discourse. Based on the analysis of a literary corpus this research proposes a methodology of study that attends to the epistemological and cognitive complexity of the lyrical enunciation.

  Abstract: What has contemporary China inherited from its revolutionary past? How do the realities and memories, aesthetics and practices of the Mao era still reverberate in the post-Mao cultural landscape? The essays in this volume propose “red legacies" as a new critical framework from which to examine the profusion of cultural productions and afterlives of the communist revolution in order to understand China’s continuities and transformations from socialism to postsocialism. Organized into five parts—red foundations, red icons, red classics, red bodies, and red shadows—the book’s interdisciplinary contributions focus on visual and performing arts, literature and film, language and thought, architecture, museums, and memorials. Mediating at once unfulfilled ideals and unmourned ghosts across generations, red cultural legacies suggest both inheritance and debt, and can be mobilized to support as well as to critique the status quo.<br>

  Book Title: Transmitters and Creators-Chinese Commentators and Commentaries on the Analects<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Makeham John<br>
  Abstract: The Analects (Lunyu) is one of the most influential texts in human history. As a putative record of Confucius’s (551–479 B.C.E.) teachings and a foundational text in scriptural Confucianism, this classic was instrumental in shaping intellectual traditions in China and East Asia until the early twentieth century. But no premodern reader read only the text of the Analects itself. Rather, the Analects was embedded in a web of interpretation that mediated its meaning. Modern interpreters of the Analects only rarely acknowledge this legacy of two thousand years of commentaries. How well do we understand prominent or key commentaries from this tradition? How often do we read such commentaries as we might read the text on which they comment? Many commentaries do more than simply comment on a text. Not only do they shape the reading of the text, but passages of text serve as pretexts for the commentator to develop and expound his own body of thought. This book attempts to redress our neglect of commentaries by analyzing four key works dating from the late second century to the mid-nineteenth century (a period substantially contemporaneous with the rise and decline of scriptural Confucianism): the commentaries of He Yan (ca. 190–249); Huang Kan (488–545); Zhu Xi (1130–1200); and Liu Baonan (1791–1855) and Liu Gongmian (1821–1880).<br>

The difficulty is compounded by one of the logically prior challenges of making sense of Panikkar: the idiosyncratic relationship between the publishing dates of Panikkar’s books and other writings and the actual genesis of their content. At times, this makes it difficult to understand the development of Panikkar’s thought, even about a single issue. Nonetheless,<br>

  Abstract: To ask what Franz Boas would have thought of 9/11 is obviously to engage in an act of historical and biographical imagination, but also one of self-examination. I would argue that we anthropologists, especially those of us trained in the great Americanist tradition of cultural anthropology and historical ethnography, feel that we know Boas. Indeed, we have internalized him in some way, like a beloved dead relative, and so, in some sense, his reaction is our reaction. As in any time of crisis, the crisis of the past decade that was ushered in on that bright September morning and that<br>

  Abstract: I found myself the other day—and upon reflection this was an astonishing thing to say, no less think—wishing my son were seven years old again. He was adorable at seven. The vexations of the teenage years were far off, and he still liked me. But I said this not because I find having an empty nest unbearable, although at times I do, or that I long to raise a teenager again—and eventually he would be a maddening teenager again. I just thought—felt, even—that he would be safer at home, with us.<br>

  Book Title: Nietzsche's Great Politics-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): DROCHON HUGO<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche's Great Politicsshows how Nietzsche made Bismarck's notion his own, enabling him to offer a vision of a unified European political order that was to serve as a counterbalance to both Britain and Russia. This order was to be led by a "good European" cultural elite whose goal would be to encourage the rebirth of Greek high culture. In relocating Nietzsche's politics to their own time, the book offers not only a novel reading of the philosopher but also a more accurate picture of why his political thought remains so relevant today.<br>

  Abstract: Why Curll, of all people? A natural reaction to the title of this essay might be to wonder what the rascally publisher Edmund Curll has to do with narratology, the theme of this volume. It might be thought that Curll (1683-1747) was an interesting fellow, no doubt, but scarcely a pioneer of writerly innovation. The case I shall try to make here is that Curll’s most characteristic productions, above all the instant biographies he brought out in the late 1720s and early 1730s, do tell us something about paratext – specifically on the way it constitutes a type of narrative statement<br>

  Abstract: Throughout his life, John Henry Newman (1801–90) was concerned with the challenge that the rationalism of his time, which he often called “liberalism,” addressed to Christianity. In this chapter, therefore, we shall concentrate on aspects of his thought that shed light on his account of the faith process—a process he viewed as much broader and deeper than any rationalist methodology. In this respect, most innovative and valuable are his notions of “real apprehension” and “inference.”<br>

Much more surprising, however, is his belief that the cultivation of character also requires incongruence. Despite his well-known prohibition against lying and a related distaste for hypocrisy, Kant often recommends something strikingly similar to both. Specifically, he recommends both

  Abstract: Through her critical and productive dialogue with multiple phenomenological thinkers, Dastur concisely shows each thinker's debts to and departures from others, as well as each thinker's innovations and limitations. She does this judiciously, without choosing sides because, for her, phenomenology is above all a way of thinking through a problem and practicing a method. The fecundity of the movement is appreciated only by participating in it-phenomenology has always thought of itself as philosophical research undertaken by and through a community of thinkers who share certain fundamental questions and ways of approaching those questions, even if their responses to these questions often differ. In this regard, Dastur is both one of the clearest guides to phenomenology and one of its ablest practitioners.<br>

  Abstract: The still relatively new field of comparative theology has made great strides in the past few decades, growing into an internationally recognized field with departments in major universities. Throughout this growth, comparative theology has engaged a wide range of religious traditions and has addressed a similarly diverse range of topics within religious thought and practice. Yet, reflecting a wider phenomenon in theology more broadly defined, comparative theology has consistently remained a largely textual venture, based in the comparative reading of religious texts.<br>

  Book Title: The Forgiveness to Come-The Holocaust and the Hyper-Ethical<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Berkowitz Roger<br>
  Abstract: Accompanied by Jacques Derrida's thought of forgiveness of the unforgivable, and its elaboration in relation to crimes against humanity, the book undertakes close readings of literary, philosophical, and cinematic texts by Simon Wiesenthal, Jean Améry, Vladimir Jankélévitch, Robert Antelme and Eva Mozes Kor. These texts contend with the idea that the crimes of the Nazis are inexpiable, that they lie beyond any possible atonement or repair. Banki argues that the juridical concept of crimes against humanity calls for a thought of forgiveness-one that would not imply closure of the infinite wounds of the past. How could such a forgiveness be thought or dreamed? Banki shows that if today we cannot simply escape the "worldwidization" of forgiveness, then it is necessary to rethink what forgiveness is, the conditions under which it supposedly takes place, and especially its relation to justice.<br>

Moving slowly toward their conceptualizations of love and heroism, Esposito unravels the West's illusory metaphysical dream of peace, obliging us to reevaluate ceaselessly what it means to be responsible in the wake of past and contemporary forms of war.<br>

  Abstract: Best known as a child psychologist, Jean Piaget considered himself primarily an epistemologist who was engaged in empirical research on the development of knowledge. In this book, philosopher and psychologist Richard F. Kitchener provides the first comprehensive study in English of Piaget's genetic epistemology, or his theory of knowledge. Drawing largely on a careful perusal of Piaget's untranslated works, Kitchener presents little-known aspects of Piaget's thought and argues that, in fact, Piagest has been misunderstood and was completely justified in his claim to be an epistemologist rather than a psychologist.<br>

  Abstract: It is fascinating how often ostensibly empirical debates in the human sciences actually rest on largely unarticulated philosophical antinomies. So it is that within cognitive approaches to dreaming we find intimations of a hidden and very old agenda. Does an empirically based account of dreaming require a theory of constructive imagination—with its roots in the idealist/romanticist tradition of Western thought? Or rather does it afford yet another opportunity to demonstrate that all imagination is really just a complex form of memory and learning-an extension of the rationalist and reductionist attempt, now computerized, to understand the complex in terms of<br>

  Book Title: Norms of Rhetorical Culture-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Farrell Thomas B.<br>
  Abstract: Rhetoric is widely regarded by both its detractors and advocates as a kind of antithesis to reason. In this book Thomas B. Farrell restores rhetoric as an art of practical reason and enlightened civic participation, grounding it in its classical tradition-particularly in the rhetoric of Aristotle. And, because prevailing modernist world views bear principal responsibility for the disparagement of rhetorical tradition, Farrell also offers a critique of the dominant currents of modern humanist thought.Farrell argues that rhetoric is not antithetical to reason but is a manner of posing and answering questions that is distinct from the approaches of analytic and dialectical reason. He develops this position in a number of ways: through a series of bold reinterpretations of Aristotle's
      Rhetoric; through a detailed appraisal of traditional rhetorical concepts as seen in modern texts from the Army-McCarthy hearings to Edward Kennedy's memorial for his brother, Mario Cuomo's address on abortion, Betty Friedan'sFeminine Mystique, and Vaclav Havel's inaugural address; and through a fresh appraisal of theories on the character of language and discourse found in contemporary philosophy, literary criticism, anthropology, deconstructionism, Marxism, and especially in Habermas's critical theory of communicative action.<br>

Perhaps the life of practical reason, as a mode of reflection open to the collectivity, may be thought of as a generational phenomenon.¹ In any historical period, there are likely to be cultures in which reason and rhetoric have been poisoned. But it seems premature to pronounce any state of affairs, however extreme, as having eliminated forever the prospects for recovery. In the retrospection of dark times, utopian thought can appear foolish. But some such thought may be necessary if possibilities for reflection<br>

While respecting Schmemann, I have sought to go “beyond” him by questioning, at various removes, what it means to “seek in the liturgy the vision implied in its own<br>

  Book Title: The Spirit of God-Short Writings on the Holy Spirit<br>
  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Clifford Catherine E.<br>
  Abstract: Yves Congar was the most significant voice in Catholic pneumatology in the twentieth century. This new collection of short pieces makes his thought accessible to a broad range of readers - scholars, teachers, ecumenists and laity - and thus helps to ensure that an important theological voice, one that influenced many of the documents of the Second Vatican Council, continues to be heard.
      The Spirit of Godbrings together for the first time eight of Yves Congar's previously untranslated writings on the Holy Spirit composed after Vatican II (from 1969 to 1985). Two of these selections offer general overviews of Congar's pneumatology, a pneumatology based upon Scripture and the Tradition of the Church, but articulated in conversation with philosophers, ecumenical partners and non-believers. Other articles make clear the historical context of Vatican II's pneumatology and the Holy Spirit's crucial influence upon the unfolding of history and upon the moral life, the efficacy of the sacraments and, especially, upon ecclesial life.The writings inThe Spirit of Godhave been translated and edited by a team of scholars familiar with the work of the French Dominican theologian. An introduction situates each of the writings historically and highlights its theological significance. A bibliography lists Congar's publications on the Holy Spirit, the major articles and books written about his pneumatology, and the major scholarly resources to which Congar made reference in the notes that accompanied these writings. An index of biblical references and of personal names is also included.<br>

He lists five discrete dream sequences beginning with the scene of his riding in a carriage with a girl who is reading Blok.³ In the second quatrain, the narrator dwells on the profound impact the dream has had on him and how increasingly moved he was by the thought that the “the strange girl had not forgotten Blok.” “No More Than a<br>

  Abstract: In his 1937 French essay for the
                  Nouvelle Revue française, “Pouchkine, ou le vrai et le vraisemblable” (“Pushkin, or the Real and the Plausible”),³ Nabokov claimed that the truth of another’s life is inaccessible because thought inevitably distorts whatever it tries to encompass. However, the intuitions of a fictionalized biography motivated by love for its subject might convey a “plausible” life bearing a mysterious affinity for “the poet’s work, if not the poet himself.”⁴ This relatively early statement on this subject by Nabokov, made during centennial celebrations of Aleksandr Pushkin’s death, becomes poignant in light of Nabokov’s novel Pale Fire<br>

  Book Title: In Praise of Heteronomy-Making Room for Revelation<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the essential heteronomy of postmodern philosophy of religion, Merold Westphal argues against the assumption that human reason is universal, neutral, and devoid of presupposition. Instead, Westphal contends that any philosophy is a matter of faith and the philosophical encounter with theology arises from the very act of thinking. Relying on the work of Spinoza, Kant, and Hegel, Westphal discovers that their theologies render them mutually incompatible and their claims to be the voice of autonomous and universal reason look dubious. Westphal grapples with this plural nature of human thought in the philosophy of religion and he forwards the idea that any appeal to the divine must rest on a historical and phenomenological analysis.<br>

  Abstract: The domain of semiotic anthropology is considered to be the results of empirical research carried out by anthropologists (in all subfields) that makes use of concepts and methods associated with the tradition of scholarship labeled “semiotics” or “semiology.” Semiotic anthropology is not a formal subdiscipline of anthropology; it is not a “school” of anthropological thought; and it is not con-fined to researchers affiliated with particular academic institutions or national traditions. To some degree semiotic anthropology emerged as a correction and refinement of symbolic or interpretive anthropology or structural anthropology (Mertz 1985).

First, narrative music is often thought to be in some way problematic or idiosyncratic; that is, we tend to resort to narrative interpretations when traditional formal, harmonic, and generic paradigms do not apply. Anthony Newcomb (1984, 1987), for example, has located a certain type of narrative music within a particularly nineteenth-century mode of expression that attaches plot archetypes to nonstandard or unusual compositional designs.

  Abstract: Derrida’s work is often mistakenly criticized as a kind of linguistic subjective idealism which traps us inside a chain of linguistic signifiers, unable to do anything but play vainly with linguistic strings. In fact, Derrida’s thought is through and through a philosophy of “alterity,” of openness to the other, which provides a rich and vigorous catalyst for religious thought. After demonstrating the wrongheadedness of the subjectivist reading of Derrida, I go on to show the richness of this philosophy of alterity for theology: first, in terms of the negative theology, where alterity refers to God as the absolutely Other; and<br>

  Book Title: Echoes of the Tambaran-Masculinity, history and the subject in the work of Donald F. Tuzin<br>
  Publisher: ANU E Press<br>
  Author(s): Roscoe Paul<br>
  Abstract: In the Sepik Basin of Papua New Guinea, ritual culture was dominated by the Tambaran —a male tutelary spirit that acted as a social and intellectual guardian or patron to those under its aegis as they made their way through life. To Melanesian scholarship, the cultural and psychological anthropologist, Donald F. Tuzin, was something of a Tambaran, a figure whose brilliant and fine-grained ethnographic project in the Arapesh village of Ilahita was immensely influential within and beyond New Guinea anthropology. Tuzin died in 2007, at the age of 61. In his memory, the editors of this collection commissioned a set of original and thought provoking essays from eminent and accomplished anthropologists who knew and were influenced by his work. They are echoes of the Tambaran. The anthology begins with a biographical sketch of Tuzin's life and scholarship. It is divided into four sections, each of which focuses loosely around one of his preoccupations. The first concerns warfare history, the male cult and changing masculinity, all in Melanesia. The second addresses the relationship between actor and structure. Here, the ethnographic focus momentarily shifts to the Caribbean before turning back to Papua New Guinea in essays that examine uncanny phenomena, narratives about childhood and messianic promises. The third part goes on to offer comparative and psychoanalytic perspectives on the subject in Fiji, Bali, the Amazon as well as Melanesia. Appropriately, the last section concludes with essays on Tuzin's fieldwork style and his distinctive authorial voice.<br>

Correspondingly, when he writes about ethics, he is always interested in the question: “What concept of man underlies a particular ethical theory?” I have been able, therefore, to explore the fundamental themes of Wojtyła’s anthropology and ethics while at the same time safeguarding<br>

  Abstract: “
                  The most extreme sharpness and depth of thought belong to genuine and great mysticism,” Heidegger wrote in 1955.¹ The insight came to him far earlier. Joseph Sauer’s course in the history of medieval mysticism, which Heidegger took in 1910–11, was the beginning of a lifelong interest in Meister Eckhart.² In the Habilitationsschrift, Heidegger spoke of mysticism as the other side of the Middle Ages, “the living heart of medieval Scholasticism” (GA1 205–6). The fragments published in GA60 under the erroneous title “The Philosophical Foundations of Medieval Mysticism [Outlines and Sketches for a Lecture, Not Held, 1918–1919]” actually<br>

  Abstract: One of the most influential movements among philosophers today is that of

It is the moving energy of thought at the center of much that has been called “postmodern.” Its birthplace is Paris, but it has reached North America’s universities through philosophy, linguistics, literary studies, sociology, political theory, and religious studies, and its influence among young teachers and scholars is already wide and diffuse. Its background was prepared by the hermeneutic work of German philosophers such as Heidegger, and by the work in linguistics and language by such thinkers as de Saussure and Wittgenstein.

  Book Title: Mirages and Mad Beliefs-Proust the Skeptic<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Prendergast Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Proust was long the object of a cult in which the main point of reading his great novel
      In Search of Lost Timewas to find, with its narrator, a redemptive epiphany in a pastry and a cup of lime-blossom tea. We now live in less confident times, in ways that place great strain on the assumptions and beliefs that made those earlier readings possible. This has led to a new manner of reading Proust, against the grain. InMirages and Mad Beliefs, Christopher Prendergast argues the case differently, with the grain, on the basis that Proust himself was prey to self-doubt and found numerous, if indirect, ways of letting us know. Prendergast traces in detail the locations and forms of a quietly nondogmatic yet insistently skeptical voice that questions the redemptive aesthetic the novel is so often taken to celebrate, bringing the reader to wonder whether that aesthetic is but another instance of the mirage or the mad belief that, in other guises, figures prominently inIn Search of Lost Time. In tracing the modalities of this self-pressuring voice, Prendergast ranges far and wide, across a multiplicity of ideas, themes, sources, and stylistic registers in Proust's literary thought and writing practice, attentive at every point to inflections of detail, in a sustained account of Proust the skeptic for the contemporary reader.<br>

However, Marcel’s philosophy emerged as very different from that of Bergson and, as such, was suggested to be problematic: it appeared to subordinate time to an eternal present, and this seemed at odds with his assertions concerning (temporal) existence’s dynamic, dialectical nature.

  Book Title: Aquinas, Feminism, and the Common Good-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): DeCrane Susanne M.<br>
  Abstract: To dismiss the work of philosophers and theologians of the past because of their limited perceptions of the whole of humankind is tantamount to tossing the tot out with the tub water. Such is the case when feminist scholars of religion and ethics confront Thomas Aquinas, whose views of women can only be described as misogynistic. Rather than dispense with him, Susanne DeCrane seeks to engage Aquinas and reflect his otherwise compelling thought through the prism of feminist theology, hermeneutics, and ethics. Focusing on one of Aquinas's great intellectual contributions, the fundamental notion of "the common good"-in short, the human will toward peace and justice-DeCrane demonstrates the currency of that notion through a contemporary social issue: women's health care in the United States and, specifically, black women and breast cancer. In her skillful re-engagement with Aquinas, DeCrane shows that certain aspects of religious traditions heretofore understood as oppressive to women and minority groups can actually be parsed, "retrieved," and used to rectify social ills.
      Aquinas, Feminism, and the Common Goodis a bold and intellectually rigorous feminist retrieval of an important text by a Catholic scholar seeking to remain in the tradition, while demanding that the tradition live up to its emphasis on human equity and justice.<br>

  Book Title: Ethics in Light of Childhood-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wall John<br>
  Abstract: Childhood faces humanity with its own deepest and most perplexing questions. An ethics that truly includes the world's childhoods would transcend pre-modern traditional communities and modern rational autonomy with a postmodern aim of growing responsibility. It would understand human relations in a poetic rather than universalistic sense as openly and interdependently creative. As a consequence, it would produce new understandings of moral being, time, and otherness, as well as of religion, rights, narrative, families, obligation, and power.
      Ethics in Light of Childhoodfundamentally reimagines ethical thought and practice in light of the experiences of the third of humanity who are children. Much like humanism, feminism, womanism, and environmentalism, Wall argues, a new childism is required that transforms moral thinking, relations, and societies in fundamental ways. Wall explores childhood's varied impacts on ethical thinking throughout history, advances the emerging interdisciplinary field of childhood studies, and reexamines basic assumptions in contemporary moral theory and practice. In the process, he does not just apply ethics to childhood but applies childhood to ethics-in order to imagine a more expansive humanity.<br>

  Book Title: Overcoming Our Evil-Human Nature and Spiritual Exercises in Xunzi and Augustine<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stalnaker Aaron<br>
  Abstract: Can people ever really change? Do they ever become more ethical, and if so, how?
      Overcoming Our Evilfocuses on the way ethical and religious commitments are conceived and nurtured through the methodical practices that Pierre Hadot has called "spiritual exercises." These practices engage thought, imagination, and sensibility, and have a significant ethical component, yet aim for a broader transformation of the whole personality. Going beyond recent philosophical and historical work that has focused on ancient Greco-Roman philosophy, Stalnaker broadens ethical inquiry into spiritual exercises by examining East Asian as well as classical Christian sources, and taking religious and seemingly "aesthetic" practices such as prayer, ritual, and music more seriously as objects of study. More specifically,Overcoming Our Evilexamines and compares the thought and practice of the early Christian Augustine of Hippo, and the early Confucian Xunzi. Both have sophisticated and insightful accounts of spiritual exercises, and both make such ethical work central to their religious thought and practice. Yet to understand the two thinkers' recommendations for cultivating virtue we must first understand some important differences. Here Stalnaker disentangles the competing aspects of Augustine and Xunxi's ideas of "human nature." His groundbreaking comparison of their ethical vocabularies also drives a substantive analysis of fundamental issues in moral psychology, especially regarding emotion and the complex idea of "the will," to examine how our dispositions to feel, think, and act might be slowly transformed over time. The comparison meticulously constructs vivid portraits of both thinkers demonstrating where they connect and where they diverge, making the case that both have been misunderstood and misinterpreted. In throwing light on these seemingly disparate ancient figures in unexpected ways, Stalnaker redirects recent debate regarding practices of personal formation, and more ~<br>

  Abstract: Rather than providing a supposedly static summary, much of the best contemporary work on Augustine carefully traces the development of his thought, often correlating it to events in his life.¹ One great virtue of this approach is that it maps the changes in his views over time, illuminating every contour and ridge of his evolving conceptions, and thereby aids a more precise grappling with his ideas. Another virtue is suitability to Augustine’s thought itself, which “proceeds by way of ceaseless inquiry”² and is preserved in a vast collection of writings, almost all of which were provoked by particular circumstantial needs<br>

  Abstract: Although these two upheavals arose in different environments, they followed similar courses. The thought and language of Enlightenment France were the glories of western civilization; those of tsarist Russia's intelligentsia were on its margins. Both revolutions began as revolts vowed to fight unreason, injustice, and inequality; both swept away old regimes and defied established religions in societies that were 85% peasant and illiterate; both entailed the terrifying return of repressed vengeance. Contrary to prevalent belief, Mayer argues, ideologies and personalities did not control events. Rather, the tide of violence overwhelmed the political actors who assumed power and were rudderless. Even the best plans could not stem the chaos that at once benefited and swallowed them. Mayer argues that we have ignored an essential part of all revolutions: the resistances to revolution, both domestic and foreign, which help fuel the spiral of terror.<br>

  Abstract: This thought-provoking book initiates a dialogue among scholars in rhetoric and hermeneutics in many areas of the humanities. Twenty leading thinkers explore the ways these two powerful disciplines inform each other and influence a wide variety of intellectual fields. Walter Jost and Michael J. Hyde organize pivotal topics in rhetoric and hermeneutics with originality and coherence, dividing their book into four sections: Locating the Disciplines; Inventions and Applications; Arguments and Narratives; and Civic Discourse and Critical Theory.Contributors to this volume include Hans-Georg Gadamer (one of whose pieces is here translated into English for the first time), Paul Ricoeur, Gerald L. Bruns, Charles Altieri, Richard E. Palmer, Calvin O. Schrag,.Victoria Kahn, Eugene Garver, Michael Leff, Nancy S. Streuver, Wendy Olmsted, David Tracy, Donald G. Marshall, Allen Scult, Rita Copeland, William Rehg, and Steven Mailloux.For readers across the humanities, the book demonstrates the usefulness of rhetorical and hermeneutic approaches in literary, philosophical, legal, religious, and political thinking. With its stimulating new perspectives on the revival and interrelation of both rhetoric and hermeneutics, this collection is sure to serve as a benchmark for years to come.<br>

  Abstract: Rhetoric and hermeneutics have rediscovered each other in our postmodern period. In classical modernity both had seen their range narrowed and their importance as intellectual disciplines denied. Modern rationality felt free to diminish, even dismiss, both rhetoric and hermeneutics because each resisted the famous separations enforced by modernity: thought from feeling (dissociation of sensibility); content from form; theory from practice. Rhetoric could be reduced to issues understood as separate from and unimportant to modern theory: first, practical reason and its topical thinking; second, the forms of thought and the tropes informing all reason; third, the reasonableness of emotions, feelings, moods,<br>

  Book Title: Rhetoric in an Antifoundational World-Language, Culture, and Pedagogy<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Glejzer Richard R.<br>
  Abstract: In this brilliant collection, literary scholars, philosophers, and teachers inquire into the connections between antifoundational philosophy and the rhetorical tradition. What happens to literary studies and theory when traditional philosophical foundations are disavowed? What happens to the study of teaching and writing when antifoundationalism is accepted? What strategies for human understanding are possible when the weaknesses of antifoundationalism are identified? This volume offers answers in classic essays by such thinkers as Richard Rorty, Terry Eagleton, and Stanley Fish, and in many new essays never published before.The contributors to this book explore the nexus of antifoundationalism and rhetoric, critique that nexus, and suggest a number of pedagogical and theoretical alternatives. The editors place these statements into a context that is both critical and evaluative, and they provide for voices that dissent from the antifoundational perspective and that connect specific, practical pedagogies to the broader philosophical statements. For those with an interest in rhetoric, philosophy, comparative literature, or the teaching of composition, this book sets forth a wealth of thought-provoking ideas.<br>

  Abstract: What is a consequent marxist view of the history and philosophy of science? Reference to Marx’s and Engels’s (or even Lenin’s) work will not yield a satisfactory answer, although certain signposts are evident. For example, there is the famous observation on method in the introduction to the

  Book Title: The Uncertain Sciences-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mazlish Bruce<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging book one of the most esteemed cultural historians of our time turns his attention to major questions about human experience and the attempts to understand it "scientifically." Bruce Mazlish considers the achievements, failings, and possibilities of the human sciences-a domain that he broadly defines to include the social sciences, literature, psychology, and hermeneutic studies. In a rich and original synthesis built upon the work of earlier philosophers and historians, Mazlish constructs a new view of the nature and meaning of the human sciences.Starting with the remote human past and moving through the Age of Discovery to the present day, the author discusses what sort of knowledge the human sciences claim to offer. He looks closely at the positivistic aspirations of the human sciences, which are modeled after the natural sciences, and at their interpretive tendencies. In an analysis of scientific method and scientific community, he explores the roles they can or should assume in the human sciences. Mazlish's approach is genuinely interdisciplinary, and he draws on an array of topics, from civil society to globalization to the interactions of humans and machines, to inform his thought-provoking discussion of historical consciousness.<br>

  Abstract: A problem that reciprocally involved both subject matter and formality engaged the Abstract Expressionist painters of the middle and late forties. It was how to make paintings that would be powerful signifiers, and this led to decisions as to what signifiers could be properly referred to without compromising (too much) the flatness of the picture plane. The desire for a momentous content was constricted by the spatial requirement of flatness and by the historically influenced need to avoid direct citation of objects.

  Abstract: While Hannah Arendt was trying to think her way toward a “political morals,” her adopted country entered years of political and moral confusion as drastic as any in the postwar period. Many Americans in and around the New Left thought they were witnessing a reenactment of the decline of the Weimar Republic or France between the wars. Arendt resisted the analogy. In the mid-1960s, she thought that the American military presence in Vietnam would remain limited; she expected early withdrawal of troops, assuming that informed public opinion, which she viewed as solidly against the war, would prevail.

  Book Title: Passage to Modernity-An Essay on the Hermeneutics of Nature and Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dupré Louis<br>
  Abstract: Did modernity begin with the Renaissance and end with post-modernity? In this book a distinguished scholar challenges both these assumptions. Louis Dupré discusses the roots, development, and impact of modern thought, tracing the fundamental principles of modernity to the late fourteenth century and affirming that modernity is still an influential force in contemporary culture.The combination of late medieval theology and early Italian humanism shattered the traditional synthesis that had united cosmic, human, and transcendent components in a comprehensive idea of nature. Early Italian humanism transformed the traditional worldview by its unprecedented emphasis on human creativity. The person emerged as the sole source of meaning while nature was reduced to an object and transcendence withdrew into a "supernatural" realm. Dupré analyzes this fragmentation as well as the writings of those who reacted against it-philosophers like Cusanus and Bruno, humanists like Ficino and Erasmus, theologians like Baius and Jansenius, mystics like Ignatius Loyola and Francis de Sales, and theosophists like Weigel and Boehme.Baroque culture briefly reunited the human, cosmic, and transcendent components, but since that time the disintegrating forces have increased in strength. Despite post-modern criticism, the principles of early modernity continue to dominate the climate of our time.
      Passage to Modernityis not so much a critique as a search for the philosophical meaning of the epochal change achieved by those principles.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I will review three major attempts to overcome the theological dualism modern culture inherited from late medieval thought, namely, those of humanist religion, the early Reformation, and Jansenist theology. According to such Christian humanists as Valla, Erasmus, and Ficino, a universal divine attraction sanctifies the natural order and draws it back to its source. Archaic religion, ancient philosophy, Hebrew and Christian revelation—in an order of increasing intensity—all responded to the same divine impulse. Generally speaking, humanism offered more an alternative than an answer to the questions raised by fifteenth-century School theology. Humanists, even when acquainted<br>

  Book Title: Interpreting Interpretation-The Limits of Hermeneutic Psychoanalysis<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Saks Elyn R.<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalytic interpretation, according to the hermeneutic view, is concerned with meaning rather than facts or causes. In this provocative book, Elyn R. Saks focuses closely on what hermeneutic psychoanalysis is and how the approaches of hermeneutic psychoanalysts differ. She finds that although these psychoanalysts use the same words, concepts, images, and analogies, they hold to at least five different positions on the truth of psychoanalytic interpretations. Saks locates within these five models the thought of such prominent analysts as Roy Schafer, Donald Spence, and George Klein. Then, approaching each model from the patient's point of view, the author reaches important conclusions about treatments that patients not only will-but should-reject.If patients understood the true nature of the various models of hermeneutic psychoanalysis, Saks argues, they would spurn the story model, which asks patients to believe interpretations that do not purport to be true; that is, the psychoanalyst simply tells stories that give meaning to patients' lives, the truth of which is not considered relevant. And patients would question the metaphor and the interpretations-as-literary-criticism models, which propose views of psychoanalysis that may be unsatisfying. In addition to discussing which hermeneutic models of treatment are plausible, Saks discusses the nature of metaphorical truth. She arrives at some penetrating insights into the theory of psychoanalysis itself.<br>

This claim is central to Levinas’s thought and indeed, as will be made clear, figures importantly in relation to problems of rhetoric, ideology, and idolatry within discourse. For without the priority of ethics, a critique of these functionings would, for Levinas, be impossible.

  Book Title: Faces of History-Historical Inquiry from Herodotus to Herder<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLEY DONALD R.<br>
  Abstract: In this book, one of the world's leading intellectual historians offers a critical survey of Western historical thought and writing from the pre-classical era to the late eighteenth century. Donald R. Kelley focuses on persistent themes and methodology, including questions of myth, national origins, chronology, language, literary forms, rhetoric, translation, historical method and criticism, theory and practice of interpretation, cultural studies, philosophy of history, and "historicism."Kelley begins by analyzing the dual tradition established by the foundational works of Greek historiography-Herodotus's broad cultural and antiquarian inquiry and the contrasting model of Thucydides' contemporary political and analytical narrative. He then examines the many variations on and departures from these themes produced in writings from Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian antiquity, in medieval chronicles, in national histories and revisions of history during the Renaissance and Reformation, and in the rise of erudite and enlightened history in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Throughout, Kelley discusses how later historians viewed their predecessors, including both supporters and detractors of the authors in question.The book, which is a companion volume to Kelley's highly praised anthology
      Versions of History from Antiquity to the Enlightenment,will be a valuable resource for scholars and students interested in interpretations of the past.<br>

  Book Title: On the Nature of Consciousness-Cognitive, Phenomenological, and Transpersonal Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): HUNT HARRY T.<br>
  Abstract: What is the relation between mystical experience and ordinary consciousness, between the principles of modern physics and the patterns of perception in all moving creatures, between our human self-consciousness and the more primary sentience of protozoa? This book pursues an inquiry into consciousness that ranges from ancient Greece to empirical neuro-psychology to the experiential traditions of introspection and meditation. Harry Hunt begins by reviewing the renewed interest in ordinary consciousness and in altered and transpersonal states of consciousness. He then presents competing views of consciousness in cognition, neurophysiology, and animal psychology, developing a view of perceptual awareness as the core of consciousness potentially shared across species. Hunt next brings together the separate strands of neo-realist approaches to perception and thought, the phenomenology of imagery and synesthesia, and cognitive theories of metaphor. He develops an original cognitive theory of mystical experience that combines Buddhist meditative descriptions of consciousness and Heidegger's sense of Being. In relating both of these to James J. Gibson's views on perception, he avoids the various "new age" supernaturalisms that so often blight the transpersonal literature. Other themes include the relation between consciousness and time; the common perceptual-metaphoric rooting of parallels between consciousness and modern physics; and the communal basis of transpersonal states as reflected in a sociology of mysticism and a reinterpretation of parapsychological research.<br>

  Book Title: Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna (Ibn Sina)-With a Translation of the Book of the Prophet Muhammad's Ascent to Heaven<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Heath Peter<br>
  Abstract: Islamic allegory is the product of a cohesive literary tradition to which few contributed as significantly as Ibn Sina (Avicenna), the eleventh-century Muslim philosopher. Peter Heath here offers a detailed examination of Avicenna's contribution, paying special attention to Avicenna's psychology and poetics and to the ways in which they influenced strains of theological, mystical, and literary thought in subsequent Islamic-and Western-intellectual and religious history. Heath begins by showing how Avicenna's writings fit into the context and general history of Islamic allegory and explores the interaction among allegory, allegoresis, and philosophy in Avicenna's thought. He then provides a brief introduction to Avicenna as an historical figure. From there, he examines the ways in which Avicenna's cosmological, psychological, and epistemological theories find parallel, if diverse, expression in the disparate formats of philosophical and allegorical narration. Included in this book is an illustration of Avicenna's allegorical practice. This takes the form of a translation of the Mi'raj Nama (The Book of the Prophet Muhammad's Ascent to Heaven), a short treatise in Persian generally attributed to Avicenna. The text concludes with an investigation of the literary dimension Avicenna's allegorical theory and practice by examining his use of description metaphor. Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna is an original and important work that breaks new ground by applying the techniques of modern literary criticism to the study of Medieval Islamic philosophy. It will be of interest to scholars and students of medieval Islamic and Western literature and philosophy.<br>

While numerous texts of the first and second centuries were making exactly this move (as evidenced by our analysis thus far), this was not the only conceptual option available to Christians as they thought about their identity and what its legitimate relationship ought to be to the rhetoric of alienation. Thus there were (perhaps not surprisingly) voices of protest to the increasingly common strategy of constructing the Christian self as other. These voices were not separate or outside the contested discourse of formative Christian identity,<br>

  Abstract: Since the early 1950s, Alain Robbe-Grillet’s writings and films have influenced that body of French literary investigative work which reflects the “suspicion” (in Nathalie Sarraute’s sense) that the real world and natural language might be arbitrary constructions. Despite the metafictional character of his de-naturing of traditional narratives, his ex-posing of the ideologies concealed behind Western myths, and his interrogation of the hidden structures of thought and feeling (Logos and Eros) in which writer and reader are enmeshed, Robbe-Grillet’s detecting project can itself be generated only from within the traditional frames of language, myth, and feeling.<br>

Baroque Rome – and moreover all of Italy – appears barren on an intellectual level as well, with every impulse of modern thought oppressed by a dominant papacy and the Inquisition; the case of Galileo Galilei had induced a long-term trauma. Even contemporaries complained about Italy’s backwardness compared with the wellknown home of scholarly exchange, France.<br>

Moral culpability is made possible by our ability to choose to do terrible things or to refrain from doing good things. Philosophically, the categories of moral praiseworthiness and blameworthiness depend on the prospect of our being able to act or not act one way when we have the capacity to act otherwise.

  Book Title: Black Intersectionalities-A Critique for the 21st Century<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rocchi Jean-Paul<br>
  Abstract: Black Intersectionalities: A Critique for the 21st Century explores the complex interrelationships between race, gender, and sex as these are conceptualised within contemporary thought. Markers of identity are too often isolated and presented as definitive, then examined and theorised, a process that further naturalises their absoluteness; thus socially generated constructs become socialising categories that assume coercive power. The resulting set of oppositions isolate and delimit: male or female, black or white, straight or gay. A new kind of intervention is needed, an intervention that recognises the validity of the researcher’s own self-reflexivity. Focusing on the way identity is both constructed and constructive, the collection examines the frameworks and practices that deny transgressive possibilities. It seeks to engage in a consciousness raising exercise that documents the damaging nature of assigned social positions and either/or identity constructions. It seeks to progress beyond the socially prescribed categories of race, gender and sex, recognising the need to combine intellectualization and feeling, rationality and affectivity, abstraction and emotion, consciousness and desire. It seeks to develop new types of transdisciplinary frameworks where subjective and political spaces can be universalized while remaining particular, leaving texts open so that identity remains imagined, plural, and continuously shifting. Such an approach restores the complexity of what it means to be human.<br>

By ‘intellectual field’ we mean the broad domain constituted by publications and debates in the social sciences, particularly sociology, history, political sciences and, more marginally, anthropology.

  Abstract: In The Poetry of Saying Robert Sheppard explores an array of ‘experimental’ writers and styles of writing many of which have never secured a large audience in Britain, but which are often fascinatingly innovative.

As well as analysing the work of individual poets such as Roy Fisher, Lee Harwood and Tom Raworth The Poetry of Saying also examines the influence of the Poetry Society and poetry magazines on the evolution of British poetry throughout this period. The overriding virtue of the poetry of this period is its diversity, a fact that Sheppard has not ignored.

However, the demise of the Soviet Union and the increase in the volume, scope and speed of transnational interactions challenged this traditional assumption of anarchy and non-co-operation.

  Book Title: V. Y. Mudimbe-Undisciplined Africanism<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): FRAITURE PIERRE-PHILIPPE<br>
  Abstract: VY Mudimbe: Undisciplined Africanism is the first English-language monograph dedicated to the work of Valentin Yves Mudimbe. This book charts the intellectual history of the seminal Congolese philosopher, epistemologist, and philologist from the late 1960s to the present day, exploring his major essays and novels. Pierre-Philippe Fraiture highlights Mudimbe’s trajectory through major debates on African nationalism, Panafricanism, neo-colonialism, negritude, pedagogy, Christianisation, decolonisation, anthropology, postcolonial representations, and a variety of other subjects, using these as contexts for close readings of many of Mudimbe’s texts, both influential and lesser-known. The book demonstrates that Mudimbe’s intellectual career has been informed by a series of decisive dialogues with some of the key exponents of Africanism (Herodotus, EW Blyden, Placide Tempels), continental and postcolonial thought (Jean-Paul Sartre, Frantz Fanon, Michel Foucault, and Claude Lévi-Strauss), and African thought and philosophy from Africa and the diaspora (L.S.

  Book Title: Heidegger and the Thinking of Place-Explorations in the Topology of Being<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Malpas Jeff<br>
  Abstract: The idea of place--topos--runs through Martin Heidegger's thinking almost from the very start. It can be seen not only in his attachment to the famous hut in Todtnauberg but in his constant deployment of topological terms and images and in the situated, "placed" character of his thought and of its major themes and motifs. Heidegger's work, argues Jeff Malpas, exemplifies the practice of "philosophical topology." In Heidegger and the Thinking of Place, Malpas examines the topological aspects of Heidegger's thought and offers a broader elaboration of the philosophical significance of place. Doing so, he provides a distinct and productive approach to Heidegger as well as a new reading of other key figures--notably Kant, Aristotle, Gadamer, and Davidson, but also Benjamin, Arendt, and Camus. Malpas, expanding arguments he made in his earlier book Heidegger's Topology (MIT Press, 2007), discusses such topics as the role of place in philosophical thinking, the topological character of the transcendental, the convergence of Heideggerian topology with Davidsonian triangulation, the necessity of mortality in the possibility of human life, the role of materiality in the working of art, the significance of nostalgia, and the nature of philosophy as beginning in wonder. Philosophy, Malpas argues, begins in wonder and begins in place and the experience of place. The place of wonder, of philosophy, of questioning, he writes, is the very topos of thinking.<br>

                  Being and Timeis not primarily concerned with questions of interpretation or understanding. Its driving interest is instead ontological—an interest in the question of the “meaning of being.” Yet inasmuch as the work adopts a thoroughly hermeneuticized approach to ontology—the very focus on themeaningof being suggests as such—so the inquiry into ontology also involves Heidegger in an inquiry into the “structure” of understanding. Although the explicitly hermeneutic focus disappears from Heidegger’s later work, still the concern with understanding, thought in terms of a broader happening of disclosedness—a happening of world—can be seen<br>

  Abstract: For many years I have been studying the work of Benjamin Fondane, a poet, philosopher, critic, and playwright, who was a contemporary of Rachel Bespaloff. In a diary of Fondane’s encounters and discussions with Shestov I came across the name of Rachel Bespaloff for the first time.¹ She appeared an irritating woman who never agreed with Shestov. Bespaloff’s father, Daniel Pasmanik, a friend of Shestov’s, introduced his daughter to him. At first, she was very impressed by Shestov. He awakened her to philosophical thought, and she is still considered a disciple of Shestov, though she later became opposed to certain<br>

  Abstract: It is not uncommon among Western philosophers who show some interest in non-Western thought to engage that thought as if it were put forward as a series of arguments that require little or no understanding beyond what the resources of their own tradition afford. Arguments are lifted out of the forms in which they are assumed only to be presented, not embedded, and then are dealt with in straightforward Western truth-value terms. The unstated assumption is that philosophers everywhere have addressed the same basic problems and adhere (or at least ought to adhere) to the same standards of what constitutes<br>

  Abstract: When choosing a frame for a picture, it is important to consider carefully both the picture that you want to frame and the frame itself. Not just any frame will go with any picture. A wellchosen frame can add to a picture; a poorly-chosen frame can detract from it. The picture that Millikan wants to frame here is an externalist picture of the semantic content of thought, or more simply, an externalist theory of meaning. What does this picture look like?<br>

  Abstract: For Tolstoy, love provides one with special abilities to speak and be understood, and in descriptions of love we find his most startling examples of communication. Contrariwise, the loss of love, the emergence of suspicion, infidelity, and betrayal, all take a terrible toll on communication. A jealous husband in Tolstoy’s world has a difficult time communicating with his wife. Of course, that is nothing extraordinary to anyone who has ever been in love—groundless, or even well-grounded, suspicions somehow interfere with intimate conversations. Something more significant is at stake, however: the tenuous bond in Tolstoy’s fiction between thought and language,<br>

  Abstract: While the Greek etymology of analysis means “dis-solution,” analysis as a thinking practice (which has been theorized since the ancient times, initially in the realm of geometry¹) involves the related idea of a “breaking up”²: the first experience of it may be considered that of a child breaking a toy to understand its internal structure, and the way it works.

It is in the city that the various self-images of modernity (freedom, rationality, wealth), as well as the various critiques of modernity (decadence, alienation, poverty) find their exemplars. The city constitutes the focal point of many ambivalences about modern life. Still, if it is thoroughly disputed what modern urban life stands for, the dispute also evidences how the city is thought to constitute a certain way of life, to engender some or other general mode of being.

  Abstract: With
      Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebook,readers of English can now access in a single volume the richness and diversity of Japanese philosophy as it has developed throughout history. Leading scholars in the field have translated selections from the writings of more than a hundred philosophical thinkers from all eras and schools of thought, many of them available in English for the first time.TheSourcebookeditors have set out to represent the entire Japanese philosophical tradition-not only the broad spectrum of academic philosophy dating from the introduction of Western philosophy in the latter part of the nineteenth century, but also the philosophical ideas of major Japanese traditions of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shinto. The philosophical significance of each tradition is laid out in an extensive overview, and each selection is accompanied by a brief biographical sketch of its author and helpful information on placing the work in its proper context. The bulk of the supporting material, which comprises nearly a quarter of the volume, is given to original interpretive essays on topics not explicitly covered in other chapters: cultural identity, samurai thought, women philosophers, aesthetics, bioethics.An introductory chapter provides a historical overview of Japanese philosophy and a discussion of the Japanese debate over defining the idea of philosophy, both of which help explain the rationale behind the design of the Sourcebook. An exhaustive glossary of technical terminology, a chronology of authors, and a thematic index are appended. Specialists will find information related to original sources and sinographs for Japanese names and terms in a comprehensive bibliography and general index.Handsomely presented and clearly organized for ease of use,Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebookwill be a cornerstone in Japanese studies for decades to come.

  Abstract: The question of whether there is such a thing as samurai philosophy, and if so, what it might consist of, is one of the more complex issues in Japanese intellectual history. This is primarily due to developments that occurred during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and which are still inextricably linked to current discussions of the question. From the 1890s onward, a romanticized image of the samurai emerged, motivated by cultural and political currents at the time. The major lasting effect of this idealization was the idea that “warrior thought” represented an independent and relatively homogeneous intellectual tradition<br>

  Abstract: Considerations of center and periphery in Heian Japan involve at the highest level the relationship between the central political apparatus and the hinterlands, the sixty-six provinces and two islands (Iki and Tsushima) that constituted the conceptualized polity. Indeed, the very existence of a state presupposes control over the human and material resources of the space thought to constitute the geographical area of that conceptualized state.

  Author(s): JAY MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Over his distinguished career as a European intellectual historian and cultural critic, Martin Jay has explored a variety of major themes: the Frankfurt School, the exile of German intellectuals in America during the Nazi era, Western Marxism, the denigration of vision in twentieth-century French thought, the discourse of experience in modern Europe and America, and lying in politics.
         Essays from the Edgeassembles Jay's writings from the intersections of this intellectual journey. Several essays focus on methodological debates in the humanities and social sciences: the limits of interdisciplinarity, the issue of national or universal philosophy, cultural relativism and visuality, and the implications of periodization in historical narrative. Others examine the concept of "scopic regime" and the metaphors of revolution and the gardening impulse. Among the theorists treated at length are Theodor Adorno, Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault. The essays also include several of Jay'sSalmagundicolumns, dealing with subjects as varied as the new Museum of Modern Art in New York, the impact of Colin Wilson's The Outsider, and the demise of thePartisan Review.<br>

  Book Title: Religion after Religion-Gershom Scholem, Mircea Eliade, and Henry Corbin at Eranos<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wasserstrom Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: By the end of World War II, religion appeared to be on the decline throughout the United States and Europe. Recent world events had cast doubt on the relevance of religious belief, and modernizing trends made religious rituals look out of place. It was in this atmosphere that the careers of Scholem, Eliade, and Corbin--the twentieth century's legendary scholars in the respective fields of Judaism, History of Religions, and Islam--converged and ultimately revolutionized how people thought about religion. Between 1949 and 1978, all three lectured to Carl Jung's famous Eranos circle in Ascona, Switzerland, where each in his own way came to identify the symbolism of mystical experience as a central element of his monotheistic tradition. In this, the first book ever to compare the paths taken by these thinkers, Steven Wasserstrom explores how they overturned traditional approaches to studying religion by de-emphasizing law, ritual, and social history and by extolling the role of myth and mysticism. The most controversial aspect of their theory of religion, Wasserstrom argues, is that it minimized the binding character of moral law associated with monotheism.<br>

  Abstract: Although among the categories informing the study of politics there are few as fundamental as those demarcating theory and practice, that distinction is highly problematic when applied to the analysis of ideologies. Many traditional as well as current approaches regard political thought as the area in which issues of moral philosophy pertaining to political entities are aired, with the objective of setting defining ethical and validating criteria that are then to be applied to political practice. A grounding of this view may be found in Kant, for whom individuals were subjected to clear and unequivocal moral duties and were

  Author(s): Struck Peter T.<br>
  Abstract: The book notes that Aristotle and his followers did not discuss the use of poetic symbolism. Rather, a different group of Greek thinkers--the allegorists--were the first to develop the notion. Struck extensively revisits the work of the great allegorists, which has been underappreciated. He links their interest in symbolism to the importance of divination and magic in ancient times, and he demonstrates how important symbolism became when they thought about religion and philosophy. "They see the whole of great poetic language as deeply figurative," he writes, "with the potential always, even in the most mundane details, to be freighted with hidden messages."<br>

  Abstract: The book is divided into sections that address three broad subjects: the relationship between Bruno and the new science, the history of his reception in English culture, and the principal characteristics of his natural philosophy. A final essay examines why this advocate of a "tranquil universal philosophy" ended up being burned at the stake as a heretic by the Roman Inquisition. While the essays take many different approaches, they are united by a number of assumptions: that, although well versed in magic, Bruno cannot be defined primarily as a Renaissance Magus; that his aim was to articulate a new philosophy of nature; and that his thought, while based on ancient and medieval sources, represented a radical rupture with the philosophical schools of the past, helping forge a path toward a new modernity.<br>

  Abstract: Despite, or perhaps in part because of, its importance and influence within the history of aesthetics, the current status of mimesis as a concept (or family of concepts) in the theory of art is contentious and unstable. In an age when talk of representation has become increasingly subject to both ideological and epistemological suspicion, mimesis is, for many philosophers and critics, little more than a broken column surviving from a long-dilapidated classical edifice, a sadly obsolete relic of former certainties. According to such convictions, even the Renaissance and neoclassical revival of mimeticism was a phase of thought whose structure of<br>

  Book Title: Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tauber Alfred I.<br>
  Abstract: Freud began university intending to study both medicine and philosophy. But he was ambivalent about philosophy, regarding it as metaphysical, too limited to the conscious mind, and ignorant of empirical knowledge. Yet his private correspondence and his writings on culture and history reveal that he never forsook his original philosophical ambitions. Indeed, while Freud remained firmly committed to positivist ideals, his thought was permeated with other aspects of German philosophy. Placed in dialogue with his intellectual contemporaries, Freud appears as a reluctant philosopher who failed to recognize his own metaphysical commitments, thereby crippling the defense of his theory and misrepresenting his true achievement. Recasting Freud as an inspired humanist and reconceiving psychoanalysis as a form of moral inquiry, Alfred Tauber argues that Freudianism still offers a rich approach to self-inquiry, one that reaffirms the enduring task of philosophy and many of the abiding ethical values of Western civilization.<br>

  Abstract: From Augustine to our own era, introspection is inextricable from “self-consciousness,” which in turn is integral to and, in some sense, coincident with various understandings of selfhood. Simply, self-consciousness is enacted through self-reflexivity, and in this process of self-awareness, identity emerges. But the word “reflexivity” has a more circumscribed history. Reflexivity appears as a paradigm of understanding the self during the early modern period, coincident with the preoccupation with optics and the birth of a new physics of light. “Reflexivity” was first applied to cognitive introspection, in referring to “thought as bending back upon itself,” in the 1640s, when theologians,<br>

  Abstract: The concept of the symbol has appeared often in criticism of music. This is a different kind of symbol from that described by Peirce; for the American semiologist, symbol is opposed to icon and index in a trichotomy of signs. But for the aesthetic idealists, the symbol has a transcendent resonance which gives it a master-function in music and makes it a determinant of moral force and aesthetic value. In this kind of symbol, the relation of signifier and signified is asymmetric; what is signified is a radical idealism, an overcoming of the antinomy of thought and object. The imagination<br>

What emerges is a vision of Nietzsche's philosophy as the enactment of a spiritual quest informed by transfigured versions of religious tropes and practices.<br>

  Abstract: Could World War I have been averted if Franz Ferdinand and his wife hadn't been murdered by Serbian nationalists in 1914? What if Ronald Reagan had been killed by Hinckley's bullet? Would the Cold War have ended as it did? In
      Forbidden Fruit, Richard Ned Lebow develops protocols for conducting robust counterfactual thought experiments and uses them to probe the causes and contingency of transformative international developments like World War I and the end of the Cold War. He uses experiments, surveys, and a short story to explore why policymakers, historians, and international relations scholars are so resistant to the contingency and indeterminism inherent in open-ended, nonlinear systems. Most controversially, Lebow argues that the difference between counterfactual and so-called factual arguments is misleading, as both can be evidence-rich and logically persuasive. A must-read for social scientists,Forbidden Fruitalso examines the binary between fact and fiction and the use of counterfactuals in fictional works like Philip Roth'sThe Plot Against Americato understand complex causation and its implications for who we are and what we think makes the social world work.<br>

This understanding goes back to the Greeks who held that knowledge of a cause ruled out the operation of chance, and vice versa. In early modern Europe, Calvin and Spinoza did their best to define contingency out of existence. In the eighteenth century, Leibniz, Montesquieu, and Hume followed suit. Outcomes that appear to be the result of chance, Hume wrote, may be the product of “the secret operation of contrary causes.”¹ Montesquieu makes a more extreme claim, insisting, “If the fortune of a battle, that is, a particular case, has<br>

  Book Title: Christian Political Ethics-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Coleman John A.<br>
  Abstract: Christian Political Ethicsbrings together leading Christian scholars of diverse theological and ethical perspectives--Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, and Anabaptist--to address fundamental questions of state and civil society, international law and relations, the role of the nation, and issues of violence and its containment. Representing a unique fusion of faith-centered ethics and social science, the contributors bring into dialogue their own varying Christian understandings with a range of both secular ethical thought and other religious viewpoints from Judaism, Islam, and Confucianism. They explore divergent Christian views of state and society--and the limits of each. They grapple with the tensions that can arise within Christianity over questions of patriotism, civic duty, and loyalty to one's nation, and they examine Christian responses to pluralism and relativism, globalization, and war and peace. Revealing the striking pluralism inherent to Christianity itself, this pioneering volume recasts the meanings of Christian citizenship and civic responsibility, and raises compelling new questions about civil disobedience, global justice, and Christian justifications for waging war as well as spreading world peace. It brings Christian political ethics out of the churches and seminaries to engage with today's most vexing and complex social issues.<br>

She reveals that the literature and art produced in Britain during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries obsessively cultivated means for feeling as much as understanding such wars, and established forms still relevant today.<br>

Thus the wartime poems set on a winter’s evening, considered in the prelude, elaborate the simplest markers of time (winter, evening) into channels of memory and prophecy, avenues of recursivity and nodes of stillness.

  Abstract: In this powerful work, Susan Friedman moves feminist theory out of paralyzing debates about us and them, white and other, first and third world, and victimizers and victims. Throughout, Friedman adapts current cultural theory from global and transnational studies, anthropology, and geography to challenge modes of thought that exaggerate the boundaries of gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, and national origin. The author promotes a transnational and heterogeneous feminism, which, she maintains, can replace the proliferation of feminisms based on difference. She argues for a feminist geopolitical literacy that goes beyond fundamentalist identity politics and absolutist poststructuralist theory, and she continually focuses the reader's attention on those locations where differences are negotiated and transformed.<br>

  Abstract: Circles Disturbedbrings together important thinkers in mathematics, history, and philosophy to explore the relationship between mathematics and narrative. The book's title recalls the last words of the great Greek mathematician Archimedes before he was slain by a Roman soldier--"Don't disturb my circles"--words that seem to refer to two radically different concerns: that of the practical person living in the concrete world of reality, and that of the theoretician lost in a world of abstraction. Stories and theorems are, in a sense, the natural languages of these two worlds--stories representing the way we act and interact, and theorems giving us pure thought, distilled from the hustle and bustle of reality. Yet, though the voices of stories and theorems seem totally different, they share profound connections and similarities.<br>

They have gone beyond their precursors by experimenting with the tensions between ludic and didactic art. Edith Clowes explores these "meta-utopian" narratives, which address a wide range of attitudes toward utopia, to expose the challenge that literary play poses to dogmatism and to elucidate the sense of renewal it can bring to social imagination. Using both structural analysis and reception theory, she introduces readers outside Russia to a fascinating body of literature that includes Aleksandr Zinoviev'sThe Yawning Heights, Abram Terts'sLiubimov, Vladimir Voinovich'sMoscow 2042, and Liudmila Petrushevskaia's "The New Robinsons.".<br>

At the same time, this book is a general study of Stevens's poetry, moving from his earliest to his latest work, and includes close readings of three of his remarkable long poems--Esthetique du Mal, Notes toward a Supreme Fiction, and An Ordinary Evening in New Haven. The chronological arrangement enables readers to follow Stevens's increasing skill and changing thought in three areas of his "poetry of the earth": the poetry of place, the poetry of eros, and the poetry of belief.<br>

He then outlines the role of aesthetics in the theories of religion proposed by Otto, Eliade, van der Leeuw, and Tillich, in the cultural anthropology of Geertz, and in the thought of Santayana, Dewey, Whitehead, Heidegger, and Wittgenstein. In a global context Martin explores the relation of aesthetic theory to religious thought in the traditions of India, China, and Japan and concludes with reflections on the viability of modern aesthetic and religious theory in the light of contemporary cultural and methodological pluralism.<br>

This paradox suggests the ambiguities inherent in the concept of audience.

According to one approach, the reader is thought of as an end conceived by the writer, whose work, accordingly, may be read in reference to the idea we have of that reader. A certain number of studies have enriched the history of literary criticism in this way, showing that the expectations of a particular public aimed at by the writer were determinative down to the most secret strata of the text (Jauss’s

The scene has changed, but the critical orientation represented by these “movements” has not disappeared. Rather it has been sublimated and to an extent transformed in the “ideology critique” that dominates literary studies at this moment. The most enduring effect of deconstruction has been the subversion of all universalist or foundationalist claims to truth. In the Marxist canon, ideology has as one of its principal meanings “false consciousness,” which is a kind of universalizing thought that conceals the particular, self-interested (class) motives that<br>

  Book Title: Scripture, Canon and Commentary-A Comparison of Confucian and Western Exegesis<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): HENDERSON JOHN B.<br>
  Abstract: In this major contribution to the study of the Chinese classics and comparative religion, John Henderson uses the history of exegesis to illuminate mental patterns that have universal and perennial significance for intellectual history. Henderson relates the Confucian commentarial tradition to other primary exegetical traditions, particularly the Homeric tradition, Vedanta, rabbinic Judaism, ancient and medieval Christian biblical exegesis, and Qur'anic exegesis. In making such comparisons, he discusses some basic assumptions common to all these traditions--such as that the classics or scriptures are comprehensive or that they contain all significant knowledge or truth and analyzes the strategies deployed to support these presuppositions. As shown here, primary differences among commentarial or exegetical traditions arose from variations in their emphasis on one or another of these assumptions and strategies. Henderson demonstrates that exegetical modes of thought were far from arcane: they dominated the post-classical/premodern intellectual world. Some have persisted or re-emerged in modern times, particularly in ideologies such as Marxism. Written in an engaging and accessible style, Scripture, Canon, and Commentary is not only a challenging interpretation of comparative scriptural traditions but also an excellent introduction to the study of the Confucian classics.<br>

Until the seventeenth century in Europe, and even later in China, India, and the Near East, thought, especially within high intellectual traditions, was primarily exegetical in character and expression.

Deconstruction makes social criticism of whatever inspiration (literary, historical, philosophical) very difficult, if not impossible. The touchstone for a literary-inspired social criticism has been of course, Matthew Arnold. Arnold had an abundant capacity for doubt, but he assumed the presence and fullness of the cultural tradition. Disinterestedness, the free play of the mind upon our “stock habits of thought and feeling” never really extended to the touchstones that formed his convictions.

  Abstract: Twelfth-century writers assimilated and transformed a tradition of the conceptual unity of all the arts and attributed that unity to the fact that art both conceals and discloses. Recovering that tradition, especially the methods and motives of concealment, provides extraordinary insights into twelfth-century ideas about the kingdom of God, the status of women, and the nature of time itself. It also identifies a strain in European thought that had striking affinities to methods of perception familiar in Oriental religions and that proved to be antithetic to later humanist traditions in the West.<br>

  Abstract: With an original combination of close reading and political theory, Joy Connolly argues that Cicero, Sallust, and Horace inspire fresh thinking about central concerns of contemporary political thought and action. These include the role of conflict in the political community, especially as it emerges from class differences; the necessity of recognition for an equal and just society; the corporeal and passionate aspects of civic experience; citizens' interdependence on one another for senses of selfhood; and the uses and dangers of self-sovereignty and fantasy. Putting classicists and political theorists in dialogue, the book also addresses a range of modern thinkers, including Kant, Hannah Arendt, Stanley Cavell, and Philip Pettit. Together, Connolly's readings construct a new civic ethos of advocacy, self-criticism, embodied awareness, imagination, and irony.<br>

  Author(s) Darby Tom<br>
  Abstract: George Grant, the only political philosopher this country has produced, once remarked that, during the century since Nietzsche wrote, “his opinions filtered down unrecognized through lesser minds to become the popular platitudes of the age, but also what he prophesied is now all around us to be easily seen” (Grant 1969, 25). The current level of vulgarization of Nietzsche’s thought is not perhaps as easily seen as what is all around us. What is all around us, in turn, is not so easy to characterize as to see. Heidegger considered Nietzsche’s the “final thought of Western metaphysics” (Heidegger 1984, 2:232).<br>

  Abstract: Poetry, like fiction, has a time-sense, and it is worth extending the ideas laid out in “Time’s Andromedas” to the formal – rather than thematic – elements of Bishop’s poetics. Generally, critics writing about Bishop have used the question of time to buttress arguments about the “mind thinking”: the notion that Bishop’s goal is to capture the feeling of a mind in the process of working out a thought rather than a mind relating a fully formed idea. The distinction is one Bishop found in an essay on Baroque prose by Morris Croll and used in both a paper of her own<br>

  Book Title: Knight-Monks of Vichy France-Uriage, 1940-1945<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): HELLMAN JOHN<br>
  Abstract: In The Knight-Monks of Vichy France John Hellman describes the founding, operation, transformation, and demise of the school, details the institution's ideological and political struggles with other segments of French society, and deals with the remarkable rise of Uriage ideas and alumni in postwar France. By focusing on the social, philosophical, and psychological concepts propounded by the staff of the school, Hellman has produced the first study that shows the École Nationale des Cadres d'Uriage to have been an original educational and group experience which inspired French youth from very different backgrounds to abandon the liberal democratic tradition for a new political and social vision. Drawing on a variety of sources, including interviews, newly available archival material, Vichy publications, correspondence, and diary entries, Hellman contributes to the current, lively debate concerning the phenomenon of collaboration and the response of the French population to fascism and to the occupation during the Second World War. This book will be of particular interest to readers concerned with the intellectual and political life of modern France, modern religious thought and experience, fascism and the Vichy regime, changes in France in the prewar and postwar periods, and the "third way" political option in contemporary Europe.<br>

  Book Title: Karl Polanyi on Ethics and Economics-Foreword by Marguerite Mendell<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Baum Gregory<br>
  Abstract: Exploring Polanyi's lesser-known works as well as The Great Transformation, Baum provides a more complete and nuanced understanding of Polanyi's thought. He examines Polanyi's interpretation of modern economic and social history, clarifies the ethical presuppositions present in Polanyi's work, and addresses how Polanyi's understanding of the relation between ethics and economics touches on many issues relevant to the contemporary debate about the world's economic future. Baum argues that we should look to Polanyi's understanding of modern capitalism to reinstate the social discourse and, in political practice, the principles of reciprocity and solidarity. He points to examples, both in Canada and abroad, of attempts to formulate alternative models of economic development and to create new forms of institutional and cultural intervention.<br>

Polanyi, who in his personal life was greatly inspired by Leo Tolstoy,¹ was not a philosopher in the strict sense. Yet he believed that as a social and political thinker he had to articulate his intuitions regarding the ethical foundation of human thought and action. He first did so as a young man in the Vienna of the 1920s while struggling against his depression over the useless killing of the Great War. As Polanyi<br>

And of course, esthetic discourses of all kinds (paintings, books, plays) have always been prey to censorship. Tintoretto, Molière, Voltaire, Rousseau, etc., all had dealings with the thought police of their day.¹ In the last ten years or so, the age-old practice of policing opinions has acquired a new name: political correctness, offspring of the American liberal left of the 1980s.

Both thinkers express faith in the possibility of forgiveness at a time in history when such faith might seem naïvely optimistic and at worst dangerously self-deceptive. After all, the conceptual apparatus of forgiveness, to the extent that it involves recollection of and reflection on the past, is patently imbricated with notions of truth and memory; yet a virtual axiom of contemporary thought is that the latter are partial, fragmentary, and intensely<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy of Merleau-Ponty-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Matthews Eric<br>
  Abstract: In this clear and comprehensive account of Merleau-Ponty's thought Eric Matthews shows how Merleau-Ponty has contributed to current debates in philosophy, such as the nature of consciousness, the relation between biology and personality, the historical understanding of human thought and society, and many others. Surveying the whole range of Merleau-Ponty's thinking, Matthews examines his views about the nature of phenomenology and the primacy of perception; his account of human embodiment, being-in-the-world, and the understanding of human behaviour; his conception of the self and its relation to other selves; and his views on society, politics, and the arts. A final chapter considers his later thought, published posthumously. The ideas of Merleau-Ponty are of immensely important to the development of modern French philosophy. Matthews evaluates his distinctive contributions and relates his thought to that of his predecessors, contemporaries, and successors, both in France and elsewhere. This unrivalled introduction will be welcomed by analytic philosophers and cognitive scientists as well as all students taking courses in contemporary continental philosophy.<br>

  Abstract: Many philosophers influenced the direction of Merleau-Ponty's thinking, as was shown in Chapter 1, but the single most significant influence was that of Edmund Husserl (1859-1938) and the “phenomenological” school that he founded. If we are to understand Merleau-Ponty properly, we have to see him above all in relation to phenomenology. At least in his major works, he certainly saw himself as a phenomenologist, and even the other influences on his thought were filtered through his conception of phenomenology. And, clearly, if we are to understand Merleau-Ponty's relationship to Husserlian phenomenology, we must first say something about Husserl's own thought.<br>

  Book Title: Augustine's Theology of Preaching-  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): SANLON PETER T.<br>
  Abstract: Scholarship has painted many pictures of Augustine—the philosophical theologian, the refuter of heresy, or contributor to doctrines like Original Sin—but the picture of Augustine as preacher, says Sanlon, has been seriously neglected. When academics marginalize the Sermones ad Populum, the real Augustine is not presented accurately. In this study, Sanlon does more, however, than rehabilitate a neglected view of Augustine. How do the theological convictions that Augustine brought to his preaching challenge, sustain, or shape our work today? By presenting Augustine’s thought on preaching to contemporary readers Sanlon contributes a major new piece to the ongoing reconsideration of preaching in the modern day, a consideration that is relevant to all branches of the twenty-first century church.<br>

In search of a theological response to what critical theorists called the “dialectic of Enlightenment,” Schillebeeckx turned to the critical negativity of Christianity’s eschatological hope.

  Book Title: Godless Intellectuals?-The Intellectual Pursuit of the Sacred Reinvented<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Riley Alexander Tristan<br>
  Abstract: The Durkheimians have traditionally been understood as positivist, secular thinkers, fully within the Enlightenment project of limitless reason and progress. In a radical revision of this view, this book persuasively argues that the core members of the Durkheimian circle (Durkheim himself, Marcel Mauss, Henri Hubert and Robert Hertz) are significantly more complicated than this. Through his extensive analysis of large volumes of correspondence as well as historical and macro-sociological mappings of the intellectual and social worlds in which the Durkheimian project emerged, the author shows the Durkheimian project to have constituted a quasi-religious quest in ways much deeper than most interpreters have thought. Their fascination, both personal and intellectual, with the sacred is the basis on which the author reconstructs some important components of modern French intellectual history, connecting Durkheimian thought to key representatives of French poststructuralism and postmodernism: Bataille, Foucault, Derrida, Baudrillard, and Deleuze.<br>

Tracing its roots back to the “Jesus Movement” of the 1960s, the Vineyard is now a denomination that rejects its denominational status, presenting itself as a church-planting “movement.” The Vineyard, however, has effects that exceed its own body (denominational or otherwise): the Vineyard is seen as playing a vital role in the “Californianization” of American Protestantism<br>

  Abstract: The death of any individual strikes at the hearts of the living. Family and friends mourn a lost life; a community recognizes a permanent loss. If a death is thought to have been needless—or worse, politically motivated—mourning may well take on the trappings of public protest. Along with the official rituals of church and state, we often see, as the editors of this volume suggest, a kind of “grassroots memorialization,” in which individuals are mourned as a form of social action. When the causes of death are objectionable, foreseeable, or avoidable, people often mourn publicly in protest (Margry<br>

  Book Title: Culture and Rhetoric-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Tyler Stephen<br>
  Abstract: While some scholars have said that there is no such thing as culture and have urged to abandon the concept altogether, the contributors to this volume overcome this impasse by understanding cultures and their representations for what they ultimately are - rhetorical constructs. These senior, international scholars explore the complex relationships between culture and rhetoric arguing that just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric. This intersection constitutes the central theme of the first part of the book, while the second is dedicated to the study of figuration as a common ground of rhetoric and anthropology. The book offers a compelling range of theoretical reflections, historical vistas, and empirical investigations, which aim to show how people talk themselves and others into particular modalities of thought and action, and how rhetoric and culture, in this way, are co-emergent. It thus turns a new page in the history of academic discourse by bringing two disciplines - anthropology and rhetoric - together in a way that has never been done before.<br>

  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: The present essay grows out of this question: What is it that makes the chiasmus “practice of rhetoric, rhetoric of practice” at first so convincing but then, on second thought, so agonizingly difficult to understand? To answer, we need to reconsider the intersection of rhetoric and practice. Among the many authors dealing with this subject, Farrell (1999) has examined rhetoric in terms of practice, and practice in terms of rhetoric, and his questions are very close to those I pose below. However, we differ in our basic interests—philosophy for him, ethnography for me—and while Farrell examines the political<br>

  Author(s) Ames Michael M.<br>
  Abstract: This chapter addresses what are often seen as the practical issues of exhibition-making as a theoretical problem of translation – with all the transformative effects of moving between languages¹ – and as a didactic device. It begins by invoking anthropological concern about recent developments in the museum world. It goes on to consider how (what are often thought of as) technical aspects the process of making a temporary exhibition at the University of Oslo Ethnographic Museum were used as a didactic device. Finally, there is a discussion of how these technical matters fit into the theoretical operation of translation that exhibition-making involves.<br>

  Abstract: Although early authors such as Vasari and Ghiberti have attempted to make us believe otherwise, nowadays it is generally agreed upon that the antique inheritance did not die during the Middle Ages. Consequently, the ancient tradition was never revived during the Renaissance. Renaissance scholars inherited their antique treasure from their medieval ancestors. Medieval thought, writings and imagery, for their part, borrowed significantly from the antique tradition.¹<br>

  Abstract: In our “enlightened” times, the concept of dogma has acquired a rather negative connotation. Most people seem to believe that we should not accept dogma(ta) without constant, or at least potential critical reflection¹. Even so, dogma continues to be relied upon in certain areas of life where we strive for a form of authoritative certitude, such as religion, or law. It seems as if our quest for stability here warrants the use of a modus of a thought that builds upon a set of premises that are accepted without constant critical re-examination, as authoritative.

  Abstract: The invention and development of recombinant DNA techniques in the 1970s led to what is nowadays known as “genetic engineering” and to “genetically modified organisms” such as transgenic maize, insulin-producing bacteria, and the oncomouse. Synthetic biology is usually thought of as a more recent development. It may come as a surprise, then, that the term “synthetic biology” entered the scientific scene around the same time as “genetic engineering.”<br>

  Book Title: Constructing Feminine Poetics in the Works of a Late-20th-Century Catalan Woman Poet: Maria-Mercè Marçal-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Vicedo Noelia Díaz<br>
  Abstract: This study focuses upon the work of the Catalan woman poet Maria-Mercè Marçal. It analyses the interaction between body and language in her first five books of poetry. Drawing on the Italian feminist thought of il pensiero della differenza sessuale, it examines the ways in which Marçal’s poetic images display her Catalan feminine subjectivity, including the function of the poet, the space of poetry and the representation of love. It also explores the potentiality of the space of poetry to reconstruct female identity and reconfigure reality. In addition, it unravels the way in which the poet uses poetry to express the love for the other whilst also extending the boundaries of the self. The central concern is to bridge the fissure between female experience and universal precepts on the art of poetry through the predominance of an embodied and natural iconography. This study presents Marçal’s poetic compositions within the international panorama of poetry and feminist studies and aims to open up new terrains of discussion in the field of language, body and writing.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I examine Maria-Mercè Marçal’s distinctive feminist thought and her contribution to the scope of Catalan feminism. I also argue how this feminist dimension results from a profound meditation on her experience as a woman and the consequent dialectic relationship with the process of writing. I attempt to demonstrate how in Marçal’s aesthetics, feminism and poetry become inextricably linked and interdependent, and how both converge in a profoundly heuristic process of the place and space of the female body.

  Book Title: A Politics of the Ordinary-  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Dumm Thomas L.<br>
  Abstract: In A Politics of the Ordinary, Thomas Dumm dramatizes how everyday life in the United States intersects with and is influenced by the power of events, on the one hand, and forces of conformity and normalcy on the other. Combining poststructuralist analysis with a sympathetic reading of a strain of American thought that begins with Emerson and culminates in the work of Stanley Cavell, A Politics of the Ordinary investigates incidents from everyday life, political spectacles, and popular culture. Whether juxtaposing reflections about boredom in rural New Mexico with Emerson's theory of constitutional amendment, Richard Nixon's letter of resignation with Thoreau's writings to overcome quiet desperation, or demonstrating how Disney's Toy Story allegorizes the downsizing of the American white-collar work force, Dumm's constant concern is to show how the ordinary is the primary source of the democratic political imagination.<br>

  Abstract: What do Jews think scripture is? How do the People of the Book conceive of the Book of Books? In what ways is it authoritative? Who has the right to interpret it? Is it divinely or humanly written? And have Jews always thought about the Bible in the same way? In seventeen cohesive and rigorously researched essays, this volume traces the way some of the most important Jewish thinkers throughout history have addressed these questions from the rabbinic era through the medieval Islamic world to modern Jewish scholarship. They address why different Jewish thinkers, writers, and communities have turned to the Bible - and what they expect to get from it. Ultimately, argues editor Benjamin D. Sommer, in understanding the ways Jews construct scripture, we begin to understand the ways Jews construct themselves.<br>

  Abstract: The thought of Martin Buber (1878–1965) and Franz Rosenzweig (1886–1929) continues to exert a profound influence not only on theologians and philosophers of religion, both Jewish and Christian, but on biblical scholars as well. Their work has been foundational for readers who want not so much to deny as to move beyond historical and philological approaches that obscure biblical literature’s religious and humanistic vitality. Buber and Rosenzweig bring God back into the picture and thus represent a gesture of return to older modes of biblical interpretation.

  Book Title: 22 Ideas to Fix the World-Conversations with the World's Foremost Thinkers<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Sakwa Richard<br>
  Abstract: The aftershocks of the 2008 financial crisis still reverberate throughout the globe. Markets are down, unemployment is up, and nations from Greece to Ireland find their very infrastructure on the brink of collapse. There is also a crisis in the management of global affairs, with the institutions of global governance challenged as never before, accompanied by conflicts ranging from Syria, to Iran, to Mali. Domestically, the bases for democratic legitimacy, social sustainability, and environmental adaptability are also changing. In this unique volume from the World Public Forum Dialogue of Civilizations and the Social Science Research Council, some of the world's greatest minds - from Nobel Prize winners to long-time activists - explore what the prolonged instability of the so-called Great Recession means for our traditional understanding of how governments can and should function. Through interviews that are sure to spark lively debate,22 Ideas to Fix the Worldpresents both analysis of past geopolitical events and possible solutions and predictions for the future.The book surveys issues relevant to the U.S., Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Speaking from a variety of perspectives, including economic, social, developmental, and political, the discussions here increase our understanding of what's wrong with the world and how to get it right. Interviewees explore topics like the Arab Spring, the influence of international financial organizations, the possibilities for the growth of democracy, the acceleration of global warming, and how to develop enforceable standards for market and social regulation. These inspiring exchanges from some of our most sophisticated thinkers on world policy are honest, brief, and easily understood, presenting thought-provoking ideas in a clear and accessible manner that cuts through the academic jargon that too often obscures more than it reveals.22 Ideas to Fix the Worldis living history in the finest sense - a lasting chronicle ~<br>

  Book Title: Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Feminist as Thinker-A Reader in Documents and Essays<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Smith Richard Cándida<br>
  Abstract: More than one hundred years after her death, Elizabeth Cady Stanton still stands - along with her close friend Susan B. Anthony - as the major icon of the struggle for women's suffrage. In spite of this celebrity, Stanton's intellectual contributions have been largely overshadowed by the focus on her political activities, and she is yet to be recognized as one of the major thinkers of the nineteenth century.Here, at long last, is a single volume exploring and presenting Stanton's thoughtful, original, lifelong inquiries into the nature, origins, range, and solutions of women's subordination. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Feminist as Thinker reintroduces, contextualizes, and critiques Stanton's numerous contributions to modern thought. It juxtaposes a selection of Stanton's own writings, many of them previously unavailable, with eight original essays by prominent historians and social theorists interrogating Stanton's views on such pressing social issues as religion, marriage, race, the self and community, and her place among leading nineteenth century feminist thinkers. Taken together, these essays and documents reveal the different facets, enduring insights, and fascinating contradictions of the work of one of the great thinkers of the feminist tradition.Contributors: Barbara Caine, Richard Candida Smith, Ellen Carol DuBois, Ann D.

  Abstract: In what was ostensibly a letter of praise, the English writer H. G. Wells once wrote to Dora Russell (Bertrand Russell’s first wife) how much he admired her energy and initiative. “Bertie thinks,” he wrote, “and I write but you

Like Bertrand Russell, Wells often made clear his sense of women’s intellectual inadequacies—and he rarely went so far as to suggest that a capacity for action was to be rated more highly than writing or thought.

  Book Title: Externalism-Putting Mind and World Back Together Again<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Rowlands Mark<br>
  Abstract: The externalist conception of the mind was one of the most significant developments in the philosophy of mind in the second half of the twentieth century. Despite its central importance, however, most recent work on externalism has been very technical, often making the basic ideas and principles difficult for students to grasp. As well, comparatively little work has been done to situate externalism in the history of philosophy, in either analytic and continental traditions. Mark Rowlands remedies both these problems, presenting a clear and accessible introduction to externalism that is grounded in wider developments in the history of philosophy. Rowlands discusses Sartre's radical reversal of idealism and the Husserlian views that prompted it; Wittgenstein's attack on the assimilation of meaning and understanding to an inner process; Putnam's and Burge's thought experiments and the externalism about content to which those experiments gave rise; the scope and limits of content externalism; and the extension of externalism to consciousness.<br>

  Abstract: Seldom in the history of thought have men made such absolute declarations of an atheist position as those made by the French non-Christian existentialists. Nietzsche declared that “God is dead” and a whole philosophy has been built up contingent upon that. Sartre writes in
                     Existentialism and Humanism(p. 56): “Existentialism is nothing else but an attempt to draw the full conclusions from a consistently atheistic position.”<br>

  Author(s) PATTISON GEORGE<br>
  Abstract: One might suppose that life’s end is of special importance to narrativist views of the self, even if the specific nature of that import is opaque. Many philosophical discussions of the narrative self touch upon the end of life.¹ End-related terms and concepts that occur in these discussions include finitude, completion, closure,
                  telos, retroactive meaning-conferral, life shape and a closed beginning-middle-and-end structure. Those who emphasise life’s end in non-philosophical narrative contexts are perhaps clearer on its significance. The end is thought to play a key role in the story of a life, securing or enhancing the life narrative’s meaning or<br>

  Author(s) Murray Stuart<br>
  Abstract: Born of the sociocultural effervescence that swept through Europe in the years following the First World War, Surrealism represented a profound disillusionment towards the established intellectual order that it held responsible for the dehumanising and violent depths to which civilisation had so recently sunk.¹ Decrying the inadequacy of postwar philosophies and politics to deal with the new, brutalised world of the interwar period, the Surrealists loudly championed a revolution of perception by replacing the certainties of prewar thought with the unpredictable discontinuities of non-Euclidean geometry, the base materialism of Georges Bataille and, most especially, the dark visions of the human<br>

  Abstract: In the universal humanism of Michel Serres we saw both a development and a change of direction from the accounts of the human elaborated by Badiou, Meillassoux and Malabou. Whereas the figure to emerge in the thought of Badiou and Meillassoux relies on the host capacity of thought, Malabou moves away from determinate capacities but, in her early work at least, seems to favour a host cerebral substance of human personhood. Serres’s account of the human, by contrast, is multi-modal: he combines de-differentiation with a recognition of determinate capacities, and also develops a narrative account of humanity as part of<br>

  Abstract: Moving from the ethical to the legal (or, indeed, the political) is an irreducible problem within the Levinasian framework. This is not an internal failing of his thought. Were it not a problem, were there an easy solution to this relationship, Levinas’s ethics would of course lose all of their radical purchase. Ethics is, by definition, a unique relationship. It is the very singularity of subjectivity put into discord with the infinitely chasmic accusation by the other that constitutes not only ethics but the very movement of subjectivity.

Despite the vigorous affirmation by the German Romantics of the value of Sanskrit poetry and literature, and the celebration by philologists like Max Mueller of the cultural and linguistic proximity of Sanskritic civilization to Europe, the European philosophical tradition, with perhaps the exception of Schopenhauer, has rejected the idea of an Indian ‘philosophy.’ Classical Indian ‘philosophy’ was not regarded as at par, in terms of rigor and rationality, with the products of European civilization.

Of what does the audience need to be persuaded? – the truthfulness, authenticity and plausibility of what is presented. This association of sound with a rhetorical function (persuasion) underscores sound’s relation to the image in documentary film as one of support. Working in a subordinate role, sound, it is thought, enhances and consolidates the tasks set by the image; the soundtrack is simply part of<br>

  Abstract: If for Laruelle Nietzsche establishes the standard model of philosophy as Difference, Heidegger marks the full taking-stock of Difference in relation to the Western tradition as such and draws out the consequences of its immanent critique as the culmination of metaphysics. Whereas Laruelle characterises the Nietzschean model of Difference as one of ‘Idealism’, he designates the Heideggerean model as that of ‘Finitude’. Laruelle’s reading of Heidegger follows the late Heidegger in treating the thought of the ontological difference of Being and beings as still determined and thus relatively constrained by the history of metaphysics.

  Abstract: The discussions provide a jargon-free account of a wide range of historical and contemporary schools of thought about poetic language, and an organised, coherent critique of those schools (including analytical philosophy, cognitive poetics, structuralism and post-structuralism). Via close readings of whole poems from 1600 to the present readers are taken through a wide range of modernist, experimental and innovative poetries. Paired chapters within a chronological structure allow lecturers and students to approach the material in a variety of ways (by individual chapters, paired historical periods) that are appropriate to different courses.<br>

  Abstract: The idea of creativity or creative writing as a research method may seem a contradiction in terms. Long-held beliefs about the nature of creativity identify it as something that is outside or beyond methodical thought. Plato presented his philosopher, Socrates, as charmed by poets, but sceptical about the latters’ capacity to be governed by reason: ‘a poet is a light and winged thing and holy, and never able to compose until he has become inspired, and is beside himself, and reason is no longer in him’.¹ Romanticism is often taken to reinforce these beliefs in its account of the poet<br>

Both were born in Singapore, of Chinese descent, and both became very influential in the dynamic intellectual scene that emerged at the turn of the twentieth century.

The fold, in turn, allows us to overcome some of the more ambiguous elements in Sartre’s thought, particularly insofar as his retention of a dualistic vernacular evokes a problematic image of transcendence and therefore remains trapped in this crisis. The remaining issue with Merleau-Ponty concerns his lack of a worked-out conception of force, particularly within a<br>

But the concept of consciousness cannot be taken for granted. Philosophy in general, both in the phenomenological and in the Anglo-American analytical traditions, has turned to language in order to investigate the realms of experience, perception, thought and understanding.

The compulsion to repeat is one – perhaps the arch – element making the psychic mechanism mechanical, hence the structural role it plays, and consequently its tolerance of<br>

  Abstract: Chapter 5 argued that the ability to take account of the perceptions and expectations of others is crucial to the development of a coherent or stable conception of self, and that this ability is affected by the kinds of dispositions and attitudes we develop as a result of experience: the formative events in our psychological past; the patterns of salience and habits of thought and response we develop. Our emotions are important conduits for registering and communicating value in this regard. They are intelligent evaluative interpretations, which reveal particular dispositions, attitudes and thoughts to others and to ourselves. The previous<br>

  Abstract: There is no consensus among International lawyers on a workable or operable concept of general customary law, supposed to be the fundamental source of an international law binding upon states. It is thought to represent an analytical framework within which one can assess whether states recognize a rule, principle, or practice as binding upon them as law. Jurists are to examine the same ‘raw material’ of international relations as diplomats, statesmen, historians, and political scientists. Yet according to the most orthodox view, expressed in the jurisprudence of the ICJ the jurists are to find that states have, in some sense,<br>

  Abstract: If Castoriadis constitutes the (extimate) frontier of the emerging Lacanian Left, two of its pivotal figures are certainly Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe. For a start, they have both exhibited, again and again, their increasing readiness to take on board many crucial Lacanian insights in their innovative analysis of political discourse and in reorienting the political theory of the Left in the direction of a ‘radical and plural democracy’. In their joint work, theoretical affinities with Lacanian thought are evident from at least the time of

  Book Title: Phenomenology or Deconstruction?-The Question of Ontology in Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricoeur and Jean-Luc Nancy<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Watkin Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Phenomenology or Deconstruction? challenges traditional understandings of the relationship between phenomenology and deconstruction through new readings of the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricœur and Jean-Luc Nancy. A constant dialogue with Jacques Derrida's engagement with phenomenological themes provides the impetus to establishing a new understanding of 'being' and 'presence' that exposes significant blindspots inherent in traditional readings of both phenomenology and deconstruction.In reproducing neither a stock phenomenological reaction to deconstruction nor the routine deconstructive reading of phenomenology, Christopher Watkin provides a fresh assessment of the possibilities for the future of phenomenology, along with a new reading of the deconstructive legacy. Through detailed studies of the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty, Ricœur and Nancy, he shows how a phenomenological tradition much wider and richer than Husserlian or Heideggerean thought alone can take account of Derrida's critique of ontology and yet still hold a commitment to the ontological. This new reading of being and presence fundamentally re-draws our understanding of the relation of deconstruction and phenomenology, and provides the first sustained discussion of the possibilities and problems for any future 'deconstructive phenomenology'.<br>

  Book Title: Post-Foundational Political Thought-Political Difference in Nancy, Lefort, Badiou and Laclau<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Marchart Oliver<br>
  Abstract: A wide-ranging overview of the emergence of post-foundationalism and a survey of the work of its key contemporary exponents.This book presents the first systematic coverage of the conceptual difference between ‘politics’ (the practice of conventional politics: the political system or political forms of action) and ‘the political’ (a much more radical aspect which cannot be restricted to the realms of institutional politics). It is also the first introductory overview of post-foundationalism and the tradition of ‘left Heideggerianism’: the political thought of contemporary theorists who make frequent use of the idea of political difference: Jean-Luc Nancy, Claude Lefort, Alain Badiou and Ernesto Laclau.After an overview of current trends in social post-foundationalism and a genealogical chapter on the historical emergence of the difference between the concepts of ‘politics’ and ‘the political’, the work of individual theorists is presented and discussed at length. Individual chapters are presented on the political thought of Jean-Luc Nancy (including Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe), Claude Lefort, Alain Badiou, and Ernesto Laclau (including Chantal Mouffe).Overall the book offers an elaboration of the idea of a post-foundational conception of politics.Other titles in the Taking on the Political series: Valentine and Arditi/ Polemicisation 0 7486 1064 2Shapiro/ Cinematic Political Thought 0 7486 1289 0Chambers/ Language and the Politics of Untimeliness 0 7486 1766 3Bowman/ Post-Marxism Versus Cultural Studies 978 0 7486 1762 3Simons/ Critical Political Theory in the Media Age 0 7486 1583 0<br>

  Abstract: One of our initial assumptions was that, if our aim is to delineate the contours of current post-foundational political thought, it is not sufficient to develop the conceptual history of the emerging concept of the political. In the present investigation I wanted to go one step further by concentrating on those theories that employ the term within the post-foundational framework of what was described as left Heideggerianism. So let us once more recapitulate the thesis: in most such theories, ‘the political’ in its difference vis-à-vis ‘the social’ and ‘politics’ serves as an indicator of precisely the impossibility or absence of<br>

  Abstract: For Deleuze, all thinking begins in a kind of pathos. This is because thinking must be distinguished from knowledge or mental activity in general: remembering, sensing, imagining and so on. These modes of cognition remain at the purely empirical level of recognisable objects. Thought, however, goes beyond the limits of the recognisable and thus needs to be grasped in a way which distinguishes it from our day-to-day cognition of the world.¹ In other words, thought goes beyond the given differences which allow us to recognise the objects of our experience, and in turn leads towards a realm in which differences<br>

  Book Title: Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clemens Justin<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis was the most important intellectual development of the twentieth century, which left no practice from psychiatry to philosophy to politics untouched. Yet it was also in many ways an untouchable project, caught between science and poetry, medicine and hermeneutics. This unsettled, unsettling status has recently induced the philosopher Alain Badiou to characterise psychoanalysis as an ‘antiphilosophy’, that is, as a practice that issues the strongest possible challenges to thought. Justin Clemens takes up the challenge of this denomination here, by re-examining a series of crucial psychoanalytic themes: addiction, fanaticism, love, slavery and torture. Drawing from the work of Freud, Lacan, Badiou, Agamben and others, 'Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy' offers a radical reconstruction of the operations and import of key psychoanalytic concepts and a renewed sense of the indispensable powers of psychoanalysis for today.<br>

  Abstract: If art moves, understanding moves. Schleiermacher and Dilthey showed how within hermeneutics, understanding upholds itself by a constant, irresolvable and inconclusive movement between part and whole. The philosophy of Hans-Georg Gadamer uniquely transfers insights relating to the movement of understanding to the question of aesthetic attentiveness. In his thought, aesthetic contemplation no longer attends to changeless forms but participates in the movement of a work’s constitutive elements. Aesthetic contemplation is no longer passive but an active participant (
                  theoros) in the bringing forth what a work can disclose. Where Dilthey laments the inconclusiveness of understanding, Gadamer celebrates it. The ceaseless movement<br>

  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Saltz David Z.<br>
  Abstract: The fifteen original essays in
      Staging Philosophymake useful connections between the discipline of philosophy and the fields of theater and performance and use these insights to develop new theories about theater. Each of the contributors-leading scholars in the fields of performance and philosophy-breaks new ground, presents new arguments, and offers new theories that will pave the way for future scholarship.Staging Philosophyraises issues of critical importance by providing case studies of various philosophical movements and schools of thought, including aesthetics, analytic philosophy, phenomenology, deconstruction, critical realism, and cognitive science. The essays, which are organized into three sections-history and method, presence, and reception-take up fundamental issues such as spectatorship, empathy, ethics, theater as literature, and the essence of live performance. While some essays challenge assertions made by critics and historians of theater and performance, others analyze the assumptions of manifestos that prescribe how practitioners should go about creating texts and performances. The first book to bridge the disciplines of theater and philosophy,Staging Philosophywill provoke, stimulate, engage, and ultimately bring theater to the foreground of intellectual inquiry while it inspires further philosophical investigation into theater and performance.David Krasneris Associate Professor of Theater Studies, African American Studies, and English at Yale University.

By focusing on a theory’s internal structure as an assemblage of political concepts, this book conceptualizes theories as theoretical constructions, a form of idea entity, and moreover, a form of political thought: a configuration of decontested political concepts arranged together, each conferring meaning on the others and receiving meaning from them.

  Book Title: Moving Consciously-Somatic Transformations through Dance, Yoga, and Touch<br>
  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Fraleigh Sondra<br>
  Abstract: The popularity of yoga and Zen meditation has heightened awareness of somatic practices. Individuals develop the conscious embodiment central to somatics work via movement and dance, or through touch from a skilled teacher or therapist often called a somatic bodyworker. Methods of touch and movement foster generative processes of consciousness in order to create a fluid interconnection between sensation, thought, movement, and expression. In Moving Consciously , Sondra Fraleigh gathers essays that probe ideas surrounding embodied knowledge and the conscious embodiment of movement and dance. Using a variety of perspectives on movement and dance somatics, Fraleigh and other contributors draw on scholarship and personal practice to participate in a multifaceted investigation of a thriving worldwide phenomenon. Their goal: to present the mental and physical health benefits of experiencing one's inner world through sensory awareness and movement integration. A stimulating addition to a burgeoning field, Moving Consciously incorporates concepts from East and West into a timely look at life-changing, intertwined practices that involve dance, movement, performance studies, and education.

  Author(s): Duran Jane<br>
  Abstract: Spanning over nine hundred years, Eight Women Philosophers is the first singly-authored work to trace the themes of standard philosophical theorizing and feminist thought across women philosophers in the Western tradition. Jane Duran has crafted a comprehensive overview of eight women philosophers--Hildegard of Bingen, Anne Conway, Mary Astell, Mary Wollstonecraft, Harriet Taylor Mill, Edith Stein, Simone Weil, and Simone de Beauvoir--that underscores the profound and continuing significance of these thinkers for contemporary scholars. _x000B_Duran devotes one chapter to each philosopher and provides a sustained critical analysis of her work, utilizing aspects of Continental theory, poststructuralist theory, and literary theory. She situates each philosopher within her respective era and in relation to her intellectual contemporaries, and specifically addresses the contributions each has made to major areas such as metaphysics/epistemology, theory of value, and feminist theory. She affirms the viability and importance of recovering these women's overlooked work and provides a powerful answer to the question of why the rubric "women philosophers" remains so valuable.<br>

It is cited in a number of areas of endeavor and disciplines. Far from being regarded merely as a philosopher, Weil is frequently thought of in other terms, as a religious thinker or, as some would have it, a mystic. Her work has in common with the thought of Edith Stein a devotion to belief and an attempt to get to the core of things, while with that other Simone, Simone de<br>

  Abstract: Group. Art. Text. Genre. Performance. Context. Tradition. Identity. _x000B_No matter where we are--in academic institutions, in cultural agencies, at home, or in a casual conversation--these are words we use when we talk about creative expression in its cultural contexts. Eight Words for the Study of Expressive Culture is a thoughtful, interdisciplinary examination of the keywords that are integral to the formulation of ideas about the diversity of human creativity, presented as a set of essays by leading folklorists. _x000B_Many of us use these eight words every day. We think with them. We teach with them. Much of contemporary scholarship rests on their meanings and implications. They form a significant part of a set of conversations extending through centuries of thought about creativity, meaning, beauty, local knowledge, values, and community. Their natural habitats range across scholarly disciplines from anthropology and folklore to literary and cultural studies and provide the framework for other fields of practice and performance as well. _x000B_Eight Words for the Study of Expressive Culture is a much-needed study of keywords that are frequently used but not easily explained. Anchored by Burt Feintuchs cogent introduction, the book features essays by Dorothy Noyes, Gerald L. Pocius, Jeff Todd Titon, Trudier Harris, Deborah A.

  Author(s): Skafish Peter<br>
  Abstract: The iconoclastic Brazilian anthropologist and theoretician Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, well known in his discipline for helping initiate its "ontological turn," offers a vision of anthropology as "the practice of the permanent decolonization of thought." After showing that Amazonian and other Amerindian groups inhabit a radically different conceptual universe than ours-in which nature and culture, human and nonhuman, subject and object are conceived in terms that reverse our own-he presents the case for anthropology as the study of such "other" metaphysical schemes, and as the corresponding critique of the concepts imposed on them by the human sciences. Along the way, he spells out the consequences of this anthropology for thinking in general via a major reassessment of the work of Claude Lévi-Strauss, arguments for the continued relevance of Deleuze and Guattari, dialogues with the work of Philippe Descola, Bruno Latour, and Marilyn Strathern, and inventive treatments of problems of ontology, translation, and transformation. Bold, unexpected, and profound,
      Cannibal Metaphysicsis one of the chief works marking anthropology's current return to the theoretical center stage.<br>

  Book Title: The Thought of Death and the Memory of War-  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
  Abstract: War lays bare death and our relation to it. And in the wars-or more precisely the memories of war-of the twentieth century, images of the deaths of countless faceless or nameless others eclipse the singularity of each victim's death as well as the end of the world as such that each death signifies. Marc Crépon's The Thought of Death and the Memory of War is a call to resist such images in which death is no longer actual death since it happens to anonymous others, and to seek instead a world in which mourning the other whose mortality we always already share points us toward a cosmopolitics. Crépon pursues this path toward a cosmopolitics of mourning through readings of works by Freud, Heidegger, Sartre, Patocka, Levinas, Derrida, and Ricœur, and others. The movement among these writers, Crépon shows, marks a way through-and against-twentieth-century interpretation to argue that no war, genocide, or neglect of people is possible without suspending how one relates to the death of another human being. A history of a critical strain in contemporary thought, this book is, as Rodolphe Gasché says in the Foreword, "a profound meditation on what constitutes evil and a rigorous and illuminating reflection on death, community, and world." The translation of this work received financial support from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<br>

  Book Title: Heidegger and Criticism-Retrieving the Cultural Politics of Destruction<br>

  Author(s): Pease Donald E.<br>
  Abstract: In Heidegger and Criticism: Retrieving the Cultural Politics of Destruction, William Spanos examines the controversy, both in Europe and the United States, surrounding Heidegger and recent disclosures about his Nazi past. Not intended as a defense or apology for Heidegger’s thought, Spanos instead affirms the importance of Heidegger’s “antihumanist” interrogation of the modern age, its globalization of technology, and its neo-imperialist politics. The attack on Heidegger’s “antihumanist” discourse (by “liberal humanists” who have imported the European debated into the United States) aligns ideologically with the ongoing policing operations of William Bennett, Allan Bloom, E.D. Hirsch, Roger Kimball, Dinesh D”Souza, and others in the spheres of higher education and cultural production. Throughout his arguments, Spanos focuses not so much on Heidegger the historical subject as on the transformative cultural political discourses and practices, implicit in and enabled by Heidegger’s interrogations of Being and Time, that have led to the contemporary emergence of the multiplicity of resistant “Others” colonized by hegemonic discursive formations, all the while reminding us that Heidegger’s philosophic interrogations eventually generate a diverse body of transgressive writing and an oppositional intellectual climate in the West.<br>

Theories and expressions of atavism in these representational spheres reveal the way modern thought oriented itself around a paradigm of obsolescence and return that structured the experience of modern time.

Although this study has focused primarily on Portuguese and Brazilian national cultures, this epistemological shift has clearly been an international phenomenon due to a multiplicity of interrelated factors, namely (in varying order of intensity) globalization, the relative weakening of foundationalist thought structures (for example, nationalisms, Marxism, and Christianity); the affirmation of micro or<br>

  Abstract: By the early 1960s, a young postwar generation of architects had seized the idea that architecture should participate in the liberation of human experience from the constraints of the social status quo. Raised during the ascendancy of postwar modernism in the West, they viewed its austere institutionalized aesthetics as the emblem of an oppressive and closed social order. They thought individual experience had been impoverished by the process of industrialization and became disillusioned with the modernist faith in technology as the driver of emancipation. In a radical break from modernist ideology, some members of that generation sought to reground the<br>

  Abstract: The

But Dante’s small book is forward-, rather than backward-looking; Dante saw his poetry as the culmination and fulfillment of his predecessors’ poetics, and as a promise of something greater, as completing their works in the same way that the New Testament was thought to have completed the Old—a figural reading of literary<br>

  Abstract: At least since Benedict Anderson breathed new life into the thought of Walter Benjamin, Ernst Renan, and Victor Turner, nationalism has constituted a prominent conceptual feature of contemporary literary and cultural studies. Following the lead of Perry Anderson, Anthony Giddens, and others, academics in English literary studies, by and large, have restricted their analyses to artifacts produced since the late eighteenth century, when the American and French revolutions launched the processes that gave rise to both a modern state founded on popular sovereignty and the appearance in the lexicon of the word “nationalism” (Anderson,

  Abstract: If the producers of the so-called reality TV shows have any say in defining reality, Jean Baudrillard and Michel Foucault are not merely towering figures of postmodern thought; they are the true prophets of this young millennium. By placing human subjects under the never-ending surveillance of cameras, and by labeling the resulting spectacle reality, these shows seem to have been conceived for the specific purpose of implementing Foucault’s dystopic vision of a panoptic society, and Baudrillard’s doctrine of the (hyper) reality of the image in contemporary culture.

  Book Title: The Habermas Handbook-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): LAFONT CRISTINA<br>
  Abstract: Jürgen Habermas is one of the most influential philosophers of our time. His diagnoses of contemporary society and concepts such as the public sphere, communicative rationality, and cosmopolitanism have influenced virtually all academic disciplines, spurred political debates, and shaped intellectual life in Germany and beyond for more than fifty years. In
      The
            Habermas Handbook, leading Habermas scholars elucidate his thought, providing essential insight into his key concepts, the breadth of his work, and his influence across politics, law, the social sciences, and public life.This volume offers a comprehensive overview and an in-depth analysis of Habermas's work in its entirety. After examining his intellectual biography, it goes on to illuminate the social and intellectual context of Habermasian thought, such as the Frankfurt School, speech-act theory, and contending theories of democracy. TheHandbookprovides an extensive account of Habermas's texts, ranging from his dissertation on Schelling to his most recent writing about Europe. It illustrates the development of his thought and its frequently controversial reception while elaborating the central ideas of his work. The book also provides a glossary of key terms and concepts, making the complexity of Habermas's thought accessible to a broad readership.<br>

  Abstract: Although Habermas has rarely explicitly addressed the topic of equality, it is clearly an ideal that informs much of his thought. This is, of course, not surprising, since the idea of an association in which “the free development of each is a condition for the free development of all” is an ideal that informs the tradition of Western Marxism, of which Habermas is a central figure.

  Book Title: Political Uses of Utopia-New Marxist, Anarchist, and Radical Democratic Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): INGRAM JAMES D.<br>
  Abstract: Utopia has long been banished from political theory, framed as an impossible-and possibly dangerous-political ideal, a flawed social blueprint, or a thought experiment without any practical import. Even the "realistic utopias" of liberal theory strike many as wishful thinking. Can politics think utopia otherwise? Can utopian thinking contribute to the renewal of politics?In
      Political Uses of Utopia, an international cast of leading and emerging theorists agree that the uses of utopia for politics are multiple and nuanced and lie somewhere between-or, better yet, beyond-the mainstream caution against it and the conviction that another, better world ought to be possible. Representing a range of perspectives on the grand tradition of Western utopianism, which extends back half a millennium and perhaps as far as Plato, these essays are united in their interest in the relevance of utopianism to specific historical and contemporary political contexts. Featuring contributions from Miguel Abensour, Étienne Balibar, Raymond Geuss, and Jacques Rancière, among others,Political Uses of Utopiareopens the question of whether and how utopianism can inform political thinking and action today.<br>

But this complexity does not exist in isolation, any more than it can be frozen in time in the form of an unchanging position. Bodies of thought enrich and transform each other through the play of interactions and reactions, strategies and exchanges, and conflicts and ruptures. One body of thought thus implicates others.

  Abstract: Alessandro Ferrara instead launches an entirely different strategy for transcending the particularity of context without contradicting our pluralistic intuitions: a strategy centered on the exemplary universalism of judgment. Whereas exemplarity has long been thought to belong to the domain of aesthetics, this book explores the

After defining exemplarity and describing how something unique can possess universal significance, Ferrara addresses the force exerted by exemplarity, the nature of the judgment that discloses exemplarity, and the way in which the force of the example can bridge the difference between various contexts.<br>

  Author(s): BERNASCONI ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: Emphasizing the multidisciplinary and global nature of existential arguments, the chosen texts relate to philosophy, religion, literature, theater, and culture and reflect European, Russian, Latin American, African, and American strains of thought. Readings are grouped into three thematic categories: national contexts, existentialism and religion, and transcultural migrations that explore the reception of existentialism. The volume explains how literary giants such as Dostoevsky and Tolstoy were incorporated into the existentialist fold and how inclusion into the canon recast the work of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, and it describes the roles played by Jaspers and Heidegger in Germany and the Paris School of existentialism in France. Essays address not only frequently assigned works but also underappreciated discoveries, underscoring their vital relevance to contemporary critical debate. Designed to speak to a new generation's concerns, the collection deploys a diverse range of voices to interrogate the fundamental questions of the human condition.<br>

  Author(s): Marasco Robyn<br>
  Abstract: The Highway of Despairfollows Theodor Adorno, Georges Bataille, and Frantz Fanon as they each read, resist, and reconfigure a strand of thought in Hegel'sPhenomenology of Spirit. Confronting the twentieth-century collapse of a certain revolutionary dialectic, these thinkers struggle to revalue critical philosophy and recast Left Hegelianism within the contexts of genocidal racism, world war, and colonial domination. Each thinker also re-centers the role of passion in critique. Arguing against more recent trends in critical theory that promise an escape from despair, Marasco shows how passion frustrates the resolutions of reason and faith. Embracing the extremism of what Marx, in the spirit of Hegel, called the "ruthless critique of everything existing," she affirms the contemporary purchase of radical critical theory, resulting in a passionate approach to political thought.<br>

In this broader sense, then, what follows are close encounters with some twentieth-century Left Hegelians: Theodor W. Adorno, Georges Bataille, and Frantz Fanon, in particular.

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Obeyesekere Gananath<br>
  Abstract: Throughout his career, Obeyesekere has combined psychoanalysis and anthropology to illuminate the relationship between personal symbolism and religious experience. In this book, he begins with Buddha's visionary trances wherein, over the course of four hours, he witnesses hundreds of thousands of his past births and eons of world evolution, renewal, and disappearance. He then connects this fracturing of empirical and visionary time to the realm of space, considering the experience of a female Christian penitent, who stares devotedly at a tiny crucifix only to see the space around it expand to mirror Christ's suffering. Obeyesekere follows the unconscious motivations underlying rapture, the fantastical consumption of Christ's body and blood, and body mutilation and levitation, bridging medieval Catholicism and the movements of early modern thought as reflected in William Blake's artistic visions and poetic dreams. He develops the term "dream-ego" through a discussion of visionary journeys, Carl Jung's and Sigmund Freud's scientific dreaming, and the cosmic and erotic dream-visions of New Age virtuosos, and he defines the parameters of a visionary mode of knowledge that provides a more elastic understanding of truth. A career-culminating work, this volume translates the epistemology of Hindu and Buddhist thinkers for western audiences while revitalizing western philosophical and scientific inquiry.<br>

  Abstract: In book 4 I have dealt with the rich visionary traditions in medieval Christianity. The rest of this essay leaps over a couple of centuries to consider those who lived and worked under the shadow of the Enlightenment. This hinge discourse builds a rough bridge between the visions of Catholic penitents and those who experienced visions in the height of the age of reason, beginning with Blake and ending with new age visionaries. We now know that it is a mistake to think that Enlightenment and scientific reason simply supplanted the prior tradition of visionary thought, even in those countries<br>

  Abstract: Other powerful lineages populate the history of philosophy. There are other binaries to describe the issues and people at work in the tradition. Of course, there is Idealism and Materialism; the ascetic Ideal and the hedonist Ideal; and transcendence and immanence. But equally, there is denigration of the “I” and writing about the self. On the one hand, the philosophers I have listed did not seem to value autobiographical confession or little details derived from personal experiences. On the other hand, their lives fed their thought and they acknowledged drawing lessons from life. Some are messengers who efface themselves, trying<br>

  Book Title: Encountering Religion-Responsibility and Criticism After Secularism<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS TYLER<br>
  Abstract: To respond to religion is to ask what religious behaviors and representations mean to us in our individual worlds, and scholars must confront questions of possibility and becoming that arise from testing their beliefs, imperatives, and practices. Roberts refers to the work of Hent de Vries, Eric Santner, and Stanley Cavell, each of whom exemplifies encounter and response in their writings as they traverse philosophy and religion to expose secular thinking to religious thought and practice. This approach highlights the resources religious discourse can offer to a fundamental reorientation of critical thought. In humanistic criticism after secularism, the lines separating the creative, the pious, and the critical themselves become the subject of question and experimentation.<br>

  Book Title: Milton and the Rabbis-Hebraism, Hellenism, and Christianity<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Shoulson Jeffrey S.<br>
  Abstract: Shoulson is unconvinced of a direct link between a specific collection of rabbinic writings and Milton's works. He argues that many of Milton's poetic ideas that parallel midrash are likely to have entered Christian discourse not only through early modern Christian Hebraicists but also through Protestant writers and preachers without special knowledge of Hebrew. At the heart of Shoulson's inquiry lies a fundamental question: When is an idea, a theme, or an emphasis distinctively Judaic or Hebraic and when is it Christian? The difficulty in answering such questions reveals and highlights the fluid interaction between ostensibly Jewish, Hellenistic, and Christian modes of thought not only during the early modern period but also early in time when rabbinic Judaism and Christianity began.<br>

  Book Title: The Death of Philosophy-Reference and Self-reference in Contemporary Thought<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): LYNCH RICHARD A.<br>
  Abstract: Thomas-Fogiel begins with postphilosophical claims such as scientism, which she reveals to be self-refuting, for they subsume philosophy into the branches of the natural sciences. She discovers similar issues in Rorty's skepticism and strands of continental thought. Revisiting the work of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century philosophers, when the split between analytical and continental philosophy began, Thomas-Fogiel finds both traditions followed the same path-the road of reference-which ultimately led to self-contradiction. This phenomenon, whether valorized or condemned, has been understood as the death of philosophy. Tracing this pattern from Quine to Rorty, from Heidegger to Levinas and Habermas, Thomas-Fogiel reveals the self-contradiction at the core of their claims while also carving an alternative path through self-reference. Trained under the French philosopher Bernard Bourgeois, she remakes philosophy in exciting new ways for the twenty-first century.<br>

  Abstract: The return to Kant is in fact the choice of a single path that brings an end to the tension in the critical project. It is a matter of “returning” to the question of representation as an explication of the relation between a subject and an object. Let’s first of all recall that, from 1810 to 1850, Hegel and his disciples were the main figures on the philosophical scene. Henri Dussort points this out, “From 1800 to about 1840, speculative thought, its famous developers and their disciples occupied the center stage.”¹ Friedrich Engels himself noted that this enthusiasm for the<br>

  Author(s): TRAVERSO ENZO<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on a vast and diverse archive in theory, testimony, and image and on such thinkers as Karl Marx, Walter Benjamin, Theodor W. Adorno, and others, the intellectual historian Enzo Traverso explores the varying nature of left melancholy as it has manifested in a feeling of guilt for not sufficiently challenging authority, in a fear of surrendering in disarray and resignation, in mourning the human costs of the past, and in a sense of failure for not realizing utopian aspirations. Yet hidden within this melancholic tradition are the resources for a renewed challenge to prevailing regimes of historicity, a passion that has the power to reignite the dialectic of revolutionary thought.<br>

  Book Title: After Christianity-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): D’Isanto Luca<br>
  Abstract: When Vattimo was asked by a former teacher if he still believed in God, his reply was, "Well, I believe that I believe." This paradoxical declaration of faith serves as the foundation for a brilliant exposition on Christianity in the new millennium -- an age characterized by a deep uncertainty of opinion -- and a personal account of how Vattimo himself recovered his faith through Nietzsche and Heidegger. He first argues that secularization is in fact the fulfillment of the central Christian message, and prepares us for a new mode of Christianity. He then explains that Nietzsche's thesis concerns only the "moral god" and leaves room for the emergence of "new gods." Third, Vattimo claims that the postmodern condition of fragmentation, anti-Eurocentrism, and postcolonialism can be usefully understood in light of Joachim of Fiore's thesis concerning the "Spiritual Age" of history. Finally, Vattimo argues for the idea of "weak thought." Because philosophy in the postmetaphysical age can only acknowledge that "all is interpretation," that the "real" is always relative and not the hard and fast "truth" we once thought it to be, contemporary thought must recognize itself and its claims as "weak" as opposed to "strong" foundationalist claims of the metaphysical past. Vattimo concludes that these factors make it possible for religion and God to become a serious topic for philosophy again, and that philosophy should now formally engage religion.<br>

  Abstract: HEIDEGGER’S RELATIONSHIP TO the Christian, and specifically Catholic, tradition is still to be thoroughly explored. Heidegger was steeped in Catholicism to the extent that his bishop subsidized his studies, and he was considered the bright promise of German Catholic thought at the beginning of his career. Perhaps this relationship to Christianity will appear in a new light after the release of more unpublished works in addition to those that have appeared in recent years. Among the latter, the “Einleitung in die Phenomenologie der Religion” (Introduction to the Phenomenology of Religion)¹ has a central place. This is a transcript of the<br>

  Abstract: Vattimo's status as a left-wing faculty president paradoxically made him a target of the Red Brigades in the 1970s, causing him to flee Turin for his life. Left-wing terrorism did not deter the philosopher from his quest for social progress, however, and in the 1980s, he introduced a daring formulation called "weak thought," which stripped metaphysics, science, religion, and all other absolute systems of their authority. Vattimo then became notorious both for his renewed commitment to the core values of Christianity (he was trained as a Catholic intellectual) and for the Vatican's denunciation of his views.<br>

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): VÁZQUEZ-ARROYO ANTONIO Y.<br>
  Abstract: Sounding the alarm for those who care about robust forms of civic engagement, this book fights for a new conception of political responsibility that meets the challenges of today's democratic practice. Antonio Y. Vázquez-Arroyo forcefully argues against the notion that modern predicaments of power can only be addressed ethically or philosophically through pristine concepts that operate outside of the political realm. By returning to the political, the individual is reintroduced to the binding principles of participatory democracy and the burdens of acting and thinking as a member of a collective. Vázquez-Arroyo historicizes the ethical turn to better understand its ascendence and reworks Adorno's dialectic of responsibility to reassert the political in contemporary thought and theory.<br>

  Author(s): Duke Michael S.<br>
  Abstract: From Ying-shih Yü's perspective, the
      Dao, or the Way, constitutes the inner core of Chinese civilization. His work explores the unique dynamics between Chinese intellectuals' discourse on theDao, or moral principles for a symbolized ideal world order, and their criticism of contemporary reality throughout Chinese history. Volume 2 ofChinese History and Culturecompletes Ying-shih Yü's systematic reconstruction and exploration of Chinese thought over two millennia and its impact on Chinese identity. Essays address the rise of Qing Confucianism, the development of the Dai Zhen and Zhu Xi traditions, and the response of the historian Zhang Xuecheng to the Dai Zhen approach. They take stock of the thematic importance of Cao Xueqin's eighteenth-century masterpieceHonglou meng(Dream of the Red Chamber) and the influence of Sun Yat-sen'sThree Principles of the People, as well as the radicalization of China in the twentieth century and the fundamental upheavals of modernization and revolution. Ying-shih Yü also discusses the decline of elite culture in modern China, the relationships among democracy, human rights, and Confucianism, and changing conceptions of national history. He reflects on the Chinese approach to history in general and the larger political and cultural function of chronological biographies. By situating China's modern encounter with the West in a wider historical frame, this second volume ofChinese History and Cultureclarifies its more curious turns and contemplates the importance of a renewed interest in the traditional Chinese values recognizing common humanity and human dignity.<br>

To suggest that there are essential determinate characteristics in Chinese historiography that are wholly absent in the West is to lapse into a false essentialism. The more I know about the history of Western historiography, the less I am sure about the possibility of drawing a sharp distinction between the two traditions.

  Abstract: The work of German cultural theorist and art historian Aby Warburg (1866-1929) has had a lasting effect on how we think about images. This book is the first in English to focus on his last project, the encyclopedic
         Atlas of Images: Mnemosyne. Begun in earnest in 1927, and left unfinished at the time of Warburg's death in 1929, theMnemosyne-Atlasconsisted of sixty-three large wooden panels covered with black cloth. On these panels Warburg carefully, intuitively arranged some thousand black-and-white photographs of classical and Renaissance art objects, as well as of astrological and astronomical images ranging from ancient Babylon to Weimar Germany. Here and there, he also included maps, manuscript pages, and contemporary images taken from newspapers. Trying through these constellations of images to make visible the many polarities that fueled antiquity's afterlife, Warburg envisioned theMnemosyne-Atlasas a vital form of metaphoric thought.<br>

This fugue is seeded with possibilities that are waiting for us, its listeners, to develop them. Some are dead ends-viruses that can lead only to a monolithic, monotonous misunderstanding of history. Others are embryonic insights that promise to deepen our thought, and perhaps our lives, if we find the right way to make them our own."<br>

  Abstract: Wagner’s
                  Parsifalmay be thought of as both an end and a beginning. As the completion of Wagner’s programme of recovering and renewing the tradition of religious theatre, it was meant to signify the last stage of overcoming opera. As the paradigmatic example of a new cultic theatre, of art religion in the full sense of the term, it provided a model for the avant-garde search for a synthesis of the arts. How this played out in the theatre, from the Ballets Russes to Brecht and Artaud, will be the subject of the following chapters. In the present chapter I<br>

  Book Title: Mourning Happiness-Narrative and the Politics of Modernity<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Soni Vivasvan<br>
  Abstract: Soni explains that this puzzling phenomenon can only be comprehended by studying a structural transformation of the idea of happiness at the level of narrative form. Happiness is stripped of its ethical and political content, Soni demonstrates, when its intimate relation to narrative is destroyed. This occurs, paradoxically, in some of the most characteristic narratives of the period: eighteenth-century novels including
         Pamela, The Vicar of Wakefield, andJulie; the pervasive sentimentalism of the time; Kant's ethics; and the political thought of Rousseau and Jefferson.<br>

  Abstract: The trial narrative paradigm achieves its most radical development and rigorous theorization in Kant’s writings on ethics, politics, history, and religion.¹ When Kant’s thought is interrogated from the perspective of the trial narrative, not only do we gain unconventional insight into the underlying narrative structure of his theories, but we also discover surprising continuities between the eighteenth-century novel, sentimentalism, and Kantian ethics.² Indeed, I would argue that novels such as 
                  Pamela and Julie are the imaginative precondition for the emergence of Kantian ethics, just as Kant theorizes one of the most important narrative developments in the eighteenth century.³ Among his<br>

  Book Title: A Companion to Julian of Norwich-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): McAvoy Liz Herbert<br>
  Abstract: Julian of Norwich, the fourteenth/early fifteenth-century anchoress and mystic, is one of the most important and best-known figures of the Middle Ages. Her Revelations, intense visions of the divine, have been widely studied and read; the first known writings of an English woman, their influence extends over theology and literature. However, many aspects of both her life and thought remain enigmatic. This exciting new collection offers a comprehensive, accessible coverage of the key aspects of debate surrounding Julian. It places the author within a wide range of contemporary literary, social, historical and religious contexts, and also provides a wealth of new insights into manuscript traditions, perspectives on her writing and ways of interpreting it, building on the work of many of the most active and influential researchers within Julian studies, and including the fruits of the most recent, ground-breaking findings. It will therefore be a vital companion for all of Julian's readers in the twenty-first century.

  Abstract: In order to critique the philosophical concept of the absolute subject — the subject posited by German idealist thought — one need not dismiss wholesale all prior Western metaphysics, as did Heidegger. For his part, Kleist made narratives of such critiques. Casting a critical eye upon contemporary philosophical systems, he relentlessly denied absolution to the characters in his texts. His explorations of the fundamentally fragmentary nature of subjectivity implicated him in the same Romantic philosophical dilemma that I have been describing throughout.

  Abstract: Why, indeed, is memory important in medieval romances? This question needs clarification given the many associations and definitions of such a complex cognitive faculty as memory, and the equally wide-ranging scope of this particular literary genre. We should begin by considering what exactly we mean by “memory,” which can be both individual, relating to the thought processes of a single remembering subject, and also collective. To take examples from the romance genre itself, a single knight might be trying desperately to maintain the memory of his love whilst away from home for many years. This is his individual memorial challenge.<br>

  Book Title: Forgotten Dreams-Revisiting Romanticism in the Cinema of Werner Herzog<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Johnson Laurie Ruth<br>
  Abstract: Werner Herzog (b. 1942) is perhaps the most famous living German filmmaker, but his films have never been read in the context of German cultural history. And while there is a surfeit of film reviews, interviews, and scholarly articles on Herzog and his work, there are very few books devoted to his films, and none addressing his entire career to date. Until now. Forgotten Dreams offers not only an analytical study of Herzog's films but also a new reading of Romanticism's impact beyond the nineteenth century. It argues that his films re-envision and help us better understand a critical stream in Romanticism, and places the films in conversation with other filmmakers, authors, and philosophers in order to illuminate that critical stream. The result is a lively reconnection with Romantic themes and convictions that have been partly forgotten in the midst of Germany's postwar rejection of much of Romantic thought, yet are still operative in German culture today. The film analyses will interest scholars of film, German Studies, and Romanticism as well as a broader public interested in Herzog's films and contemporary German cultural debates. The book will also appeal to those interested in the ongoing renegotiation - by Western and other cultures - of relationships between reason and passion, civilization and wild nature, knowledge and belief.

  Book Title: Modern German Thought from Kant to Habermas-An Annotated German-Language Reader<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Large Duncan<br>
  Abstract: German-language thinkers such as Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud are central to modernity. Yet their reception in the English-speaking world has largely depended on translations, a situation that has often hampered full engagement with the rhetorical and philosophical complexity of the German history of ideas. The present volume, the first of its kind, is a response to this situation. After an introduction charting the remarkable flowering of German-language thought since the eighteenth century, it offers extracts -- in the original German -- from sixteen major philosophical texts, with extensive introductions and annotations in English. All extracts are carefully chosen to introduce the individual thinkers while allowing the reader to pursue broader themes such as the fate of reason or the history of modern selfhood. The book offers students and scholars of German a complement to linguistic, historical, and literary study by giving them access to the wealth of German-language philosophy. It represents a new way into the work of a succession of thinkers who have defined modern philosophy and thus remain of crucial relevance today. The philosophers: Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Georg Lukács, Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, Jürgen Habermas.

  Book Title: Tragedy and the Tragic in German Literature, Art, and Thought-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Quinn Thomas P.<br>
  Abstract: The many catastrophes of German history have often been described as tragic. Consequently, German literature, music, philosophy, painting, and even architecture are rich in tragic connotations. Yet exactly what "tragedy" and "the tragic" may mean requires clarification. The poet creates a certain artful shape and trajectory for raw experience by "putting it into words"; but does putting such experience into words (or paintings or music or any other form) betray suffering by turning it into mere art? Or is it art that first turns mere suffering into tragic experience by revealing and clarifying its deepest dimension? What are we talking about, exactly, when we talk about tragic experience and tragic art, especially in an age in which, according to Hannah Arendt, evil has become banal? Does banality muffle or even annul the tragic? Does tragedy take suffering and transform it into beauty, as Schiller thought? Is it in the interest of truth for suffering to be "beautiful"? Is it possible that poetry, music, and art are important because they in fact create the meaning of suffering? Or is suffering only suffering and not accessible to meaning, tragic or otherwise? This book comprises essays that seek to clarify the meaning of tragedy and the tragic in its many German contexts, art forms, and disciplines, from literature and philosophy to music, painting, and history.

  Book Title: A Companion to Friedrich Nietzsche-Life and Works<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Bishop Paul<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche looms over modern literature and thought; according to Gottfried Benn, "everything my generation discussed, thought through innerly; one could say: suffered; or one could even say: took to the point of exhaustion - all of it had already been said . . . by Nietzsche; all the rest was just exegesis." Nietzsche's influence on intellectual life today is arguably as great; witness the various societies, journals, and websites and the steady stream of papers, collections, and monographs. This ‘Companion’ offers new essays from the best Nietzsche scholars, emphasizing the interrelatedness of his life and thought, eschewing a superficial biographical method but taking seriously his claim that great philosophy is “the self-confession of its author and a kind of unintended and unremarked ‘memoir’.” Each essay examines a major work by Nietzsche; together, they offer an advanced introduction for students of German Studies, philosophy, and comparative literature as well as for the lay reader. Re-establishing the links between Nietzsche's philosophical texts and their biographical background, the volume alerts Nietzsche scholars and intellectual historians to the internal development of his thought and the aesthetic construction of his identity as a philosopher.

  Abstract: After Parsonsis a fresh examination of Parsons' theoretical undertaking, its significance for social scientific thought, and its implications for present-day empirical research. The book is divided into four parts: Social Institutions and Social Processes; Societal Community and Modernization; Sociology and Culture; and the Human Condition. The chapters deal with Parsons' notions of societal community, societal evolution, and modernization and modernity.After Parsonsaddresses major themes of enduring relevance, including social differentiation and cultural diversity, social solidarity, universalism and particularism, and trust and affect in social life. The contributors explore these topics in a wide range of social institutions-family and kinship, economy, polity, the law, medicine, art, and religion-and within the context of contemporary developments such as globalization, the power of the United States as an "empireless empire," the emergence of forms of fundamentalism, the upsurge of racial, tribal, and ethnic conflicts, and the increasing occurence of deterministic and positivistic thought.<br>

  Abstract: The relationship between Talcott Parsons’s scholarship and Max Weber’s classic thought has been debated in two recent contexts in American sociology. According to one viewpoint, Parsons’s thought can be traced back to genuinely American intellectual origins, and was not, under Weber’s influence, “made in Germany,” incorporating the often-invoked Heidelberg myth in the 1920s—as some European disciples, including me, are said to assume (Camic, chapter 12, this volume). The other view stemmed from an anti-Parsonian impetus in the early 1970s, when three authors claimed to be preserving Weber’s greatness as they attempted to “de-Parsonize Weber” (Cohen, Hazelrigg, and Pope 1975a).¹<br>

  Book Title: Friendship and Love, Ethics and Politics-Studies in Mediaeval and Early Modern History<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Österberg Eva<br>
  Abstract: Today, friendship, love and sexuality are mostly viewed as private, personal and informal relations. In the mediaeval and early modern period, just like in ancient times, this was different. The classical philosophy of friendship (Aristotle) included both friendship and love in the concept of philia. It was also linked to an argument about the virtues needed to become an excellent member of the city state. Thus, close relations were not only thought to be a matter of pleasant gatherings in privacy, but just as much a matter of ethics and politics. What, then, happened to the classical ideas of close relations when they were transmitted to philosophers, clerical and monastic thinkers, state officials or other people in the medieval and early modern period? To what extent did friendship transcend the distinctions between private and public that then existed? How were close relations shaped in practice? Did dialogues with close friends help to contribute to the process of subject-formation in the Renaissance and Enlightenment? To what degree did institutions of power or individual thinkers find it necessary to caution against friendship or love and sexuality?<br>

But I have also been able to shed light on specific variations in actual relationships by using diaries, correspondence, and autobiographical material.

  Abstract: In untangling this complicated subject it will be helpful to resort to a simplified schema, founded upon the following point of departure: that religion—Serbian Orthodoxy, in this particular context—defines man and his place in the universe. In order to function effectively, it is essential that a person or group have a precisely focused and systematically conceived definition of its environment and of itself. Such a definition of the system and the cosmos to which it is related is a conception of identity.

  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Czigányik Zsolt<br>
  Abstract: The 500th anniversary of Thomas More’s Utopia has directed attention toward the importance of utopianism. Utopian Horizons investigates the possibilities of cooperation between the humanities and the social sciences in the analysis of 20th century and contemporary utopian phenomena. The papers deal with major problems of interpreting utopias, the relationship of utopia and ideology, and the highly problematic issue as to whether utopia necessarily leads to dystopia. Besides reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of contemporary utopian investigations, the papers effectively represent the constructive attitudes of utopian thought, a feature that not only defines late 20th- and 21st-century utopianism, but is one of the primary reasons behind the rising importance of the topic.<br>

  Abstract: The present volume offers interdisciplinary analyses of utopian phenomena. The interdisciplinary nature of studies in utopianism (and also in other fields) is becoming more and more accepted, yet the cooperation of the various disciplines in interpretation is not automatic, and their emphases and approaches may differ substantially. As Balázs Trencsényi argues, “historians of political thought try to renegotiate the relationship between history, literary studies and the social sciences, pointing out that the understanding of a political interaction might necessitate the use of a variety of different interpretative techniques and approaches.”¹ Yet interdisciplinarity is not only a technical issue.

  Book Title: Given World and Time-Temporalities in Context<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Tyrus<br>
  Abstract: The interconnections of time with historical thought and knowledge have come powerfully to the fore since the 1970s. An international group of scholars, from a range of fields including literary theory, history of ideas, cultural anthropology, philosophy, intellectual history and theology, philology, and musicology, address the matter of time and temporalities. The volume’s essays, divided into four main topical groups question critically the key problem of context, connecting it to the problem of time. Contexts, the essays suggest, are not timeless. Time and its contexts are only partly “given” to us: to the primordial donations of time and world correspond our epistemic, moral, and practical modes of receiving what has been granted. The notion of context may have radically different parameters in different historical, cultural, and disciplinary situations. Topics include the deep antiquity, and the timeless time of eternity, as well as formal philosophies of history and the forms of histories implicit in individual and community experience. The medium specific use of time and history are examined with regard to song, image, film, oral narration, and legal discourse.<br>

Separately, collectively and with great complementarity they developed an

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Abstract: We would summarize the group style of “active disengagement” as composed of
               appropriate speechthat steered clear of serious explorations of opinion and violated the pious rules that participants thought were hypocritical. The group relied on institutions of the wider world to take up conversational airtime and put on events from which they could disaffiliate. That is, members usually assumed the point was to drawgroup boundariesagainst institutions. Finally, they assumed they ought to respect each other as human beings pure and simple, and they wanted to give each other ample room to be themselves; that was the way thegroup bondsworked.<br>

Abstract: 1. Is paradigm the right choice, and have I used it correctly?There is always a risk in adopting a concept that comes from a different tradition. It is even riskier when we fiddle with it and stretch it to fit a set of data for which it was not designed as I have done. But I believe that the risk is warranted for two reasons. The first is that there is considerable confusion within and outside of anthropology regarding the nature of the anthropological study of language. The oscillation mentioned in the article among a number of labels, including linguistic anthropology, anthropological linguistics, sociolinguistics, and ethnolinguistics, is only the most superficial and yet telling example of the widespread lack of clarity as to what constitutes linguistic research from an anthropological perspective. Further evidence of confusion can be inferred from the typically partial and often clumsy attempts to represent the linguistic subfield (or the study of language) in sociocultural anthropology textbooks. I felt that it was time to come to terms with the fact that perhaps those of us inside the subfield had not been communicating to those outside as effectively as we thought we were. I then realized that to address this issue I needed a notion that by its very nature would force us to think in terms of broad trends rather than particular notions or hypotheses. The popular notions of paradigm and paradigm shift seemed to me the perfect candidates; they could force us to think in terms of the major features of our research projects. CookGumperz and Gumperz are right when they write that Kuhns approach gives a sense of structural containment to the flow of ideas that to those living with them appear much more fluid and overlapping. (Their proposal to adopt Holtons themata is a bit cryptic given that his model is not considered an improvement on Kuhns by most historians of science.)

Abstract: One of these Dissenting youths of the present day that Toulmin was anxious to reach was William Hazlitt. Born in 1778, the son of a Dissenting minister, he was educated at a Dissenting academy in the 1790s and sat briefly at the feet of Joseph Priestley in London after the Birmingham riots of 1791. Hazlitt later testified to the impact that Dissenting history had on him. In one of his brilliant political essays of 1819 he recalled with powerful nostalgia the political culture and bloody‐minded refusals of the eighteenth‐century Dissenters among whom he was raised. They “lived in thought,” as Hazlitt puts it, “with those who had borne testimony of a good conscience” and looked back to the Protestant martyrs of the Reformation. The canonical texts of this Dissenting tradition recalled by Hazlitt included, alongside the bible and Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, both Neal and Calamy: “they had Neal’s History of the Puritans by heart, and Calamy’s Account of the Two Thousand Ejected Ministers, and gave it to their children to read, with the pictures of the polemical Baxter, the silver‐tongued Bates, the mild‐looking Calamy, and old honest Howe.”
      65A few years later, in the chapter on Coleridge inThe Spirit of the Age,Hazlitt recounted how the radical young poet fell into the world of Dissent in the 1790s and was drawn into its historical narratives of Protestant martyrdom and “so dwelt for a while in the spirit with John Huss and Jerome of Prague and Socinus and old John Zisca, and ran through Neal’s History of the Puritans and Calamy’s Non‐Conformist’s Memorial, having like thoughts and passions with them.”66<br>

Abstract: Despite this, metaphysics has indeed replied (whether it should be allowed to or not) to the question concerning man’s definition of himself. And we know well that the Cartesian
         cogitohas no other importance than to assure theegoits comprehension of itself and thus to impose itself as the first principle of every other science. Nevertheless, it would be more fitting to doubt this vulgate of Cartesianism, because the texts of Descartes so often contradict it. Contradiction occurs first of all because theego’s very performance of its existence unfolds within a space that is, from the outset, dialogical (with theDeus qui potest omnia, with thegenius aliquis malignius).43Next, contradiction occurs because theegoof thecogitorecognizes that its finite thought culminates in a faculty of will that is paradoxically infinite, “ratione cujus imaginem quandam et similitudinem Dei me refere intelligo” (“in virtue of [which] … I understand myself to bear in some way the image and likeness of God”); and above all the common understanding of the comprehensibility of theegois contradicted because theegoidentifies its faculty of thinking of itself with the image and likeness of God within it, to the point that the faculty of self‐knowing is simply one with the faculty of knowing God: “ex hoc uno quod Deus me creavit, valde credibile est me quodammodo ad imaginem et similitudinem ejus factum esse, illamque similitudinem, in qua Dei idea continetur, a me precipi per eandem facultatem, per quam ego ipse a me percipior” (“but the mere fact that God created me is a very strong basis for believing that I am somehow made in his image and likeness and that I perceive that likeness, which includes the idea of God, by the same faculty which enables me to perceive myself”).44Let us consider this extraordinary text: founding the thinking of self upon my thinking of God, to the point of merging them within the space opened by the image of and likeness to God.

Abstract: The long gestation period of the book—Braudel’s life to 1949 and beyond—forces remembrance of the man and his book. On the intellectual plane, as we have seen, Braudel’s
         La Méditerranéeis a history of the Mediterranean and Philip II’s Spanish empire as well as a primary document illustrating the trajectory of twentieth‐century French historical studies and social thought both before and after its publication and revision.97On a biographical level, it was the sum of his personal experiences and studies, as Braudel’s preface to the first edition in 1949 recalls: “I have joyfully dedicated long years of study to it—much more than all my youth.”98Already in his forty‐seventh year at the time of the book’s publication, Braudel had had an eventful life; but it should be remembered that at mid‐century he had not yet made his mark nor won an established academic position in France, as, for example, his colleague Ernest Labrousse (1895–1988) or his American peers Hamilton and Lane had done long before.99Braudel himself knew what his friends thought about his never‐ending book: “among my friends and colleagues it was reported that I would never finish this very ambitious work.”100In 1976 he himself would correct the common false impression of the positive reception in 1947 of his thesis and theAnnalesmovement in general—“without drum and trumpet and with a thousand nice‐sounding words in my ear,” he was rejected for an appointment at the Sorbonne and received condescending criticism at his thesis defense. “One of the judges suavely said to me, ‘You are a geographer: let me be the historian.’”101Braudel saw himself as a perpetual outsider, an exile, not unlike the self‐image of theAnnalesitself, memorialized at the Binghamton inaugural conference, as a historical tradition of resistance.102Yet, in the administrative sphere, in his post‐1950 career as director of theAnnales,the Ecole, and the Maison, Braudel’s keen intelligence, force of personality, power with words, ~<br>

Abstract: Noting in the opening of his book rhetoric’s failure to develop a “general theory of expression,” Spencer goes on to sum up the advice of the rhetoricians in a single principle: brevity. Unconstrained by any commitment to received doctrine, he produces the following explanation for the supremacy of this principle:
            
                  As in Smith, a rhetoric has been generated from a communication theory. And this theory anticipates, if it does not actually arrive at, a concept of information. The principle of an “economy of attention,” which mandates Smith’s smallest possible number of words for any thought, is the same that governs information technologies generally, and the documentary genres in particular. The principle presupposes something that we now call processing, for which ease and speed are indeed ultimate desiderata.On seeking for some clue to the law underlying these current maxims, we may see shadowed forth in many of them, the importance of economizing the reader’s or hearer’s attention. To so present ideas that they may be apprehended with the least possible mental effort, is the desideratum towards which most of the rules above quoted point. When we condemn writing that is wordy, or confused, or intricate—when we praise this style as easy, and that as fatiguing, we consciously or unconsciously assume this desideratum as our standard of judgment.

Abstract: Once again, we can begin by referring to the pioneering work of Francis Clooney. Clooney has argued that comparative theology replaces traditional apologetics as the defining mode of interreligious theological encounter and yet retains an apologetic dimension. As a confessional enterprise, comparative theology still finds it necessary sometimes to critique the theological positions of other faith communities.
         54And yet a serious engagement with other theological traditions reveals the specious nature of many of the contrasts through which traditional apologetics has argued for the uniqueness of Christianity. As Clooney’s most recent work on interreligious theological reasoning demonstrates, many of the theological concepts and arguments that were previously thought to be unique to the Christian tradition can in fact be found in other theological traditions.55By invalidating the facile contrasts of traditional apologetics, comparison challenges the Christian theologian to examine the Christian tradition more carefully in order to discern what truly makes this tradition unique. We can infer that for Clooney the “well‐informed” apologetics that survives comparison exists in a more nuanced and attenuated form than its predecessor. Perhaps reflecting a concern to appeal to as wide a theological audience as possible, Clooney’s conception of the relationship between the apologetic tradition and comparative theology nevertheless emphasizes the continuity between the two. Clooney’s reflections imply that comparative theology subsumes apologetics in such a way that the latter survives with its basic nature intact, albeit with a greatly diminished role.<br>

Abstract: The question then becomes: to what extent does the pattern of ontotheology permit such distinctions? For Marion, not at all, since the God of ontotheology is stigmatized as a philosopher’s God to be overcome in the search for a truly theological thought of God. When Robbins claims that Marion provides a model of philosophical theology to the extent that “[he] accepts the bounds established by the ontotheological condition” (p. 101), there is either a massive misreading of Marion or what is meant by ontotheology remains imprecise. Some clarity might be achieved by sticking to Heidegger, who offers the classic conceptualization of ontotheology. For Heidegger, ontotheology is the answer to the question “How does God enter philosophy?” As such, it would not allow conversation between philosophy and theology because the God it thinks, even theologically, is already the God of philosophy. In Robbins’s work, by contrast, ontotheology stands for a “synthesis” (p. 11), a “dialogue” (p. 14), or a “mixed discourse” (p. 15) of philosophy and theology that best resists the corrosive fragmentation and dangerous purification of thought and culture. I cannot help but feel that in the transition from overcoming ontotheology to accepting it, what is being saved or maintained is not what was being overcome.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since h~<br>

Abstract: Meyers is not so naive as to hold that careful screening and imaginative trope play will automatically yield a liberatory model of individual agency. She insists that the self‐figurations that “survive this vetting must become embedded in the cognitive, emotional, and corporeal structures that shape agency and that function as criteria of self‐appraisal. To agentically integrate dissident self‐figurations, women must command skills that enable them to invest emotionally in these tropes and to reconfigure their embodied values as well as their patterns of thought and volition in accordance with them” (55). How? Partly through changes in child‐rearing practices and the social order more generally, but Meyers’s view presumes that the skills for emotional investment and revision of values and volition are already available to most women. However, it can be argued that many women lack these skills and find it arduous to embed new figurations in their cognitive, emotional, and corporeal selves. It is hard to see how any amount of screening and play will take us from image to agency. A more productive approach would be to focus on developing those skills (including through changes in the social order), but that option is constrained in part by the predominance of the very imagery of which Meyers is critical. She uses commanding language in her argument for experimentation with new subjectivities—women
      mustscreen,mustviscerally imagine,mustembed new self‐images,mustcommand skills. This makes it easy to miss her recognition of the insufficiency of such measures, as does the relative lack of detailed proposals for restructuring the social order. Yet one cannot simply flout the power of cultural images in women’s lives. By exposing the feedback loop between self‐image and agentic skills in a patriarchal order, Meyers establishes that image and agency are not two distinct paths. Her emphasis may be on imagery, but it is clear that image and large‐scale political change mu~<br>

Author(s): Mandry,  Christof<br>
Abstract: Granting the important historical work of part 1 of this book, it is in part 2 that Mandry begins to make some innovative moves. The gambit is to shift the discussion from the relations that can and ought to obtain between theology and philosophy toward a consideration of the ethical self. In order to make that move, Mandry draws on the recent work of Paul Ricoeur, especially
      Oneself as Another(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992). This is important because, while Ricoeur’s thought has had considerable impact in the United States and in France, his work has not been used nearly so much within German theology. To be sure there are some theologians, like Dietmar Mieth, who have engaged in hermeneutical reflection and, further, work of Jürgen Habermas, Hans‐Georg Gadamer, and other German thinkers is certainly well known. But the contribution of Ricoeur to theological reflection is just now gaining interest. Happily, with the work of Mandry and others this development will continue.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur suggests that, for a person, there are a series of dialectics at work in this process of identity narration [
         29]. First, there is explanation and understanding operating in dialectic; a process of interpretation involves a threefold movement of interpretation, understanding, and explanation. In other words, as we saw above, a person interprets a symbol, understands it, and then explains its meaning; Ricoeur argues that this happens regardless of whether we privilege one or the other of two kinds of events—interpretations or facts—because both are present and part of one set of operations. Second, Ricoeur attends to the importance of the dialectic between self and other, which he suggests is multiple in the sense that it is characterized by experience of one’s own body, the self of reciprocity or dialogue with other people, and the dialogue with what can be thought of as the “other within.” The last, he argues, is experienced as conscience. Third, there is the dialectic of identity, which is shaped by narrative in time. Each of these contribute to a dynamic relationship between sameness and selfhood, by which he means that we can be identified in time as the same person, but we also change over time as we develop selfhood.<br>

Abstract: There is nothing particularly new or different about the politics Haraway articulates if one compares it to the strategies of the New Left in the sixties, to different versions of French poststructuralist theory, or to some versions of postcolonial theory in their postmodern, discursive guise. As Michael Ryan suggests, the New Left’s strength was precisely its diversity and diffuse nature. He argues that the binarism posited between a unified, authoritative, effective politics and ineffective anarchy is simplistic: “It is possible to combine a sense of commonality amid diversity, firmness of resistance, and aggressivity of attack with a plurality of different struggles” (
         1982, 216). Similarly, Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe’s (1985, 167–71) ideas of resistance are based on radical pluralism, the blurring of frontiers, and the unsutured character of the social. For Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari (1983, 76), the schizophrenic (like the cyborg) ruptures wholeness and puts disjunctions to affirmative use: “He is and remains in disjunction.” Deleuze and Guattari’s later concepts, such as rhizomatic thought and nomadism, are similar attempts to name disruptive ontologies. Finally, Haraway’s politics has much in common with Homi Bhabha’s (1994, 11, 207–9) valorization of interstitial and border spaces as sites for solidarity, and with his celebration of hybridity as a metaphor for postcolonial writing, colonial discourse, and colonized identities.9<br>

Abstract: See Hans‐Georg Gadamer,
            Truth and Method, trans. Joel Weinsheimer and Donald G. Marshall, 2nd ed. and 2nd rev. ed. (New York: Crossroad, 1989; Continuum, 1998); Emmanuel Levinas,Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority, trans. Alphonso Lingis (Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1969), 33–52. Levinas argues that dialogue is founded upon the asymmetrical relationship between the self and the infinite Other (“Dialogue … is a thinking of theunequal, a thought thinkingbeyondthe given” [Emmanuel Levinas,God Who Comes to Mind, trans. Bettina Bergo (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998), 151]) and in that sense not a method of uncovering truth but a call to (self‐) transcendence, i.e., to ethics (ibid., 143–51). Levinas’s purely asymmetrical ethical understanding of the self‐other relation, in which the practice of dialogue is reduced to the infinite Other’s “breaking in” and rupturing of the totalizing horizon of my world, is meant as a critique of Hegel’s more symmetrical, interdependent, and holistic understanding of the self‐other relation in terms of mutual recognition. But this criticism is predicated on what in my view is an unconvincing identification of holism, which is an internally differentiated harmony, with totality, which is devoid of internal differentiation whatsoever. I follow Paul Ricoeur’s more Hegelian, dialectical understanding of the self‐other relation (that is at the same time informed by the Levinasian critique), in which the horizon of my world is driven by its own logic to a universalizability test via the sieve of the other’s scrutiny and is transformed in the process.

Abstract: Another striking feature about Frei’s discussion is his historical classification of various types of Jewish thought. As he describes it, Jewish “theology” develops largely through engagement with its surrounding cultures, while Midrash occurs when the community cultivates a more distinctive identity. If Midrash operates analogously to type 4 theology, then perhaps “Jewish theology” would be closer to type 3. That much of Christian discourse falls under the category of “theology,” indicates that Frei sees Christianity as devoting much of its “Reflective energy” to the apologetic task, rather than to cultivating its own self‐understanding and practice by giving priority to its figural reading. The Kabbala, likewise, represents the rise of allegory as a practice that distorted, and perhaps “eclipsed,” the literal sense of Midrash. The specter of allegory in Frei’s work, as a loss of the literal sense within Christianity, has been well described by Dawson. These comments, then, are perhaps best taken as markers for how Frei would like to locate the
         Christianliteral sense: neither allegorical nor apologetic, nor entirely self‐contained, it is the community’s self‐understanding through typological engagement with the text, rooted in a practice that can engender a plurality of readings within the literal sense.<br>

Abstract: Meanwhile, as one of us listened to these assaults on Conrad and Cather, the other chose to visit the session on “Feminist Perspectives on the Frankfurt School,” which drew a standing‐room‐only crowd and turned out to offer a little of everything—except, of course, literature. No sooner had we seated ourselves and unpacked the trusty tape recorder than we heard the familiar whine of the dentist’s drill—no, sorry, our mistake: it was only the sound of the first speaker, who had come to “clarify the function of femininity in Frankfurt School thought, with an emphasis on re‐reading the work of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer in the context of gender.” Ah, yes, we knew it well: the “critique of patriarchy and logocentricsm,” old friends such as the feminist icons Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva, not to mention Judith Butler, the young philosopher of queer theory who our rough tabulation identified as the second most frequently referred to person at the convention. The most frequently cited figure was undoubtedly Walter Benjamin, the hapless Marxist critic and protege of Adorno who committed suicide while fleeing from the Nazis in 1940.<br>

Abstract: Equality.—The principle that human relations should be determined by equality, implying equal treatment in equal cases, is as old as human rights and democratic thought, which is rooted in Greek antiquity, notably in Aristotle’s philosophy. According to hisNicomachean Ethicssuch equality, in the sense of equal treatment in equal cases, is the cornerstone of justice. Of course, it is far from clear what the expression “equal cases” means: What is the criterion of equality? Which cases are to be compared with which? Which and how many cases in terms of time and place? At all events, equality is assigned a “position of preeminence” in human rights thought.<br>

Abstract: The act of the destroyers was based on a somewhat passé theory of memory. It presumed that by erasing the artifact, recall is prevented because there is no direct image—except, of course, for the generation where the image has left a trace. But the recall, as new research demonstrates, need not be produced by a literal trace; recall itself, prompted by a context—a book, a discussion, a thought—can produce an image.
         106What is even more essential is the emotional component. In the absence of specific imagery, it is feelings that become essential in reliving the past. “So, while memory does not consist in a memory image, the existence of a complex interplay of image and affect in the processes of recall is important to the cluster of ideas brought together under memory.”107<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Abstract: All I have claimed here, however, is that moral practice involves, even if it is not exhausted by, a primordial creative capability. However such a capability may be realized substantively, my point has been to argue, against a long history in Western moral thought, that such a capability is not ancillary or hostile to moral practice but rather presupposed within it. Poetics is the condition for ethical life’s transformative possibility. What it means to be an
         imitatio Creatorisis to be capable of imitating an invisible and dynamic creativity deeply impressed in the human will. This original human creative capability is absolutely necessary for forming worlds of moral meaning that may overcome historical distortions and violence and respond to human difference. Without it we are likely to retreat into unchanging moral certainties or a simplistic moral pluralism. The more profoundly human possibility is to engage in the endless but ultimately more rewarding task of creating real historical tensions into ever more meaningfully inclusive moral worlds.<br>

Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: Over time, statements such as the LBR have been discussed and alternatives weighed, but librarianship’s discursive practice has, in recent years, largely constituted an orthodoxy that may not be sensitive or responsive to disputation. One voice of this orthodoxy is Robert Hauptman, who writes, “We are free to articulate anything we imagine” [
         30, p. 18], and “If there are more fundamental rights than freedom of thought, then anyone, naturally, can cite those rights when attempting to control what students may read in a class, what libraries may collect, and what Americans may access on the Internet” [30, p. 138]. His first idea is incorrect; there are, in fact, laws that limit what a person can say. Paradoxically, Hauptman also argues against research misconduct on the grounds of responsibility and public interest, but if we are indeed free to say anything we can imagine, we can lie and falsify with impunity. The positive ethos of research integrity is indisputable; violation of the ethos can cause harm. That positive ethos does, however, come into conflict with Hauptman’s first maxim. His second claim is puzzling; if there are more fundamental rights, then those rights probably should supersede a right to access to information. For example, a right to privacy trumps another’s “right” to certain of an individual’s personal information. A right to freedom from harm trumps a person’s “right” to libel another intentionally and with malice. Hauptman also proposes that, in combating censorship, the minority cannot dictate to the majority. However, Paul Ricoeur, arguing for the kind of normative ethics suggested here, says, “Whoever might be a victim must not be sacrificed to the benefit of some common good. This is the anti‐utilitarian point of the Rawlsian theory of justice” [31, p. 65]. It is obvious that the whims of the minority should not hold sway simply because they wish it to be so, but, likewise, the majority should not be able to cause harm to others o~<br>

Abstract: Moreover, Derrida does not seem to have been familiar with the basic tenets of Patočka’s later phenomenology, in particular his reinterpretation of the Husserlian conception of the lifeworld. According to Patočka, the natural world is constituted by three movements that are fundamental for understanding his reference to the exceptional (the orgiastic, demonic, or sacred), the inauthenticity of everydayness, and, above all, the motif of the care of the soul. Nonetheless, Derrida’s reading of the essay in question is a very fine account of Patočka’s thought.<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: After the JST describes the evolution of a godly order and rebellious antiorder among Adam and Eve’s immediate progeny, the generations of the patriarchs are listed consistent with the KJV. While the KJV was able to tell Enoch’s story in thirteen words—“And Enoch walked with God, and he was not; for God took him”—the
         JSTrequired 4,600.80Smith’s Enoch is the most representative of Mormonism’s understanding of the divine‐human relationship and its rejection of contemporary Christian anthropology. For the sake of brevity, two themes must suffice to make this point. First, in the JST, Enoch “built a city that was called the city of Holiness, even Zion.”81The people were also called Zion “because they were of one heart and of one mind and dwelt in righteousness and there were no poor among them.” In short, the story of Enoch tells of a community that experienced the end of evil. This is made clear in their overcoming the separation from God occasioned by the fall: “Enoch and all his people walked with God, and he dwelt in the midst of Zion.” They triumphed over their enemies because Enoch “spake in the word of the Lord,” and, when he did, humans and nature “were turned out of their course.” Ultimately, not only Enoch, as implied in the KJV, but also his city were taken up to heaven without experiencing death.82Second, and most significant for the argument of this article, Smith’s narrative depicts an extended theophany in which Enoch is portrayed as obtaining guarantees of redemption from God in virtue of Enoch’s God‐given right to access heavenly power and exercise it in temporal affairs. This is the final example of the way in which Smith’s mythos “recalibrates” categories of thought and privilege inherent in the status quo of Christian theologizing on the divine human relationship.83<br>

Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and~<br>

Author(s): Scimeca Ross<br>
Abstract: The third theory of truth is the pragmatic theory. This is America’s philosophical contribution to the question of truth. There are two variations to the pragmatic theory of truth. The first variation comes from Charles S. Peirce [
         69]. According to Peirce, truth is arrived at by abduction, that is, inference to the best possible explanation. Abduction is one of the three basic forms of inference, along with deduction and induction, by which hypotheses concerning reality are generated, that is, move from a particular case to a possible explanation of the case [69, vol. 7, p. 319]. Truth as consensus is the consequence of what Peirce called the “social theory of reality” [69, vol. 6, p. 610]. According to Peirce, this means that reality is the construct of all propositions arrived at by abduction. It is important to note, however, that Peirce did not think that propositions are true because they are arrived at by abduction; rather he thought that they are true because they will be universally accepted. Peirce realized that a proposition originally accepted to be true could very well upon further investigation prove to be false. The social theory of reality is in constant revision. Indeed, the growth of knowledge demands this continual revision of universally accepted propositions.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: By definition, of course, the discipline of stylistics is comparably engaged with a single medium at a time. Narratography, however, does more than specify a mode within this field of attention, does more than single out narrative (and its generic signposts) from other textual (and hence stylistic) manifestations. The differences run deeper. Stylistics is tabular, narratography linear. Stylistics sorts and quantifies, whereas narratography would read
            along.Its detected loops and setbacks, its braidings and slipknots, have their own “narratival” tension and sometimes an equally telling release. This is why narratography, as distinguished from a general stylistics, can be thought to calibrate the very plot of style itself—and sometimes its counterplot.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 592372<br>
Date: 01 2009<br>
Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Augustine helps to shed light on these insights. Note that connections between the ethics of war and memory are intimate indeed, joined at the outset in his discussion of Christianity and political morality in the
         City of God. That work is, among other things, an argument about how to remember the fall of Rome and whether Rome’s decline should be understood as a consequence of embracing Christianity’s putatively pacific virtues. According to Augustine, we must understand that Christianity is not a pacifist creed; it allows for the use of force to defend certain goods. Equally important in Augustine’s mind is the need to remember the true reasons for Rome’s fall: its ongoing pagan sacrifices subsequent to its official conversion to Christian doctrine. This aspect of Augustine’s thought has been universally ignored by theologians and philosophers who have worked in the just‐war tradition. But we should not lose sight of what could be his most striking contribution to the ethics of war and peace. Often overlooked by readers of Augustine is the fact that he is defending the idea of a just war in response to criticisms about the political and cultural effects of accepting Christianity’s moral norms. Thus, he queries at the outset of his magnum opus: “Why do our antagonists bring false accusations against the established Christian order, alleging that catastrophe has come upon the city just because it has left off the worship of its gods?”81With that question in the background, Augustine seeks to absolve Christianity for Rome’s demise. On his account, Rome’s decline should not be remembered as a result of its conversion from Roman religion to Christian beliefs and practices. That argument is part of a larger agenda regarding the civic benefits of the Christian religion along with the core features of its political ethic.<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Rather than simply reading Ricoeur’s work in chronological sequence to make this case, Hall aims for what he calls a “critical constructive interpretation” that will yield something like a “situated reading” of Ricoeur’s thought (4), one that will better demonstrate this thesis than Ricoeur’s own words do. Basically, the structure of the argument Hall proposes begins from what Ricoeur has to say about the idea of agency in relation to the understanding of selfhood. Hall then moves on to consider the narrative configuration of a meaningful existence that follows from this understanding. He then takes up questions that can arise regarding our practical experience and moral concerns from this perspective. It is the testimony of conscience that comes in at this latter level that brings in the theological perspective. It does so through a discussion of what Ricoeur has to say about the Golden Rule in relation to the love commandment and in relation to what Ricoeur calls a logic of superabundance, one that goes beyond any logic of equivalence. It is this idea of a possible logic of superabundance that leads in turn to a discussion of what Hall calls the economy of the gift and the poetic imperative that Hall sees in Ricoeur’s concept of a theonomy that stands over against Kant’s call for an autonomy that all too easily isolates people from one another. It is love that drives this poetic imperative, and what love calls for is something more than, not less than, justice.<br>

Abstract: We live in a time when it seems that many disciplines within the university are unsure of their task and purpose. Some scholars bemoan the listlessness of the humanities and religious studies. There are the relentless attacks, sometimes warranted and sometimes not, on things modern and Western. Of course, the question of what defines the university and its several disciplines is itself constitutive of the university and its disciplines. Yet the purpose of answering that question, and so clarifying the nature and connection of forms of knowledge, is not always transparent in our time, especially in the humanities and religious studies. Unconcerned with squabbles among humanists and scholars of religion, the natural sciences, like neuroscience and genetics, and the social sciences, especially economics, daily make inroads into domains of thought previously defined as the
         Geisteswissenschaften. In this context I have proposed a reconstruction of my own discipline in order to demonstrate its place within and contribution to the wider work and purposes of the university. This proposal might have implications for other fields of study. That is a question for thinkers in the various disciplines to debate. Yet beyond the matter of how we constitute and conceive of disciplines of inquiry, I have been driving at something else in this lecture.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 598771<br>
Date: 8 2009<br>
Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: Benjamin's friend Siegfried Kracauer had a better chance to bring Frankfurt‐style critical theory to America, since
         From Caligari to Hitler(1947) andTheory of Film(1960) were published here. The former could be called a study of a cinematic public sphere, though a decidedly dysfunctional one, while the latter (introduced in its latest edition by Hansen) ranks as the most ambitious treatise on the cinema written by anyone from this school of thought. YetTheory of Filmhas until recently been largely ignored. I contributed to this neglect inThe Major Film Theories, being relatively ignorant at the time of Kracauer's journalism of the 1920s. And, indeed, Kracauer'sTheory of Filmdid seem like an orphan, in dialogue with no active discourse community—Frankfurt school or otherwise—especially in comparison to Bazin, whose works, collected around the same time, were written within an unbroken and vibrant French tradition of criticism. Kracauer came off badly in the inevitable comparison with Bazin at a time when realist theory as a whole, and Bazin's star in particular, had dimmed considerably. Kracauer was thus doubly cursed, at least until the 1990s when he benefited from Benjamin's fame and from the fine bibliographic recovery effort of Tom Levin, whose translation ofThe Mass Ornamentappeared in 1995.55These essays, more than Kracauer's book‐length works, encouraged the kind of detailed and imaginative historical research that Anglo‐American film scholars had been pursuing, especially in the area of early cinema and the culture it grew out of. Think of Gunning's wide‐ranging array of essays; one could say that he writes, consciously or not, in the Frankfurt school manner. Critical theory put film in its place, so to speak, and interrogated it from that place. Perhaps its impact could only be felt when American film studies began to realize that media was integral to a discipline no longer bounded by dates or by specific technologies.<br>

Is it claimed or granted?—the existence of vulnerability and passivity within autonomy and initiative, and the relationship between moral ideals and historical manifestation, questions that exist more on the margins ofOneself as Another. Those interested in Ricoeur’s religious thought will find little of direct interest here. Those who see a deep connection between his moral philosophy and his philosophy of religion will find some confirmation, but there are other places where the connections are more explicitly manifest.Reflections on the Justis best approached as a companion volume to earlier philosophical works, certainlyThe Justbut perhaps more importantlyOneself as Another. As such, it holds an important place in Ricoeur’s oeuvre.<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: Revelation of the transcendent is always apocalyptic, but apocalypse is not limited to religious discourse: “For in poetry, language is broken open to let the previously inconceivable appear” (24). The negative capability of poetry is a creative deconstruction akin to negative theology, and this is especially true of modernist poetry that reflects on the limits of its own representation. The result is deconstructive—a breaking down of the idols of thought and speech—but also openness to what we cannot conceive or represent. The deconstructive power of literature reveals and reveils grace or gift, but Franke insists that this openness to transcendent mystery has no positive or dogmatic content. However, to deny this openness as irrational repeats the dogmatism of absolutist belief, and here Franke parts company with Habermas and insists that such openness informs reason. None of us has a privileged vantage point to confirm or deny the transcendent, and reason itself requires an openness that questions the present in pursuit of new knowledge.<br>

Article Title: Resacralizing the World: The Fate of Secularization in Enlightenment Historiography<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: This brief glimpse into Enlightenment-era controversies over mysticism and materialism both corroborates and problematizes the revised narratives of secularization found in the studies reviewed in this essay. For defenders of self-ownership, the human person—like the nation or society—was thought to derive its autonomy from a remote and transcendent God demanding that created beings exercise their faculties on their own, for their own purposes. However, historians have often neglected the violent reactions to this development. Radical spiritualists and radical philosophers railed against what they regarded as illegitimate claims for self-ownership by calling for a revival of immanent dispossession. This challenge implied a dramatic reversal of transcendence in a resacralized world: the self must evacuate its position in favor of a totalizing force, thereby neutralizing its personal autonomy and allowing the divine (or what remained of it in nature) to inhabit the place that the individual human person claimed to occupy.<br>

Abstract: Consider recent thinking on ritual, music, and persuasion: “The formality, sequence, pattern, and repetition of such musical structures themselves elicit emotional response through their instantiation of ritual. Music thereby creates an emotive ‘proto‐symbolic’ system capable of abstracting both the signals and structure of ritual” (Alcorta and Sosis, “Ritual, Emotion, and Sacred Symbols,” 336–37). “Human use of ritual to conditionally associate emotion and abstractions creates the sacred; it also lies at the heart of symbolic thought” (348–49).<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: In engaging the aporias Agamben articulates, a theologian laboring to consider the political and the theological together should pay heed to Horace’s playwriting advice: do not bring a god into the narrative unless the plot’s problem merits the god’s entrance. The theologian must avoid the temptation to absorb the sphere of the political into the theological and to first consider how forces and agents immanent to the political can attend to the problems facing it. This should not avoid the important insights of Schmitt and others that find that modern political philosophy often has drawn its breath from secularized theological and ecclesiological concepts. Nevertheless, it would do considerable violence to political thought to demand that it depend in its entirety upon prophetic criticism and the form‐without‐form of divine judgment. Instead, we must look for the way that prophetic judgment and its concept of promise has immanent effect and the way that promise itself mediates between the divine gift and the immanent reciprocal gift. This way will articulate a relationship between the theological and the political that continues in the correlational tradition. Once again, it is promise and its being that will permit these connections; we will rely on the interaction and interruption of the promise.<br>

Abstract: The world as we know it and operate upon it is one in which we continually conjoin discourse and practice, text and action: where we simultaneously learn
            andact by embodying intentions and projecting our metaphorically constructed models onto matter which we shape and use to our ends asinstrumentsof thought and action. The world as we know it and study it is filled with material‐textual, or material‐discursive, hybrids—instruments; machines; illustrations; diagrams; maps; charts; physical models; computer simulations—that are simultaneously part of the material world andinstrumentsfor our knowing and manipulating it. They are all, in their own way, what I like to callmaterial metaphors: embodied metaphors‐in‐action!9<br>

Abstract: But Ulysses, if one may say so, did not hear their silence; he thought they were singing and that he alone did not hear them. For a fleeting moment, he saw their throats rising and falling, their breasts lifting, their eyes filled with tears, their lips half-parted, but he believed that these were accompaniments to the airs that sounded unheard around him. Soon, however, all this faded from his sight, fixed on the distance; the shape of the Sirens vanished before him, and at the very moment when they were nearest to him, he no longer knew anything of them.<br>

Abstract: Due to the encyclopedic character of the work and the extensive range it covers, however, certain significant thinkers are often treated too quickly, whereas other, more marginal thinkers are treated too closely. This is particularly the case in his treatment of hermeneutics in the “pre-modern” period. For example, in chapter 6, entitled “From the Third Century to the Thirteenth Centuries,” he covers no fewer than twenty-four thinkers. At times, one feels flooded and inundated with a litany of references and historical facts, and it is easy to get confused as to the overall trajectory and purpose of the chapter and how it contributes to the formation and development of hermeneutics. The work would have been better served if it was more balanced and had devoted the same kind of sustained attention and precision to important “pre-modern” thinkers that it devoted to many key figures in modern and contemporary hermeneutics. In the same vein, in the rush to cover the history of hermeneutics, chapters are often oddly divided. For instance, the reader may be surprised to find the thought of Karl Barth lumped in together with structuralism and poststructuralism in a chapter loosely titled, “Some Mid-Twentieth Century Approaches.” It remains unclear as to why such disparate figures and strands of thought are gathered together into a single chapter, and it thus lacks the tightness and coherence of argument that it otherwise could have. If certain sections may glide over thinkers too quickly and other sections pay attention too closely, there are, despite the encyclopedic range of this book, certain gaps altogether in the history of hermeneutics that Thistleton offers. Thistleton himself concedes in his conclusion, for example, that there is insufficient attention paid particularly to Catholic biblical scholarship, which clearly indicates a way of introducing hermeneutics from a distinctly Protestant perspective. Any work that seeks to introduce a subject matter necessarily ma~<br>

Abstract: Although this account is promising, I see three problems or issues needing clarification in it. First, while insisting that their function is not cognitive, Larmore describes such avowals as “an exercise of practical reflection” (128). This suggests that it is by a kind of thought that someone deliberately commits herself or takes “responsibility for what she is doing” (63). It would be clearer to say that this is a process of will that sets new final ends or shores up motivation to follow intentions already formed. Luther may have performed an act of practical reflection in “expressing his resolution to pursue the path on which he had set out” (63), but the resolution in which he took his stand and set his personal policies was not itself constituted by the reflective expression of them. Larmore’s account misses what I have called the “projective motivation” function of willing that Ricoeur at least implicitly recognizes. He does such a good job of arguing that the constitutive self-relation is not a “cognitive” or knowledge-aimed relationship (131) that he does not draw key distinctions between different practical or “performative” operations of mind (134). However, perhaps the problem is simply that Larmore’s terminology reflects his aversion to any “acts of will” distinct from beliefs and desires, as we saw above. For, in arguing that the object of practical reflecting is “in no way cognitive,” he briefly distinguishes it from
      practical reasoningin which we “conclude that certain actions are obligatory, permissible, or prudent” (70). While practical reasoning is cognitive and aims at objective correctness in judgment, practical reflection instead aims at “an explicit intention to do this or that” (71)—which sounds like Aristotle’s concept ofprohairesis(usually translated as rational “choice”). Why not then recognize that such an intention-forming process normally mediates between belief-desire sets and the intentions that express them?<br>

Abstract: Some of the earliest forms of the generic notion of evil demarcate
            abominations—acts that, like incest, cannibalism, patricide—elicit horror and disgust. Abominations are violations, disorders of nature that issue in natural sanctions: plagues or expulsions. The world in whichevilis construed as a form ofsinful disobedienceis a world defined by a divinity who gives commands, exacts obedience, punishes, or rewards (Genesis and Exodus). A world focused on virtue andviceis a naturalistic, social world (Theophrastus, Butler, Mandeville). Virtues are those traits that—like courage and justice—preserve and enhance a community. The vices—greed, disloyalty, envy, self-indulgence, disrespect—threaten the social order. The origins and sanctions for vices are social: an unfortunate upbringing in a malformed polity can issue in the kind of corruption whose sanction is the loss of trust and cooperation. Withmalevolence(Pope Innocent III, Calvin), we enter a new world, a world of individual will and responsibility. While malevolence is normally marked by a defective will,sinfuses disobedience with a defiant will (Aquinas, Jonathan Edwards). But while the earliest forms of disobedience can be relatively innocent, sin presupposes that Everyman, in the full knowledge of the difference between good and evil, right and wrong, willfully violates the divine order by presumptuous pride (Milton’s Satan, Goethe’s Faust). When the disposition or proclivity to sin—construed as pride or egoism—becomes an inherently dominant and psychologically structuring motive, only divine grace can set aside divine punishment. Evil becomes less fraught when morality returns to the secular, social order during the Renaissance and Enlightenment. Setting aside the theology and metaphysics of sin, the new psychology turned to characterizing character traits that—like wanton cruelty—generate “man’s inhumanity to man” (Montaigne, Voltaire).Partiality, egoism—the desire for glory or selfinterest—remai~<br>

Abstract: Eve claims only to have thought she “could not but taste,” on which the anticipated effects occur, and we are tempted retroactively to fill in the blank with a commission of sin. First-time readers of the poem almost inevitably remember the sin that did not happen. Internalist critics sometimes assume it, as Tillyard does when he simply relegates the fact to an introductory clause: “Having eaten, she seems to fly up to heaven.”
         
               But most critics do not accuse Eve so cavalierly. Diane McColley provides a map of the interpretive choices open to us as readers of Eve’s ellipsis: “Does Eve, in imagination, taste the fruit? Four possibilities present themselves. Either she does not taste, and remains free of even imagined disobedience; or she does not taste, but is inclined toward actual disobedience by the dreamed impulse; or she does taste, and is tainted by disobeying even in ‘forg[d] / Illusions’; or she does taste, by Satan’s manipulation of the ‘organs of her Fancie,’ but her waking will and reason are still free to reject the imagined evil.”27

Abstract: In response, Peperzak offers what would most accurately be described as a phenomenology of the practice of philosophy. Peperzak applies Emmanuel Levinas’s phenomenology of the Other to the critique of this philosophical autarky. Philosophy cannot be conceived simply as a system of propositions. Any Said implies someone saying it to someone, and Saying limits the totality of thematic thought through the encounter with the infinitude of the Other to whom I address my saying (8–19). Peperzak invites philosophers to reconsider their discipline by attending to the lived intersubjective context of philosophical conversation, rather than to systematically thematized rational propositions alone.<br>

Abstract: The Ionian cosmogonies of the sixth century b.c.e. explained how an ordered world evolved out of an undifferentiated initial state of “things.” In the fifth century, science became more particularly an inquiry into the ultimate constitution of material substance: the uniform and permanent “nature of things.” The notion of substance derives from tactile sensation. The belief in substantial things outside us reverts to the original detachment of self from the object. With Heraclitus of Ephesus, philosophy focused on knowing the thing, not on that which is known. Thought controls the phenomena as it constitutes the thinker. The problem of understanding nature was taken to a new level. The Milesian school of philosophers had moved it to the realm of the intellect in that they claimed the universe to be an intelligible whole. The manifold was to be understood as deriving from a sustaining principle or first cause, but was to be perceived in the phenomena.<br>

Abstract: In spite of their differences, both Strauss' and Voegelin's analyses of Plato partake in the common task of recovering the Platonic-Aristotelian science against positivism. Both Strauss and Voegelin were opposed to abstract, ideological, and positivist thought, and both sought to renew political science by returning to a philosophical anthropology rooted in Plato and Aristotle. With respect to politics, both Strauss and Voegelin were worried about liberalism: As Ted V. McAllister wrote in
         Revolt Against Modernity, “they were worried that liberal principles would ultimately undermine liberal goals. Consequently they advocated a postliberal order” (1996, xi).<br>

Abstract: The very centrality of its questions to literary studies may be the greatest handicap for
   Translating Investments.Words That Matter, especially in its recovery of grammatical theory, had more surprises page-for-page. Here the big ideas are perforce more familiar, the innovations more incremental. The reward, however, is a fine sense of metaphor as a cultural project across an especially broad range of terrain in early modern England. Anderson insists, and teaches us to insist, on the local, historical conditions of metaphor’s torpor and vitality, how writers thought about and went about killing and quickening the trope she calls “the scaffolding of human culture” (216).<br>

Abstract: Maybeck openly admitted this deviation from the dogma in his typewritten manuscript "The Palace of Fine Arts," Environmental Design Archives, UC Berkeley, Bernard Maybeck Collection; see also Woodbridge,
               Bernard Maybeck, 102–6, for excerpts from this manuscript. In this manuscript Maybeck states that he reduced the height of his columns to eight diameters from eleven diameters (cited from ibid., 106). Interestingly, such sources as Palladio and Vignola suggested Corinthian columns to be ten diameters high. In other words, Maybeck thought he had deviated from the canon even further than for what he was criticized. He might have thought so because some of his sources—such as plates from Hector d'Espouy'sFragments d'architecture antique d'apr̀s les relev́s & restaurations des anciens pensionnaires de l'Acad́mie de France à Rome(Paris: C. Schmid, 1890), depicting the Temples of Mars Ultor and of Castor and Pollux—show slender proportions of the columns.<br>

Abstract: Review of Robert D. Romanyshyn's The Wounded Researcher: Research with Soul in Mind, New Orleans, Louisiana: Spring Journal Books, 2007. Robert Romanyshyn has written a treatise on the question of understanding that brings together the fields of phenomenology and depth psychology. Following the thought of C. G. Jung, Romanyshyn has presented an archetypal view of the dilemma of psychological research that he sees as a story of loss, mourning, descent, re-search and homecoming expressed in the mythical image of Orpheus. Going deeper into the actual process of psychological research, Romanyshyn looks to the ancient art of alchemy as providing a model of the attitude and action of imagination that most closely suits psychological life.<br>

Abstract: Walter Pater's theoretical "come-back" over the past forty years or so has been dominated by the competing claims of the new historicism and deconstruction, both of which discover prescient forerunners of their own, seemingly mutually exclusive, theoretical concerns in Pater's aesthetic criticism and in his historical novel Marius the Epicurean (1885). Yet despite their obvious differences, both critical approaches share one thing in common: the same post-humanist denigration of the trope of metaphor in favor of the seemingly more ethically responsive (because inclusive) trope of metonymy. In this essay I observe how the new historicism's and deconstruction's privilegings of metonymy as the prime trope of difference poses an immediate problem for ethical thought that, largely under the influence of Alain Badiou, has become increasingly cognizant of the need for a workable conception of sameness (or universality), traditionally supplied by metaphor. Accordingly, this close reading of the metaphorical dialectic of one of Pater's surprisingly underread Imaginary Portraits, "Sebastian van Storck" (1887), explores the basic charge against metaphor-namely, that it is an essentially "theological" trope insofar as it invariably pre-posits the "identity" that it modestly claims to have merely discovered. Employing the central figure of Sebastian's idealism- equation-I venture that, once rethought as a relation not of identity but of equivalence, metaphor is capable of shouldering the rhetorical burden of similarity without relinquishing its ethical claim as a primary producer of new differences in the world and is, hence, deserving of a central place in a post-deconstructive ethics.<br>

Abstract: Buell's view in The Environmental Imagination can serve to epitomize the prevailing
consensus: "Thoreau is often thought of as Emerson's earthy opposite. But it would be
truer to imagine him as moving gradually, partially, and self-conflictedly beyond the pro-
gram Emerson outlined in Nature, which sacralized nature as humankind's mystic coun-
terpart .... Thoreau became increasingly interested in defining nature's structure, both
spiritual and material, for its own sake, as against how nature might subserve humanity,
which was Emerson's primary consideration" (117)<br>

Abstract: Aspects of the Pratyabhijñā philosophical theology for monistic Śaivism of the ninth- and tenth-century Kashmiri thinkers Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta are interpreted in relation to their relevance and pre-sumptiveness to contemporary Western thought. It is claimed that the Pratyabhijñā system elucidates important features of our past and present deliberations about the role of interpretation in experience and provides us with a sound way of arguing for the reality of God.<br>

Article Title: Rethinking the Political: Some Heideggerian Contributions<br>
Publisher: University of Notre Dame<br>
Issue: i261382<br>
Date: 10 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Pangle Fred<br>
Abstract: Recent literature on Heidegger concentrates heavily on his (temporary) involvement in or collusion with Nazi ideology and policies. Without belittling the gravity of the issue, this article shifts the focus somewhat by invoking a distinction which recently has emerged (or reemerged) in political thought: namely, the distinction between "politics" and "the political" or between politics viewed as partisan ideology or policy making, on the one hand, and politics seen as regime or paradigmatic framework, on the other. The main thesis of the article is that Heidegger's promising contributions to political theory are located on the level of ontology or paradigmatic framework rather than that of ideological partisanship. While not neglecting the dismal intrusions of the latter plane, the article probes Heideggerian cues for a "rethinking of the political" by placing the accent on four topical areas: first, the status of the subject or individual as political agent; second, the character of the political community, that is, of the polity or (in modern terms) the "state"; thirdly, the issue of cultural and political development or modernization; and finally, the problem of an emerging cosmopolis or world order beyond the confines of Western culture. In discussing these topics, an effort is made to disentangle Heidegger from possible misinterpretations and to indicate how, in each area, his thought pointed in the direction of an "overcoming" of Western political metaphysics.<br>

Publisher: University of Notre Dame<br>
Issue: i261417<br>
Date: 7 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Patoeka Edward F.<br>
Abstract: This article examines the ties between the work of Václav Havel and his dissident mentor Jan Patočka. Havel's political theory consists largely of an evocative, literary reformulation of a number of themes developed by Patočka, the student of Husserl and Heidegger generally recognized as the most significant Czech philosopher of the century. Insofar as Patočka's work continues to be ignored in the West, the intuitively appealing essays of Havel will themselves fail to be fully understood. This study offers an analysis of Havel's debt to Patočka, as well as an explication of the latter's political thought. With Patočka's phenomenological interpretation of ancient and contemporary thought, of Socrates and Heidegger, a bridge is built between the classical and the postmodern that seeks to ground ethics and politics without recourse to the foundationalism of metaphysical accounts of reality.<br>

Issue: i262148<br>

Author(s): Ito Botond<br>
Abstract: This essay investigates the roots of a growing impass in contemporary architecture vis a vis the economic, technological, social and political developments of our advanced or late-capitalist society. It focuses upon architecture's apparently diminishing capacity to address our present human condition, yet argues that the problems responsible for the "crisis" of architectural thought and design in general have evolved as the result of historic processes, and therefore the impass can only partially be explained with the short-comings of modern architecture or the 'short sighted' attitude of the architects themselves. Nevertheless, it also argues that architecture, in spite of its now rather limited transformative capacity, should persistently attempt to reveal, rather than mask or otherwise escape, its fundamental relatedness to material processes; that is, to the modes of production and consumption on which social and political power relations are predicated. To be able to do so, and thus to foster a more liberating "form" of human environment, the profession needs first of all a strong political self consciousness, while aiming at a practice of critical inquiry.<br>

Abstract: The study of metaphor provides valuable insights into the workings of thought and understanding. This article addresses the important question of what the study of metaphor has to say about the design process and design teaching. We include the findings of a series of studies involving architectural design students who were asked to report on their own design experience and that of colleagues in the context of specific projects. Our conclusions are that (1) there is a close relationship between design and metaphor that provides insights into effective design education; (2) metaphor operates through privilege, directing concern and the identification of difference; and (3) design involves the generation of action within a collaborative environment in which there is the free play of enabling metaphors.<br>

Article Title: Generic Studies: Their Renewed Importance in Religious and Literary Interpretation<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263709<br>
Date: 9 1, 1975<br>
Author(s): Wiggins Mary<br>
Abstract: In recent years, the need for a critique of "reader" as rigorous as that which has been developed for "text" and for "author" has become increasingly acute. Whether in the study of religion as story and biography or in interpretative reading in general, a critical notion of reader is essential if the act of reading is to be anything other than mere consumption of texts. Some new way of understanding the hermeneutical circle is required to avert the narcissism latent in the Anselmian model. The notion of "genre" as developed by four recent theorists is helpful in the task of constructing a critique of "reader." E. D. Hirsch, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Tzvetán Todorov, and Paul Ricoeur have each surpassed the idealist notion of genre as a classificatory device and developed in its place the notion of genre as a generative pinciple. Todorov, for example, illustrates how "form" is a theoretical, as distinct from a descriptive or explanatory, issue. According to both Hirsch and Todorov, somewhere between empirical details and metaphysical thematizations lie generic formulations which can assist the reader to organize his/her response to the text and to recognize the probable understanding toward which the conventions of the text are directed. In Gadamer's theory of interpretation, the notion of genre acquires historicity. After Gadamer, genres can no longer be regarded as timeless a priori categories. Rather, because they are constituted by historical reflections, their rise and decline are intrinsic to text-interpretation. Finally, in Ricoeur's theory that generic considerations are correlative principles of production and interpretation, we find a basis for understanding genre as praxis. If we understand reading to be isomorphic to authoring, it becomes clear that the reader can no longer be regarded as the self-evident recipient of text-signification. Genre, in Ricoeur's theory, transforms "speech" into a "work" and points toward a new notion of "reader" as one whose reconst~<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263722<br>
Date: 12 1, 1960<br>
Author(s): Edwards William J.<br>
Abstract: Part 1 shows that while Edwards and Berkeley both regard nature as God's discourse and speak of this discourse in similar ways, Edwards differs from Berkeley in believing that the signs of this discourse signify spiritual and divine realities. Part 2 explains why Edwards thought it reasonable to believe that our world is a world of types and images. Because our world is a world of resemblances and imitations, because spiritual things are its "alpha and omega," and because its beauty is a reflection of God's beauty, our world can be expected to contain images or shadows of divine things. Scripture provides evidence that this expectation is realized. Part 3 shows that these images are not symbols but emblems, and that because emblems are consciously invented, their occurrence implies theism. Part 4 attempts to show that, given the assumptions of classical Christian theism, it is in principle no more difficult to decipher the meaning of the book of nature than to decipher the meaning of an allegorical poem or tale. Part 5 criticizes Perry Miller. Edwards's reflections on types were not influenced by the new science. He did not anticipate Coleridge on the imagination, nor did he "elevate nature to a level of authority coequal with revelation."<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263719<br>
Date: 3 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Weiss Richard<br>
Abstract: Anyone who wishes to understand the debate between Hegel and Schleiermacher is forced to confront not only the staggering complexity of their thought but also the disparate nature of the key texts which are available and the fact that many philosophers and theologians approach Hegel and Schleiermacher with misleading preconceptions. This article attempts to illuminate the conflict between the two thinkers by exploring the biographical and historical context in which it arose. The author argues that, while neither thinker depended upon the other in forming his own position, each man kept the other's position constantly in view as a foil for his own. After a consideration of some early indications of conflict, the debate between Hegel and Schleiermacher is traced through a series of events which begins with Hegel's call to Berlin. While Schleiermacher was apparently quite willing to have Hegel come to Berlin, differences in political philosophy soon led to conflict, with the student movement providing a concrete focus for their disagreement. Schleiermacher's role in excluding Hegel from the Berlin Academy of Sciences is shown to have heightened the tensions. The article concludes with an exploration of Hegel's critique of Schleiermacher's dogmatics. It is argued that the intellectual core of the conflict between the two men centers upon the problem of immediate knowledge.<br>

Article Title: The Liberation of Questioning in Augustine's "Confessions"<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i263809<br>
Date: 9 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Zaleski Charles T.<br>
Abstract: Concluding his "Confessions," Augustine chose as the work's final word aperietur, "will be" or "shall be opened." The oddity of ending and closing a book on a conjugation of to open provokes reflections into the nature of questioning, reflections that open into a larger investigation concerning how Augustine understood the nature of religious belief and faithful life. For him, faithful life is a project of resisting our always premature attempts at conclusion, in order better to see the project of "inquiry into God" as an infinite undertaking, in community with others, organized centrally around reading and inhabiting the thought world of the Scriptures. The "Confessions" turns out to be a story of Augustine learning to ask questions in the right way and to accept the dynamic of questioning as an energy moving him toward God. Appreciating the "Confessions" as a story of "learning to ask questions" illuminates not only the work's content but also its structure, most notably the odd change of tone and topic from books 1-9 to books 10-13.<br>

Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first mean~<br>

Abstract: According to a school of thought that has been gaining ground for about a century, the social sciences are best conceived as styles of humanistic inquiry akin to hermeneutics rather than as branches of naturalistic inquiry paralleling the natural or physical sciences. In the past decade or so, advocates of this position have been active in providing critiques of educational research. It is argued that, although the case has some merit, the prognosis is mistaken--traditional naturalistic inquiry in education and the social sciences will continue to have an important and strong role. /// D'après une école de pensée qui gagne du terrain depuis environ un siècle, les sciences sociales devraient être considérées comme des enquêtes humanistes apparentées à l'herméneutique plutôt que comme des disciplines cherchant à comprendre la nature des choses comme le font les sciences naturelles. Au cours de la dernière décennie, les partisans de ce point de vue ont multiplié leurs critiques à l'endroit de la recherche en éducation. On affirme que, même si ce point de vue est valable à certains égards, le pronostic donné est erroné: les recherches en éducation cherchant à élucider la nature même de son objet d'étude et les sciences sociales continueront à jouer un rôle clé. /// Eine geistige Richtung, die sich seit etwa einem Jahrhundert stärker durchsetzt, sieht die Socialwissenschaften am ehesten als Arten humanistischer Untersuchung, die mit der Hermeneutik verwandt sind, denn als Zweige der naturalistischen Untersuchung, die den Natur- oder Physik-Wissenschaften gleichen. In den letzten zehn Jahren etwa waren Vertreter dieser Schule aktiv damit beschäftig, kritische Abhandlungen über erziehungswissenschaftliche Forschung vorzubringen. Es wird argumentiert, daß die gestellte Prognose falsch ist, wenngleich die Sache einen gewissen Wert hat--traditionelle naturalistiche Forschung in den Erziehungs--und Sozialwissenschaften wird weiterhin eine wichtige und starke Rolle spielen. ///~<br>

Article Title: Dying between the Lines: Infinite Blindness in Lessing's "Laokoon" and Burke's "Enquiry"<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303121<br>
Date: 7 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Wellbery Adam<br>
Abstract: The essay studies the ways in which death-the word, the concept, and the friction between word and concept-informs aesthetic programs of Lessing and Burke. Both writers turn (and return often) to death as a kind of artistic touchstone and, in doing so, illustrate divergent schools of Enlightenment aesthetic thought. Lessing wants to define and maintain, if only conceptually and only pragmatically, the borders between spatial and temporal representation; Burke, to collapse the borders between space and time, if only imaginatively and momentarily. Lessing, in both the Laokoon and How the Ancients Represented Death, although nervous about the slipperiness of the word death, seems to embrace death's certainty; it is an end, the end, the limit to end all limits. Burke, on the other hand, treats death as "the king of terrors"; he opens himself, at least nominally, to the "obscurity" of death, to the possibility of the infinite. Beneath the surface, though, Burke is profoundly ambivalent about giving up finite, spatialized representation in favor of a potentially infinite temporal flow, and his treatment of Milton's "universe of death" is a fascinating study in this ambivalence. This essay closely studies the tropes-blindness, for instance-with which Lessing and Burke approach death and suggests that their strategies are at root more similar than may appear. Both find themselves in a linguistic predicament, and death becomes for both a metaphor for the strife between natural and arbitrary signs.<br>

Author(s): Thiele Leslie Paul<br>
Abstract: To what extent and in what respects does the political though of Michel Foucault reflect the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche's ideas? In the September 1990 issue of this Review, Leslie Paul Tiele firmly asserted Nietzchean roots for Foucault's thought. In this Controversy, Thiele's claims are disputed by J. Scott Johnson. Johnson argues that Foucault's theory is rooted as much in Marx as in Nietzsche and that Foucault himself refuted Thiele's interpretation. In his response, Thiele takes issue with Johnson's critique.<br>

Article Title: Merleau-Pontian Phenomenology as Non-Conventionally Utopian<br>
Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20010333<br>
Date: 1 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Johnson Greg<br>
Abstract: This essay takes up the claim made recently by Simon Critchley in The Companion to Continental Philosophy that a "feature common to many philosophers in the Continental tradition" is the "utopian demand that things be otherwise." The general question I pursue has to do with whether or not such a claim includes movements within Continental philosophy that do not self-identify with the utopian (like critical theory). The particular question has to do with whether or not the movement of phenomenology is utopian or does it, because of its other commitments, view the utopian as the antithesis to its orientation, which makes that claim that phenomenology is utopian seem strange. My thesis is that phenomenology can be seen as a utopian tradition but that some account must be given that demonstrates this connection to the utopian. In particular, I argue that Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology provides an understanding of the utopian, which I call a non-conventional view, that is vastly different from the one assumed by most when they see or hear the word "utopian," which I lable conventional. I show that such a non-conventional understanding can be developed in a way that neither requires us to view the utopian solely as opposed to finitude and contingency, nor a form of thought and action from which we necessarily need to dissociate ourselves. It is this non-conventional view of the utopian that in the end enables us to understand how Continental philosophy in general and phenomenology in particular are important bearers of the utopian demand that things be otherwise.<br>

Article Title: Meaning and Method in the Social Sciences<br>
Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20010381<br>
Date: 1 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Fisher William P.<br>
Abstract: Academia's mathematical metaphysics are briefly explored en route to an elaboration of the qualitatively rigorous requirements underpinning the calibration and unambiguous interpretation of quantitative instrumentation in any science. Of particular interest are Gadamer's emphases on number as the paradigm of the noetic, on the role of play in interpretation, and on Hegel's sense of method as the activity of the thing itself that thought experiences. These point toward and overlap with (1) Latour's study of the metrological social networks through which technological phenomena are brought into language as modes of being that can be understood, and (2) the way that Rasch's models for measurement comprise a potential beginning for metaphysically astute, qualitatively and quantitatively integrated, mathematical methods in the social sciences. The paper closes with observations on the general problem that is philosophy, the need to remain open to multiplicities of meaning even as clear understandings are sought and obtained.<br>

Author(s): Guiance Ariel<br>
Abstract: This article begins by proposing the difference between a rhetorical mentality and scientific thought and deals, basically, with the work of Juan de Cárdenas "Los problemas y secretos maravillosos de las Indias [The Problems and Wonderful Secrets of the Indies]", published in Mexico in 1591. It narrates the life of Cárdenas, who was 28 years old when he published his book in 1591; his intellectual training --perhaps the most comprehensive of his era--, his culture, and his experiences. A well-rounded academic, Juan de Cárdenas presents in his book the utopian and scientific sides of himself as Doctor of Medicine. This is an interesting and entertaining work. /// Comienza planteando la diferencia entre mentalidad retórica y pensamiento científico y trata, fundamentalmente, sobre la obra de Juan de Cárdenas "Los problemas y secretos maravillosos de las Indias", aparecido en México en 1591. Relata la vida de Cárdenas que tiene 28 anos cuando publica su obra en 1591; la formación intelectual --quizá la más completa de la época--, la cultura, las vivencias de Cárdenas y sus experiencias. Universitario, culto, su libro presenta la faz utópica y la científica como Doctor en Medicina. Trabajo interesante y entretenido.<br>

Abstract: As a tool for understanding the world in which we live the study of the history of political thought is stunted because of a preoccupation with the Western canon as the history of political thought to the exclusion of other histories and traditions. This ongoing exclusion is itself facilitated by a deeply entrenched select reading of the Western canon; a reading that overlooks a tendency within the canon to not just ignore but suppress and dismiss the value of other accounts of history and traditions of thought. An opening of the Western mind to these assumed to be alien traditions of social, legal and political thought reveals that, in the global market place of ideas, these purportedly competing and non-compatible traditions of thought might in fact have considerably more in common than what sets them apart: thus opening the way for an authentic inter-civilisational dialogue that focuses more on co-operation and less on clashes.<br>

Abstract: This reflection on Errington's thought-provoking paper, by an intellectual historian and a student of Chinese philosophy, does not dispute her interpretive position on classical Malay literature in general and on hikayat in particular. Rather, it attempts to challenge three salient points of her argument: that the distinction between "oral" and "written" is a hazy one in the paratactic style of the hikayat; that the "images" in this type of literature are flat, repetitive and without content; and that the Malay art of story-telling is diametrically opposed to the rhetorical style of history characteristic of the post-Renaissance West. It is hoped that such a discussion will bring about fruitful encounters between scholars in different fields and disciplines in Asian studies.<br>

Article Title: Symbolic Patterning in Angkola Batak Adat Ritual<br>
Publisher: The Association for Asian Studies, Inc.<br>
Issue: i309685<br>

Author(s): Van Gennep Susan<br>
Abstract: In Sumatra's Angkola Batak culture, rituals celebrating major kinship-related events such as marriage have many layers of social and symbolic meaning; they have political, kinship, musical, mythic, and philosophical dimensions as lengthy, oratory-filled ceremonies that unite wife-giving lineages with wife-receivers. This article examines several ways that the interpretive approach that is discussed in the introduction can help students of Indonesian ritual grasp diverse aspects of Batak marriage rituals such as their hidden symbolic organization and their practical political implications. The article deals with a short sequence of adat dance staged for anthropological research purposes. (Adat, once translated as customary law, roughly means Angkola ceremonial life, kinship norms, and political thought; adat is eminently flexible, redefined by each Batak generation.) The choreography of the dance (wife-receivers dancing with wife-givers), songs, clothing, the political biographies of the participants, and the fact that the event was staged render the ceremony open to both structural and social contextual inquiry.<br>

Abstract: Jusqu'à Totalité et Infini compris, la temporalité aura été essentiellement pensée par Lévinas, au seuil de l'événement qu'est l'Autre, comme ouverture d'un avenir pur, jusqu'à la rémission d'un présent, qui nous relèverait alors de notre passé. À partir de sa méditation toujours plus insistante de la « Trace de l'Autre », Lévinas est toutefois amené à repenser cette ouverture elle-même depuis un passé toujours déjà passé et dont nous aurions à jamais à répondre, échapperait-il à toute expérience dans l'entre-temps de son passage. Du Visage à la Trace — jusqu'au visage comme trace —, l'avenir ne s'ouvrirait à nous que dans la déchirure de notre réponse à ce passé immémorial d'où l'Autre nous appellerait sans cesse, déjà parti avant d'être venu. Arrachés à nous-mêmes, nous voici, dans la « honte de survivre », ordonnés à l'avenir par l'accusation d'un passé qui toujours se dérobe, sans qu'il nous soit jamais possible de nous y dérober. À partir de sa pensée de la trace de l'Autre et de sa mortalité, Lévinas inscrit sa propre méditation du temps et de l'histoire dans la trace de l'immémorial — impossible mémoire, à la mémoire de l'impossible, dont la signifiance éthique ne saurait se réduire à un improbable « devoir de mémoire ». « Une voix vient de l'autre rive. Une voix interrompt le dire du déjà dit », qui nous voue, à présent, à ce qui ne cesse de venir, selon une vocation, une dévotion, qui est le temps lui-même. Up to and including Totality and Infinity, temporality has been thought by Levinas, on the threshold of this incident which is the Other, as the opening of a pure future, up to the remission of the present, which would then recover us from our past. Nevertheless, from his more and more insistent meditation upon the « Trace of the Other », Levinas has been led to re-examine that opening itself from a past for ever past and for which we would be answerable, were it to escape our experience in the interval of its crossing. From the Face to the Trace — up to~<br>

Article Title: LA FONDATION AUGUSTINIENNE DE LA PERSONNE<br>
Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i20849827<br>
Date: 4 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Cormier Philippe<br>
Abstract: Le dépassement phénoménologique du substantialisme métaphysique devrait permettre aujourd'hui d'envisager une refondation de la notion de personne, laquelle s'était quelque peu immobilisée depuis Boèce. Sur ce nouvel horizon, le retour à la fondation première, celle d'Augustin, s'impose. Celui-ci est le premier en effet, pour l'essentiel dans son traité de la Trinité, à avoir clairement pensé la personne (divine) comme relation et non comme substance. La réduction augustinienne de la personne (humaine) à l'ego ou à « l'homme intérieur » ouvre la possibilité d' « analogies subjectives » avec la Trinité: pensée, amour, connaissance; mémoire, intelligence, volonté. Cependant, la spéculation augustinienne trouve sa limite en échouant à penser une personne de chair — et, qui plus est, une telle personne comme « en relation ». Ce qui était relation en Dieu reste, en l'homme, substance pensante, seule face à son Dieu. Phenomenology has overcome the old substance of metaphysics and then should permit us today to refound the idea of the person which was in a way, since Boethius, brought to a standstill. Therefore we must to go back to St. Augustine who was actually the first, in his De Trinitate, to conceive, the (divine) person as a relation and not as a substance. The (human) person so confined to the ego or to the « inner man » allows some possible « subjective analogies » with the Trinity: thought, love, knowledge, memory, intelligence and will. However the Augustinian theory fails to conceive first the person in her own flesh and blood — a bodily person — and secondly such a person as being « in relation »: man is a thinking substance, alone facing her God.<br>

Publisher: Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore<br>
Issue: i23005171<br>
Date: 3 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): CEREDA AMBROGIA<br>
Abstract: The article analyses the meaning of tattooing as a form of narration. Introducing the body as a text that can convey different forms of thought (derived both from philosophy and from sociology), the author maintains that the body modification is today as an open and living work whose interpretation has an influence on the individual identity and can be changed by means of the interaction with others. A thumbnail sketch of the history of the practice among traditional communities up to contemporary society is drawn to provide a series of fundamental usages for the inscription of the body. The concern here is to show tattooing as an expression of the whole individual (no longer divided into mind vs. body) and of his own perceived identity, underlying the relation of the chosen symbols (and of the symbolic ritual) with society, which remains the main source offering forms of representation and the main stage for the construction of identity. So that the whole final text can be read as the result of a process where the authorship is shattered among the society itself.<br>

Date: 6 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): SEACHRIS JOSHUA<br>
Abstract: Death and futility are among a cluster of themes that closely track discussions of life's meaning. Moreover, futility is thought to supervene on naturalistic meta-narratives because of how they will end. While the nature of naturalistic meta-narrative endings is part of the explanation for concluding that such meta-narratives are cosmically or deeply futile, this explanation is truncated. I argue that the reason the nature of the ending is thought to be normatively important is first anchored in the fact that narrative ending qua ending is thought to be normatively important. Indeed, I think futility is often thought to characterize naturalistic meta-narratives because a narrative's ending has significant proleptic power to elicit a wide range of broadly normative human responses on, possibly, emotional, aesthetic, and moral levels towards the narrative as a whole.<br>

Abstract: This essay explores the suggestion that many American narratives are supplementary, correcting narratives — alternatives to the main story on offer. The guiding thought is that of Henry James's "possible other case," and the chief example is Cormac McCarthy's "No Country for Old Men," in which one story after another fails to cope with the ongoing mystery it faces. The novel may imply, then, that narrative itself, rather than any individual report or fiction, is in crisis or has come to the end of its road. A coda to the essay proposes the option of nonnarrative understandings of the world in those extreme situations where storytelling is no longer the sense-making activity we so often take it to be.<br>

Abstract: The ultramodern condition represents the "third wave" in postmodernist-inspired philosophy and cultural practice. Two of ultramodernism's critical theoretical components are the human/social forces, flows, and assemblages that sustain transgression; and the human/social intensities, fluctuations, and thresholds that make transcendence possible as both will and way. In the ultramodern age, then, transcendence is about overcoming and transforming the conditions (i.e., forces, flows, and assemblages) that co-produce harm-generating (i.e., transgressive) tendencies. This manuscript problematizes transgression by way of ultramodern theory. This critical investigation represents "the phenomenology of the shadow," or the ultramodern philosophy of harm. To contextualize this phenomenology and philosophy, the intellectual history of ultramodern thought is recounted. This includes a review of the shadow construct by way of its prominent socio-cultural, psychoanalytic, and political-economic currents; and a chronicling of the reification process (regarding risk, captivity, and harm) since the modernist era (i.e., the industrial revolution). The article concludes with some very speculative observations concerning "the phenomenology of the stranger," or the ultramodern philosophy of transcendence as both will and way.<br>

Abstract: Derrida and Foucault provide key starting points to understanding archives. They see archives as hegemonic, characterizing ways of thought, modes of colonization, and the control of citizens. However, they also make clear that archives can be read subversively. With patience, counter-readings allow the excavation of the voices (sometimes names) of subaltern and otherwise suppressed others from the archive. By reading along and across the archival grain, researchers can follow the development of ideas and processes across historical periods. Archives can be seen as orphanages, containing surrogates of performances. Archives (paper and digital) also provide access to the results of anthropological research in ways mandated by ethics codes, but these are subject to controversy. What sorts of consent and what sorts of anonymization should be provided? Archives run by the groups traditionally studied by anthropologists provide models of radical archives that are very different from those conceived of by traditional archivists.<br>

Abstract: À partir la distinction des trois sens de la conscience dans la Cinquième Recherche logique de Husserl, nous tâchons d'évaluer les rapports entre conscience, impression et réflexion. Seule la prise en compte de la temporalité immanente de la conscience permet de comprendre l'articulation des trois. Mais on souligne la fonction de connaissance et d'unification égologique qui confère à la réflexion un poids méthodologique considérable dans la phénoménologie de Husserl comme dans la pensée du jeune Fink. Enfin, la critique de Michel Henry permet de préciser à quelles conditions le niveau préréflexif ou impressionnel peut acquérir une teneur propre, voire une relative autonomie. This study has its departure point in Husserl's distinction of three concepts of consciousness (Fifth Logical Investigation); it seeks to evaluate the relationship between consciousness, impression and reflection. Their articulation requires that the immanent temporality of consciousness be taken into account. At the same time, this paper stresses the cognitive function and the egological meaning of reflection, which explain its considerable methodological weight in Husserl's phenomenology and in the early thought of Fink. Finally, Michel Henry's objections enable us to establish to what extent the pre-reflective, impressional level can be credited with consistency and autonomy.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur has initiated a new direction in the field of hermeneutics by applying the phenomenological method to the interpretation of texts. By this he has effected a transition from description to hermeneutic phenomenology. In order to explicate his position the paper deals with this transformation: In developing hermeneutics Ricoeur tends to eliminate Husserl's transcendental idealism, to retain some central phenomenological motifs, and to add new elements. These elements were eclectically picked up by him from analytic and linguistic philosophy and from the current linguistic and structural theories. Since the deepest and most genuine roots of Ricoeur's thought lie in the phenomenology of Husserl, the paper concentrates on the explication of his phenomenological presuppositions and attempts to show how they were reformulated within the new science of interpretation. Thus, the first part of the paper is mainly an exposition of the transition from phenomenology to hermeneutics. The second part points to some difficulties inherent in such a move. The paper ends with a discussion of the problem of "the hermeneutic circle", which is an immanent part of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: Nietzsche's impact on educational thought has always been surprisingly neglected, possibly because it is hard to divorce his educational views from his philosophical endeavour, as a whole which has given rise to considerable scholarly polemics during the last few decades. Recently several articles propagating various interpretations of Nietzsche's educational teaching have been published Their main weakness lies in the fact that Nietzsche's central educational theses are discussed quite apart from his "psychological" philosophy, while it is the philosophy that serves as the necessary background for understanding those theses. The present paper, mainly analyzing nietzsche's essay "Schopenhauer as Educator", will attempt to provide a better insight into Nietzsche's early psychological and pedagogic thought. It will also demonsrate those basic criteria implicit in his method of psychologization, which at the very outset had served Nietzsche as an educational means of testing the integrity of certain examplary personalities. Nietzsche's Educational Thought is established in the service of authenticity — a central and influential Existentialist concept, the main ideas of which are explicated in the paper. Another Nietzschean concept, much negleted yet significant, that of the "Higher-Self", is elaborated and compared to Freud's parallel notion of the "Super-Ego".<br>

Abstract: Cet article vise à mettre en valeur le niveau discursif du langage des géographes. Plus particulièrement il se penche sur la métaphore. Celle-ci est d'abord cernée en tant que procédé mis en œuvre dans tout discours. Puis l'exemple de l'organicisme, très répandu dans la pensée du siècle dernier, est utilisé pour examiner les principales modalités de l'emploi d'une métaphore, celle de l'organisme, dans les discours géographiques. A partir de cet examen, on en vient à préciser les finalités de cet emploi et la portée générale du langage métaphorique en géographie. Il apparaît que le recours à la métaphore révèle la nature profonde de l'activité scientifique, aussi bien dans ses dimensions cognitives que créatrices. The aim of this article is to emphasize the discursive level of the language of geographers. More particularly, it is concerned with metaphor. First, metaphor is characterized as a method which is used in any discourse. Then, thanks to the example of organicism which was wide-spread in nineteenth century thought, the major patterns of the use of a metaphor in geographic discourses (the metaphor of the organism) are investigated. It is then possible to specify what are the main reasons for such a use of metaphor and what is the full significance of metaphorical language in geography. It becomes clear that the resort to the use of metaphor reveals the true nature of scientific activity, in its cognitive as well as creative dimensions.<br>

Author(s): Lévy Jacques<br>
Abstract: Innovante en apparence dans son énoncé, la géographie culturelle pose un double problème épistémologique. D'abord, s'agit-il d'une nouvelle branche de la géographie ou d'une école de pensée qui prétend réorganiser l'ensemble des savoirs de la discipline? Le projet d'une géographie culturelle reprend et endosse les ambiguïtés du mot « culture » dans les sciences sociales contemporaines. Ensuite, le mot « culture » correspond le plus souvent à une version faible de la notion de société, en particulier dans les travaux anglophones. Cette géographie, qui aborde les sociétés sans le dire clairement, a-t-elle forgé de nouveaux outils pour explorer la dimension spatiale de ces sociétés? Si le « tournant culturel » a certainement contribué à faire avancer notre regard sur le monde social dans certains domaines, la réponse à cette question n'est pas toujours consistante. Au bout du compte, deux caractéristiques, qui pouvaient paraître périphériques, se révèlent essentielles pour éclairer les logiques de ces hésitations. L'une, théorique, concerne la mise en place éventuelle d'un paradigme du social qui se passerait d'un concept de société. L'autre, effet pratique du premier, concerne l'usage de discours universitaires prétendant fonder le « multiculturalisme » sur le respect des « cultures » pour légitimer le communautarisme contre la « société des individus ». Cultural geography proposes an apparently innovative project but it actually raises a dual epistemological issue. First of all, is it a new field inside geography or a school of thought that contends to redesign the overall geography's disciplinary layout? The perspective of a "cultural geography" encompasses and endorses the ambiguity of the word "culture" in contemporary social sciences. Secondly, "culture" is predominantly used as a weak version of "society", namely in English-speaking literature. Cultural geographers address societies but do not explicitly admit it. Have cultural geographers built fresh tools to e~<br>

Abstract: Text-books of former days have been rightly criticised for using the Bible in a lazy manner as a «mine of premises». The same reproach would apply to the historian of exegesis who would make no attempt to situate the texts in the horizon of their ancient authors. While the cultural context in which they thought and wrote was predominantly hellenistic, they owed much also to biblical methods of reading. It would, moreover, be difficult to understand their works without taking into account the polemic context in which they were written. Throwing light on each other, the great theologies allow us to draw the figure of Jesus Christ in mutually complementary perspectives.<br>

Abstract: On the occasion of the recent publication of a complete translation into French of Sein und Zeit, the author of the article means to approach the work with a "prejudice of innocence." Three philosophical questions are first treated. Reflection on time introduces the theological debate. For Heidegger, theology, as metaphysics on which it depends, is marked by "the forgetfulness of being." But does not the lack in him of a stand on moral conscience reveal a weakness of his thought on otherness? As for his theory of "concern", because it does not go back to its hebrew sources it fails to make "creatureliness" thinkable. The debate would deserve to be resumed starting from a philosophical analysis of the anamnesis.<br>

Author(s): Gilbert Paul<br>
Abstract: Jean Ladrière, professeur à l'Université Catholique de Louvain, a développé une réflexion consacrée à la distinction et aux relations de la science et de la philosophie au point de vue épistémologique et ontologique, c'est-à-dire de la vérité. L'article parcourt trois de ses textes, écrits au long d'un demi siècle. La phénoménologie anime de plus en plus la réflexion, lui permettant de recentrer la dynamique de la science en un projet fondamental. Les vérités scientifiques et leur relativité historique sont à comprendre intérieurement à la pratique de la science, dont le philosophe médite le sens en prenant la responsabilité d'en révéler la vérité. L'évolution de la pensée de Ladrière illustre l'évolution de l'université de Louvain qui, fleuron du thomisme restauré par Léon XIII, s'est orienté de plus en plus vers la phénoménologie à l'époque de l'enseignement de notre auteur. Jean Ladrière, professor at the Catholic University of Louvain, developed a reflection on the distinction and relations between science and philosophy from the point of view of epistemology and ontology, i. e. from the point of view of truth. The article considers three of his texts, which span a 50-year period. The increasing influence of phenomenology on his reflection allows Ladrière to re-locate the dynamic of science in a fundamental project. The truths of science, and their historic relativity, are to be understood as belonging within the practice of science, while it is the task of philosophy to reflect on its meaning, by revealing its truth. The evolution of Ladrière's thought illustrates the evolution of the university of Louvain, which, from being a centre of the Thomism which was reinstated under Leo XIII, adopted a progressively more phenomenological orientation during our author's time as a teacher there.<br>

Abstract: Experience of God, of time, and of oneself are connected with each other. This connection is not to be understood within the frame of a metaphysical thought of god, but in the context of the realism of mercy: God's time is qualified by the movement of mercy. Discussing different theories of time (Augustin, M. Theunissen, U. Beck, E. Erikson) the character of time as a gift is elaborated and understood as a way of secular speaking of God.<br>

Abstract: The relationship between gift and exchange continues to be a controversial issue in the missiological, anthropological and philosophical debate. The author's pastoral experience and phenomenological observation are placed within the framework of such discourses and related to the basic rationale of Luther's Reformation: The gratuity of faith interrupts both the logic and the practice of reciprocity. This thought throws some light on the networking of the churches in terms of development aid as well as on the field of intercultural missionary communication. In conclusion, the author discusses options for churches to be advocates for a culture of giving. He argues that in cultural settings shaped by a logic and practice of reciprocity Christian witness to the pure gratuity of faith is not rendered irrelevant or ineffective but rather proves itself.<br>

Abstract: Nos inúmeros estudos sobre a natureza humana, a referência à deficiência intelectual é muito escassa. No entanto, assumi-la, além de acabar com uma marginalização injusta, poderia ensinar-nos muito. Com esta convicção, neste estudo analisa-se como essas pessoas são colocadas nas várias teorias sobre o ser humano e como, por sua vez, essas teorias são interpeladas por elas. Depois de propor um mapa das concepções mais influentes da natureza humana, estuda-se o lugar das pessoas com deficiência em propostas que destacam como chaves estes traços do humano: a subjectividade moral da dignidade, a linguagem e o pensamento, a natureza (animal), a cultura. Como resultado desta análise conclui-se a necessidade de repensar estas concepções, tanto a partir de critérios estritamente cognitivos como éticos. There is almost no reference to intellectual disability in the many studies about human nature. The incorporation of intellectual disability into those studies would help to overcome the unfair marginalization of affected people and would provide us with important insights into the human nature. This study examines the place of intellectually disable people in diverse philosophical anthropologies and how the incorporation of this human condition challenges them. After mapping the most influential conceptions of human nature, the paper reviews how intellectually disabled people are taken into account in theories that highlight the following key human features: moral subjectivity of dignity, language and thought, (animal) nature, culture. The study concludes that taking into account intellectual disability provides cognitive and moral reasons for rethinking current conceptions of the human nature.<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo analiza las revistas argentinas El Peronista Lucha por la Liberación y La Causa Peronista, editadas por la organización Montoneros desde abril a septiembre de 1974, y Movimiento, ligada a la Juventud Peronista Lealtad durante el mismo periodo. Asumiendo que las tradiciones no constituyen legados cerrados sino herencias en constante invención, se explora la significación que dichas publicaciones articularon sobre el peronismo. ¿Qué sentido se otorgaba al vínculo con Juan Domingo Perón en cada revista? ¿Cómo se pensaba la relación con el resto de los actores del Movimiento Peronista? ¿Qué papel se atribuía a la violencia? Respondiendo dichos interrogantes, se examina el modo en que cada espacio configuró su identidad política. The article analyzes the Argentinean magazines El Peronista Lucha por la Liberación and La Causa Peronista, published by Montoneros organization from April to September 1974, and Movimiento para la Reconstrucción y la Liberación Nacional, tied to the Juventud Peronista Lealtad during this period. Assuming that the traditions do not constitute closed legacies but inheritances in continuous re-invention, the article explores the meaning that those publications presented on the Peronism. What sense was granted to the link by Juan Domingo Perón in every magazine? How was thought the relationship with the other actors of the Movimiento Peronista? What position was assumed around the political violence? Answering the above mentioned questions, the article examines the way in which each organization formed its political identity.<br>

Publisher: OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS<br>
Issue: i23638508<br>
Date: 1 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Pavlich George<br>
Abstract: Analyses highlighting the genres of critique engaged by radical criminologists are comparatively rare. The few exceptions tend to associate radical criminological thinking with a grammar of critique that (i) establishes universal criteria, (ii) judges (con)texts against these and (iii) prescribes paths of action accordingly. This is an unfortunate tendency since it ties radical thought to an increasingly anachronistic genre of critique, and does not arrest the dwindling plight of critical approaches, or resist dominant technocratic discourses in criminology. In an attempt at redress, this paper identifies four alternate genres of critique in British radical criminology of the 1960s-70s, and shows how these could spawn a deconstructive ethos from which to develop critical analysis with renewed legitimacy.<br>

Author(s): Escudier Alexandre<br>
Abstract: Le lien entre pensée philosophique et pensée juive chez Hermann Cohen se confond avec son concept de raison ou de rationalité. Dès ses premiers travaux, il s'attache à éprouver la dimension universaliste de la tradition juive. Or la rationalit/e du judaïsme réside, selon lui, dans l'idée d'une morale universelle, qui se manifeste avant tout dans la pensée messianique. Ce lien apparaît le plus clairement dans les écrits qui font converger le judaïsme et la philosophie kantienne dans l'horizon de la raison. Sous l'aspect de la philosophie pratique, cette convergence rejoint le projet politique de l'assimilation du judaïsme et de la culture allemande. The link between philosophical reflexion an Jewish thought in Hermann Cohen is thoroughly determined by his concept of reason or rationality. Since his earlier works Cohen tries to show the universalistic dimension of Jewish tradition. Now the rationality of Judaism lies in its universal morality, which is inherent to the perspective of messianism. This appears clearly in those works where Cohen brings together Judaism and Kantian philosophy with regard to the idea of reason. In the field of practical philosophy such a convergency is part of the political project of assimilation between Judaism and German culture.<br>

Abstract: This article aims at explaining, on the one hand, the inadequacy of the formalist positivist method in answering the essential questions of constitutional Law, such as the validity of the constitutional norm, the sovereignty of the people which comes before the original constitutional act and the effects of a theory of values on the limitation of the revision power. On the other hand, it proposes an onto-axiological approach, which refers to the Philosophy of Law. A relevant methodology of constitutional science of Liberty helps the specialists to follow the progress of knowledge. It puts forward means for approaching the subject matter of science (the norm), the constitutional environment and the theoretical basis of the norm. Following this proposed method would help not only in describing the norms but also in checking their validity, their justification and their imperfection when compared with their aims. These thought processes are a never ending search, that is to say a characteristic of science itself.<br>

Abstract: Quentin Skinner's methodological project contains a fundamental imprecision that is rarely mentioned by the secondary literature: the assumption, present in several of his methodological texts, that a theory designed for the analysis of oral communication (speech act theory) can be unreservedly used for interpreting text. In this article I will use some of Paul Ricoeur's phenomenological insights on the difference between textual and oral communication in order to advance a systematic critique of Skinner's project and to suggest new methodological possibilities for the history of political thought and related disciplines. This procedure will also allow me to organize some of the criticism raised against Skinner's Collingwoodean approach since its inception.<br>

Article Title: Where do I belong? Narrating collective identity and translocational positionality<br>
Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i23880984<br>
Date: 12 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): ANTHIAS FLOYA<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the concept of 'identity' is of limited heuristic value and proposes that it may instead be more useful to deploy the notion of narratives of location and positionality for addressing the range of issues normally thought to be about collective identity. Location and positionality (and translocational positionality) are more useful concepts for investigating processes and outcomes of collective identification — that is, the claims and attributions that individuals make about their position in the social order of things, their views of where and to what they belong (and to what they do not belong) as well as an understanding of the broader social relations that constitute and are constituted in this process. This enables a complete abandonment of the residual elements of essentialization retained even within the idea of fragmented and multiple identities so favoured by critics of unitary notions of identity. The article will draw on research into the ways in which experiences of 'race' and ethnicity were articulated in the narrations produced by British-born youngsters of Greek Cypriot background.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917924<br>
Date: 9 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Antonaccio Maria<br>
Abstract: This article argues that Iris Murdoch makes a distinctive contribution to the agenda of theological humanism by formulating a revised theology of culture. Specifically, the article claims that Murdoch provides a compelling apologia for religious life in a secular world in two ways: by defending the significance of individual consciousness, and by retrieving an idea of the religious depth of morality. In doing so, Murdoch's work challenges antihumanist currents in modern and postmodern thought, offers an alternative to confessional forms of religious reflection, and revises previous theologies of culture (such as Tillich's) by giving priority to the ethical dimension of human life.<br>

Article Title: DOSTOEVSKY AND THE HERMENEUTICS OF SUSPICION<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917895<br>
Date: 9 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Ward Bruce K.<br>
Abstract: The contemporary philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, has characterized the dominant trend in modern interpretative thought as the 'school of suspicion', whose most significant 'masters' are Freud and Nietzsche. For them, to seek meaning—whether in a text, dream, discourse, or institution—is, first and foremost, to suspect 'truth as lying'. It is my contention that Ricoeur could well have named Dostoevsky as a third master of this modern school of interpretation, for he, too, was preoccupied with exploring the possibility of 'truth as lying', whether to others or to oneself. The general concern of my essay is to clarify Dostoevsky's relation to the modern 'hermeneutics of suspicion' in a manner which is mutually illuminating. The particular focus is on Dostoevsky's hermeneutics of suspicion as employed in The Brothers Karamazov, especially with the object of deciphering the avowed 'love of humanity' which motivates Ivan Karamazov's famous 'rebellion' against God. Ivan's humanism is highly ambiguous, as his words and actions (of omission and commission) throughout the novel demonstrate. I attempt to show that the ambiguity of Ivan Karamazov can be illumined as an exercise of suspicion on Dostoevsky's part which distinguishes between the manifest sources of Ivan's moral stance and what is in reality its hidden basis. And, in order to situate Dostoevsky in relation to the modern 'school of suspicion', his interpretation of the ambiguous text of modern humanism is compared with that of Nietzsche. The dialogue which the essay sets up between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky on the problem embodied by Ivan Karamazov reveals areas of convergence and divergence: the former apparent in a shared suspicion of a secular humanism which affirms the love of humanity apart from religious faith; and the latter apparent in their different understandings of love—whether of humanity or of God. The comparison between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, then, highlights the distinction between a hermeneutics of sus~<br>

Author(s): McNay Lois<br>
Abstract: Examining the relevance of communitarian thought for feminist theory, this essay considers the idea of narrative identity in certain types of communitarianism and feminism. It claims that the particular way in which the idea of narrative identity is elaborated raises difficulties for a feminist understanding of gender identity. The syncretic and over generalised idea of narrative identity derived from communitarian thought ode snot adequately grasp important aspects of the ways in which gender inequalities are constructed.<br>

The important results are not given in bigger monographs but in smaller detailed investigations, represented in "Origeniana". Another important venute into Origen's thought is the dictionary produced by the Italian group of "Origenists", providing all the contributions of investigation.<br>

Abstract: Theology can only prove its inner cohesion and unity in the interplay between life and thought in faith and in dialogue with its contemporary culture. Ch. Theobald is a theologian who does not search for this inner unity in a foundation of theological thought unfolding in various tractates but in a style of doing theology that has its analogy in being Christian. This article traces some of the elements in Theobald's style of theology.<br>

Abstract: Original Sin is considered to be a uniquely Christian doctrine. Nevertheless, an analysis of apparently forgotten Jewish treatises — most of which are to be found only in manuscript form — reveals that an extraordinary philosophical theory of Original Sin is present in late medieval Jewish thought. It implies, therefore, a new dimension in characterising this doctrine and has implications for the understanding of the process of inter-communicating of Jewish and Christian thought. This study focuses on fundamental Jewish passages, beginning with Apocalyptic literature and ending with medieval philosophical texts. Yet, the examination of those Hebrew texts is carried out in the light of the writing of Christian scholars. This means that the attempt to clarify this Jewish doctrine is made, from a methodological viewpoint, both by looking at the development of this doctrine trough the history of the Jewish thought, and by a close examination of the parallel general sources. It is only then that one can see that rudiments of the Christian doctrine of Original Sin were inserted into the Aristotelian theory of Nature, and combined with elements from Maimonides' Biblical-allegoric exegesis.<br>

Abstract: Son ya varias las décodas transcurridas desde que los estudios de folklore en general y la etnomusicología en particular se han visto dominados por la analitica deconstructiva y el pensamiento culturalista, configurando un bloque paradigmático sumamente influyente en el multidisciplinar territorio de las ciencias sociales. Las aportaciones provenientes de estas corrientes han resultado en líneas generates de gran valor e interés para la comunidad científica, ensanchando y dinamizando el hasta entonces relativamente reducido campo de acción e interpretación de disciplinas como la musicología comparada. Sin embargo el proceso de renovación académica –que encabezarían obras como las de Benedict Anderson y Eric Hobsbawm– ha implicado asimismo un desigual desplazamiento del foco de atención desde el objeto de estudio mismo hacia la esfera de su contexto, relevancia social e implicaciones ideológicas. La deconstrucción se ha ejercido particularmente en contra del aserto diferencial, subrayando sus debilidades argumentales, excesos etnocéntricos y –con frecuencia– obvios intereses espurios, una tarea históricamente necesaria pero que a la par ha sustraído del folklore todo valor ontológico en aras de su significado, y del trabajo científico el vital soporte empírico, que ahora se ve arrinconado por una elaboración altamente abstracta al amparo de un lenguaje en el límite de la saturación semántica. Este artículo explora la vía crítica descrita para concluir planteando determinadas alternativas en defensa de una tradición sostenible –a pesar del vigor innegable y sinergético de las fuerzas del progreso, los procesos de hibridación y globalización y las alteraciones provenientes del constructo folklorista–, así como del hecho diferencial implícito y su asunción y gestión no indefectiblemente en el marco de un proyecto político o comercial. Studies of folklore in general and ethnomusicology in particular have been dominated by deconstructive analysis and culturalist theory fo~<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de Francis Jacques est innovante. Du « dialogisme transcendantal » à la « philosophie de l'interrogation », deux jalons sont posés; ils commandent une alliance inédite du formel et du transcendantal. Par la reprise radicalisante des schèmes criticistes, l'activité symbolique devient le miroir où se reflète l'originarité a priori des structures érotétiques de la pensée et du texte. Avec une effectivité peu commune nourrie par la logique de l'interrogation, F. Jacques montre que l'interrogativité est constitutive de l'acte de penser. In the work of Francis Jacques, the innovation is remarkable : his heuristic model goes from his transcendantal dialogism to his erotetical philosophy. Along this itinerary, the critical schemes become converted; in consequence, on the new path of a formal and transcendantal logic revisited, the language appears as a miror where is strongly expressed the a priori originarity which is specific to the interrogative structures of text and thought.<br>

Freud gegen die Theodizee führt, wenn sie erklärt: »Daß den Ursprung eines Glaubens auf-
zuzeigen noch nicht seine Widerlegung ist, entging Freud nicht.« Zu betonen wäre dagegen
gerade, daß Freuds Attacke das Funktionszentrum der Theodizee trifft, indem sie deren subjek-
tive Grundlagen offenbart. Fortan ist eine Philosophie des Bösen, wie auch Neiman einräumt,
undenkbar, denn sie erscheint wie eine Fortschreibung kindlicher Ängste in der Ordnung des
gelehrten Diskurses.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this article is to analyse the political and mnemonic programme to be found in the last books of the British historian and thinker Tony Judt. The author of this article assumes that the final period of Judt's writing, in which he produced Ill Fares the Land, The Memory Chalet, and the posthumously published discussion with Timothy Snyder entitled Thinking the Twentieth Century, is dependent on a kind of 'art of memory'. For Judt, being terminally ill with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and thus condemned to immobility, this method became not so much—as in the case of its classic varieties—a technology of remembering, as a manner of recognizing and analyzing the contemporary world by turning to his own biography. The purpose was to construct a 'political testament' for the Western world in a time of crisis whose roots, according to Judt, can be found in the supremacy that 'economic' thinking has achieved over traditional political thought. In a gesture reminiscent of the Stoic 'techniques of the self' described by Michel Foucault, Judt, by exploiting his own no less complicated biography and identity, tries to throw light on the complicated history of the 20th century, containing the sources of 'our contemporary ills'. Biography and history thus meet here in a 'work of memory' whose horizon and catalyzer is the perspective of death, and whose stake is the idea of a political community experiencing, according to Judt, a period of inertia.<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to explore the relationship between the thought of Richard Rorty and that of his former teacher, Charles Hartshorne. There are important similarities between the two, but ultimately the differences are more readily apparent, especially in terms of the battle between poetry (in the wide sense of the term conceived by Rorty) and (Hartshornian) metaphysics. Hartshorne is defended against Rorty.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>
Issue: i24439506<br>
Date: 4 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): LOOBUYCK PATRICK<br>
Abstract: In the first half of the twentieth century noncognitivism was the predominant metaethical point of view in analytical philosophy. This perspective came under critical scrutiny as early as the late 1950s, and by the 1970s its authority began to be undermined. For various reasons cognitivist theories began to be put forward with confidence. Different philosophers tried ways to restore the role of reason in ethics. This shift in the philosophical climate was influenced by—or was at least in accordance with—the thought of the later Wittgenstein. In particular, this article will consider the relevance of Wittgenstein for cognitivist views, such as that of S. Toulmin, relativists like G. Harman, and British moral realists like S. Lovibond and J. McDowell. In fact, Wittgenstein is one of the founding fathers of antifoundationalism. He gives us the hopeful insight that the end of foundationalism does not necessarily imply the end of moral philosophy but must be considered a new start of it.<br>

Article Title: THE POETICS OF ANCIENT GREEK MEMORY AND THE HISTORICAL IMPERATIVE<br>
Publisher: Wiley Periodicals, Inc.<br>
Issue: i24542986<br>
Date: 10 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Grethlein Jonas<br>
Abstract: This book examines Greek engagements with the past as articulations of memory formulated against the contingency of chance associated with temporality. Based on a phenomenological understanding of temporality, it identifies four memorializing strategies: continuity (tradition), regularity (exemplarity), development, and acceptance of chance. This framework serves in pursuing a twofold aim: to reconstruct the literary field of memory in fifth-century BCE Greece; and to interpret Greek historiography as a memorializing mode. The key contention advanced by this approach is that acts of memory entailed an "idea of history" that was articulated not only in historiography, but also in epinician poetry, elegy, tragedy, and oratory. The book offers a rich account of poetic conventions and contexts through which each of these genres counterbalanced contingency through the use of exemplary and traditional modes of memory. This fine analysis highlights the grip of the present on the past as a significant feature of both historiographical and nonhistoriographical genres. The essay argues that this work fills a disciplinary gap by extending the reflection on memory to a new period, Greek antiquity. The retrospective positioning of this period at the outset of Western historical thought brings Grethlein's investigation to the center of debates about memory, temporality, and the meaning history. In engaging with the book's argument, the essay suggests that historiographical memory emerged in Greece not as a first-order encounter with time, but as a second-order encounter with forgetting. This confrontation marked a certain separation of historiography from other memorializing genres. Whereas poetic and rhetorical memories were posited against contingency, historiography sought to retrieve those aspects of the past that may otherwise have been irretrievably lost and forgotten. In doing so, it formulated the historiographical imperative as a negation of forgetting that problematized~<br>

Abstract: Max Weber's ideas of value pluralism and disenchantment haunt modern political thought often without explicit acknowledgement. The problem of value pluralism in the work of Isaiah Berlin and John Rawls is explored. Is there an uncritical, even if implicit, acceptance of the idea of a connection between 'the fact of pluralism' as Rawls calls it and the idea of disenchantment?<br>

Author(s): Tyree-Hageman Jennifer<br>
Abstract: This paper traces the development of the historical origins of an economic ethos and the groups that carried and transformed this ethos in two key economic sectors: first, Silicon Valley, and second, Wall Street. Financialization of the US economy is closely connected to a political logic that celebrated the capacity for the self-regulation of markets and condemned state intervention, bringing free-market thought to the fore. A growing body of sociological literature explains the rise of neoliberalism as an intellectual project, as a series of policy reforms, and as a form of politics. This dialogue has largely lacked sufficient critical analysis of whether a motivating ethos allowed market fundamentalism to emerge and take hold across different economic sectors. An analysis of the resurgence of free-market ideas in two important sectors of the US economy, informed by Weberian theory, reveals a distinct element, in this case an ethos, which itself motivates and sustains free-market thinking. In Silicon Valley and on Wall Street an economic ethos emerged from the structuring of ideas and ethics into specific historical contexts by distinct groups within each economic sector.<br>

Abstract: Cette étude se propose d'analyser certains aspects du soubassement historiographique de la pensée politique de François Guizot. S'il est certain que sa politique scolaire est largement fondée sur une vision progressiste de l'histoire, on n'a peutêtre pas assez souligné la part qui revient à la rhétorique dans l'élaboration de cette pensée du progrès. Ainsi, l'exposé de 1828 peut-il non seulement se lire comme un cours d'histoire, mais également s'entendre comme une injonction politique à effet immédiat. Le sens de cet article est de repérer les voies par lesquelles l'évocation du passé peut ainsi se conjuguer au présent. This paper intends to study some aspects of the historiographic fundaments of François Guizot's political thought. Surely enough, Guizot's educational policy was based on a progressist view of history but one has tended to overlook the part played by rhetorics in the elaboration of this view of progress. The 1828 account may be read as a lecture on history but may also be understood as a political injunction compelling immediate effects. The aim of this paper is to discover the ways through which the evocation of the past can thus be conjugated in the present tense.<br>

Abstract: The article comprises three parts. Part I contains an overview of the areas in the analysis of modern French philosophy that have been of the greatest relevance to Russian researchers over the last years. We conclude that numerous aspects of the French philosophical thought of the twentieth century are well represented in the research of Russian authors, who also point out the emerging trends in its development. Part II deals with the development of analytic philosophy in Russia within the framework of such areas as "critique of bourgeois philosophy", a purely ideological stand only nominally related to philosophy, logic, and the history of philosophy and theoretical research. Part III contains a periodization of the history of phenomenology in Russia, pointing out the most important achievements of the contemporary Russian scholars of phenomenology as well as their understanding of the essence, the problems, and the aims of phenomenological philosophy. We also indicate the tendencies within the development of the discipline in the Russian Federation.<br>

Abstract: See for instance Lire le Capital, I, pp. 47f, 169f. See also MansChot, op. cit.,
pp. IV—17, IV—21f. 'Not in the superstructure' does not mean here simply 'then
it is in the basis'. The 'problem' is that scientific thought, as thought, cannot be
put in the same category as material powers of production; cf. Lire le Capital,
p. 47 : 'Ce système de production théorique, système matériel autant que "spiri-
tuel"...'. Manschot admits 'that Althusser has not yet been able to develop a new
formulation of the problem of the relation science-society. Strictly speaking, he has
not got further than the assertion that the old notions of this relationship are no
longer tenable'. (IV—22).<br>

Abstract: For Dooyeweerd's conception of history, see in particular A New Critique, vol. 2, part 1,
chs. 3 and 4; see further his Roots of Western Culture, ch. 1, §§ 14-25; and In the Twilight of
Western Thought, chs. 3 and 4.
With regard to Vollenhoven's conception of history, see especially his Isagooge Philoso-
phiae, §§ 113-34, pp. 74-98. In 'Problemen van de tijd in onze kring' Vollenhoven notes that
he 'already in 1929 in a debate wih Dooyeweerd openly differed with him in opinion regard-
ing the modal character of history'. Naturally, it remains a question whether Dooyeweerd's
conception of history, substantively speaking, is not more than modal. In Dutch he preferred
to describe this modal history not as 'cultural development' but more broadly as 'development
of civilization' (beschavingsontwikkeling). Compare, e.g., A New Critique, vol. 1, pp. 267, 362-
65 with De Wijsbegeerte der Wetsidee, vol. 2, pp. 187, 296-300; see also p. 143.<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i24708591<br>
Date: 1 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Seerveld Calvin<br>
Abstract: I am open to David Carroll's considération that American 'deconstructionists' (and
those in art historical circles?) may have oversimplified Derrida's thought into a 'newer
form of new criticism' (in Paraesthetics, Foucault/Lyotard/Derrida ILondon:Methuen,
1987) pp.81-89). Yet even Carroll notes that 'a critical reading of Derrida should have as
one of its goals to make a practical criticism derived from Derrida's work very diflicult, if
not impossible to realize' (p.207 n.3). Possibly Derrida's disciples, like those of Dooye-
weerd or Dewey or Hegel, misrepresent his genius, but Derridean authority is constantly
invoked on the world academie circuit today for its assembly-line scholarship of profes-
sional articles which continue to marginalize both philosophical and literary criticism. So
there is more warrant than chagrin to André Lefevere's sardonic remark: 'To produce
more and more interprétations of texts that have been interpreted for centuries may
appear to be a trifle redundant, except that it is a matter of bread and butter for most
interpreters.... (quoting Vincent Leitch, Deconstructive Criticism, 1983) 'There can never
be <correct> or <objective> readings, only more or less energetic, interesting, careful or
pleasurable misreadings.' Often the same person who writes this kind of thing then goes
home and grades the 'misreadings' of others, so that they, too, can take their place within
the academy, or be denied it, as the case may be.' Lefevere, '"Beyond Interprétation" or
The Business of (Re)Writing,' in Comparative Literature Studies 24 (no. 1, 1987): 18.
William Rowe, however, asks for a patient, 'more internai' critical reading of Derrida's
nomadic no-position. Cf. 'Critical study of [Sander Griffioen'sl The Problem of Progress',
in Philosophia Reformata 55 (no. 1, 1990): 80-83.<br>

Abstract: The transcendental critique of theoretical thought as it was developed by Herman
Dooyeweerd can be seen as a particularization of a général reflective critique of experience.
This perspective implies that theoretical thought and everyday experience do not stand
opposite each other as 'Gegenstand-relation' versus 'subject-object relation', as in
Dooyeweerd. I hope to show elsewhere the structural affinity of these two.<br>

Abstract: On the "participation idea" see Steen, Structure, p. 209; on the collapse of structure into
direction see Ibid., p. 83, where Steen writes: "It might be said that structure tends to be
reduced to direction... Structure is transcendentally-directed meaning. Meaninglessness,
nothing, and meaning loss tend to occur when this direction is lost. The structure is almost its
pointing character." Steen finds in this state of affairs what he calls the "semi-contradictory
theme" in Dooyeweerd's thought.<br>

Abstract: Cooper (1989, 221) also comments on indications in Scripture that persons continue life
after death with a visible form of corporeality: the appearances of Samuel, Moses and Elijah.
With great reservation Cooper tends towards the view that these were visible manifestations of
energy, probably comparable to the ether-body in spiritism (and anthroposophy). Popma, who
also places great emphasis on the soul's continued temporal life after death, is more cautious
but he does refer to a continuation of the temporal function-cloak in some other, unknown
form. For Cooper this thought is an argument in favour of dualism (in view of the difference
between this energy-body and the ordinary earthly body). In Popma the idea of the
continuation of the function-cloak is meant as anti-dualistic argument.<br>

Abstract: Dieser Aufsatz greift auf die Forschungen des Altgermanisten Friedrich Ohly zurück, der die Geisteswissenschaften durch eine metaphern-orientierte Forschung neu stimulieren wollte: Metaphern, so Friedrich Ohly, seien nicht Restbestände, sondern Grundbestände menschlichen Lebens. Besonders die religiöse Sprache komme nicht ohne Metaphern aus. So sei die Beziehung zwischen Gott und den Menschen allein metaphorisch zu versprachlichen. Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird der metaphern-orientierte Zugang von Friedrich Ohly auf die Metapher „Gotteskind“ bzw. „Gotteskindschaft“ angewendet. Näherhin analysiert der Beitrag die Prägekraft der Metapher „Gotteskind“ bzw. „Gotteskindschaft“ mit Blick auf die Taufliturgie und die Tauftheologie der Alten Kirche. Unabhängig von seinem biologischen Alter – so geben sich die Jesus-Anhänger von Anfang an überzeugt – wird der Christ jung in der Taufe und bleibt jung, wenn er seine Taufberufung in Treue bewahrt. So seien als Schlüsselgedanken des vorliegenden Aufsatzes hervorgehoben: erstens die Taufe als geistliche Geburt und Anfang der Kindwerdung; zweitens die metaphorische Rede von der Taufeucharistie als Milch, welche als lebenslängliche geistliche Speise für die Gotteskinder gilt (1 Petr 2,2). This article examines the research of Friedrich Ohly, a medievalist who sought to stimulate spiritual understanding through thought which explored the significance of metaphor. For him, metaphors were not merely the remains, but parts of the active inventory of human life. Religious language, in particular, could not do without them. The relationship between God and man could be articulated only by metaphoric means. In this article Ohly's approach is applied to the metaphor of 'God's Child', or 'Divine Filiation'. The article seeks to analyse the power of the impression of the metaphor itself with a view to the baptismal liturgy and baptismal theology of the ancient Church. From the very beginning Christians had been convinced that new believers be~<br>

Abstract: La métaphore kantienne du « grand jeu de la vie », dont nous sommes tous partie prenante en tant que nous sommes citoyens du monde, obligés d'affronter les quatre questions fondamentales : « Que puis-je savoir? Que dois-je faire? Que m'est-il permis d'espérer? » et : « Qu'est-ce que l'homme? » qui, d'après Kant, récapitulent les grands intérêts de la raison humaine dans une optique cosmopolitique, cette métaphore nous offre un excellent fil conducteur pour analyser les rapports complexes entre religion et raison philosophique. Contrairement à ce que prétend la vulgate contemporaine, nous n'avons pas encore fini d'explorer la « fonction méta » en ses quatre dimensions essentielles de la « trans-ascendance », de la « trans-descendance », de la « trans-passibilité » et de la « trans-possibilité » qui, même si elles trouvent une expression différente dans le champ religieux et dans le champ de la réflexion philosophique, donnent infiniment à penser à la religion comme à la philosophie. Kant's metaphor of the "big game of life", to which all humans partake insofar as they are citizens of the world confronted with the four fundamental questions: "What can I know?, What ought I do?, What may I hope for?" and, last but not least: "What is man?", which according to Kant summarize the major interests of Human reason in a cosmo-political perspective, offers an excellent thread for analyzing the complex relationships between Religion and Philosophy. As opposed to what many contemporary thinkers pretend, we have not yet finished pondering the "metafunction" in its fourfold dimensions: "trans-ascendance", "transdescendance", "trans-passibility" and "trans-possibility" which, although they find a different expressions in the religious field and in the field of philosophical thought, invites to rethink both religion and philosophy.

Abstract: By inquiring into the translatability of Judaism and philosophy, we reawaken an ancient problem that asks after philosophy’s relation with religion:
         What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?Translation is a rejuvenated means of wrestling with this irksome question, which seeks to understand how multiple approaches to meaning and being can exist concurrently or whether any interaction forfeits multiplicity for the primacy of one form over all others. The specific issue that linguistic versions of the problem address is whether or not the languages that Judaism and philosophy speak are separate and distinct and if those distinctions are established on deeper, non-linguistic ground. For this reason, translation not only raises the problem of articulacy and context in interlingual translations, it also alludes to an ontological or metaphysical separation that speaks of different, non-shared worlds. Whether or not a translation theory addresses, repairs or upholds the opposition between religion and philosophy is in question, and translation becomes a vehicle for discussing what Jerusalem has to offer Athens and what Athens has for Jerusalem. In this essay, I examine the translation problem as an attempt to repair or re-gloss the relation between Judaism and philosophy by way of Michael Fagenblat’s recovery of Emmanuel Levinas’ thought in his work,A Covenant of Creatures: Levinas’s Philosophy of Judaism(2010).<br>

Abstract: The Schumann's sonata form (or sonata form-like) compositions little can be explained from the standpoint of tradition. Instead of classical dramatic contrasts, thematic action develops towards a definite goal. This type of musical narration often lasts to the end of the coda, in other cases the constant evolution of a thematic thought or the continual transformation of a motif receives the leading role. In order to obscure the essential events of the works or of the movements Schumann often employs "traditional" formal gestures. One of the most interesting is the repetition of a longer section in different keys, reminding of the exposition-recapitulation duality. The déjà vu feeling was generally one of the starting-point in Schumann's workshop to move away from traditional sonata procedures. Influenced by the narrative content of the works, various strategies were elaborated by him to excite the déjà vu, or to relive musical moments.<br>

Author(s): Morris Rosalind C.<br>
Abstract: This article considers the legacies of Jacques Derrida in and for Anglo-American sociocultural anthropology. It begins with a survey of Derrida's own engagement with themes that have historically been foundational to the field: (a) the critique of sign theory and, with it, the questions of language and law in Lévi-Straussian structuralism; (b) the question of the unconscious; (c) the critique of the performative and its consequences for the idea of ritual; (d) the rereading of Marcel Mauss's concept of the gift, and of economy more generally; and (e) the analysis of the metaphysical basis of law, in both religious and ostensibly secular formations. It then considers the state of the field at the time when it was being infused with different forms of poststructuralism and explores the competing claims made by these discourses in relation to deconstruction. Finally, after tracing the convergences and divergences between Derridean deconstruction and theory in sociocultural anthropology, it treats two main examples of works produced against and under the influence of Derrida's thought, respectively.<br>

Abstract: En s'appuyant sur un commentaire du texte de la première nuit du Kitāb al-Imtāʿ wa-l-muʾānasa d'Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī, cet article se propose de montrer la place primordiale qu'occupe la parole conversante (al-muḥādaṯa) dans la pensée arabe classique. La conversation, ḥadīṯ, constitue bien dans la culture arabe à la fois un paradigme épistémique dominant et un cadre généralisé d'expériences esthético-éthiques: la parole conversante fonctionne à la fois comme facteur de construction des contextes d'interaction au sein desquels se tissent les réseaux de sociabilité et d'échanges intellectuels fécondants (muqābasa), comme action cathartique qui libère l'âme et purifie l'esprit, comme facteur de sublimation et d'émancipation de la personne (ʿitq). Ainsi, l'analyse de toutes ces formes de manifestation de la parole conversante dans la champ de l'adab nous a permis d'aboutir à deux conclusions complémentaires: premièrement, selon la conception de la culture propre à la vision anthropologique inhérente au système de l'adab, la culture ne se transmet pas héréditairement, mais par fréquentation, interaction et contact entre personnes contemporaines. Deuxièmement, l'adīb véritable, tel que nous en avons un exemple vivant dans la figure d'al-Tawḥīdī, est celui qui se montre capable de créer et prendre en charge les occasions de sociabilité et d'échanges permettant aux individus d'une même époque de s'insérer dans le tissu de la contemporanéité concrète et de s'influencer et se cultiver les uns les autres. /// Based on a commentary of the first night in Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī's Kitāb al-Imtāʿ wa-l-muʾānasa, the purpose of this article is to show the essential place held by conversing speech (al-muḥādaṯa) in classical Arabic thought. In Arabic culture, conversation (ḥadīṯ) represents indeed both a dominant and epistemic paradigm and a generalized ethical-aesthetic frame of experiences: i. e. conversing speech works at the same time as a building factor of interacting contexts in ~<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>

Author(s): McDonald Peter D.<br>
Abstract: The continuing fallout from the theory wars, evident not least in the nostalgic after-theory narrative that is still in vogue, has dissipated critical energy in contemporary literary studies. Rejecting that narrative, this essay calls for a review of the legacy of theory and the polemical oppositions that set it against other scholarly enterprises, like book history. In particular, it suggests that the theoretical interrogation of the category of literature in the past forty years fruitfully intersects with book history's investigation of the material conditions of literary production, opening up new possibilities for literary historiography, while also imposing new demands on it. The essay identifies two traditions of antiessentialist thought (the skeptical and the enchanted), considers the ontology of the printed literary text, and examines the legacies of, among others, Jacques Derrida and Pierre Bourdieu.<br>

Abstract: Agamben on the function of the pronoun in medieval grammatical thought:
"Inasmuch as it contains both a particular mode of signification and an indicative act, the
pronoun is that part of speech in which the passage from signifying to demonstrating is
enacted: pure being, the substantia indeterminata that it signifies and that, as such, is not in
itself signifiable or definable, becomes signifiable and determinable through an act of 'indi-
cation'" (31/22).<br>

Abstract: Alberto Guerreiro Ramos's intellectual trajectory is analyzed to show his permanent concern with the condition of contemporary humanity. Two moments in his trajectory are specifically addressed. In the first, under the strong influence of Christian intellectual thought, the category of human person was most important to him. In the second moment he sought to demonstrate autonomy from those earlier influences, secularized his thought, and coined the expression Parenthetical Man, which was central to his criticism of the social sciences and especially of organizational theory. From this he proposed his theory of social system delimitation. From this point of view, it is possible to affirm that Guerreiro Ramos's sociology is predominantly antropocentric, in other words, Ramos takes man as the main reference in his design of social systems.<br>

Author(s): Buttimer Anne<br>
Abstract: Recent attempts by geographers to explore the human experience of space have focused on overt behavior and its cognitive foundations. The language and style of our descriptions, however, often fail to speak in categories appropriate for the elucidation of lived experience, and we need to evaluate our modes of knowing in the light of modes of being in the everyday world. Phenomenologists provide some guidelines for this task. They point to the preconsciously given aspects of behavior and perception residing in the "lifeworld"-the culturally defined spatiotemporal setting or horizon of everyday life. Scientific procedures which separate "subjects" and "objects," thought and action, people and environments are inadequate to investigate this lifeworld. The phenomenological approach ideally should allow lifeworld to reveal itself in its own terms. In practice, however, phenomenological descriptions remain opaque to the functional dynamism of spatial systems, just as geographical descriptions of space have neglected many facets of human experience. There are certain avenues for dialogue between these two disciplines in three major research areas: the sense of place, social space, and time-space rhythms. Such a dialogue could contribute to a more humanistic foundation for human geography.<br>

Author(s): Dalissier Michel<br>
Abstract: This paper is the second part of a general study on the relationship between Nishida and Chinese philosophy. In the first, I explored the extent to which Nishida's philosophy was influenced, directly and indirectly, explicitly and implicitly, historically and conceptually, by materials coming from the intellectual horizon of Chinese thought. I concentrate here on Nishida's own position toward what he understood by "Chinese philosophy." Is this philosophy, so suggestive for Nishida, promoted to a central place in his work or not, and if so, in what sense might we take this idea of "centrality" as specifically Chinese? In setting forth several archetypes of Chinese thought present in Nishida's philosophy, the focus of this article falls on the methodological, logical and metaphysical contrasts we can identify between the Japanese philosopher and Chinese philosophy as his underground intellectual sources. 本稿は、筆者による西田幾多郎と中国哲学との関係を考察した研究論文の続編にあたる。前編の “Nishida Kitarō and Chinese Philosophy”は、西田哲学がどれだけの直接的もしくは間接的、明示的もしくは暗示的、歴史的もしくは概念的な影響を中国思想の知的土壊を基盤とする史料や人物から受けたかを考究したものである。続編である本稿では、西田が理解するところの中国哲学に対する西田自身の姿勢に焦点を絞る。この中国哲学なるものが西田の著作のなかで中心的な位置を占めているのかどうか、そうであるとするならば、この「中心」なる慨念を我々はどう理解すれば良いのか。本稿では、西田哲学に現れる中国思想の複数の原型を提示するとともに、西田という日本の哲学者と彼の知的背景としての中国哲学との間に認識できる、方法論的、論理的、形而上学的な対照に光を当てるものである。<br>

Abstract: How does international interaction shape states' patterns of thought, emotion, and action? This paper examines the processes by which motives and practices feed each other in reproducing historical structures. An artificial intelligence model defines state-subjects as cultures combining special meanings that produce causal attribution, state self-identification, emotions, and action motives. These special meanings are built from subjective cultural categories describing social acts and group character of the self and others. Anger, pride, fear, and relief motivate action. A collection of such subject-cultures may produce a pattern of actions that reiterates the cultures. The model discriminates between those combinations of elements in special meanings which reproduce subjects and historical structures, and those which do not. The meanings discovered in such reproduction analysis can be validated by discourse analysis.<br>

Abstract: See Quentin Skinner, On Justice, The Common Good and Liberty', in Dimensions of
Radical Democracy: Pluralism, Citizenship, Community, ed. Chantai Mouffe (London,
1992). Skinner and Pocock have been especially influential of course in bringing the
republican tradition into greater focus over the last few years. Given the complicated
history of the relations between liberal and republican thought that they so well document,
it is nicely ironic that they seek to attack versions of modern liberalism with weapons taken
from a tradition so deeply, if ambiguously, implicated in its development. It is also worth
pointing out here, however, that 'republicanism' as such has also been 'revived' (if that is
quite the word) by some scholars who hardy share either the methodological or the
normative agenda's of the Cambridge school, to wit some of the friends and allies of Leo
Strauss, especially Harvey Mansfield and Thomas Pangle (see, for example, Mansfield's
Taming the Prince: The Ambivalence of Modern Executive Power (Baltimore, 1989) and
Pangle's The Spirit of Modern Republicanism (Chicago, 1988)). I do not propose to argue
the toss between the Cambridge school and Straussian versions of 'republicanism' here, I
merely point out that this is contested ground.<br>

Abstract: Many Natural Law theorists thought that God could not rightly violate or alter
principles of justice, but argued instead that there must be independent moral grounds to
which even God would have to appeal for justification. Hugo Grotius expressed an early
form of the idea in 1625, in the Prolegomena to his De lure Belli ac Pads. Other Natural
Law theorists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, who expounded variations of
the doctrine, include Samuel von Pufendorf (De lure Nature et Gentium Librii Octo,
1672), Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui (Principes du droit naturel, 1747), and Emerich de
Vattel (Le Droit des Gens, 1758). See A.P. d'Entrèves, Natural Law (London, 1951),
ch. 3; cf. Voltaire, 'Remerciement sincère à un homme charitable', in Vol. V of
Montesquieu's De l'Esprit des lois (Paris, 1816 [1750]), pp. 257-62. See also John

Abstract: In 2008, as a follow-up to the initiative taken the previous year, ISRE – Istituto Superiore Regionale Etnografico
         [Superior Regional Ethnographic Institute]organized the seminarGramsci ritrovato, tra Cirese e i Cultural Studies(Nuoro, October 24th- 25th, 2008)[Gramsci rediscovered: between Cirese and the Cultural Studies]. The seminar focused on another ‘find’: the readings of Gramsci’s works on folklore that Cirese had elaborated thirty-eight years before. The idea came from Giorgio Baratta, who – in hisGramsci in contrappunto [Gramsci in counterpoint](Carocci 2008) – has given special attention to an analysis of Cirese’s essayConcezioni del mondo, filosofia spontanea e istinto di classe nelle “Osservazioni sul folklore” di Antonio Gramsci [World Views, Spontaneous Philosophy and Class Instinct in the “Observations On Folklore” by Antonio Gramsci](1970). Giulio Angioni’s and Pietro Clemente’s contributions – coming, in part, from an intellectual autobiography standpoint (they both have been Cirese’s students at first, and his colleagues later) – helped elucidate the method and the contents of Cirese’s work. They also dealt with Gramsci, in order to theoretically reconstruct the foundations of Italian folklore studies between the Sixties and the Seventies of XX Century. Baratta’s renewed reading, a part of which we here republish, together with Brigitte Wagner’s contribution (dedicated to the issue of the feasibility of translations of languages and cultures), give evidence to the prospect of a vitality of Cirese’s critical work outside the usual context of Italian folklore studies. Prospect and vitality that have been demonstrated by Cirese himself, who, during the 2008 seminar in Nuoro, was a protagonist of the dialogue with other scholars as well as with the public that intervened in the debate. He was a generous testimony of the large spectrum of his interests, mostly methodological, and he very carefully underlined, with respect to Gramsci, two aspect~<br>

Article Title: Between Discourse and Experience: Agency and Ideas in the French Pre-Revolution<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i345910<br>
Date: 12 1, 1756<br>
Author(s): Tulard Jay M.<br>
Abstract: Experience has recently reemerged as an important analytical category for historians of the Old Regime and the French Revolution. Reacting against the perceived excesses of discourse analysis, which made political language independent of any social determinants, certain post-revisionists are now seeking to contextualize political language by relating it to the experience of those who use it. Political agency, in these analyses, is understood to be the effect of particular formative experiences. This article suggests that the search for an experiential antidote to discourse is misconceived because it perpetuates an untenable dichotomy between thought and reality. Access to the phenomenon of historical agency should be pursued not through experience or discourse but through the category of consciousness, since the make-up of the subject's consciousness determines how he/she engages the world and decides to attempt changing it. After a brief discussion of an important study that exemplifies both the allure and the functionality of the notion of experience, Timothy Tackett's Becoming a Revolutionary, the article focuses on the evolving political consciousness of a man who became a revolutionary agitator in 1789, J.-M.-A. Servan. Analysis of his writings between 1770 and 1789 shows that the way in which his perspective was constructed, rather than the lessons of experience per se, determined the shape of his revolutionary intentions in 1789.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i327931<br>

Author(s): Crocker J. Christopher<br>
Abstract: Anthropologists have overlooked the importance of the metaphor in human culture. Core etaphors can help us identify ultimate cosmic constructs underlying a given social or religious world view. But, even more centrally, metaphors can serve as key data in our attempts to understand how a cultural system adapts to and incorporates sensated experience from the physical world. Metaphors thus provide both a "reality" principle and a "tool" for change. Their special status rests on the way in which a metaphor moves between two different types of thought (Fernandez, CA, 1974). A variety of comments which E. R. Leach and C. Levi-Strauss have made on this issue are summarized, and it is pointed out that both men have underestimated the possibilities for images to develop meaning at the level of affect and motor experience alone, without recourse to opposition or to categorical contrast. Along similar lines, it is argued that many authors mistakenly attempt to isolate metaphoric from metonymic thought. This is taken as a false problem, and the continuity of a process which uses both paradigm contrast and analogic continuity is seen as fundamental. The paper concludes by suggesting that the contemporary theological and anthropological approaches to metaphor are roughly complementary. It is hoped that they will come to interact. Fernandez's article is seen as a useful step in this direction.<br>

Abstract: I use an old observation (that religion is anthropomorphistic) to solve a problem almost as old (why do people have religious beliefs?) by arguing that religion is a special case of the more general phenomenon of anthropomorphism. This view suggests that religious belief, often thought nonempirical and cognitively anomalous, is as much based in experience as is nonreligious belief and that it consists in a plausible application of significant models to ambiguous phenomena. Anthropomorphism, often thought a cognitive aberration, appears to me both reasonable and inevitable, although by definition mistaken. On this argument, religious models of and for the world differ in content from nonreligious models but are epistemologically similar to them.<br>

Author(s): DiCenso James<br>
Abstract: This paper engages Freud's relation to Kant, with specific reference to each theorist's articulation of the interconnections between ethics and religion. I argue that there is in fact a constructive approach to ethics and religion in Freud's thought, and that this approach can be better understood by examining it in relation to Kant's formulations on these topics. Freud's thinking about religion and ethics participates in the Enlightenment heritage, with its emphasis on autonomy and rationality, of which Kant's model of practical reason is in many ways exemplary. At the same time, Freud advances Kantian thinking in certain important respects; his work offers a more somatically, socially, and historically grounded approach to the formation of rational and ethical capacities, and hence makes it more compatible with contemporary concerns and orientations that eschew the pitfalls of ahistorical idealist orientations.<br>

Abstract: Beginning with an exemplary case study, this paper diagnoses and analyses some important strategies of evasion and factors of hindrance that are met in the teaching of medical ethics to undergraduate medical students. Some of these inhibitions are inherent to ethical theories; others are connected with the nature of medicine or cultural trends. It is argued that in order to avoid an attitude of evasion in medical ethics teaching, a philosophical theory of emotions is needed that is able to clarify on a conceptual level the ethical importance of emotions. An approach is proposed with the help of the emotion theory Martha Nussbaum works out in her book Upheavals of thought. The paper ends with some practical recommendations.<br>

Abstract: Régulièrement proclamés partout dans le monde, la liberté d'expression et le pluralisme de la presse sont considérés comme des instruments de mesure démocratique. Seulement en France, où le journaliste porte dans son hérédité la tradition littéraire du débat d'idées, la diversité des opinions tend à se réduire. La déontologie professionnelle est associée à des dispositifs visant à établir l'objectivité – procédés linguistiques, recours systématique à des études sociologiques – dont les effets sont souvent de restreindre le jugement ou du moins de le conformer à des faits « scientifiquement » établis. L'observation, l'intuition, l'enquête sont ainsi supplantées par des protocoles qui agissent comme des écrans dans la démocratie d'opinion. Alors même que l'on continue d'accuser les médias de manipulation, la production endogène d'une pensée commune est une des raisons de sa perte d'influence. Generally claimed around the world, freedom of speech and press pluralism are considered as instruments of democratic measure. However in France where the journalist has in his heredity the literary tradition of ideologic debates, the diversity of opinions is lowering. Professional deontology is linked with rhetoric devices – linguistic process, resort to sociological inquiries – whose effects are often to refrein assesments or to produce them, according to « scientifically » set up items. Investigation, intuition, clearsightedness are overlapped by procedures which appear as screens in relationship to the public opinion. Even if the media are accused of manipulation, the endogeneous production of a commun thought is one of the reasons of their lack of influence.<br>

rente. Elle nous apparaît parfois comme illogique et en soi contradictoire. En
Inde, par exemple, bien que le temps soit conçu et vécu comme statique,
existe l'idée — surtout dans la religion bouddhiste, que les bonnes actions
sont récompensées et donc qu'il existe une chaîne de causalité morale. Si le
destin ultime de l'homme c'est un nirvana hors du temps, ce n'est
qu'après le parcours du karma et du samsara, deux doctrines s urs des renais-
sances (d'après E. Conze, Buddhist Thought in India, London, Allen & Unwin,
1962, pp. 50-59, et S. G. F. Brandon, Man and His destiny in the Great Reli-
gions, Manchester Univ. Press, 1962, p. 101 sq.)<br>

Article Title: Arendt on Narrative Theory and Practice<br>
Publisher: West Chester University<br>
Issue: i27917777<br>
Date: 12 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Speight Allen<br>
Abstract: This article explores Arendt's approach to narrative in theory as well as practice. The first part looks at Arendt's use of philosophical sources from the tradition—Aristotle, Augustine and Hegel—with an eye to how her appropriation of these figures differs from that of contemporary philosophers of narrative. Three of Arendt's typically bold and rich claims about narrative action emerge as important: the notion of action as revealing an agent's own daimõn; the condition that such action be revealable within a world or shared public space which has resilience yet vulnerability; and the potential for agents revealed within such a world to discover some form of narrative rebirth in their efforts at story-telling. The second section examines the extent to which Arendt herself allowed those claims to be tested and thought through in her own attempts (in Men in Dark Times, Rahel Varnhagen and elsewhere) at constructing biographical narratives<br>

Article Title: Tillich['s] Remains...<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion, Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i27919256<br>
Date: 12 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Smith Jonathan Z.<br>
Abstract: This essay makes explicit what lay behind the author's earlier casual observation that "Tillich remains the unacknowledged theoretician of our entire enterprise"—whether in the AAR or in North American studies of religion more generally. While the article does not make a narrowly (i.e., archivally verified) causal claim about Tillich's influence on the study of religion in the academy, it does point out three crucial roles Tillich's thought and practice played in the development of North American religious studies. (i) Tillich's understanding of religion as an "ultimate concern" provided a language deemed suitable to the new departments of religious studies in this country's higher education institutions (especially at state-run colleges and universities). (ii) Though not uniquely formative of the academy's longstanding discourse on symbolism, Tillich's interest in the symbol served as a legitimating vote of confidence about the worth of that discourse. Moreover, his understanding of the symbol (as that which "points to") ostensibly struck a balance between Eliade's onto-realistic and Geertz's more minimal fictive views of the symbol. (iii) Through his sustained interest in cultural institutions and products of cultural labor—more than through his theories about the relation between religion and culture (e.g., his method of correlation)—Tillich inspired the "dialogic fields" (e.g., Religion and Literature) and subsequent cultural and anthropological studies of religion. The author's earlier claim, then, was intended as a double critique: first, that the study of religion in secular public institutions should ground itself in a Protestant Christian theological project; second, that this influence should remain largely unacknowledged.<br>

Author(s): Sobel Richard<br>
Abstract: Quels rapports peuvent se nouer entre travail et liberté, dès lors que le travail n'est plus essentiellement vécu comme la marque sociale de l'aliénation de la liberté dans l'économie? C'est Marx qui élabore pour la première fois et avec beaucoup de rigueur cette question, en formulant la théorie des deux règnes, celui de la nécessité et celui de la liberté dans le cadre de l'utopie communiste. Pour autant, sa position du problème n'est pas sans maintenir toute une série d'ambiguïtés. En nous appuyant sur les analyses contrastées de Simone Weil et d'André Gorz, nous montrons la dépendance de toute pensée de l'émancipation vis-à-vis d'une philosophie de la liberté qui assume (Gorz) ou qui n'assume pas (Weil) une certaine épaisseur irréductible de tout collectif humain, c'est-à-dire une indépassable hétéronomie de la condition humaine. What sort of connections can be formed between work and freedom, since the work is not essentially lived any more as the social mark of the alienation of the freedom in the economy? It is Marx who elaborates for the first time this problem by formulating the theory of both reigns, the reign of the necessity and the reign of the freedom, within the framework of the communist utopia. For all that, his position of the problem is not without maintaining a whole series of ambiguities. By pressing us on the analyses of Simone Weil and André Gorz, we show the dependence of any thought of emancipation towards a philosophy of the freedom which assumes (Gorz) or which does not assume (Weil) a certain inflexible thickness of any human collective.<br>

Abstract: This essay deals with the relation between magic and the nature of words and things. On the one hand, it considers the ways that words confine and direct thought and desire; on the other hand it deals with how the undeniable essence of things provides both limits and reasons for the ways we think. Drawing on these properties of words and objects, magic can be appreciated as a creative and innovative feature of thinking more complex than earlier writers have claimed.<br>

Author(s): Messick Brinkley<br>
Abstract: Muftis are literate scholars who specialise in Muslim legal-religious interpretation. They provide an example of a higher level of systematic indigenous interpretation than the common sense, everyday constructions of reality that have been discussed in anthropological accounts. I discuss the institutional form of the muftiship, and contrast it with the judgeship, with reference to indigenous ideal-types found in several categories of written Muslim social thought. This ideal form is then compared with the identities of historical and contemporary muftis in Yemen. The interpretive method employed by muftis joins a Greek-derived concept of analogy with recitation and hermeneutics. While their method is structurally similar to scriptural interpretation, muftis are worldly interpreters who address practical life problems posed by lay questioners.<br>

Abstract: Archaeologists have tried to reconstruct patterns of thought, meaning, and ideas, using theories of structuralism, cognition, and ideology. Case studies involving each of the theories are described, and the strengths and weakness of their application to archaeological data are presented. Structuralism is found to yield substantial examples with well-worked treatments of archaeological data. These examples tend to ignore economic context, however. Materialism, especially neo-Marxism, contains thorough definitions of ideology that may be useful to archaeology because they preserve economic context. However, such definitions are new to the field and presently offer few well-worked examples of how to handle archaeological data.<br>

Publisher: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland<br>
Issue: i330183<br>
Date: 3 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Ohnuki-Tierney Emiko<br>
Abstract: Most symbols are polytropic as well as polysemic in that their multiple meanings in various contexts functions as different types ot trope. This article pursues the complex nature of polytropes through a formulation of synecdoche as an interstitial trope between metaphor and metonymy, and demonstrates how the two conceptual principles of analogy and contiguity, that define metaphor and metonymy respectively, are interdependent and interpenetrated, rather than of basically different natures as presented in the biaxial image of structural linguistics. The analogic thought expressed in methaphor involves movement and temporality, just as does the discursive thought of metonymy. The interpenetration of the two modes of thought is demostrated through an analysis of the process of objectification of what, throughout history, has been a dominant symbol of self in Japanese culture: the monkey. As a polysemic and polytropic symbol, the monkey takes on different meanings, and functions as different tropic types, sequentially or simultaneously, as actors use and/or interpret the symbol in varying historical and social contexts.<br>

Abstract: This Note reviews shortcomings and claims of discourse analysis (DA). In particular, it focuses on the relationship between DA and reflexivity. It argues that DA could not succeed as its supporters originally thought, because DA has not dealt adequately with the issue of reflexivity. Even now that has turned to such issues, DA has a limited interpretation of reflexivity that is related to the change in sociological focus from scientific beliefs and knowledge to the study of texts for texts' sake.<br>

Abstract: Before World War II the intellectual climate of American sociology was congenial to the growth of a sociology of knowledge akin to Mannheim's. Yet in the postwar period American sociologists committed themselves to ahistorical theory, positivist methodology, and team research; their "scientistic" sociology did not permit the historicism, relativism, and holism necessary to Mannheimian analysis. Currently, however, convergent trends in a number of disciplines--not only sociology but also philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, and the histories of ideas, science, and art--favor a revival of the Mannheimian program. Analysts of culture now seek to integrate the sociological goals of "explanation" and "understanding"--the formulation of quasi-laws of behavior, based on identification of the social structural elements of culture production, and the interpretation of the subjective meaning of culture, based on recovery of actors' intentions. Their research program requires investigation of the peculiar sociohistorical circumstances that condition actors' perceptions, necessitating attention to the cognitive content of culture. This article surveys both the theoretical justifications for such a research program and recent exemplifications of it, focusing on anlyses of what Mannheim termed "objective culture"--such symbolic vehicles for conceptions as religion, the arts, science, and political thought that acquire independent existence, becoming subject to diverse interpretations.<br>

Abstract: Sigmund Freud's work continues to attract interest from philosophers, analysts and historians, and the earliest formulation of his theory of the unconscious and the 'seduction hypothesis' have recently received particular attention. While Freud's intellectual debt to such figures as Darwin, Nietzsche, Helmholtz and Brücke has been well documented, the influence of Heinrich Schliemann on him and his work is little known. The purpose of this paper is to explore the ways in which Schliemann's work helped Freud fashion himself as an 'archaeologist of the mind' and how, in the crucial year 1896, it enabled him to construct and present his new ideas. The paper also explores Freud's interest in collecting and suggests how and why Freud's debts to archaeology are not, as commonly thought, visible in the so-called 'archaeological metaphor of mind', but present in other areas of his life and writing.<br>

Author(s): Statkiewicz Max<br>
Abstract: The article resituates Ricur's theory of métaphore vive in the contemporary context of the so-called "cognitive revolution." The latter denomination is highly misleading. There is nothing revolutionary about the cognitivist study of metaphor as a general pattern of thought; just like the discipline of rhetoric that was already on the decline in l8th century Europe, it is conservative in its validation of everyday, ideologically charged language as the model for all language, including that of poetry and art. Riceur’s conception of "live metaphor," on the other hand, does justice to the "revolutionary" character of poetic language, its function of breaking the order of "commonplaces we live by"—and are ruled by. A "poem in miniature," metaphor constitutes the model for any "poietic," creative imagination. Resulting from a clash, disturbing the common everyday language, live metaphor (and poetry in general) projects a world in such a way as to render strange and thus question the world we live in.<br>

Author(s): Rhodes Robert F.<br>
Abstract: The place of narrative in organizing our experience in the world has been the topic of much discussion in recent years. This paper starts from the position developed by the psychologist Jerome Bruner, who argues that there are two distinct modes of thought, the paradigmatic (or logico-scientific) and the narrative, and that they are equally important in ordering experience and constructing meaning. Texts written in both of these modes were crucial in the establishment of Pure Land Buddhism in Japan during the Heian Period. The Ōjōyōshū, written by Genshin in 985, is perhaps the single most important text in the development of this form of Buddhism in Japan, but insofar as it presents a systematic and comprehensive outline of Pure Land cosmology, doctrine, and practice, it is an example of a text written in the paradigmatic mode. But another text from this period written in the narrative mode, the Nihon Ōjō Gokuraku-ki by Yoshishige no Yasutane, played an equally important role in the spread of Pure Land Buddhism. This text is a collection of forty-two brief biographies of people believed to have been born in the Pure Land. These biographies serve both to "prove" that the Pure Land really exists and provide us with models with which to fashion our lives so we can gain birth in the Pure Land.<br>

Abstract: Mansell, in "Metaphor as Matter," writes, "It has been observed that metaphor seems always to
mean something that could (albeit with difficulty) be translated into a statement.... But metaphor
will never come into its own so long as it is thought of in this way. Interpretation actually leads away
from metaphor's strength" (p. 112).

Abstract: J.G.A. Pocock writes: "It has been established that a political culture took shape
in the eighteenth-century colonies which possessed all the characteristics of a neo-Har-
ringtonian civic humanism. Anglophone civilization seems. . . to present the picture of
a number of variants of this culture-English, Scottish, Anglo-Irish, New England, Penn-
sylvanian and Virginian, to look no further-distributed around the Atlantic shores. The
Whig canon and the neo-Harringtonians, Milton, Harrington and Sidney, Trenchrad,
Gordon and Bolingbroke, together with the Greek, Roman, and Renaissance masters of
the tradition as far as values and concepts were ... a civic and patriot ideal in which per-
sonality was founded in property, perfected in citizenship, but perpetually threatened by
corruption." The Machiavellian Moment: Florentine Political Thought and the Atlantic

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.<br>
Issue: i360632<br>

Author(s): Tobias Arati<br>
Abstract: The combined works of John Dewey and Jerome Bruner provide a framework spanning a century of educational thought which can inform curriculum decisions concerning students' educational development, especially for middle school students whose waning of motivation toward school has been well documented by researchers and has long concerned parents and teachers. This framework, combined with recent contributions of motivation and interest researchers, can create broad understandings of how to collaboratively construct effective educational contexts. As early as 1913, Dewey specifically looked at the pivotal role of students' genuine interests in Interest and Effort in Education. Our current research focus on how students' interest can inform curricular contexts marks the recent shift showing an increased use of interest in education research since 1990. In this article, we discuss our study of a team-taught double classroom of sixth grade students whose interests were determined through a series of brainstorming sessions, and individual and focus group interviews. Students' interests fell into six categories centering around subject areas such as Drama, Science, and Animal Studies. Learning contexts were constructed around four of these subject areas. Students participated in their first or second choice of subject area group. We found significantly higher scores on measures of Affect and Activation if students participated in their first choice group. We found intra-group unities of preferred and dispreferred ways of learning which distinguished each group from the class as a whole. Finally, our findings indicated that students reliably described their genuine interests over time. Students' interests were found to be effective tools for informing curriculum decisions in the creation of sixth grade learning contexts.<br>

want to find out what really happened, we must study how people thought these events were linked
to one another and how the thoughts of how events are linked changed [from era to era]" (192-93)

Abstract: Nous tentons de clarifier la place de la normativité dans une approche phénoménologique du politique en analysant l'opposition de la philosophie des droits de l'homme d'inspiration kantienne de Luc Ferry et Alain Renaut à la réflexion de type phénoménologique de Claude Lefort. Le projet de Lefort consiste d'abord en une tentative d'élucidation du réel et non de justification de principes. Mais la dimension normative n'en demeure pas absente puisque Lefort conçoit les droits de l'homme tant comme un phénomène du politique que comme signes de la liberté qu'il recherche dans la démocratie. Y a-t-il là nécessairement incohérence? /// Can a phenomenological analysis of political reality tackle the issue of norms? We try to answer this question through an analysis of the opposition between Luc Ferry and Alain Renaut's Kantian philosophy of human rights and the phenomenological approach of Claude Lefort. Lefort's project is an attempt to elucidate reality and not to justify principles. But the normative dimension is not entirely absent from his thought. Lefort conceives of human rights not only as a political phenomenon but also as a sign of liberty, which he supports. Is this inconsistent with the nature of his phenomenological project?<br>

Abstract: Alors que de nombreuses réflexions ont été menées concernant le recueil des biographies ou le recueil des données statistiques longitudinales, fort peu a été écrit concernant la mise en œuvre de leur interprétation. Or, l'unité de ce champ de recherche repose précisément, d'après les auteurs, sur les principes spécifiques d'intelligibilité du social produits par l'interprétation des parcours de vie. Dans cette perspective, ils subordonnent la démarche fondée sur la distinction entre approches objectivantes " balistiques " et approches fondées sur le sens construit par les acteurs à une démarche fondée sur l'élaboration de formes temporelles de la causalité. Ils distinguent trois modèles de base: un modèle archéologique, un modèle centré sur les cheminements, un modèle structurel. /// Deep thought has already been given to the filing of biographies and longitudinal statistics, whereas, little has been written about the actual use of these interpretations. According to the authors, unity in this field lies in the specific principles of social intelligibility produced by the interpretation of the paths of life. With this in view, the process based on the distinction between objectivizing " ballistic " approaches and those based on actor-built meaning are subordinated to a process based on the elaboration of temporal forms of causality. Three basic models are made distinct: an archaeological model, a model axed on itineraries and a structural model. /// Wenn einerseits zahlreiche Ueberlegungen zur Sammlung von Biographien oder statistischen Längsschnittsdaten vorliegen, so muss andererseits festgestellt werden, dass wenig geschrieben wurde zur Handhabung ihrer Interpretation. Die Einheitlichkeit dieses Forschungsfeldes beruht jedoch gerade, wie die Autoren meinen, auf den spezifischen Grundlagen der Vertändlichkeit des Sozialen, als Produkt der Interpretation von Lebenswegen. In dieser Hinsicht wird die Vorgehensweise, die auf der Unterscheidung fusst zwischen " ballist~<br>

Date: 7 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Yeats Paul F.<br>
Abstract: The apex of American legal thought is embodied in two types of writings: the federal appellate opinion and the law review article. In this Article, the author criticizes the whole enterprise of doctrinal constitutional law scholarship, using a recent U.S. Supreme Court case and a Harvard Law Review article as quintessential examples of the dominant genre. In a rhetorical tour de force, the author argues that most of modern constitutional scholarship is really advocacy in the guise of scholarship. Such an approach to legal scholarship may have some merit as a strategic move towards a political end; however, it has little value as scholarship, the goal of which is to seek truth. As a formerly monolithic legal system becomes more culturally heterogeneous, judges and academics no longer share as many assumptions about social truth. Hence, they have an increasing need to mask political judgments in order to avoid the contentious political battles that this increased diversity produces. Legal academia's present obsession with defending constitutional law as something more than an ad hoc rationalization of what are essentially political choices suggests that the present genre of constitutional scholarship may well have outlived its usefulness as a discursive form.<br>

Abstract: What is the connection between modern democratic thought and globalization? This article examines the rationale behind the present crisis of democracy. It demonstrates that the problem facing modern democratic thought has less to do with the asymmetries associated with the forces of globalization and more to do with an asymmetry within popular sovereignty itself: the fact that the boundaries of democracy cannot themselves be democratically legitimated. By making this argument the article seeks to move beyond the contemporary opposition between nationalism and cosmopolitanism. It shows that the appeal to globalization among contemporary political theorists to a large extent is analogous to the appeal to the nation during the French Revolution.<br>

Author(s): Pinnock Sarah K.<br>
Abstract: Christian Holocaust scholars insist that historical atrocity should catalyze religious change. Many established Holocaust theologians presume that the antidote to anti-Judaism involves identifying an authentic version of Christian faith lacking moral blemish. However, recent responses tend to view the Bible and the Christian tradition as irreducibly ambiguous. These new responses foreground perpetrator perspectives and correlate developments in theological reflection with evolving public Holocaust representations. They are distinctive in advocating careful examination of biographical connections to the Holocaust, including family, religious, and national identification. In significant ways, emphasis on ambiguity in recent Christian Holocaust thought provides critical leverage on the redemptive tendencies of popular Holocaust remembrance in the United States.<br>

Article Title: The Misfortune of the Happy: Levinas and the Ethical Dimensions of Desire<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000901<br>
Date: 9 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Ferreira M. Jamie<br>
Abstract: Levinas himself raises the question: "why would I feel responsible in the presence of the Face" since "we are separate ontological beings?" This questions the character of our response to the other--both in terms of agency and motivation. While the general reception of Levinas's thought has focused on his description of us as "hostage"--that is, on the moment of assignation (or assignment) by the other--I suggest that Levinas himself also, though not as directly, addresses (as he needs to) the correlative moment, the moment of response. My essay reconstructs Levinas's implicit understanding of the character of our initiative in the light of his concept of Desire. I explore the different dimensions of Desire as appetite and generosity, and I argue that the "transition to moral consciousness" that Levinas wants to "justify" is one from complacent happiness to "non-complacent happiness" and can be illuminated by the notion of "passion seeking its downfall."<br>

Article Title: A Preface to Ethics: Global Dynamics and the Integrity of Life<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000937<br>
Date: 4 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: This essay outlines a new preface for ethics demanded by the massive developments of the global age. It does so in and through the comparative use of "myths" to explicate the lived structure of experience. The essay begins by isolating main features of global dynamics, including proximity, the compression of the world and the expansion of consciousness, and also global, cultural reflexivity. In the second step of the "preface," it is argued that globality itself is a moral space in which peoples must orient their lives. It is a moral space defined by the massive extension of human power in the modern world. In light of the challenge that global dynamics and the extension of human power now pose, the essay then isolates, methodologically, options for developing a global ethics, and advocates a distinctly hermeneutical approach. This approach is practiced in the last section of the "preface" by engaging ethically the biblical "myth" of creation and its reinterpretation in an epitome of Jesus's Torah teaching. The intention is to show how current religious thought can speak to massive challenges in a distinctive way. It is, again, to offer a preface to ethics.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000938<br>
Date: 7 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Nussbaum Martha<br>
Abstract: In "Upheavals of Thought", Martha Nussbaum offers a theory of the emotions. She argues that emotions are best conceived as thoughts, and she argues that emotion-thoughts can make valuable contributions to the moral life. She develops extensive accounts of compassion and erotic love as thoughts that are of great moral import. This paper seeks to elucidate what it means, for Nussbaum, to say that emotions are forms of thought. It raises critical questions about her conception of the structure of emotion, and about her conception of compassion, in particular. Finally, the paper seeks to show how analyzing the structure, as well as the moral value, of the emotions ultimately requires entering the realm of religious ethics.<br>

Author(s): Young Josiah Ulysses<br>
Abstract: This review essay explores Josiah Young's project of developing a liberatory Pan-Africanism that is attuned to cultural diversity and Victor Anderson's advocacy of postmodern cultural criticism in African-American religious thought. After situating African-American religious thought as a branch of Africana thought, the author examines these two religious thinkers' work as an effort to forge a position on African-American religious thought--including its relation to theology--in an age where even theory is treated as a god that is about to die. At the conclusion, secularism emerges as a religious project that normatively undergirds the methodological dimensions of these works..<br>

Abstract: The field or object of study in religious ethics is presented as the moral elements of a religious ethos. Its methodology or discipline is interpreted as a combination of moral philosophy and religious thought- supplemented by socio-scientific and historical studies-which takes the form of three interrelated endeavors: descriptive ethics, meta-ethics, and normative ethics.<br>

Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
Issue: i40003740<br>
Date: 7 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): Campbell Heather<br>
Abstract: The development of the intellectual basis for planning activity has been a slow and problematic process. This paper seeks to build on existing intellectual understanding to argue that future developments in planning thought must take questions of ethical value as their starting point. The paper is essentially divided into three parts. The first makes the important distinction between planning as a narrow set of regulatory practices and planning as an idea, or more particularly a long-enduring societal activity. It is the latter concept of planning that frames the discussion in the remainder of the paper. The second, in which the core of the argument is developed, explores the nature of planning as an activity; an activity that is centrally concerned with making ethical judgements about better and worse, with and for others, in just institutions. It is about an idea of value. The third section examines the implications of this perspective for planning as a subject of academic endeavour. The argument is illustrated throughout with examples drawn from the author's research.<br>

Abstract: Vico maintained that metaphor is a fundamental process of human mental life which bridges the gap between emotion and cognition. This Vichian perspective is reflected in areas of critical theory treating metaphor and other tropes, particularly their use in narrative. In psychology too, the significance of metaphor is increasingly recognized despite the Cartesian emphasis on literal thought and language in contemporary psychology's central paradigm, cognitive science. The paper compares the Cartesian and Vichian perspectives and suggests that the former limits the integrated treatment of cognition and emotion. This is illustrated with an example of how a child's feelings about a distressing situation are both revealed and changed in storytelling. The Vichian perspective is more appropriate to understanding this therapeutic interaction of cognition and emotion through metaphoric narrative play. This perspective has significant echoes in psychoanalytic and textual studies suggesting how sensitivity to the latent content of narrative metaphors offers both speaker and hearer a unique insight into the experience of the narrator.<br>

Abstract: From the moment it began to engage with time in a considered way, human geography has employed a variety of analytical and conceptual approaches to it. Recent work especially has greatly extended the range of these different approaches by stressing the innate variability of time, leading some to talk of 'multiple temporalities' and to pronounce time as 'uneven' even within the same society. Fractured by such differences over how time may be used and interpreted, the possibility of an overarching concept of time in human geography has long gone. However, this does not prevent us from asking whether it is still possible to produce a coherent review of the differences involved. This paper offers such a review, arguing that setting these differences down within a structured framework can provide a clearer sense of how diverse the debate among human geographers has become and the trends of thought that have underpinned this growing diversity. Among the trends identified, it places particular stress on the shift from objectified interpretations to those dealing with relational forms of lived and experiential time and on how the separation of early discussions of space from those on time, their dimensional stand-off from each other, has slowly given way to a view in which space and time are treated as sticky concepts that are difficult to separate from each other.<br>

Author(s): Araújo Alberto Filipe<br>
Abstract: O autor partindo de textos-base de instituições internacionais, como a O.C.D.E. e a UNESCO, e sobretudo da Lei de Bases do Sistema Educativo Português (L.B.S.E.) ensaia o modo como eles, com especial destaque para o texto da L.B.S.E., possam garantir a pluralidade do pensar na instituição escolar. Por outras palavras, tenta-se dar subsídios que assegurem, pelo menos teoricamente, a formação de uma consciência educativa (democrática) contraposta à lógica reducionista e positivista que sempre tem caracterizado esse mesmo tipo de consciência. Igualmente é apontado que, muito provavelmene, só uma "co-gestão" escolar, tal como o conceito é habitualmente entendido, é possível de garantir o re-nascimento e mesmo a sobrevivência do espírito democrático educacional. /// Sur la base de textes-clés d'institutions internationales tels que l'OCDE ou l'UNESCO, et surtout à partir de la Loi Cadre du Système Educatif Portugais, l'auteur vérifie la façon dont ces textes, et spécialement ce dernier, peuvent garantir la pluralité des idées dans l'institution scolaire. En d'autres termes, on s'efforce de fournir une contribution pour garantir au moins théoriquement la formation d'une conscience. De même, on souligne que très probablement seule une "co-gestion" scolaire ainsi qu'on l'entend habituellement est susceptible de garantir la "renaissance" et même la survie de l'esprit démocratique en matière d'éducation. /// On the bases of fundamental texts of international institutions (O. C. D. E. and UNESCO) and chiefly of the law which determines the Portuguese Educational System (L. B. S. E.), the author seeks to examine the guarantees of having plurality of thought in educational institutions. In other words, there is attempt to suggest ways by which — at least theoretically — the formation of the democratic educational consciousness can be maintained against positivist positions. It is also suggested that only a co-administered education can guarantee the rebirth and even the survival~<br>

Author(s): Renaud Michel<br>
Abstract: Este estudo dedica-se à teoria da verdade tal como se apresenta nas obras de Ricoeur entre 1947 e 1960. Procura-se sublinhar o vaivém entre uma compreensão ontológica da verdade, marcada antes de mais pelo pensamento de Karl Jaspers (1947), e uma compreensão fenomenológica da verdade centrada na teoria do juízo (1960). Contudo a análise da tensão entre a unidade do verdadeiro e a multiplicidade das filosofias permite elaborar o conceito de verdade como comunicação e de verdade como objecto de esperança. Procura-se então mostrar o fundamento desta esperança bem como a dimensão pela qual ela ultrapassa o universo da filsosofia. A conclusão sublinha que os desenvolvimentos ulteriores de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sobre a hermenêutica do símbolo, da metáfora e da narrativa ganham em serem relidos no horizonte das tensões do problema da verdade. /// Cette étude est consacrée à la théorie de la vérité telle qu'elle se présente dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur entre 1947 et 1960. On cherche à souligner le va-et-vient entre une compréhension ontologique de la vérité initielement influencée par la pensée de Karl Jaspers 1947, et une compréhension phénoménologique de la vérité centrée sur la théorie du jugement (1960). L'analyse de la tension entre l'unité du vrai et la multiplicité des philosophies débouche cependant sur le concept de vérité comme communication et comme object d'espérence. On cherche alors à montrer le fondement de cette espérance ainsi que la dimension par laquelle elle dépasse l'univers de la philosophie. La conclusion souligne que les développements ultérieurs de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sur l'herméneutique du symbole, de la métaphore et du récit ont tout à gagner à être replacés et relus à l'horizon des tensions du problème de la vérité. /// This study pays special attention to the theory of truth elaborated in Ricoeur's work from 1947 to 1960.

Abstract: Este texto procura encontrar um princípio hermenêutico que dê acesso a uma leitura de unidade da obra de Ricoeur. Nesse contexto, experimenta a tese de que a filosofia ricoeuriana se deixa interpretar como um caso no interior do pensamento crítico de herança kantiana, como uma filosofia dos limites da razão, não no sentido originário, de investigação sobre as condições de possibilidade do conhecimento objectivo, mas por poder ser lida como uma pesquisa sistematica para encontrar as condições em que é possível ao pensar, à discursividade, dizer, num saber constituído, a existência. Assim, tratar-se-á do significado "crítico" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire que, sendo a primeira obra do projecto da Filosofia da Vontade. lhe determina as condição de possibilidade, ao propor os princípios teóricos fundantes da constituição de um discurso unitário sobre o humano enquanto expressão de uma existência histórica e livre. /// Ce texte veut trouver un principe herméneutique qui donne accès à une lecture unitaire de l'oeuvre de Ricoeur. C'est dans ce contexte que l'on avance la thèse selon laquelle la philosophie ricoeurienne doit être interprétée comme un cas à l'intérieur de la pensée critique d'héritage kantien, comme une philosophie des limites de la raison, non pas dans le sens d'investigation des conditions de possibilité de la connaissance objective, mais parce que cette philosophie peut être lue comme une recherche systématique en vue de trouver les conditions dans lesquelles le penser, le discours, peut, en un savoir constitué, dire l'existence. On s'occupera donc du sens "critique" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire qui, comme première oeuvre du projet de la Philosophie de la l'olonté, assigne à celle-ci ses conditions de possibilité en proposant les principes théoriques qui fondent la constitution d'un discours unitaire à propos de l'humain en tant qu'expression d'une existence historique et libre. /// This text seeks to find a hermeneutical principle which permit~<br>

Abstract: Partindo de alguns pressupostos que explicitam a questão nuclear da "instância do sujeito" na obra de Ricoeur (anteriores ou contemporâneos ao debate com o estruturalismo), e que tipificam a via filosófica ricoeuriana, e partindo também da articulação axial do pensamento de Lévi-Strauss (relacionada com esse debate), são depois propostos os tópicos dessa controvérsia. Tais tópicos, que se desenvolvem em torno dos elementos já considerados, gravitam à volta da inteligibilidade do sentido e do sentido da inteligibilidade, da complementaridade dos métodos, e dos níveis semiológico e semântico, este último estabelecido mediante a pregnância da frase na linguagem, e da palavra (mot) como operador entre a estrutura e o acontecimento. /// La présente analyse commence par mettre en relief quelques présupposés qui explicitent la question nucléaire de "l'instance du sajet" dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur (présupposés antérieurs ou contemporains du débat avec le structuralisme) et qui caractérisent le chemin philosophique de celui-ci; on prend également pour point de départ l'articulation centrale de la pensée de Lévi-Strauss relative à ce débat, afin de proposer ensuite les lignes mai-tresses de cette controverse. Ces lignes maitresses, qui se développent autour des éléments déjà mentionnés, gravitent autour de l'intelligibilité du sens et du sens de l'intelligibilité, de la complémentarité des méthodes et des niveaux sémiologique et sémantique, en établissant ce dernier niveau par le biais de la prégnance de la phrase dans le langage, et du mot comme opérateur entre la structure et l'événement. /// After presenting the presuppositions which underlie a question which is central to Ricoeur's work, "the subject as act, as instance", and which exemplify Ricoeur's way of doing philosophy, as well as presenting Lévi-Strauss' thought concerning this question, the article proposes the fundamental topics which define the controversy. These topics gravitate around the problem of the intellig~<br>

Abstract: A obra de Ricoeur constitui certamente uma contribuição importantc para o pensamento contemporâneo. Todavia, possui postulados metafísicos que limitam o alcance do seu projecto filosófico e religioso. A repetição de uma tese fundamental de Ricoeur tem a pretensão de desbloquear e de superar este limite. /// S'il est hors de doute que l'oeuvre de Ricoeur constitue une contribution importante pour la pensée contemporaine, néanmoins la présence en elle de postulats métaphysiques a pour effet de limiter la portée de son projet philosophique et religieux. La reprise d'une thése fondamentale et particuliérement révélatrice de Ricoeur a pour but de débloquer cette situation et de ces limites. /// No one can doubt Ricoeur's contribution to contemporary thought.

Author(s): Costa Miguel Dias<br>
Abstract: Este artigo apresenta o pensamento mais recente de P. Ricoeur sob a perspectiva de uma lógica da produção de sentido, discutindo criticamente as possibilidades e os limites do círculo hermenêutico. Tomando como ponto de partida os pressupostos fenomenológicos e ontológicos da sua filosofia, são sucessivamente abordadas as questões relativas à interpretação textual, imaginação e criatividade, acção, tempo e narrativa, ideologia e utopia. Reconhecido um certo logocentrismo - uma mistura de Logos e de suposto real - implicado na solução destas questões que nos é proposta pelo autor, procura-se repensar a ligação entre o sentido e o consensus, a coerência e a própria questão da violéncia. Estabelece-se para isso, na última secção, um confronto entre as posições defendidas por Ricoeur e a hipótese de R. Girard sobre o desejo mimético e a violência. /// Cet article présente la pensée la plus récente de P. Ricoeur sous la perspective d'une logique de la production du sens, en discutant de façon critique les possibilités et les limites du cercle herméneutique.

Tout en reconnaissant un certain logocentrisme–un mélange de Logos et de réalité supposée–impliqué dans la solution de ces questions qui nous est proposée par l'auteur, on cherche à repenser le lieu entre le sens et le consensus, la cohérence et la question même de la violence.

Abstract: O estruturalismo levistraussiano tern urn vasto alcance critico em relação ao conceitochave da filosofia do conhecimento que é a razão. Alicerçando a racionalidade num inconsciente universal, num sistema formal categórico, e postulando urn isomorfismo entre a natureza e a cultura, Lévi-Strauss faz uma critica nova da razão humana. Esta não pode ser concebida como consciência, como representação, tão ao gosto do racionalismo moderno e de algumas filosofias contemporàneas, nem perspectivada dialectica e temporalmente, como o fazem o positivismo e o hegelianismo. /// Levi-Strauss' structuralism strongly criticizes "reason", a key-concept in the philosophy of knowledge. Grounding rationality upon a universal unconscious and upon a categorical formal system, and postulating an isomorphism between nature and culture, Strauss produces a new criticism of human reason. Reason can no longer be conceived as it is both in modern rationalism and in some contemporary philosophical trends, as consciousness, as representation. Nor can it be thought of from either a temporal or a dialectical point of view, as it is in positivism and in hegelianism.<br>

Date: 6 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): da Veiga Manuel Alte<br>
Abstract: Na la meditação «em que se pretende não falar de valor», o autor esforça-se por manter um discurso linear sobre o interesse humano de pensar e agir relativamente a um tema tão fundamental, que parece quase impossivel evitar a «petitio principii». Pode-se sintetizar a primeira meditação nestas duas alíneas: (a) O desejo de felicidade é o grande motor da busca de meios para uma vida sempre melhor; (b) O ser humano estrutura a sua ideia de felicidade, vida, meios adequados, objectivos de graus diversos, em função dos conhecimentos de que disōpe. A 2 a meditação reconhece que a neutralidade de discurso da 1a meditação não teve éxito. As palavras são extremamente analógicas e pressupōem um «pensamento e discurso ocultos» , coniventes com o conceito de valor, que se pretendia evitar. O desejo de plenitude da qualidade de vida implica o acto, por vezes inconsciente, de valorização. /// The 1.st meditation aims to maintain a discourse independent of the concept of value. Like in an « Impossible mission», we face a project that easily forces the adventurer to return over his lost pathways in a desert. I. e., falling in a «petitio principii». The result of that l. st meditation could be synthesized as it follows: (a) The desire of hapiness is what forces us to search a better and better quality of life; (b) Human beings structure their idea of hapiness. life, adequate means to various kinds of objectives, according to their available knowledge. The 2. nd meditation recognizes the failure of the searched neutral discourse in the l. st meditation: its words and concepts exemplify a very deep analogy and reveal an occult system of thought and discourse, where the notion of value is unmistakably implicated. The desire of a quality of life in all its richness implies, although some times unconsciously, the act of evaluation.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo reflecte sobre o significado critico dos conceitos de tradição e preconceito, noções fundamentias da filosofia hermeneutica de Hans-Georg Gadamer. Visa de forma particular a contestação que o autor faz da moderna redução do sentido da filosofia. Filosofia ou teoria da ciência, eis os termos de uma questão que atravessa o pensamento de Gadamer, desde Verdade e Método, até aos últimos textos. Para o filosofo, na raiz originária do sentido está um modo ôntico de ser, caracterizado pela memória, pelo efeito histórico da tradição e pela necessidade de formação. A razão, que se sabe hoje historica e finita, parte sempre de pressupostos, que marcam a sua basilar inserção na comunidade da palavra já sempre partilhada e nos lembram como é ilusório o sonho iluminista de uma transparência total. /// This article is a reflexion about the critical meaning of the concept of tradition and prejudice in the hermeneutical philosopphy of H.-G. Gadamer. It focuses on Gadamer's protest against the modern reduction of the meaning of philosophy. Philosophy or theory of science are the terms of the question that crosses all of Gadamer's thought, from Wahrheit und Methode until the later works. At the root of meaning is for Gadamer an ontological way of being characterized by memory, the historic effect of tradition and the need of formation. Reason, which we now know as historical and finite, is grounded on presuposed ideas which mark its fundamental insertion in the comunity of the world, already shared, and remind us of how deceptive the iluminist dream of a total transparency actually is.<br>

Abstract: Hobbes julgava ter encontrado na ciência e na sua metodologia, especificamente naquelas ciências que eram consideradas como indubitáveis, o modelo que lhe permitiria construir as bases da nova sociedade. Com isto buscava evadir-se das ambiguidades predominantes no seu tempo, as quais não faziam outra coisa senão manter a sociedade num estado bélico. O presente artigo mostra como Hobbes constrói o seu pensamento político de modo geométrico, como uma ciência demonstrativa, comparando o dever-ser da ciência política com a ordem imperante na matemática. O autor mostra ainda até que ponto Hobbes colocou todos os seus esforços na tarefa de dar um carácter científico à política, já que a sua pretensão era fazer dela uma ciência racional Numa palavra, o artigo mostra de que modo Hobbes pretendeu elevar o carácter da filosofia política ao de uma verdadeira ciência política. /// In science - particularly in those sciences that were considered indubitable -and in its methodology, Hobbes thought that he had found the pattern which would allow him to build the bases of a new society. In doing so he was trying to avoid the prevailing ambiguities of his time, which did not go beyond keeping society in an ongoing state of war. Accordingly, he builds his thought around the geometrical mode, as a demonstrative science. Thus he compares the "ought" of political science to the prevailing order of mathematics. Hobbes took great pains to give politics a scientific character, as he tried to make a rational science out of it. By doing this, Hobbes attempted to raise the nature of political philosophy to political science.<br>

Abstract: The view of language is greatly changed from early modern philosophy to later modern philosophy and to postmodern philosophy. The linguistic question in early modern philosophy, which is characterized by rationalism and empiricism, is discussed in this paper. Linguistic phenomena are not at the center of philosophical reflections in early modern philosophy. The subject of consciousness is at the center of the philosophy, which makes language serve purely as an instrument for representing thoughts. Locke, Leibniz and Descartes consider language from a representationalist point of view. To them, language itself is idealized and represents thought as if it were thought representing itself. Like the structural linguist Saussure, the founders of phenomenology and analytical philosophy give much attention to the logical or static structure of language, and stick up for the representationalism of early modern philosophy. However, their successors refuse to accept this attitude, meaning the final collapse of representationalism. /// 从早期现代哲学到后期现代哲学再到后现代哲学，在语言观上产生了重大的 变化。早期现代哲学以唯理论和经验论为典型形式。语言现象没有成为该时期哲学 反思的中心问题; 意识主体处于哲学的中心，这使得语言仅仅充当着表象思想的工 具。洛克、莱布尼茨和笛卡尔都从表象论的角度看待语言，在他们那里，语言本身 被观念化了，它们表象思想，就像思想在表象它自身。正像结构语言学家索绪尔一 样，现象学和分析哲学的创始人关注的都是语言的逻辑结构或静态结构，他们延续 了早期现代哲学的表象论，但他们的后继者拒绝接受这种态度，而这意味着最终突 破表象论。<br>

Author(s): Hart Curtis W.<br>
Abstract: J. Robert Oppenheimer was among the most important and enigmatic figures in 20th century science. He is best known for successfully directing the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan at the end of World War II. Subsequently, he became a scientist and statesman who advised the United States government in the areas of atomic weapons development and public policy. He later became subject to an investigation in 1954 into his previous political affiliations and his personal behavior that ended in the revoking of his security clearance. This essay seeks to chronicle Oppenheimer's coming of age as a public intellectual with a view toward his own psychological history and most especially in relationship to the stages of faith development articulated by James Fowler and colleagues. Moreover, though not conventionally religious, Oppenheimer's life and thought were permeated with themes and ideas of a religious and ethical nature that shaped his adult character and informed his view of the world. This essay was originally presented at The Richardson History of Psychiatry Research Seminar at Weill Cornell Medical College.<br>

Abstract: The article deals with phenomenology in Lithuania. The main thesis of the article is this: phenomenology is a living tradition in need of both development and interpretation. The minor thesis follows from the main one: the Western phenomenological tradition and Lithuanian philosophy interact and develop in tandem with one another. According to the authors, the contact between poetics and philosophy is the dominant form of phenomenology in Lithuania. The phenomenological tradition is treated as creative and living philosophical thought.<br>

Abstract: No centro do presente artigo está a problemática kierkegaardiana do possível e do impossível, ou seja, a coexistência dos opostos como explicitação do paradoxo, uma das figuras matriciais do Absurdo. Para Kierkegaard, o homem singular vê-se confrontado com o Paradoxo precisamente na medida em que a sua existência não cai sob o domínio da metafísica e do estético. Por outras palavras, o paradoxo invade a existência humana no momento em que se trata do paradoxo absoluto, escândalo para o Judeu, loucura para o Grego, absurdo para a Razão. O artigo mostra, contudo, que antes de se confrontar com o Paradoxo, o existente precisa de aprender a esperar, malgrado o absurdo, na certeza de que tudo é possível a Deus. Porém, a experiência do Paradoxo implica percorrer um caminho prévio. Por outras palavras, é necessário aprender a experimentar a "condensação do possível", seja sob a forma de melancolia seja sob a forma do escrúpulo, de modo a poder desesperar da ideia do possível. Mostra-se assim a capacidade inovadora de Kierkegaard, mesmo sabendo nós que o desespero constitui um tema filosófico clássico já deste a Antiguidade. O que Kierkegaard faz, porém, é colocar em movimento uma dialéctica em que o jogo dos opostos se organiza em diversas figuras precárias, sempre incertas e fluentes e que se escalonam segundo degraus múltiplos de intensidade. Ora é precisamente graças a este jogo de oposições que no pensamento do Solitário de Copenhaga se articulam, ainda que de forma frágil, o finito e o infinito, o temporal e o eterno, a possibilidade e a necessidade. /// At the center of the present article is the kierhegaardian approach to the dialectic of the possible and the impossible, whose co-existence gives evidence to the Paradox, one of the figures of the Absurd. For Kierkegaard, the singular human being finds herself confronted with the Paradox precisely in the measure in which her existence does not fall under the dominion of metaphysics and of the aesthetical. The paradox ~<br>

Author(s): Rognon Frédéric<br>
Abstract: As alusões implícitas e as referências explícitas ao pensamento de Søren Kierkegaard pontuam toda a obra de Jacques Ellul. Com efeito, segundo o autor do artigo, sempre que trata de temas como a Bíblia, a fé, a esperança, o amor, a oração, a liberdade, a política, a técnica, a não-conformidade ao mundo, ou o sofrimento, Jacques Ellul recorre insistentemente a Kierkegaard em ordem a construir o seu próprio pensamento. Nesse sentido, o artigo pretende mostrar os modos de fidelidade, de retoma e de reinterpretação de uma na outra obra de modo a, de algum modo, também poder esclarecer o significado da expressão "ser kierkegaardiano". /// Implicit allusions and explicit references to Søren Kierkegaard's thought punctuate the entire work of Jacques Ellul. Especially when dealing with topics like the Bible, faith, hope, love, prayer, freedom, politics, technology, nonconformity to the world, or suffering, Ellul calls frequently on Kierkegaard in order to build his own thought. The article shows the different modes of fidelity, resumption and reinterpretation of a work into the other, so that at the end it also clarifies what it means to be kierkegaardian.<br>

Author(s): Margulis Mario<br>
Abstract: En este artículo se rescata la tradición crítica del concepto "Ideologia". Se le intenta definir tratando de superar los problemas que emanan de su polisemia y de su utilización desde el sentido común. Para definirlo, el autor inicia su análisis a partir del apartado sobre fetichismo de la mercancía en el primer volumen de El Capital de Marx. Partiendo de los efectos del fetichismo sobre los procesos de pensamiento y los códigos de la cultura en un sistema productor de mercancías, se exponen los efectos sociales de la reificación (Lukács y Goldmann) y los rasgos principales de los contenidos ideológicos presentes en los discursos. El autor considera que las luchas sociales por el poder y la dominación son paralelos con las pugnas por la construcción social del sentido. En esa línea, llega a definir ideologia como "las huellas dejadas por las luchas por la hegemonía en los códigos de la cultura". /// The critical tradition attending the concept of'ideology' is recovered by defining this term in a way to avoid the traps set by its many meanings and its common sense usage. The author grounds his analysis on the arguments about the fetishism of commodities in the first volume of Marx's Capital. Taking as his starting point the effects of fetishism on the processes of thought and cultural codes in a commodity-producing system, he explains the social effects of reification (Lukacs and Goldmann), and the main characteristics of ideological contents in discourses. The author considers that social struggles over power and domination run parallel to competing social constructions of meaning. He defines ideology as "the tracks left by the fights over hegemony in the codes of culture".<br>

Abstract: It is argued that to understand the Manus' construction of their environment their view of the night sky has to be taken into account. In Manus thought, celestial bodies and constellations were believed to reside at the edge of a saucer-shaped world, being able to permeate sea and sky and interact with the peoples' immediate environment. While only a small number of constellations had been named, these were sufficient to function as a calendar, a visualization of the seasonal cycle and a metaphorical explanation of the seasons. As such, they made the Manus world autonomous in the sense that the causes supposed to bring about seasonal change were situated within this world or at its edge.<br>

Issue: i40021726<br>
Date: 12 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Mercier Charles<br>
Abstract: Cet article cherche à identifier les différentes étapes du positionnement de René Rémond par rapport au mouvement de Mai 68, afin d'en repérer les singularités. En 1968, ce célèbre universitaire français est professeur d'histoire contemporaine à la faculté de lettres de Nanterre, berceau et matrice de la révolution étudiante. Il semble adopter trois attitudes successives : la fermeté tant que la contestation reste cantonnée à Nanterre (de mars à mai), la prise de distance quand le mouvement monte en puissance et se diffuse à la France entière (première quinzaine du mois de mai), le dialogue à partir de la seconde quinzaine du mois de mai. Cet itinéraire est diversement interprété. Si certains reprochent à René Rémond un revirement opportuniste, la majorité de ceux l'ayant fréquenté sur cette période estime qu'il a opéré une adaptation stratégique dans le but de protéger l'Université contre les dérives. Cet implication se révélera durable puisqu'il conduira René Rémond à la présidence de la nouvelle Université Paris-X-Nanterre. /// This article deals with and identifies the various stages in René Rémonds positioning with regard to the movement of May 1968. In 1968, this famous French professor was professor of contemporary history at Nanterre, faculty of humanities, cradle and matrice of the student revolution. He seemed to have three successive attitudes: firmness as long as protest remained at Nanterre (from March to May), withdrawal when the movement grew and spread to all of France (May 1-15), and dialogue during the second half of May. This itinerary has been variously interpreted. While some people criticize René Rémond for opportunistically changing sides, most who were involved with him in this period thought he carried out a strategic adaptation in order to protect the University from straying too far. This involvement turned out to be a lasting one as it led René Rémond to be president of the new University Paris-X-Nanterre.<br>

Author(s): Reynolds Anthony<br>
Abstract: This essay analyzes the role of the "dead metaphor" within deconstruction and neopragmatism in an attempt to elucidate some of the surreptitious affinities between the two discursive formations that would constitute what Derrida has called a "pragrammatology (to come)." On the basis of a thorough metaphorological rereading of philosophical thought that extends from Vico, Nietzsche, and Heidegger to Blumenberg, Derrida and Rorty, this essay argues that deconstruction continues to generate new contexts of meaning and reference in the form of a pragmatism that has long been integral to its discursive identity. /// Este artigo analisa o papel da "metáfora morta" em meio à desconstrução e ao neopragmatismo em uma tentativa de esclarecer algumas das afinidades subreptícias entre as duas formações discursivas que viriam a constituir aquilo que Derrida chamou de "pragramatologia (a vir)". Por meio de uma revisão metaforológica do pensamento filosófico que parte de Vico, passando por Nietzsche e Heidegger até Blumenberg, Derrida e Rorty, este artigo defende que a desconstrução continua a gerar novos contextos de sentido e de referência sob a forma de um pragmatismo que integra já há muito a sua identidade discursiva.<br>

Abstract: La fiction est en général considérée comme une notion univoque. Or, le terme renvoie selon les contextes à des faits très différents, voire incompatibles : illusion cognitive, leurre, postulat d'indétermination ontologique, expérience de pensée. La tendance actuelle qui consiste à interpréter les textes ethnographiques ou historiographiques comme relevant du régime fictionnel n'est pas faite pour clarifier la situation. L'hypothèse défendue ici est celle d'une spécificité irréductible de la fiction artistique fondée sur une détermination qui n'est pas d'ordre sémantique mais pragmatique : cristallisation culturelle d'une compétence mentale (la simulation) et interactionnelle (la feintise ludique) particulière, la fiction artistique se distingue à la fois des autres types de fiction (qui relèvent d'une définition sémantique) et des récits véridictionnels (pour lesquels la question de la référentialité est la pierre de touche). Fiction is usually considered to be an unequivocal concept. However this term refers to quite different, even incompatible, facts depending on the context: illusions, artifices, the postulate of ontologica! indétermination, and thought experiments. The current tendency of interpreting anthropological or historical texts as fiction does not clarify the situation. The hypothesis is defended that « artistic fiction » has an irreducible specificity, which is determined pragmatically instead of semantically : the cultural crystallization of a mental (simulation) and an interactional (pretending to play) competence. This sort of fiction thus stands apart from other types (which answer to a semantic definition) and from veridical narratives (where the question of referentiality is the touchstone).<br>

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: The influence of Husserl on the Russian Formalism and the Structuralism of the Prague School of Linguistics is especially manifest in the work of Jakobson. A direct literary dependence is traceable in the so-called „antipsychological” tendency, in the program of a Universal Grammar and in several questions of the theory of meaning. Objective points of contact can be found in the theses of the intersubjective and the associative constitution of objects, but also concerning the central topics of Husserlian phenomenology, the analysis of essence (the elaboration of invariants and universals) and the phenomenological attitude (e.g. in phonology the priority of the perceptual level against the articulatory (physiological) and the acoustic (physical) level). A comparison of Jakobson and Husserl yields not only a mutual confirmation of fundamental aspects of their linguistic and philosophical thought. It opens also interesting ways for further research in both fields.<br>

Abstract: To see, to speak, to think : these are the three main topics of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, tragically interrupted in 1961. He intended to write two works on The Origin of Truth. To understand the relationship between Merleau-Ponty I and Merleau-Ponty II it is a good lead to pay attention to the relationship between seeing, speaking and thinking. In a central passage of Phenomenology of Perception (p. 451) this relationship is called Fundierung. Merleau-Ponty conceives it as a two way relationship, which excludes every possibility of reducing one term (thinking, reason) to another (perception, language). Yet, at that time he is not able to point out clearly the originality of thinking. L'Oeil et l'Esprit and Le Visible et l'Invisible provide a first outline of l'Origine de la Vérité. The 'second' Merleau-Ponty wants to 'reassume' his whole philosophy in what he calls : fundamental thinking. Painting opens the way to the mystery of seeing : something visible begins to see. Subject and object are no longer opposed to one another ; not even related by intentionality. The new key-word is Ineinander (interrelatedness, to be in one another, chiasm). 'La chair' (the flesh) is a new notion, broader and more fundamental than the body. The sensible reflects upon itself. This 're-flection' (reflexivity or reversibility) is a work of Being. The visible can be seen in principle. Philosophy should accompany the coming-to-see of the visible. In this perspective the transition to thinking (or ideality) must be seen as a new case of 'reversibilité'. The generality of the visible opens up to the 'invisible', that which in principle cannot be seen, but is 'the other side' of the visible. The basic phenomenon of expression is central here. Language is not an absolute starting point. Language is rather a new and more subtile form of coporeity, a new instance of the same basic reversibility, which already contains the seeds of ideality (logos endiathetor). The idea is of the word (logos ~<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to outline Ricoeur's outlook on the basis of ethics and on the main elements to shape the ethical intention. Although this topic is not to the fore in his thought, Ricoeur has often raised the ethical problematic and delivered most valuable insights into it. We explain how he let a subjective, intersubjective and neutral moment precede the relationship between freedom and law. We also inquire into his vision on values and on the impact and meaning of evil for ethics. The ground of ethical existence is the fact that man basically is original affirmation of being which manifests itself in longing and striving. This dynamic facticity which is only discoverable through a reflection upon the works and creations of man, represents the starting-point for an autonomous ethics having a historical character. In this way, Ricoeur - in the main stream of J. Nabert - turns against I. Kant whose duty ethics misjudges the basic dialectic of human action. Besides, this starting-point allows ethics to meet the Christian kerygma in a more meaningful way than duty ethics is in a position to it. For the kerygma sacralizes no ethical interdiction but situates man into a history of salvation and proclaims healing and fulfilment to man's longing. A second and decisive moment in ethical existence is the appearance of the other. When the other enters into my life, he calls me up to foster mine and his freedom als well. The other becomes a centre of obligation to me, and I am called up to promote the well being of all mankind. Ricoeur also points out that the very norm of morality is man both as an individual and communitarian being. Furthermore, as human freedom is always mediated, we should fully take into account the economic, political and cultural reality which is ethically most relevant. The practice of freedom raises the question of values. Ricoeur rejects any voluntaristic and essentialistic view. Values are immanent requirements of freedom in its effort ~<br>

Abstract: Cassirer faisait de la connaissance le point culminant du « processus d'objectivation de l'esprit » se révélant ainsi progressivement à soi-même à travers la spécificité de ses diverses configurations symboliques. Nous nous proposons d'élucider ici la loi de constitution propre aux sciences exactes à partir des principales figures de la physique moderne pour nous élever à une philosophie de la culture scientifique et dégager les principaux problèmes que pose sa réalisation comme « Weltbegriff ». Cassirer considered Knowledge as the terminating point of the « process of objectification » of human spirit that leads progressively to its self-consciousness through the differential specificity of symbolic forms. We are mainly concerned here with trying to clear up the constitutive law proper to exact sciences. Our analysis starts from the main figures of modern physics as its starting point in order to set our thought on a philosophy of scientifical culture and to draw the main problems related to its achievement as « Weltbegriff ».<br>

Abstract: Juriste de formation logicienne, longtemps influencé par le positivisme logique, Chaim Perelman a d'abord pensé qu'il était possible d'étendre l'analyse du raisonnement formel à l'argumentation pratique, juridique et morale. L'abandon de ce projet est ce qui l'a conduit à redécouvrir la topique juridique et à proposer, sous le titre de « nouvelle rhétorique », un retour à la Rhétorique et aux Topiques d'Aristote. As a jurist with a background in logics who was influenced by logical positivism for a long time, Chaim Perelman first thought that the analysis of formal reasoning could be extended to practical argumentation in the field of law and ethics. Renouncing this idea was what allowed him to rediscover juridical topics and to go back to Aristotle's Topics and Rhetorics under the name of « new rhetorics ».<br>

Abstract: Bien que de nombreux auteurs aient fait œuvre à la fois de sociologue et de théologien, il n'existe pas à proprement parler de « sociologie de la théologie ». L'objet de cet article est de proposer une relecture de La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte de Maurice Halbwachs afin de montrer que ce livre offre autant une étude de sociologie de la mémoire qu'une esquisse de sociologie de la théologie. Après avoir précisé en quoi on peut parler d'une étude de la « construction sociale de la pensée chrétienne » chez Halbwachs, on revient plus en détails sur la façon dont il analyse le mécanisme de production de l'orthodoxie théologique, puis sur la spécificité du regard que le sociologue porte sur les questions théologiques. Enfin, la conclusion est l'occasion de souligner ce que pourrait apporter la sociologie de la théologie à la sociologie en elle-même. Even if various authors contributed to sociology as well as to theology, nothing like a "sociology of theology" exists. The aim of this article is to offer a rereading of La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte by Maurice Halbwachs, in order to show that this book is not only a study of sociology of memory but also an outline of a sociology of theology. After having defined in what extent we can find a study of "the social construction of the Christian thought" in Halbwachs' work, we turn to the way he analyses the production process of the theological orthodoxy, and then to the specificity of the sociological point of view on theological questions. Finally, the conclusion gives us the occasion to underline what the sociology of theology could bring to sociology itself. Aunque varios autores han contribuido tanto a la sociología que a la teología, no se puede decir que existe realmente una "sociología de la teología". Este articulo propone una relectura de La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte de Maurice Halbwachs que pretende mostrar que este libro es tanto un estudio~<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40044033<br>
Date: 5 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Barber Michael<br>
Abstract: Dorion Cairns correctly interprets the preconstituted stratum of Edmund Husserl's Fifth Cartesian Meditation to be the primordial ego and not the social world, as was thought by Alfred Schutz, who considered Husserl to be insufficiently attentive to the social world's hold upon us. Following Cairns's interpretation, which involves recovering and reconstructing strata that may never exist independently, one better understands how the transfer of sense "animate organism" involves automatic association, or somatic apprehension. This sense-transfer extends to any animate organism, not just humans, and draws on extensive unreflected-upon similarities despite the distinctive fact that the other's body is never given to oneself as is one's own. Following Cairns's interpretation, one can also understand the second epoché as an imaginative, reconstructive abstraction rather than as an example of failed ascesis. Consequently, Husserl appears as less intellectualized in his approach to empathy than often thought to be and more confident in the phenomenologist's capacity to imagine and attend selectively to experience.<br>

Abstract: Rappelant la spécificité occidentale des valeurs historiques et commémoratives liées au temps « décimal » tel l'an 2000, l'article s'interroge sur des échéances temporelles dont la portée se trouve massivement amplifiée par le tourisme, les médias, les sites Internet, et une attente millénariste qui les transforme en reflet des fautes de l'Occident et des technologies. Des auteurs tels que Ricœur, De Martino, Marramao mettent en avant le temps vécu et reconnaissent que les cultures interagissent avec le temps pour produire des valeurs symboliques qui reflètent leurs propres choix. Aujourd'hui cependant il semble nécessaire de reconnaître la fracture du temps de l'historicisme et de l'humanisme de De Martino, et d'accepter des modalités plurielles et hétérogènes de la pensée, de l'expérience temporelle. The article recalls the Western specificity of historical and commemorative values related to « decimal » time, such as the year 2000. It questions about deadlines the consequences of which are massively amplified by tourism, medias, Internet sites and millenarist waiting and turned into a reflection of Western faults and technologies. Authors such as Ricœur, De Martino, Marramao are interested in the time lived and admit that cultures use time to produce symbolic values reflecting their own choices. But today it seems necessary to acknowledge time fracture in De Martino's historicism and humanism and to accept plural and heterogenous modalities of thought and temporal experience. Der Artikel erinnert an die mit der Dezimalzeit, wie dem Jahr 2000, verbundene westliche Spezifizität der geschichtlichen und Gedenkwerte, und fragt sich über Terminen deren Tragweite massenweise durch den Tourismus, die Medien, das Internet und das Warten auf das Millenium verstärkt wird, die sie in die Spiegelung der westlichen Fehler und Technologien verwandeln. Autore wie Ricœur, De Martino, Marramao interessieren sich fur die gelebte Zeit und erkennen an, dass die Kulturen die Zeit gebr~<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40048293<br>
Date: 9 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Vieillard-Baron Jean-Louis<br>
Abstract: Divers ouvrages sur saint Augustin conduisent à reposer la question du temps et celle du sujet qui ont alors été réunies pour la première fois comme un unique problème : memoria, conscience et conscience de soi, sont pensées selon le temps comme un sentir primordial. Celui-ci suppose un lieu, le ciel des ciels, qui est le lieu temporel de l'homme auprès de Dieu. L'intériorité augustinienne a des antécédents dans la pensée antique ; elle a influencé la philosophie récente ; Heidegger interprète l'ego de Descartes d'une façon augustinienne dans son herméneutique de la facticité. Les questions suscitées par ces ouvrages viennent du manque actuel d'une histoire spéculative de l'ego, en même temps que d'une résurgence évidente de celui-ci dans le champ de la philosophie contemporaine. Several books about Augustine lead to question once more the topic of time and of the subject which then were united for the first time as a single problem : memoria, conscionsness and self conscionsness are thought according to time as a prime feeling. The latter supposes a place, heaven in heaven, which is the temporal seat of man next to God. Augustinian interiority has its antecedents within classical thought. It influenced recent philosophy. Heidegger interprets Descartes' ego in an Augustinian way within his hermeneutics of facticity. The topics at stake from these books surge from the present lack of a speculative history of the ego, together with an obvious resurgence of the latter within the field of contemporary philosophy.<br>

Author(s): David Alain<br>
Abstract: Si la personnalité philosophique de Michel Henry est saluée, son œuvre continue, quarante ans apres L'essence de la manifestation, à ne pas être reçue, ou à ne l'être que sur la base de malentendus. Pourquoi ? Les raisons alléguées peuvent sembler faibles (le ton absolu de Michel Henry, l'indifférence politique ou la sensibilité de droite qu'on lui prête, etc.), elles renvoient (la reconnaissance généralement faite de la « puissance » de sa pensée, ce qui est pressenti avec ce terme, plaident en ce sens) à une autre, plus décisive : la réception n'est pas la réception dans le monde mais la reception dans la vie, de la vie par elle-même – ce qui néanmoins serait la condition d'une politique pour notre temps. If Michel Henry's philosophical personality is indeed hailed, his work goes on, forty years after The Essence of Manifestation, not being received but on the basis of misunderstandings. Why ? The alleged reasons may seem rather weak (e.g. Michel Henry's absolute tone, his so-called political indifference, or his right-winged sensitiveness) ; they refer to another, more decisive, one (what is usually acknowledged as a potency of thought) : reception does not mean reception in this very world, but in life, which nonetheless would be the condition of a new politics of our time.<br>

Abstract: L'alternance entre les trois pôles de la formation (auto-hétéro-oïko) présente dans les pratiques de formation alternée (variété des situations d'apprentissage et des acteurs) renvoie à la différenciation des trois personnes pronominales (je-tu-il) du langage courant et s'inscrit dans l'épistémologie ternaire de la sémiotique initiée par Peirce. L'intelligence pratique et rusée (la métis des Grecs), repérée chez des artisans grâce à l'expression régionale « le biais du gars », met en scène une logique ouverte où transduction et abduction s'articulent à déduction et induction. Une « raison expérientielle » , dialogique, écologique, à visée éthique, est ainsi forgée. C'est une rationalité pratique cherchant à actualiser le potentiel de la situation. Elle est empreinte de sagesse et de « prudence » en action, au sens d'Aristote (phronésis). L'éc(h)oformation qui émerge de cette raison expérientielle, de ce regard interactionnel, est indissociable de la boucle étrange entre deux autres raisons : la raison sensible et la raison formelle, entre spontanéité et habitude. The tripolar concept of training (auto-hetero-oïko), foundation of alternating courses practice (with multiple learning situations and actors), draws us back to the differenciation between the three main persons singular (I, You, He) expressed in common language as the compound epistemology of semiotics put forward by Peirce... Practical intelligence (close to the "metis" of the Greeks) can be noticed among craftsmen when they refer to the "biais du gars" bespeaking an open logic where transduction and abduction are linked to deduction and induction. A constructive reasoning, interactive ans ecological, with ethical objectives, is created. It's a practical rationality aiming at actualizing the potentiality of the situation and marked by sagaciy and prudence in action in the Aristotelian sense (phronesis). The "ec(h)otraining" emerging from the wisdom of experience, this interactive vision of things is neces~<br>

Abstract: La tentative de rapprochement entre littérature et éducation est en train de trouver — et pas seulement en France — de nouveaux adhérents. Cela semble signaler l'émergence d'un nouveau logos pédagogique qui essaye, peut-être, de dépasser les frontières de réflexion imposés par les sciences de l'éducation. Quelques-unes de ces tentatives, cependant, non seulement présentent certaines (et compréhensibles) limites, comme l'absence d'une « théorie de la réception » des textes fictionnels, mals elles ont aussi, dans d'autres cas, l'ambition de révolutionner le discours pédagogique à travers la littérature, où la pédagogie elle-même se transforme en projet d' « esthétisation de l'existence » . En prenant Philippe Meirieu et Jorge Larrosa comme illustrations des « limites » et de l' « ambition révolutionnaire » , respectivement, l'article cherche à montrer comment romantisme et nietzscheisme essayent de constituer un nouveau discours qui prétend, encore une fois, nous sauver de la « société administrée » . The attempt to approximate literature and education is beginning to find, not only in France, numerous supporters. This may indicate the emergence of a new pedagogical logos, which tries, little by little, to overcome the limits of thought set up by the Educational Sciences. Some of these attempts, however, not only show some (understandable) insufficiencies (such as the absence of a "reception theory" for fictional texts), but also, in other cases, the ambition of a complete revolution of the pedagogical discourse through literature (where pedagogy itself becomes a "self-stylistics" or aims at the "aesthetization of existence"). Taking Philippe Meirieu and Jorge Larrosa as respective examples of "insufficiencies" and "revolutionary ambition", the article tries to show how romanticism and Nietzscheanism can constitute a new pedagogical discourse that pretends, once again, to save us from "administerea society".<br>

Abstract: Un análisis del modo en que se produjo la recepción de la obra de Bourdieu en Argentina supone necesariamente tomar en cuenta las características particulares del campo receptor en sus diferentes estadios sucesivos. Para contextualizar el caso argentino, se comienza describiendo las relaciones de Bourdieu con América Latina. Luego se aborda la recepción de los primeros trabajos traducidos en los ámbitos de la sociología y de la antropología social, en el marco de las peculiares condiciones por las que estos atravesaron a partir de su institucionalización en los años 50, así como los difusores iniciales del pensamiento de Bourdieu en Argentina. Finalmente, se describe la influencia de Bourdieu en la sociología y en la antropología social argentinas actuales. An analysis of the way Bourdieu's work has been received in Argentina necessarily involves taking into consideration the particular characteristics of the field of reception in its different successive states. In order to situate the argentine case in the appropriate context, the author starts by describing Bourdieu's relationships with Latin America. Then, the paper focuses on the reception of the first publications translated both in the fields of sociology and social anthropology in the peculiar conditions they endured since their institutionalization in the fifties, and on the first promoters of Bourdieu's thought in Argentina. Finally the author describes the influence of Bourdieu in current argentinian sociology and social anthropology.<br>

Abstract: The philosophical and practical work of M. M. Bakhtin provides an important aid to theoretical grounding with regard to information seeking. In particular, his ideas of dialogic communication suggest a way to engage in the act of information seeking and the accompanying mediation. His work is especially important because of its phenomenological basis, which emphasizes the intentionality of communication, the connection of practice to being, and the relationship between self and other. Bakhtin's thought offers a framework for the rethinking of public services in libraries.<br>

Abstract: Richard Rorty uses Nietzsche to show that people need to create themselves because there is no foundationalist language which they can establish as an anchor. Although this perspective is Nietzschean, it is not Jamesian, and so Rorty misappropriates James when he conflates James and Nietzsche as like-minded progenitors of the mythologizing of a privileged vocabulary. This essay evaluates Rorty's reading of James by considering whether truth in Rorty's textualist sense can abide by the stream of thought. Although James does mythologize privileged vocabularies, he believes that words need to reflect the world more accurately (something Rorty would never say) by abiding by the flux of experience. As such, James recognizes the value that old words have as tools. Whereas Rorty shows disdain for old words, James shows us the cash value those words have in helping us to do anything from paying our bills to constructing more practical and effective theories.<br>

Abstract: In thought as well as in imagery, two of Auden's poems, "Death's Echo" and "Danse Macabre," appear to draw on such diverse manifestations of the medieval cult of death as lyric poems of memento mon, dialogues between the "quick and the dead," and the macabre tradition in morality plays. Combining the concept of the verbal icon (Wimsatt) with the principles of the theory of metaphor, as summarized by Ricoeur in The Rule of Metaphor (1977), the paper studies a selection of medieval poems and those of Auden as complex macro-vehicles and contrasts the possible tenors they are carrying.<br>

Publisher: Carfax Publishing Co.<br>
Issue: i384398<br>

Author(s): Zerilli Jo-Anne<br>
Abstract: This paper seeks to outline and evaluate Pierre Bourdieu's work as it has appeared most recently in feminist studies and the field of gender and education. In particular, it suggests ways in which Bourdieu's theoretical insights could be seen to more effectively contribute to cutting edge debates in both social theory and feminist thought regarding concepts such as agency, identity and domination. It also argues that a more creative and empirical engagement with the recent work of Bourdieu, alongside an interdisciplinary reading of more recent cultural and social theories of power, would be a fruitful way forward in advancing a feminist sociology of education. In the present historical moment and against the tide of postmodern and post-structuralist feminist accounts, Bourdieu is often read as a determinist who has little to offer contemporary feminist debates or who argues that masculine domination is too tightly woven to social practices of a given field. In short, this paper argues that such a view is not only a misreading of Bourdieu's work on fundamental theoretical grounds, but fails to acknowledge the ways in which his more recent work on masculinity addresses both the cultural and social conditions underlying contemporary forms of symbolic domination. In short, the paper argues that Bourdieu's theory offers an analytical breadth and range beyond the scope of anything that a normative, liberal account of masculine domination could provide. Yet, in drawing from such diversity, Bourdieu's oeuvre is able to resist incomprehensibility. It stands as a highly focused, realistic and generative attempt (McNay, 1999; McLeod, 2004) to chart the problems of subordination, differentiation and hierarchy, and to expose the possibilities, as well as the limits, of gendered self-hood.<br>

Abstract: This review explores the most significant dimensions and findings of phenomenological approaches in anthropology. We spell out the motives and implications inherent in such approaches, chronicle their historical dimensions and precursors, and address the ways in which they have contributed to analytic perspectives employed in anthropology. This article canvasses phenomenologically oriented research in anthropology on a number of topics, including political relations and violence; language and discourse; neurophenomenology; emotion; embodiment and bodiliness; illness and healing; pain and suffering; aging, dying, and death; sensory perception and experience; subjectivity; intersubjectivity and sociality; empathy; morality; religious experience; art, aesthetics, and creativity; narrative and storytelling; time and temporality; and senses of place. We examine, and propose salient responses to, the main critiques of phenomenological approaches in anthropology, and we also take note of some of the most pressing and generative avenues of research and thought in phenomenologically oriented anthropology.<br>

Abstract: In Unamuno criticism there has been an irresistible temptation to see him as a precursor of some of the later twentieth-century developments in linguistics and literary theory. But a comparison of his ideas on language with those of certain nineteenth-century linguistic philosophers, with whom he was acquainted through his early philological training, shows that his ideas are reworkings of early-nineteenth-century thinkers. Two in particular, Friedrich Schleiermacher and Wilhelm von Humboldt, appear to have exercised a shaping and lasting influence on Unamuno's ideas on language, which he formulated throughout his life. This article considers how Unamuno came across these two thinkers, and compares his and their ideas on language and thought, language and person, language and nation, and language and creativity.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i40059451<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Baumgartner Frédérique<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on Gina Pane's performance Escalade non anesthésiée (1971), which consisted of the artist mounting a ladder studded with sharp metallic shards, causing injury to herself in the process. Previous art historians have read Pane's performances through a psychoanalytic lens, emphasizing the place of Lacanian thought in the nascent French feminist movement of the 1970s. This article posits that psychoanalytic accounts of Pane's work have neglected the political context of the work's execution and reception. Pane specifically referenced the Vietnam War when she described her intention with Escalade non anesthésiée. Accordingly, this article links her performance to art sociologique - a term applied to a range of politicized works produced in Paris in the wake of the May 68 events - and thereby to the politics of the Internationale Situationniste. Stressing the importance of the concept of alienation in the discourse of the 1970s and in Pane's writings, this article argues that the masochistic elements of her performance were an attempt to end collective passivity. This collective de-anesthetization was carried out by Pane through the photo-documentation of her performance, in which she staged the image of a non-specific rather than individual body.<br>

Abstract: Los estudios sociales sobre alimentación y las autoridades responsables de este campo coinciden en resaltar la situación paradójica del comensal actual: se sabe cómo se debe comer pero no se come como se debe. Enfrentarse con éxito a las paradojas suele requerir un cierto distanciamiento —lingüístico y disciplinar— que ofrezca la suficiente perspectiva. Aquí se propone hacerlo desde la perspectiva histórica que una sociología de la utopía puede aportar al conflicto entre imaginarios alimentarios. Para ello, este artículo revisará los elementos comunes del pensamiento utópico/distópico en orden a extraer las categorías de mayor interés para un análisis sociológico de las políticas y comportamientos alimentarios. Después, recorreremos los modos en que algunas de las utopías clásicas han enfocado —o desenfocado— la cuestión de la comida e intentaremos sacar algunas conclusiones. Social studies on food and nutritional authorities coincide in emphasizing the paradoxical situation of the modern eater: people know how they should eat but do not eat as they should. Dealing with paradoxes successfully usually requires a certain —linguistic and disciplinary— distance to gain sufficient perspective. We suggest this should be done from the historical perspective that a sociology of utopia offers on the conflict between food imaginaries. To this end, we outline the common elements of utopian/dystopian thought in order to extract the categories of major interest for a sociological analysis of food policies and eating behaviours. Subsequently, we trace the ways in which some classical utopias and dystopias have focused on —or blurred— the question of food and we try to draw some conclusions.<br>

Article Title: The Difference She Makes: Staging Gender Identity in Graffigny's "Phaza"<br>
Publisher: University of Tulsa<br>
Issue: i40063225<br>
Date: 10 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Bostic Heidi<br>
Abstract: Françoise de Graffigny's mid-eighteenth-century play Phaza features a main character who is unknowingly crossed dressed as male. The text provides a rich starting point for exploring questions of gender identity and performance. This article situates Phaza within the fairy-tale tradition in which women authors played a major role. Its analysis draws upon philosophies of narrative identity and theories of gender to show that identity comprises both permanence and performance. Reading Graffigny can make an important difference in our understanding of gender, authorship, and relations between the sexes in Enlightenment France. Phaza's masquerade sheds light on the ways in which women authors of the era approached and assumed various gender identities. Eighteenth-century texts like Phaza reveal a lineage of ideas that continue to influence feminist thought today and will do so in the future.<br>

Article Title: THE DIALECTICS OF JAMESON'S DIALECTICS<br>
Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>
Issue: i40063720<br>
Date: 2 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Jameson Fredric<br>
Abstract: This review essay attempts to understand the book under review against the background of Jameson's previous writings. Failing to do so would invite misunderstanding since there are few contemporary theorists whose writing forms so much of a unity. Jameson's book can be divided into three parts. The first and most important part deals with dialectics, the second with politics, and the third with philosophy of history. In the first part Jameson argues that dialectics best captures our relationship to the sociocultural and historical world we are living in. The second part makes clear that Jameson is not prepared to water down his own Marxist politics in order to spare the liberal sensibilities of his political opponents. In the third part Jameson develops his own philosophy of history, mainly in a dialogue with Ricoeur. Dialectics is his main weapon in his discussion with Ricoeur, and it becomes clear that the Spinozism of dialectics allows for a better understanding of history and of historical writing than does Ricoeur's phenomenological approach. The book is an impressive testimony to the powers of dialectical thought and to its indispensability for a proper grasp of historical writing.<br>

Abstract: Cet article propose une réflexion sur la place de la diachronie et de la synchronie dans la recherche sociale, en partant de l'une des contradictions indépassables pour toute appréhension du temps. Celui-ci peut être pensé sous l'angle de la concomitance (dont chacun a fait l'expérience et qui revient à penser le temps comme une «succession de présents différents») ou sous l'angle des processus (c'est-à-dire de la modification permanente des conditions de l'expérience en fonction d'une differentiation entre passé, présent et futur). Nous nous interrogerons sur ce que signifie travailler dans la diachronie ou dans la synchronie, en soulignant notamment la difficulté à distinguer clairement les deux approches: de nombreuses recherches habituellement pensées comme diachroniques ne le sont peut-être pas et, réciproquement, des approches pensées comme synchroniques s'articulent presque nécessairement avec une pensée des processus. This article proposes a reflection on the place of the synchrony-diachrony distinction in social research. The understanding of time is structured by a recurring contradiction: time can be thought of in terms of "concomitant experiences" (time appears in that perspective as a "succession of different presents") or in terms of "processes" (insisting on the permanent modifications of social life on the basis of a differentiation between past, present and future). I will try to present as clearly as possible diachronic and synchronie approaches, before stressing the difficulty to separate them: some researches usually thought of as diachronic might include other dimensions, while conversely, investigations presented as synchronie almost necessarily articulate processual perspectives.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40073035<br>
Date: 5 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): DIETZ MARY G.<br>
Abstract: A ristotle lived during a period of unprecedented imperial expansionism initiated by the kings of Macedon, but most contemporary political theorists confine his political theorizing to the classical Greek city-state. For many, Aristotle's thought exhibits a parochial Hellenocentric "binary logic" that privileges Greeks over non-Greeks and betrays a xenophobic suspicion of aliens and foreigners. In response to these standard "polis-centric" views, I conjure a different perceptual field—"between polis and empire"—within which to interpret Aristotle's Politics. Both theorist and text appear deeply attentive to making present immediate things "coming to be and passing away" in the Hellenic world. Moreover, "between polis and empire," we can see the Politics actually disturbing various hegemonic Greek binary oppositions (Greek/barbarian; citizen/alien; center/periphery), not reinforcing them. Understanding Politics within the context of the transience of the polis invites a new way of reading Aristotle while at the same time providing new possibilities for theorizing problems of postnational citizenship, transnational politics, and empire.<br>

Abstract: LISA M. DOLLING reviews Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand, edited by Mimi Reisel Gladstein and Chris Matthew Sciabarra. The anthology attempts to re-read Rand's work in light of important feminist issues and to locate it in the context of debates current in feminist discourse. Dolling argues that the book—which contains nineteen articles by philosophers, psychologists, literary theorists, and numerous others—is an important step toward bringing fresh attention to Rand's thought and toward the canon-transformation called for by contemporary scholars.<br>

Journal Title: Language in Society<br>
Article Title: The Things We Do with Words: Ilongot Speech Acts and Speech Act Theory in Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i393665<br>
Date: 8 1, 1973<br>
Author(s): Voloshinov Michelle Z.<br>
Abstract: I begin by introducing the Ilongots and some of their attitudes toward speech. Whereas most modern theorists think of language as a tool designed primarily to "express" or to "refer," Ilongots think of language first in terms of action. They see commands as the exemplary act of speech, displaying less concern for the subjective meanings that an utterance conveys than for the social contexts in which utterances are heard. An ethnographic sketch thus outlines how Ilongots think of words and how their thought relates to aspects of their practice -- providing an external foil for theorists found closer to home. Speech Act Theory is discussed and questioned first on internal grounds, as an approach that recognizes but slights important situational and cultural constraints on forms of language use. A consideration of the application of Searle's taxonomy of acts of speech to Ilongot categories of language use then leads to a clarification of the individualistic and relatively asocial biases of his essentially intra-cultural account. Last, I return to Ilongot directives. A partial analysis of Ilongot acts of speech provides the basis for a statement of the ways in which indigenous categories are related to the forms that actions take, as both of these, in turn, reflect the sociocultural ordering of local worlds.<br>

Abstract: Contemporary poetry, since Rimbaud and Mallarmé, invests issues which used to be the preserve of rational philosophy, while philosophy since Nietzsche makes greater use of poetic expressivity. The convergence is towards the sensory focus of perception, rational thought, and expression, the body; but, except at the limits, philosophy establishes concepts, poetry speaks from within.<br>

Abstract: History is a passage from an « I-truth » to a « He-truth » through an « Ustruth » where the nature of who resides in the us, and the capacity for it to an assumed « We-truth », determines the transformation into a « He-truth » - with the pitfall that an « I-truth » can disguise as a « He-truth » by restricting its « Us » aspects, and anyway be read as such. Reading Learning Each Other's Historical Narrative through the prism of Greek history and political thought enables it to be seen as a step in the direction of the constitution of a « we » encompassing what are as yet two « us »'s... L'histoire est un passage d'un « Je-vrai » à un « Il-vrai » au travers d'un « On-vrai » , où la question de qui se tient derrière ce « on » et de sa capacité à assumer un « nous » détermine le passage au « Il-vrai » -avec le risque qu'un « Je-vrai » peut se déguiser en « Il-vrai » en restreignant l'accès au « On », et en tout cas peut toujours être lu ainsi. La lecture d'Histoire de l'autre au moyen du filtre de l'histoire et de la pensée politique grecques permet de le voir comme une étape dans la construction d'un « nous » rassemblant ce qui ne sont pour le moment que deux « on »...<br>

Abstract: Le long sillon tracé par Jean-Claude Coquet pour labourer le champ d'une sémiotique phénoménologique (qu'elle soit nommée « subjectale », « du continu », « continuiste », ou encore « des instances ») ne pouvait qu'être... sensible au sensible. À travers plusieurs interventions des dernières années (de l'ouvrage de 2007 sur le jeu de phusis et de logos jusqu'à une communication vénitienne de 2010), on cherche à discerner quelques vertus d'une telle approche : ce qu'elle permet d'entrevoir pour traiter la question de l'empêtrement, ce qu'elle autorise à penser de la problématique du kairos, et, dans le prolongement, ce qu'elle appelle à approfondir pour lire certain tableau de plate peinture. Jean-Claude Coquet has long dug furrows in order to prepare the field for a phenomenological semiotics (a semiotics variously dubbed "subjectal", "of continuity", "continuistic", or yet "grounded in its ' instances'"), and his endeavour could only be... sensitive to the sensible universe. Through a number of recent works (from the 2007 work on the play of Phusis and Logos to a talk in Venice in 2010), the virtues of such an approach are articulated: what it enables us to catch a glimpse of pertaining to certain issues regarding the question of entanglement (empêtrement), what it allows us to think about other issues pertinent to the problematic of kairos, and, going forward, what needs to be thought through in order to read a given work of plain painting.<br>

Abstract: La época que nos ha tocado vivir, que, a falta de mejores términos, denominamos tentativamente "globalización," provoca el entretejido de una malla virtual que aglutina privilegiadas zonas de contacto e ignorados ghettos de exclusión, así como irreconciliables identidades monolíticas y múltiples (individuales, locales, étnicas, religiosas, de género, de preferencias sexuales, nacionales, mundiales... et al.); fragmentaciones, opacidades, pro-, proto-, pos-, antinaciones, transnaciones, translenguas, transculturas... La novela Rojo, amarillo y verde, del autor boliviano-quebequés-canadiense-planetario Alejandro Saravia, es representativa del titubeante imaginario planetario que comienza a perfilarse. Lejos de ser una apología celebratoria de la "aldea global," este multifacético imaginario propone un contrapeso dialógico al monólogo del pensamiento único que pretende imponernos el capitalismo globalizante. La période que nous vivons, que nous nommons provisoirement la "mondialisation" à défaut de meilleurs termes, provoque l'entre-tissage d'un réseau virtuel agglutinant des zones de contact privilégiées et des ghettos d'exclusion ignorés; des identités monolithiques et multiples irréconciliables (individuelles, locales, ethniques, religieuses, de genre, d'orientations sexuelles, nationales, mondiales... et al.); des fragmentations, des opacités, des pro-, proto-, post-, anti-nations, des trans-nations, des trans-langues, des trans-cultures... Le roman Rojo, amarillo y verde, de l'auteur bolivien-québécois-canadien-planétaire Alejandro Saravia, est représentatif du chancelant imaginaire planétaire qui commence à se profiler. Loin d'être une apologie célébratoire du "Village global," cet imaginaire aux mille visages propose un contrepoids dialogique au monologue de la pensée unique, celle que le capitalisme mondialisant essaie de nous imposer. The age we find ourselves living in which, for lack of a better term, we tentatively call "globalization" provokes the interwea~<br>

Abstract: Because Hobbes is understood to be a proto-liberal thinker, a great deal hinges on how we understand his writings. Does he contribute to the development of a purely secular political self-understanding, as many liberals today claim? And, by extension, does that mean that liberal thought today best stands on a purely secular foundation? What, then, should we make of the extensive theological speculation throughout his Leviathan! Here, I argue that to reconcile the seemingly purely secular claims in Leviathan with the obviously religious claims found there we must move beyond reading him in terms of what I here call 'the fable of liberalism', and comprehend Leviathan as a whole in terms of Reformation era debates between Protestants and Roman Catholics about the limits and purview of reason. Understood in that way we see his claims about 'reason' in a new and important light. Rather than being an inevitable development that comes to supercede honour and glory, as the fable of liberalism suggests, 'reason' is seen to have an historically contingent character, whose parameters are established by wagers about the meaning of religious experience.<br>

Abstract: Le but de notre article est d'essayer de montrer en quoi l'expérience rédactionnelle et éditoriale de l'Histoire socialiste de la Révolution française fut pour Jaurès, hormis le prétexte pédagogique évident pour préparer les dirigeants à l'unité du mouvement socialiste encore divisé et pour éduquer politiquement les militants et le prolétariat, l'occasion d'affiner sa réflexion sur une future « méthode socialiste », à la veille de l'unité de 1905. Parce que « la Révolution française contient le socialisme tout entier », quels sont donc les événements que Jaurès juge les plus pertinents et les plus féconds pour l'avenir socialiste de la société et de l'État ? Rappelant le contexte et les conditions de cette grande entreprise, nous nous sommes attachés à retrouver ce qui fonde philosophiquement sa démarche et ses analyses historiques - spécialement au cours du « moment thermidorien » - à partir de sa méthode philosophique adossée à sa métaphysique de l'unité de l'être. Une esquisse, en somme, de l'analyse critique jaurésienne de la « dictature jacobine » et de l'esprit révolutionnaire de Robespierre conditionnant le socialisme réformiste gradualiste de Jaurès. The article attempts to show how the writing and editing of the Socialist History of the French Revolution was for Jaurès not merely a self-evident pretext to enlighten others, unify the still divided leaders of the socialist movement and educate politically the party faithful and the proletariat, but also an opportunity to finetune his reflections on a future « socialist methodology » on the eve of the union of 1905. Given that « the French Revolution contains socialism in its entirety », what then were the events that Jaurès thought most relevant and fruitful for the socialist future of society and state ? While recalling the context and conditions of this great venture, our aim has been to retrieve the philosophical essence of his historical approach and analysis, especially during the « moment of Thermidor »~<br>

Abstract: O propósito do artigo é determinar a situação do pensamento de Dilthey no contexto da hermenêutica. Objetiva primordialmente, assim, determinar se a hermenêutica diltheyana seria filosófica ou se ainda se enquadraria na qualificação de clássica (=tradicional). Secundariamente, o trabalho ainda intenta caracterizar de modo breve a situação histórica na qual o pensamento de Dilthey se ambienta, e apresentar, por meio do projeto de fundamentação das ciências humanas, os pressupostos diltheyanos e alguns conceitos fundamentais de seu pensamento. As hipóteses a serem validadas são as seguintes: a) existe no pensamento diltheyano uma intuição filosófica; b) tal intuição filosófica se evidencia no propósito crítico, na preocupação ontognoseológica e na visada psicológica que a obra tardia do filósofo possuirá; c) em seu modo de operação, a hermenêutica de Dilthey ainda é metódica e, portanto, clássica (não-filosófica). The aim of the essay is to determine the status of Dilthey's thought in the context of hermeneutics. It aims to to determine, first, whether the hermeneutics by Dilthey would be philosophical or if it would still be classical (=traditional). The work also seeks to characterize the historical situation in which Dilthey's thoughts settles, and to present, through the project of foundation of human sciences, his assumptions and some fundamental concepts of his thought. The hypotheses to be validated are the following: a) there is a philosophical intuition in Dilthey's thought; b) the content of the philosophical thought of Dilthey shows itself in his critical purpose, in his ontognoseological concern and in the psychological perspective in the late work of the philosopher, c) in their mode of operation, the hermeneutics of Dilthey is still methodic and therefore classical (non-philosophical).<br>

Abstract: O artigo aborda o pensamento de Emmanuel Lévinas a partir de duas perspectivas distintas mas complementares: numa primeira fase, recorrendo ao romance de guerra de Erich M. Remarque intitulado A l'Ouest Rien de Nouveau (Im Westen Nichts Neues), procuraremos, com a ajuda de Jacques Derrida e de René Girard, desconstruir o pensamento de Lévinas, sustentando a ideia de que o "Humanismo do Outro Homem" contém vestígios de violência dissimulados percebíveis, quer a partir da interpretação levinasiana do referido romance, quer no modo como Lévinas resolve o problema da legítima defesa; numa segunda fase, demonstraremos que a restauração do pensamento de Lévinas passa, por um lado, pela noção de "filialidade" (e não a de "Rosto" ou a de "substituição"), a pedra basilar não corrosiva do pensamento de Lévinas e, por outro lado, pela ideia de que a "desfiguração" da fenomenologia e da ontologia, operada pelo autor, é aparente uma vez que estas não obstruam a alteridade mas antes a tornam possível. The article deals with the thought of Emmanuel Levinas using two distinct but complementary perspectives: in a first phase, using the war novel by Erich M. Remarque entitled A l'Ouest Rien de Nouveau (Im Westen Nichts Neues), we will try, with the help of Jacques Derrida and René Girard, deconstruct the thought of Levinas, supporting the idea that the "Humanism of the Other Man" contains traces of perceivable covert violence, either from the Levinasian interpretation of the Novel, or in the way that Levinas solves the problem of self-defense; in a second phase, we will demonstrate that restoration of Levinas's thought is, on one hand, the notion of "filiality" (and not 'Face' or 'exchange'), the cornerstone non--corrosive of Levinas's thought, on the other hand, by using the idea of 'defacement' of phenomenology and ontology, used by the author, is apparent since they do not obstruct the alterity but rather becomes it possible.<br>

Abstract: Ensaio expositivo e interpretativo das perguntas sobre a natureza humana e das respostas que o pensamento moderno, em Merlin Donald e outros, vai dando. A perspetiva fisicalista, neurobiológica, é analisada a partir de Joseph LeDoux, e outros, comentando as suas teses principáis. É dada ênfase particular à evolução das capacidades da mente humana na transiçao da cultura mimética para a cultura oral, a criaçao mítica e o advento da escrita e das outras formas de cultura exterior simbólica. Na crítica ao monismo fisicalista é discutido o que se pode entender por qualia e de que modo este entendimento justifica a aceitação de um "hiato explicativo" como o pensam Urbano Sidoncha e outros autores. É abordada a relaçao entre Pensamento e Linguagem a partir de Lev Vygotsky. Considerando a ética como um qualia procura-se fixar, empíricamente, a diferença entre ética e eticidade como contraponto à diferença entre autoconsciência e consciência cognitiva. Como proposta final é apresentada uma pergunta radical e oferecida urna temeraria resposta sobre o possível conhecimento total da natureza humana. Expository and interpretive essay of the questions on human nature and the responses that modern thought, in Merlin Donald et al., has been producing. The physicalist, neurobiological perspective is analysed as from Joseph LeDoux et al., by commenting on his main theses. Particular emphasis is given to the evolution of the human mind's capacities in the transition from the mimetic culture to the oral culture, the mythical creation and the advent of writing and the other forms of external symbolic culture. In the critique of the physicalist monism, one discusses what can be understood by qualia and how this understanding justifies the acceptance of an 'explanatory hiatus' such as Urbano Sidoncha and other authors think. The relationship between Thought and Language, as from Lev Vygotsky, is addressed. Considering ethics as a qualia, one tries to establish, in an empirical way, the d~<br>

Abstract: The article is intended to indicate how the study of written and cultural texts may be used to approach the problem of identifying the system of thought characteristic of particular groups. Certain premises of what may be called an “interpretative paradigm” have been selected to create a theoretical starting-point, and in this context the most suggestive appear to be the concept of culture developed by symbolic anthropology, the cultural-semiotic concept of text and the multi-dimensional hermeneutic approach to textual intepretation. The author therefore seeks to bring together, in addition to the general features ofinterpetative ethnology, certain theoretical and methodological starting-points derived from the three approaches mentioned. One may approach the problem of understanding of a foreign testimony via “adequate interpretation”. Here, to understand means to adopt the cultural “language” of a message as one's own, and to interpret and so transfer the unknown into an accessible code, most often one's own code. The process of interpretation is understood as the discovery of the hidden content behind the apparent stirface, and in this activity the understanding of culturally remote testimony is axiomatically taken to bepossible and communicable. In a broader epistemological context we can see in adequate intepretation one of the means to the never-ending process of correction of our pre-judged knowledge. In a spirit of critical rationalism we could deflne such interpretation as the working hypothesis that may be falsified by further Scientific activity and then replaced by a better theory. Such conclusions on the methodological range of the interpretative approach indicate only one of the possible syntheses of various epistemological paradigms, for the theoretical use and application of which ethnology seems especially suited.<br>

Abstract: In recent times, under the influence of postmodernist thought sociology has largely rejected the idea of social evolution. An exception to this trend is to be found in the work of Jürgen Habermas. Habermas's account of social evolution has received some critical attention, but in sociology wider detail of the picture is not well known. Habermas wishes to hold to the possibility that evolutionary progress can be discerned not only in the sphere of technical control, but also in the sphere of social and moral development. The paper presents Habermas's views on social evoluton within the wider context of his development of critical theory as a 'reconstructive science'. It suggests that his account has been able to resist many of the standard criticisms of evolutionary theory and that a renewal of interest in this area could provide a rich vein of new sociological knowledge.<br>

Abstract: The public/private debate has not been a major feature in recent sociological theory. However; Bailey (2000) has argued for a renewed sociological research programme to focus on the sociological private. He outlines three dimensions of this: intimate relationships, the self and the unconscious. This article seeks to address two of these dimensions, the production of self-theories and unconscious disavowal. We extend this theorizing to account for the experience of sexual engagement present a discourse analysis of the diaries of the comedian and actor Kenneth Williams (1928-1988). Drawing principally on the thought of Merleau-Ponty (1962) we argue that our analysis demonstrates the importance of a prereflective engagement with the social world that is then reflected on in internal dialogue. We show how discourse analysis may be used to demonstrate the discursive production of a self-theory and the role of such a self-theory in the disavowal of the principal's pre-reflective engagement with others.<br>

Abstract: Over the past few years there has been an increasing interest in the use of psychoanalytic ideas within a sociological framework These ideas have been largely developed within sociological theory rather than practice. There does, however, seem to be a new frame of thought and practice emerging which we could term psycho-social studies, perhaps even a new discipline in its own right In this article I will discuss the development of the use of psychoanalytic ideas around sociological issues, explore some of the tensions that have arisen and evaluate the implications for methodological practice.<br>

Publisher: Routledge<br>
Issue: i394465<br>
Date: 10 1, 1973<br>
Author(s): White James<br>
Abstract: This article considers the consequences of new reading histories that have pursued the question of reading practices -- how people read texts, rather than just who readers were and what it was that they read. New theoretical considerations widen our appreciation of the difficulty in recovering the history of reading, but they must also confront the limitations and peculiarities of the evidence available. Using eighteenth-century England as a case study, the article reviews recent work -- much from diverse research not usually associated with reading history -- and assesses the potential for future study. Important questions about the relationship between literature, belief and action, about the nature of 'popular' and 'elite' culture, about the archaeology of political and social thought, and about the dissemination and control of ideas, cannot be determined without asking what reading meant. Such enquiry is particularly rewarding in writing the history of the transitional and diverse society of eighteenth-century England. It also reinforces concern that pursuit of new reading histories through an exploration of reading practice can marginalise the evaluation of change by concentrating on an examination of the singular and the synchronic.

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113403<br>
Date: 4 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Ronen Ruth<br>
Abstract: Temporal concepts such as "order," "chronology," "narrative present," and "exposition" are extensively used in narrative theory. Accepted notions of time can contribute to our understanding of these concepts and can allow us to question their "temporal" meaning in the context of fictional narrative. Fictional time may be thought of as a system of relations unique to the fictional world after real time. Theories of narrative tend to adopt an essentialist interpretation of temporal concepts and to ignore the ontological divergence between time in fiction and time in reality. As a result, concepts such as "exposition" or "present" appear which appear to carry a direct "temporal" meaning, actually function in a way that indicates the nature of time in fiction. In fiction, temporal divisions and time segmentations do not just construct a temporal structure; they also mark degrees of factuality in the fictional world.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113404<br>
Date: 7 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Gordon Paul<br>
Abstract: Largely due to Benveniste's dismissal ("Language in Freudian Theory," 1951), Freud's review essay of the philologist Karl Abel's "Über den Gegensinn der Urworte" ("On the Antithetical Sense of Primary Words") has been ignored or slighted by most critics of Freud's thought, even those influenced by Lacan's linguistic emphasis. Nonetheless, the essay on "primary antithetical meaning" (Ur-worte) should be of great importance for psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic approaches to art, for it explicitly addresses Freud's persistent identification of the unconscious with antithetical modes of thought. Benveniste's positivist dismissal is relevant to psychoanalysis in general (Freud's theories of bisexuality, Lutschen, and castration fear) and psychoanalytic studies of art in particular (Freud's essays on the "uncanny" in E. T. A. Hoffmann, Friedrich Hebbel's "Judith und Holofernes," Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, and so on.).<br>

Date: 10 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Stampfl Barry<br>
Abstract: Narratology may be thought of as a complicated system of conceptual filters that enact a severe formalist reduction upon the corpus of what may be thought and said about storytelling. According to Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, this reductiveness needs to be expanded in order to attend more to language. One way of answering to her reformist prescription is a turn to the study of linguistic surface structure organized as a meditation on the metaphor of the filter. For Seymour Chatman this metaphor designates a character through whom a narrator elects to tell a story. For Max Black, "filter" is a trope for metaphoric process. Examining these senses of the filter in Henry James's short story "The Beast in the Jungle" leads to emphasis upon negations and belief qualifiers. In James's story, both turn out to be invaded by the logic of Freudian negation, itself a type of intrapsychic filtration.<br>

Abstract: An elaboration and defense of the "interaction view of metaphor" introduced in the author's earlier study, "Metaphor" (1962). Special attention is paid to the explication of the metaphors used in the earlier account. The topics discussed include: selection of the "targets" of the theory; classification of metaphors; how metaphorical statements work; relations between metaphors and similes; metaphorical thought; criteria of recognition; the "creative" aspects of metaphors; the ontological status of metaphors. Metaphors are found to be more closely connected with background models than has previously been recognized. Elaboration et défense de la « conception interactive de la métaphore » présentée par l'auteur dans une étude antérieure Metaphor (1962). Une attention particulière est vouée à l'explication des exemples de métaphores utilisés dans la précédente étude. Les sujets discutés comprennent: sélection des buts de la théorie; classification des métaphores; comment fonctionnent les énoncés métaphoriques; relations entre-métaphores et termes voisins; pensée métaphorique; critères de reconnaissance; les aspects « créatifs » des métaphores; le statut ontologique des métaphores. Les métaphores apparaissent comme étant plus étroitement liées à des modèles sous-jacents qu'on ne l'avait précédemment soupçonné. Es handelt sich um eine Ausarbeitung und Verteidigung der «interaction view of metaphor», die der Autor schon in einer früheren Arbeit, Metaphor (1962), vertreten hat. Besondere Aufmerksamkeit wird der Erklärung von Metaphern geschenkt, die in der früheren Betrachtung verwendet worden sind. Unter den diskutierten Fragen finden wir: Auswahl der «Ziele» der Theorie; die Klassifikation der Metaphern; die Art des Funktionierens von metaphorischen Aussagen; die Beziehungen zwischen Metaphern und Vergleichen; das metaphorische Denken; Kriterien für den Entscheid, wann wir es mit einer Metapher zu tun haben; die «schöpferischen» Aspekte von Metaphern; der ontologische Sta~<br>

Abstract: En suivant le mouvement circulaire que dessine l'ouvrage fondamental d'Éric Weil, la « Logique de la Philosophie », on relève d'un même coup le penser qui s'y déploie et le rôle qu'y tiennent l'idée de Dieu, la foi biblique et le christianisme. On analyse d'abord la catégorie de Dieu, introduite dans le monde par l'attitude de la foi biblique. On note ensuite ce que devient l'idée de Dieu dans les catégories ultérieures. L'examen des catégories du sens et de la sagesse, constitutives de la philosophie, permet de voir comment le logicien recueille à sa manière le sur-être indicible de la tradition philosophique occidentale, sous la forme du sens présent, de l'éternité de la présence dans le temps de l'histoire. On manifeste enfin, à travers l'écart, quelques convergences entre cette philosophie séculière et la pensée d'un croyant. In the circular movement of the main work of Eric Weil, the « Logique de la Philosophie », we may notice both the development of the thought and the part played by the idea of God, the biblical faith and Christianity. The category of God, introduced by the behaviour of biblical faith, is analysed, and also how the idea of God appears in further categories. By examining categories of meaning and wisdom, proper to philosophy, we may see what means, for the logician, the ineffable over-being of the Western philosophical tradition, as a present meaning, as an eternal presence in historical time. At last appears, through the difference, some convergence between this secular philosophy and the thought of a believer.<br>

Abstract: Afin de justifier l'élaboration et l'usage d'une phénoménologie de l'imagination poétique, on montrera comment le langage poétique permet selon le mot de P. Ricoeur « d'articuler une expérience fictive » en dégageant l'« illusion » qui s'attache à la lecture de l'objet poétique. Avec Bachelard on verra comment l'image poétique apparaît comme une aurore de parole et un être nouveau. On verra comment le phénoménologue n'oublie jamais que l'expérience poétique situe le poème dans « le pays de la vérité » et s'efforce de le saisir comme essence, Wesenschau. Mais comme d'autre part une illusion fondamentale s'attache à la lecture de l'œuvre poétique, on évoquera la pensée de Nietzsche qui se déploie dans le jeu de l'illusion et de la vérité. L'artiste est cet illusionniste sublime qui nous fait sentir comme réel le monde des phénomènes. On terminera par une définition du poète comme celui qui nomme et par sa nomination fait être, fait l'Être apparaissant et transparent. To justify a phenomenology of poetic imagination we show how through poetical language a fictitious experience can be articulated, as says P. Ricoeur, by sifting out the « illusion » which pertains to the reading of the poetical object. According to Bachelard poetical image appears as a dawn of words and a new being. The phenomenologist never forgets that according to poetical experience a poem dwells in the « land of truth » and should be grasped as an essence, « Wesenschau ». But, as a fundamental illusion clings to the reading of a poetical work, we shall remember Nietzsche whose thought dwells in the play of illusion and truth. Thanks to the artist as a sublime conjurer we feel real the world of phenomena. To end, a poet is someone who names and, by doing so, makes being appearing and transparent.<br>

Abstract: La rencontre entre la philosophie de Lukacs et la pensée ontologique de Nicolai Hartmann est un sujet rarement abordé dans Vhistoriographiephilosophique. Le contact avec les grands travaux ontologiques de Hartmann a joué pourtant un rôle décisif dans la genèse de l'Ontologie de l'être social, l'ouvrage qui a couronné le long parcours intellectuel et politique de Lukacs. Le texte se propose d'èclaircir l'affinité profonde qui se fait jour entre deux pensées que tout semblait séparer. Hartmann cultivait la philosophia perennis, élevée au-dessus des contingences socio-historiques, Lukacs, philosophe engagé dans les batailles du siècle, bâtissait une oeuvre saturée dépensée marxienne. Il existe néanmoins de significatifs traits d'union : la critique de la phénoménologie de Husserl, la critique des courants néo-positivistes et surtout de fortes réserves à l'égard de Heidegger. The encounter between Lukacs'philosophy and ontological thought of Nicolai Hartmann is a seldom tackled topic in philosophical historiography. The contact with Hartmann's great ontological works played a key role in the genesis of Ontology of Social Being, the work which has crowned the intellectual and political course of Lukacs. This paper aims to clear up the deep affinity between two historical thoughts that all seemed to separate. Hartmann cultivated a philosophia perennis above socio-historical contingences, while Lukacs, an engaged philosopher in the battles of the century, built a work which was saturated with Marxian thought. There are nevertheless significant links between them : a critique of Husserlian phenomenology, a critique of neo-positivist currents and, above all, strong rervation with regard to Heidegger.<br>

Abstract: Avec l'avènement récent des neurosciences cognitives, le problème corps-esprit passait du registre traditionnel de la réflexion philosophique au domaine factuel de l'investigation scientifique. Une possible réduction de la pensée à ses infrastructures cérébrales rencontre cependant des ècueils d'ordre épistémologique considérables. C'est dans l'aval de ces problèmes impliquant le nouveau dialogue des neurosciences avec les réalités cliniques que s'inscrit l'étude présentée. Dans ce contexte de discussion sont abordés les fondements théoriques des neurosciences contemporaines comme la mise en perspective des recherches sur le cerveau dans le discours actuel des sciences humaines. Tout en considérant l'importance heuristique des recherches conduites sur les instances neurocognitives et sur la matérialité tissulaire des intégrations psychophysiologiques, les travaux présentés tendent à montrer que les relations fonctionnelles tissées entre le cerveau et la pensée ne sauraient se déchiffrer sur la base théorique des seules herméneutiques réductives. Si le tissu nerveux implique dans ses vecteurs de causalité la manifestation potentielle de comportements adaptatifs progressivement plus complexes, le tissu cérébral n'implique pas directement dans ses virtualités fonctionnelles la manifestation de l'esprit. A cet égard, les travaux abordés soulignent au niveau de la réflexion critique comme sur le plan de l'analyse factuelle que l'émergence de la pensée n'enracine pas sa nécessité dans la complexité des connexions neuronales. Arguments et propos qui tendent à réviser les nouveaux paradigmes neurophilosophiques de la vie mentale intéressant le substantialisme de la conscience et la dimension logistique de l'esprit. Some metaphysical aspects concerned with the mind-body problem are approached in these theoretical studies involving the new neuronal materialism.

Abstract: L'ontologie heideggérienne de l'être-pour-la-mort a souvent servi de référence négative à Paul Ricoeur. Il lui a très tôt opposé trois thèses qu'il n'aurait peut-être pas formulées s'il n'avait pas croisé la philosophie de Jaspers: a) « La naissance signifie plus que la mort » ; b) « la rencontre décisive avec la mort est la mort de l'être aimé » ; c) « la mortalité elle-même doit être pensée sub specie vitae et non sub specie mortis ». La première thèse conditionne les deux suivantes. Elle introduit une phénoménologie de l' « être-envie » qui en appelle de la vie reçue à la vie transmise. On objectera peut-être que la phénoménologie de l'être-en-vie suppose l'ontologie de l'être-pour-la-mort. Mais, même si c'était le cas, elle n'en transformerait pas moins profondément la signification. La compréhension de l'existence est affectée elle-même par les phénomènes de la vie reçue et transmise. C'est ce que veut dire cette expression: « exister vivant ». L'angoisse de la fin n'annule pas la joie des commencements. Peut-être même reçoit-elle de celle-ci son sens. Paul Ricoeur has often referred to Heidegger's ontology of being-towards-death to oppose it. He early set against it three thesis that he might have formulated differently had he not studied Jasper's philosophy : a) « birth means more than death » ; b) « the decisive encounter with death is the death of the loved one » ; c) « mortality itself must be thought sub specie vitae, not sub specie mortis ». From the first thesis, can be inferred the two others. It brings in a phenomenology of being-alive. One may raise the objection that the phenomenology of being-alive presupposes the ontology of being-towards-death. But even so it would be necessarily transform its meaning. The understanding of existence is itself affected by the phenomena of life as given and received. Such is the meaning of the phrase: « existing alive ». The distress of the end never cancels the joy of the beginnings. It may even get its sense from~<br>

Abstract: La critique phénoménologique de la métaphysique a opposé « l'intuition » à la « représentation », et le débat philosophique contemporain une phénoménologie « minimaliste » à une phénoménologie « maximaliste ». Face à ces alternatives, l'approfondissement weilien de l'expérience n'oppose ni la présence et l'absence, ni le fini et l'absolu, mais cherche à éprouver et penser le lien qui les unit, à partir de la structure trinitaire du don de l'être. À distance d'une médiation extériorisante comme d'une immanence pure, le processus de révélation n'est jamais négateur du mystère, mais en manifeste au contraire la profondeur. Ainsi, depuis la perception jusqu'à l'amour surnaturel, « évidence » et « mystère » vont toujours de pair, ce qui permet de ne rejeter aucun des niveaux de l'être et de l'expérience. The phenomenological critique of metaphysics opposed intuition and representation as contemporary debates in philosophy opposed minimalist and maximalist phenomenologies. Confronted with these alternatives the Weilean thought of experience neither opposes presence and absence, nor finite and absolute, but it tries to verify and think what unites them - based on the Trinitarian structure of the giving of being. Standing apart from exteriorizing mediation as from pure immanence, the revelation process never makes ineffective the mystery but expresses its depth. Thus, from perception to supernatural love, 'obviousness' and 'mystery' go together, which allows not to reject any levels of being and experience.<br>

Abstract: À l'encontre d'une école récente d'interprétation qui tend à voir dans les Essais de Montaigne une pensée du renoncement à toute maîtrise de l'action, nous voulons montrer qu'il y a chez lui une authentique pensée de la prudence. Si les références aristotéliciennes et stoïciennes sont sollicitées par Montaigne, il reste que le caractère mouvant et imprévisible de la fortune ainsi que la part de fortuit inscrite dans l'être l'obligent à redéfinir les contours de la notion traditionnelle de prudence. À un premier niveau de prudence qui consiste à savoir agir dans le monde s'ajoute un second niveau, qui consiste à savoir se préserver face aux sollicitations du monde. Montaigne inaugure ainsi une pensée moderne de la prudence, qui trouvera, mutatis mutandis, une expression contemporaine chez Hannah Arendt, Georg Gadamer et Paul Ricœur. Contrary to a recent school of interpretation which aims to see in Montaigne's Essays a thought of renouncement to any control of action, we intend to show the presence of an authentic thought of prudence. If Montaigne refers to aristotelician and stoician texts, the unsettledness and unpredictableness of fortune, as well as the part of fortuitness which is part of the being, require him nevertheless to redefine the outlines of the traditionnal notion of prudence. To a first level of prudence, which consists in knowing how to act in the word, one must add a second level, which consists in knowing how to preserve oneself facing with word's appeals. Montaigne thus inaugurates a modern thought of prudence, which will find, mutatis mutandis, a contemporary expression in Hannah Arendt, Georg Gadamer and Paul Ricœur.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the content given to the term rhetoric and some of the history of its changes. It begins with the sophistic emphasis on persuasion as a means of coming to terms with the phenomenal world around us, through to a modern conception of rhetoric as a deconstructive and critical tool in analysing the power-play of meaning that constitutes texts. This paper tries to reflect on some of these changes, arguing that understanding the term implies that one must also examine the surplus of meaning that informs it. While the word rhetoric is highly ambiguous, this paper tries to demonstrate that such ambiguity need not be viewed as a trial and a hindrance in the search for a correct definition as a precursor for effective discussion on the subject. Instead it argues that an investigation into rhetoric's surplus of meaning is perhaps what constitutes effective discussion in the first place, and that further, such surplus of meaning is one that can be characterised as far more unified than commonly assumed which enables one do more with the term rhetoric than previously thought of, or allowed.

Abstract: This study, based largely on unpublished material, is an attempt to describe and evaluate how French Protestantism dealt with the German question in the postwar period. A short description of the perception of Germany by French Protestants towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century underlines the new approach which characterized the relations between French and German Protestants after the Second World War. In spite of the shattering defeat of the Third Reich, Germany remained in the eyes of many French Protestants a dreadful danger. However, already shortly after the war, some clergymen and laymen, many of whom had been involved in the resistance against the nazi regime, believed that their mission was to act as mediators and peacemakers despite the official hard-line diplomacy of their country. This article provides a selection of quotations of French Protestants' intentions and conceptions regarding the German question, as well as examining the ways and means they thought best to prevent Germany from becoming a new danger to France and Europe. It shows how seriously they debated all aspects of a common future with yesterday's enemy in a Europe of tomorrow, and affords an insight into how some Protestant personalities on both sides of the Rhine played an important role in the process of Franco-German reconciliation during the postwar period.<br>

Abstract: As a Catholic historian, this theme raises particular difficulties for me, since the notion of specific patterns of thought is one I would not use, and the term 'contemporary history' is much too vague. Of course, Catholic scholars, no less than their protestant counterparts, still recognize the need to raise questions about the nature of history and its analysis, despite the various unsuccessful attempts in the past when systematic theologians have failed to come to terms with the reality of historical events, as in the unhistorically conceived 'New Scholasticism'. The concept of 'freedom', for example, is one which requires new conceptualization in our present historical context. If we accept the current view that all rationalist theories of knowledge are in fact based on an act of 'faith', so we have to see that the belief in the primacy of 'Reason' cannot any longer be maintained. Which does not mean that we have to take flight into 'unreason', or abandon rational categories of thought. What we need to find is some manner by which 'faith' can be anchored as a final justification, over and above any transcendental basis. In our present pluralistic world this will have to be to presented in a variety of ways. But at least it calls for a new consideration of how to relate 'faith' and 'knowledge'.<br>

Abstract: En liant, à partir d'une approche phénoménologique, travail, individu et vie, Michel Henry propose un magistral éclairage de toute l'oeuvre de Marx en tant qu'elle est essentiellement une critique de l'économie et une ontologie sociale. La radicalité d'une telle philosophie économique n'est que très peu soulignée par la pensée marxiste contemporaine, qui n'a sans doute pas donné à l'interprétation Michel Henry l'importance qui est la sienne. Pour autant, sa notion d'individus vivants, ainsi hypostasiés de leurs conditions objectives d'existence, conduit Michel Henry à déformer l'anthropologie de Marx et à en affaiblir la dimension politique. The aim of this article is to show the full critical power of the subjective philosophy of living-labour which Michel Henry develops out of Marx. The radicality of such an economic philosophy was only underlined very little by the contemporary thought Marxist which, one knows it, does not give to the interpretation of Michel Henry the major importance which should be his. For all that, his notion of alive individuals, so taked out from their objective conditions of existence, leads Michel Henry to deform the anthropology of Marx and to weaken the political dimension.<br>

Abstract: Comme n'importe quel éditeur scientifique, l'économiste qui entend diffuser les écrits de ses prédécesseurs est confronté à une problématique invariable : publier quoi et comment, par delà le choix de qui. Les difficultés posées par cette problématique, dans le champ de notre discipline, ne se distinguent pas radicalement de celles qui interviennent dans d'autres domaines, y compris en littérature. Certes, le traitement de ces difficultés mobilise à de nombreux égards des compétences qui ne sont habituellement pas l'apanage de l'historien de la pensée économique, mais il requiert aussi des capacités analytiques que ce dernier a coutume de reconnaître comme les siennes propres. Il demeure que l'activité editoriale est une pratique savante à laquelle l'historien de la pensée économique n'accorde ordinairement que peu d'attention. Pourtant, puisque la littérature primaire dont s'alimente notre discipline est ici en jeu, l'affirmation institutionnelle et la diffusion de celle-ci dépendent d'une telle pratique. Like any other scientific editor, the economist who intends to spread the writings of his predecessors is faced with constant problems, beyond the question of who he will publish: what he should publish and how he should publish it. In the field of our discipline, the difficulties raised by these questions are not radically different from those which occur in other disciplines, including literature. Of course, in many respects dealing with these difficulties implies skills which are not usually the prerogative of the historian of economic thought. Nevertheless it also requires analytical abilities that the latter is in the habit of regarding as being his own. The fact remains that editing is a scholarly practice to which the historian of economic thought usually pays little attention. However, since the primary source materials that continue to be the foundation for research in our academic discipline are here at stake, its institutional recognition and spread dep~<br>

Abstract: Les deux courants de pensée politique arabe au Proche-Orient les plus marquants depuis la guerre des Six jours sont, d'une part, les théories palestiniennes de la révolution arabe, et, d'autre part, l'islamisation du socialisme arabe hérité de Nasser. Les textes fondamentaux du FPLP et du FDPLP, mais aussi les études, plus modérées, d'intellectuels proches du Fath et de l'OLP redonnent vie à des sensibilités politiques proche-orientales caractéristiques. En effet, la « révolution palestinienne » est vue expressément à la fois comme locale, provinciale, d'une part, et, d'autre part, comme nationale-arabe, et non comme étatique. Quant au socialisme arabe en quête d'islamisation, il bénéficie de la pensée sociale et politique des Frères musulmans. Socialisme arabe et socialisme islamique se rejoignent, avec en priorité un projet économique d'une urgence évidente. L'intégrisme et le fanatisme politiques des Frères se sont estompés. Cette remontée raisonnable de l'authenticité islamique offre peut-être la chance d'une ferveur mobilisatrice des masses arabes. Ces deux évolutions, chacune à sa façon, contestent la pensée politique héritée de l'Occident. Quelques penseurs arabes ont profité de la catastrophe de juin 1967 pour analyser les structures profondes des sociétés arabes actuelles : communautarisme, mentalité « poétique », et surtout expérience originale de l'appartenance nationale. Réflexions sociologiques assez indépendantes des pressions idéologiques pour aider à saisir un phénomène comme le « nationalisme arabe », par exemple. Since the Six-Day War, the two most prominent lines of Arab political thought in the Near East have been, on the one hand, the Palestinian theories of the Arab revolution and, on the other, the Islamisation of the Arab socialism inherited from Nasser. The basic texts put out by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Popular and Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PDFLP), and also the more moderate st~<br>

Abstract: A rebours de l'illusion rétrospective qui tend à ancrer le totalitarisme comme abolition de la démocratie dans le phénomène révolutionnaire lui-même, l'œuvre de Rosa Luxemburg se caractérise par l'exigence jamais abandonnée d'articuler révolution et démocratie. La révolution (dont la théorie apparaît dans Grève de masses, parti et syndicat) est chez elle la redécouverte par les masses de l'action politique : c'est ainsi qu'à partir de certaines catégories de pensée arendtienne on peut interpréter la notion de spontanéité, laquelle est auto-organisation et non violence. De plus, Rosa Luxemburg ne cessera de considérer comme essentielle la question de la forme de régime politique appropriée au pouvoir du peuple (d'où ses critiques adressées à la Révolution russe), s'inscrivant en faux contre la notion de « démocratie bourgeoise ». Refusant toute conception de l'action politique comme fabrication, commandement ou stratégie militaire, il y a chez elle une théorie de l'organisation politique d'inspiration machiavélienne, dont l'action est vue comme une intervention dans le présent et la contingence. Cette contingence reste toutefois inscrite dans le cadre fixé par Marx qui fait du conflit de classe la substance de l'action politique. Contrary to the retrospective illusion which tends to locate totalitarianism as abolition of democracy in the revolutionary phenomenon itself, Rosa Luxemburg's work is characterized by the ever present requirement to join revolution and democracy. Revolution (the theory of which appears in Mass strikes, parties and unions) is the masses' rediscovery of political action; one can thus, using certain categories of Arendt's thought, interpret the concept of spontaneity as self organization rather than violence. Moreover, Rosa Luxemburg never ceased considering as essential the issue of the form of political regime appropriate for popular power (which explains her criticism of the Russian revolution), and was opposed to the concept of "bourgeois ~<br>

Abstract: In Arendt's interrogations of political modernity, the concepts of history and politics have an ambiguous relation. On the one hand, she insisted that the performative character of politics as action was bound to its narrative aspect as remembrance. She was also a fervent proponent of integrating the historical sense into political understanding. On the other hand, Arendt characterized the modern historical sensibility from the point of view of politics as a "ghastly absurdity," and asserted that the political thought of our times needed to free itself both "from history" and "from thinking in historical terms." This paper explores the different meanings that Arendt granted to "history" as a (anti) political force and to historical sensibility as the basis for political understanding. It argues that not only were Arendt's rejection of the modern concept of history and its politics of history central for her critique, but that it was one of the key concerns that shaped the articulation of her own theory of action. The paper also examines the problem against the background of the intellectual tradition of Arendt's youth and in particular its uncompromising antihistoricism.<br>

Author(s): SHOHAM HIZKY<br>
Abstract: The article seeks to revitalize the concept of tradition and re-claim its usefulness for contemporary sociological thought and research. Instead of ontological entity, tradition is defined here as an assigned temporal meaning, i. e., a symbolic activity in which various social groups attribute traditional qualities to certain sectors of life that are understood as binding together different times. The article analyzes two incompatible approaches with which tradition was hitherto conceptualized in sociology: (1) tradition as the anti-modern, and (2) tradition as synonymous with "culture." The analysis introduces a few middle-ground options that support the theory of tradition as assigned meaning. L'article entend redonner vie au concept de tradition en sociologie et montrer son utilité pour la recherche aujourd'hui. Il met en évidence les insuffisances des deux interprétations usuelles : tradition comme refus de la modernité et tradition rendue synonyme de culture. Il propose de voir dans l'appel à tradition une activité symbolique par laquelle des groupes sociaux divers attribuent des caractères « traditionnels » à certains aspects de la vie sociale regardés comme assurant un lien inter-temporel. Dieser Aufsatz setzt sich zum Ziel der Tradition in der Soziologie einen neuen Aufschwung zu geben und ihre Bedeutung für die heutige Forschung zu verdeutlichen. Er hebt die Unzulänglichkeiten zweier gängiger Interpretationsschemen hervor: Tradition als Verweigerung der Moderne und Tradition als Synonym für Kultur. Er schlägt vor, den Aufruf an die Tradition als symbolischen Akt zu begreifen, dem verschiedene soziale Gruppen traditionelle Werte im sozialen Miteinander beimessen, die als intertemporales Bindeglied fungieren<br>

Abstract: The text aims at considering from various points of view the presence of the value of truth in the work of art. The first step is a phenomenological analysis of epistemológical, ontological and aesthetic phenomena connected with perception of the work of art. Its conclusion is the statement that truth belongs to the characteristics of both creation (contents, structure) and reception (cognition of various aspects) of the work. The very fact that the aesthetic value of the object claiming to be beautiful can be discussed proves the presence of the object on the rational-veritable plane. The next aspect undertaken in the article is concerned with the epistemological and methodological criticism of the view (represented here by R. Ingarden) that there is a radical difference between the objective domains of science and art. An attempt is made to show that the view is rooted rather in ideologically understood scientism and neo-positivism than in a realistic conception of cognition through art. In a completely realistic attitude the borderline between 'what is rationally cognised' and 'what is beautiful' (the sphere of quasi in Ingarden's meaning) is not an absolute borderline. The domain of the work of art also contains cognitive elements, often existentially and morally essential for man's life. As it appears, a similar position can be found in G. B. Vico's texts that proclaim the unity of poetic and metaphysical perspective in ancient beginnings of anthropological thought about the human world. Nowadays a methodological tendency is observed on the philosophical plane that allows joining the veritable and aesthetic aspects, and hence exploring the objective domain of art in the cognitive aspect. This is expressed today, among others, in the increase of the significance of art in social, cultural and scientific life.<br>

Abstract: A religião é uma enorme projeção de significações humanas. Estas projeções convertem-se, para os seus produtores, na forma de uma realidade de ordem transcendente. De acordo com Peter L. Berger a alienaçāo religiosa é antropologicamente necessária. A partir da fenomenologia da religiāo, cosmos sacralizado em que se constitui toda e qualquer concepçāo do mundo, faz da religiāo um âmbito de estudo para elucidar os mecanismos complexos de sentido e significado da vida humana. Rudolf Otto e Mircea Eliade sāo os fenomenólogos que mais influenciaram o pensamento de Peter L. Berger. Religion is largely a projection of human meanings. These projections are converted in the form of a reality of transcendent order back to their very authors. According to Peter L. Berger religious alienation is anthropologically necessary. From the Phenomenology of Religion, the sacralized cosmos in which any conception of the world is formed makes religion a field study to elucidate the complex mechanisms of sense and meaning of the human life. Rudolf Otto and Mircea Eliade are the phenomenologists that most influenced the thought of Peter L. Berger.<br>

Abstract: A metafísica aristotélica não considera o ser enquanto ser em si mesmo, mas enquanto símbolo daquilo que é simultaneamente o mais universal e o mais singular para o espírito. Platão antecipou a concepção propondo uma dialéctica ascendente, completada por uma dialéctica descendente, cuja dinâmica fora objecto de pesquisa nas suas últimas obras. A metafísica encontra-se na intersecção destas duas dialécticas, no eixo em que a primeira passa na outra. Este eixo começa a fazer sentido a partir do saber que o pensamento tem de si mesmo. A mentalidade representativa, desatenta à especificidade deste eixo, não consegue aceder à dimensão dos caminhos da razão. O eixo no coração das dialécticas clássicas é assumido pela metafísica contemporânea em termos de tempo associado com o espírito vivo em detrimento do ser conceptual. Aristotelian metaphysics does not consider being qua being in itself, but rather as a symbol of what is, for the spirit, at once the most universal and the most particular. Plato had anticipated the conception, the dynamic of which had been the object of investigation in his last works. Metaphysics finds itself at the intersection of these two dialectics, at the axis around which the first passes into the other. The axis takes its sense from the knowledge that thought has of itself. The mentality, based on representation, inattentive to the specificity of this axis, does not have access to the amplitude of the paths that reason can take. The axis at the heart of classic dialectics is taken up by contemporary metaphysics in terms of time associated with the living spirit rather than as conceptual being.<br>

Abstract: Dans la réflexion de Jean-Pierre Vernant et Pierre Vidal-Naquet, le rapprochement entre le passé et le présent est caractéristique d'une démarche qui, pour aborder les problèmes historiques les plus difficiles, et notamment les questions politiques, n'hésite pas à recourir à ce que Nicole Loraux a pu appeler «une pratique contrôlée de l'anachronisme». L'analyse porte dans cette étude sur un point omniprésent dans leurs œuvres : l'héritage politique des Grecs ? Comment ont-ils défini, par leurs travaux, un héritage politique qui ne reprend pas tout ce que les Anciens ont pensé et fait? Comment, dans leur démarche, chacun à leur manière, ont-ils tracé et franchi des frontières, entre le passé et le présent? Quelle pertinence accorder dans ce contexte à la notion de frontière? Quel sens donner aux trois termes autour desquels est centrée cette contribution: le politique, les frontières, l'historien? In Jean-Pierre Vernant's and Pierre Vidal-Naquet's thought, the rapprochement between past and present characterizes a procedure which in dealing with the most difficult historical issues and notably the political ones, does not hesitate to resort to what Nicole Loraux once called "a controlled practice of anachronism". In this study the analysis bears on a pervasive point throughout their works: the political heritage of the Greeks? How did they define in their works a political heritage of the Greeks which does not take up all that the Ancients thought and did? How in their thought processes each of them in his own way has traced up and trespassed borders between past and present? What relevance can be accorded in such context to the notion of border? What meaning to be given to the three terms around which this contribution is centered: politics, the borders, the historian?<br>

Abstract: En explorant plus avant le projet des ouvrages théologiques précédents, Au lieu de soi ne distingue pas simplement la pensée de la création de l'onto-théologie mais la sépare aussi de son dépassement heideggérien, qui demeure pour Marion aussi idolâtrique que la métaphysique elle-même. L'ouvrage se concentre ici autour de l'interprétation de l'adonné comme créature par excellence, ou créature iconique — dont le privilège tient à sa temporalité et à sa mutabilité. Indispensable à l'interprétation de saint Augustin comme penseur non métaphysique, l'analyse de la temporalité de l'homme iconique, en démontrant la manière dont la pensée de la création reste hors de l'ontothéologie et de la causa et de l'ego, suggère en même temps que saint Augustin n'affirme le devenir de l'homme qu'en lui enlevant toute innocence et, corrélativement, ne trouve pas de bonheur véritable dans l'amour du mortel comme tel. Extending the project of his prior theological works, Au lieu de soi distinguishes the thought of creation not only from onto-theology but also from its Heideggerian overcoming, which remains for Marion as idolatrous as metaphysics itself Along these lines, the work turns on the interpretation of the adonné as creature par excellence, or as an iconic creature - whose privilege stems from its temporality and mutability. Indispensable to the interpretation of Saint Augustine as non-metaphysical thinker, the analysis of iconic man's temporality, while demonstrating rigorously the way in which the thought of creation remains beyond the onto-theology both of the causa and of the ego, suggests at the same time that Augustine affirms the becoming of man only in depriving it of all innocence and, correlatively, finds no true happiness in love of the mortal as such.<br>

Abstract: Since much of modern discourse, extending from cognitivism to connectionism, has been greatly inclined to look at human behavior in relation to processes where the subjective factor plays little if any causal role, it would not be inaccurate to say that the person has been left with but a trivial part to play in the overall script. The intent of this paper is to address this theoretical disproportionality by offering a more symmetrical account of creativity — one that reconsiders the reconstructive nature and generative capabilities of the person while not ignoring the contributions of technical and scientific thought.<br>

Abstract: On semble considérer d'ordinaire que, dans les Travaux et les jours d'Hésiode, les deux grands mythes successifs de Prométhée et des races sont deux vieux mythes de même nature. On peut montrer pourtant que le mythe des races est en fait une sorte de révision critique du mythe de Prométhée, tout comme, dans la Bible, le premier récit de la Genèse doit être situé par rapport au deuxième, plus archaïque. Cette démarche comparative permet de voir dans le caractère créatif et critique de la pensée mythique une donnée anthropologique assez générale, longtemps minimisée par les approches structuralistes. The two great successive myths in Hesiod's Works and Days — the myth of Prometheus and the myth of Ages — are usually seen as two old myths of the same nature. However, it is possible to show that the myth of Ages is actually a kind of critical reassessment of the myth of Prometheus, just as in the Bible, the first narrative of Genesis must be placed in relation to the second one, which is more archaic. Thanks to this comparative proceeding, the creative and critical nature of mythical thought will appear as a fairly general anthropological fact, long minimized by the structuralist approach.<br>

Abstract: La pensée de Gabriel Marcel se présente essentiellement comme une ontologie de la relation intersubjective. Par la relecture des textes publiés dans Les hommes contre l'humain, cette étude vise à situer les enjeux éthiques de cette pensée lorsqu'elle exerce sa clairvoyance sur le terrain de la critique des idéologies, du jugement politique et de l'évaluation des formes «désenchantées» de notre culture. The thought of Gabriel Marcel presents itself as essentially an ontology of intersubjective relations. Through the rereading of texts published in Les hommes contre l'humain, this study aims to show what is at stake ethically when these ideas are used to clarify the critique of ideologies, of political judgment, and of the evaluation of various forms of cultural "disillusionment".<br>

Abstract: La notion de tolérance est problématique: je m'efforce de le montrer en considérant tout d'abord les critiques dont elle est ou a été la cible. Puis, en partant de la conception de Locke, je relève les dilemmes qui peuvent surgir de la mise en pratique de la tolérance et la nécessité, mais aussi la difficulté, de fixer les limites de son application. Corollaire de la liberté de pensée et de l'acceptation du pluralisme, la tolérance est décrite, en dernier lieu, comme mise à l'épreuve purificatrice de nos convictions et comme instauratrice d'une véritable relation de réciprocité dans la mesure où elle parvient à dépasser le simple acquiescement à la diversité. The concept of tolerance is problematic : this I try to show first by considering the criticisms made of it. Then, starting with the perception of Locke, I point out the potential dilemmas of practising tolerance and the need, as well as the difficulty, of fixing limits to tolerance. A corollary to the freedom of thought and the approbation of pluralism, tolerance is finally described as the refining proof of conviction and the instigator of true reciprocity to the degree that it goes beyond the simple acquiescence of diversity.<br>

Abstract: Cet article présente de manière actualisée et critique l'œuvre du «paysan-philosophe» catholique Marcel Légaut. Après avoir examiné les principales retombées culturelles et ecclésiologiques de cette pensée, l'auteur se concentre sur la façon dont Légaut traite le thème de la conscience de soi du Christ. Il se demande à la fois ce que ce traitement original peut apporter à la recherche christologique actuelle, et en quoi celle-ci le complète et le relativise. This article is an up-to-date and critical presentation of the work of the Catholic "peasant-philosopher" Marcel Légaut. After examining the main cultural and ecclesiological repercussions of this line of thought, the author concentrates on the way in which Légaut treats the theme of the self-consciousness of Christ. He asks what this original treatment can add to and how it is completed and made relevant by present Christological research.<br>

Abstract: Tout porte à croire qu'une langue «exotique» donne naissance également à des métaphores exotiques, qui conditionnent à leur tour des modes de penser différents des nôtres. L'analyse comparée d'un champ métaphorique commun à la Grèce et à la Chine (la lumière et le miroir) montre que les différences philosophiques ne procèdent pas de la diversité matérielle des métaphores utilisées, mais bien plutôt d'attitudes différentes adoptées face au langage. L'hypothèse du relativisme linguistique, loin de pouvoir être infirmée ou confirmée à travers l'analyse comparée, apparaît elle-même comme étant déjà dépendante de la manière dont la pensée grecque et occidentale a conçu les rapports entre la pensée et le langage. Everything leads us to believe that an «exotic» language produces exotic metaphors, which in turn condition those modesof thought different from our own. Comparative analysis of a metaphorical field common to Greece and China (light and the mirror) shows that the philosophical differences do not proceeed from the various material of the metaphors used, but rather from the different attitudes to language. The hypothesis of linguistic relativism far from being either weakened or confirmed by this comparative analysis, appears itself to depend on the manner in which Greek and occidental thought conceived the relation of thought to language.<br>

Abstract: La confrontation théologique à la critique du christianisme contenue dans l'œuvre du Marquis de Sade n'est pas encore habituelle. Ces pages offrent donc une entrée dans la réflexion qui peut naître d'une telle confrontation. L'article se divise en sept paragraphes qui reprennent les grandes lignes de mon travail théologique inspiré par la pensée de Sade. La question du mal semble être au centre de ce dialogue. C'est autour de notions telles que le péché, la responsabilité, la culpabilité ou le mal radical que s'articule l'argumentation. The theological confrontation with the criticism of Christianity contained in the work of Marquis de Sade is not yet common. These pages offer a point of entry into reflection which can originate from such a confrontation. The article is divided into seven paragraphs based on the main lines of my theological work inspired by the thought of Sade. The problem of evil seems to be at the centre of this dialogue. The argument develops around such notions as sin, responsability, guilt and radical evil.<br>

Abstract: Dans cet article, il s'agira pour nous de mettre en évidence la richesse de la pensée de Maine de Biran et l'originalité qui le rend encore de nos jours d'une grande actualité. Cela par le biais de la critique de la notion de «sensation transformée», que Maine de Biran amorce dans son Mémoire sur la décomposition de la pensée. L'étude de cette critique présente un double intérêt : elle montre, d'une part, que le «biranisme» prend forme à l'intérieur de la doctrine de Condillac ; d'autre part, que la décomposition de la notion de sensation marque la rupture de Maine de Biran d'avec l'Idéologie. In this article we want to present the rich thought of Maine de Biran and its originality which renders it still very pertinent in our time. The study of a critique of the notion of "transformed sensation", which Maine de Biran initiated in his esssay "Decomposition of thought", has a twofold interest: to show, first of all, that "biranism" takes form within the doctrines of Condillac; and secondly, that the decomposition of the notion of sensation marks the separation of Maine de Biran with that ideology.<br>

Abstract: En réponse aux questions de Philippe Cardon, et indépendamment de remarques de détail, brièvement discutées, l'auteur se réjouit de se voir décerner un certificat de non barthisme. Il s'étonne par contre de la grande naïveté de Philippe Cardon, dont le projet théologique lui semble s'apparenter à un retour massif à Barth, traité de manière littérale et orthodoxe. L'auteur demeure attaché, au contraire, à une reconstruction critique non seulement de la pensée de Barth, mais de l'ensemble de la théologie contemporaine, d'où quelques observations sur les débats actuels au sujet de l'avenir de la théologie académique. Responding to Philippe Cardon, and apart from some detailed remarks briefly discussed, the author is happy to be discerned a certificate of non-Barthianism. However, the great naivety of Philippe Cordon, whose theological project seems like a massive return to Barth, literal and orthodox, surprises him. On the contrary, the author remains attached to a critical reconstruction not only to the thought of Barth, but to the whole of contemporary theology, whence some observations on current debates about the future of academic theology.<br>

Abstract: La question des rapports entre éthique philosophique et éthique théologique est au cœur de la pensée de Friedrich Daniel Schleiermacher (1768-1834). Proposant une conception originale de la raison dans ses liens à la nature et à l'histoire, l'auteur des Discours et de la Foi chrétienne restructure l'éthique philosophique autour des notions de Biens, de vertus et de devoirs. Quels liens une telle vision de l'éthique entretient-elle avec l'interprétation théologique de thèmes comme le Royaume de Dieu, la rédemption, la justification par la foi et la sanctification ? La concentration téléologique sur les Biens (Güterlehre) et sur le Bien suprême est-elle à comprendre aussi en un sens théologique ? Et si oui, comment penser la relation entre la dogmatique, la dialectique et l'éthique, non seulement chez Schleiermacher, mais dans le contexte moderne et postmoderne qui est le nôtre ? The relation between philosophical and theological ethics is at the centre of the thought of F. D. Schleiermacher (1768-1834). Proposing an original conception of reason in its connection to nature and to history, the author of Discourses and of The Christian Faith restructures philosophical ethics around the notions of the Good, of virtues and of duties. What connection does such a vision of ethics have with the theological interpretation of themes like the Kingdom of god, redemption, justification by faith and sanctification? Can the teleological focus on the Good fGüterlehrej andón the supreme Good be also understood theologically? If yes, how should one think of the relation between dogmatics, dialectics and ethics, not only in Schleiermacher, but in the modern and postmodern context of our age?<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricœur construit la philosophie comme une hétérotopie, en la soumettant à l'ordre, juridique et théologique, d'un «aveu». En soustrayant la pensée à la compétence première de la philosophie pour l'accorder à l'ordre d'un récit, Ricoeur fait de l'exercice de la philosophie une «empirique de la volonté serve». Ce primat donné à un ordre de médiation, par le biais d'un récit, dépouille ainsi la philosophie de toute tâche inaugurale. Dans ses Valences of the Dialectic, le philosophe américain Jameson est revenu de façon critique sur ce montage, soulignant le paradoxe qui oblige Ricœur à ôter la pensée du temps des tâches premières de la phénoménologie. Cet article vise à en exposer les conséquences (notamment le basculement vers une herméneutique), pour interroger les effets théologico-politiques de ce vaste projet. Paul Ricoeur constructs philosophy as a heterotopia, in subjecting it in the order of a juridical and theological «confession». By subtracting thought from the primordial competency of philosophy in order to link it to a story, Ricoeur displays the primacy of a third party. In his Valences of the Dialectic, the American philosopher Jameson has reviewed this assemblage, underlining the paradox which thus obliges Ricoeur to pull out an idea from the time of the first tasks of phenomenology. This article tries to lay out the consequences (notably the swinging towards hermeneutics), so as to question the theological-political effects of this vast project.<br>

Abstract: Tout au long de son œuvre, Henri Bergson s'est penché sur le temps du vécu qu'il nomme «durée», une notion qu'il a, des années durant, cherché à cerner. Du point de vue de l'énonciation de sa pensée surgit une difficulté: comment mettre des mots sur une notion qui a pour caractéristique d'échapper aux schèmes de penser habituels, de se soustraire aux filets du logos ? Si, comme il le souligne, «[l] a pensée demeure incommensurable avec le langage», il se doit d'ouvrir une nouvelle voie pour formuler malgré tout sa pensée en faisant appel à des ressources langagières proprement inhabituelles, voire étrangères à la philosophie. Pour dire le temps, le philosophe se doit de briser les cadres de la pensée conceptuelle. Ainsi, l'emploi de la métaphore, habituellement ressource du langage poétique, devient sous la plume du philosophe français un outil privilégié du philosopher, transcendant les concepts pour atteindre qu'il nomme l'intuition de la durée immanente à chacun de nous. In all his writings, Henri Bergson sought to define worked the notion of time lived, which he called duration. In the enunciation of his thought, emerges a difficulty: how to put words to a notion which characteristically escapes habitual schemas of thought and logical traps? If, as he claims, «thought remains immeasurable by language», we need, nevertheless, a new way to formulate his thought by calling upon unusual or even un-philosophical linguistic resources. In order to speak of time, the philosopher must expand the framework of conceptual thought. Thus, the use of metaphor, normally a poetical resource, becomes in the writing of the French philosopher an excellent tool for philosophy, going beyond the concepts in order to reach what he calls the immanent intuition of duration which each one of us has.<br>

Abstract: Cet article essaie d'évaluer les implications des courants phénoménologiques et existentialistes pour la géographie. Le relativisme socio-culturel conteste des modèles de recherche que la pratique contemporaine n'avait pas questionnés. En transposant la notion de Lebenswelt (monde vécu) en termes de genre de vie, on présente un schéma d'analyse qui pourrait encourager la réflexion critique sur (a) les rapports sociologiques et les relations de pouvoir associés au vécu du géographe lui-même, dans sa pensée et dans sa pratique; (b) la capacité des modèles courants à expliquer l'expérience vécue. This article interprets some claims made by phenomenology and existentialism and evaluates their potential significance for geography. Questions are raised regarding socio-cultural relativism in taken-for-granted research models and their applications. Translating Lebenswelt (lifeworld) in terms of genre de vie, a framework is presented which could facilitate critical reflection on (a) sociological construction and power relations associated with the geographer's own lifeworld of thought and praxis, and (b) selectivity and relative appropriateness of current models for the elucidation of lived experience.<br>

Abstract: The manner in which the LDS Church administers its temple rite constitutes a strategic use of the conventions of an oral tradition in a modern, literate society. Three effects of this strategy are considered. First, refusing to make a text of the rite available and insisting that its specific content not be revealed or otherwise subjected to discursive thought sustains the rite's canonical authority as immutable truth, notwithstanding its periodic mutation. Secondly, the conventions of oral tradition structure the relationships created by the ritual and constitute a principal means by which the Church's historic separatism is maintained. Finally, these conventions when applied to the temple rite maximize ritual's capacity to adapt the canon to the needs of successive generations of the faithful while minimizing skepticism and schism.<br>

Abstract: Les mathématiques, auxquelles on peut joindre la logique, et depuis 1960 une large part de l'informatique théorique, fournissent un témoignage sur une part essentielle du fonctionnement de l'esprit humain. Loin de fournir seulement des outils extérieurs, elles se sont faites mode de pensée nécessaire pour appréhender la réalité physique. Elles nous ont appris que ce que nous nommons raison, démarche rationnelle, est en réalité laborieusement construit. Un bref survol de l'histoire des mathématiques, anciennes, puis surtout depuis le XIXe s., montre en quel sens le concept ancien de « vérité scientifique » s'en trouve désormais modifié. Mathematics, to which one may add logic and, since 1960, a large section of theoretical computer technique, all furnish evidence concerning an essential part of the working of the human mind. Far from providing only external tools, they have evolved as a necessary mode of thought for the understanding of physical reality. They have taught us that what we call reason, or rational deduction, is in fact something we have ourselves laboriously constructed. A brief survey of the history of mathematics, ancient and modern but especially from and after the 19th century, shows ways in which the old concept of a 'scientific truth' must henceforth be modified.<br>

Abstract: Cette étude propose une approche « textologique » du texte scripturaire, à l'interface de la philosophie de la religion et de la philosophie du texte. Elle repose sur deux hypothèses : 1. penser, c'est interroger; la pensée religieuse est une interrogation sur le salut. 2. le sens se textualise en achevant de saturer les trois dimensions de la signifiance (référence, communicabililé, symbolisme). Trois raisons sont données, après le textual turn en philosophie, pour distinguer « texte » et « discours » : structurelle, « érotétique », clause de clôture du Canon des Écritures. Du même coup, le rôle de l'expérience religieuse est dérivé. La méthode est celle de l'analyse conceptuelle des problématiques. This study proposes a "textological" approach to scriptural text, at the interface of the philosophy of religion with the philosophy of the text. It avances two hypothesis: 1. to think is to question; religious thought raises the question of salvation. 2. the meaning textualizes itself by completely saturating the three dimensions of signification (reference, communicabiliiy, symbolism). Three reasons are given, following the textual turn in philosophy, for distinguishing between "text" and "discourse": structure, "erotetics", and the closing clause of the scriptural Canon. At the same time the role of religious experience is explained. The method used is that of the conceptual analysis of problematics.<br>

Abstract: On donne des exemples de difficultés rencontrées par la théologie classique quand elle se réapproprie certaines catégories d'ordre philosophique. Après avoir étendu la notion de category-mistake à la logique du questionnement, on illustre par une étude de cas certains glissements, dérives, accaparements qui posent des « problèmes catégoriaux ». Une approche interrogative et textologique permet de les analyser selon un partenariat entre théologie fondamentale et une certaine philosophie (critique) de la religion. Les prémisses de cette approche qui inaugure un nouveau type de théologien et de philosophe non retranché, sans ancillarité ni sous-traitance, ont été exposées dans un article antérieur sur « la pensée expressément religieuse » (chère à Balthasar) et sa catégorisation spécifique. On prépare ici un travail ultérieur consacré aux conditions de légitimité de la reprise problématique d'un ordre à l'autre. Examples are given of the difficulties that arise when classical theology apropriates certain categories of a philosophical order. After taking the notion of category-mistake over into the logic of the questioning the study of certain cases illustrates how certain slips, spoliations, or a certain going astray, lead to « categorial problems. » An interrogative and textological approach allows their analysis via a partnership between fundamental theology and a certain (critical) philosophy of Religion. The premises of this approach which heralds a new type of unentrenched theologian and philosopher, free from subordination or belittlement, were the subject of a previous exposé on « expressly religious thought » (dear to Balthasar) and its specific categorisation. This article prepares a further work on the conditions of legitimate transfer of problematic from one order to another.<br>

Abstract: En partant de l'histoire intellectuelle dont nous provenons, puis en retraçant en elle les tensions majeures de l'expérience et du sens, on soutient d'abord ici que le christianisme peut et doit être pour nous un lieu décisif de réflexion philosophique. Cette conviction se confirme à travers le parcours de trois pensées phénoménologiques d'importance – celles de M. Henry, de J. L. Marion et de P. Ricœur – qui abordent selon leur style propre la question du rapport à la « révélation » biblique et évangélique. On débouche ainsi finalement sur un espace à la fois commun et hétérogène : celui de notre monde, soulerrainemenl et diversement travaillé par l'inscription en lui d'une « kénose » d'origine chrétienne qui n'interroge pas moins les constructions philosophiques que théologiques. Beginning with the intellectual history from which we come, then in retracing in it the major tensions of experience and sense, this paper first maintains that Christianity can and must he for us a decisive place for philosophical reflection. This conviction is confirmed through the overview of three important phenomenological lines of thought, those of M. Henry, J. L. Marion and P. Ricœur – who take up, each according to his own style, the question of biblical and evangelical « revelation ». One is thus finally led into a space at once common and heterogeneous: that of our world, clandestinely and variously crafted by the inscription into it of a « kenosis » of Christian origin that questions philosophical constructions no less than theological ones.<br>

Abstract: En vue de se laisser enseigner par les lettres philosophiques, l'auteur s'applique à reconnaître, depuis Platon jusqu'à Nietzsche, l'insistance et l'existence des questions relatives au mal. La nature (quid), l'origine (unde) et la justification (cur) sollicitent toujours et autrement la pensée du mal. Au commencement, de Plotin à Leibniz, le moment ontologique retravaille la question de la nature à partir de la question de l'origine, mais pour résoudre le mal de la volonté dans le non-être du mal. Il faut que s'affirme avec Kant la préséance du vouloir sur l'être, l'auto-position de la volonté libre, pour que le moment éthique associe l'essence positive du mal à la recherche de son origine. Lorsqu'enfin dans la perspective de Nietzsche s'impose le moment généalogique, la question de la théodicée se transforme en question du langage. Là où se dit la justification de la volonté, c'est une volonté de justification qui parle. L'article se conclut en préparant une pensée du mal qui réunirait l'horizon de l'attente à celui de la genèse. The author, with the aim of being taught by philosophical letters, applies himself to acknowledge from Plato to Nietzsche the persistence and existence of the questions relating to evil. The nature (quid), the origin (unde) and the justification (cur) always and in different ways urge the thought of evil. In the beginning, from Plotin to Leibniz, the metaphysical instance works again at the question of nature starting from the question of origin, but in order to solve the evil of the will power in the non existing of evil. It will need Kant's assertion of the precedency of the will over the being, the auto-position of the free will in order that the ethical moment may associats the positive essence of evil to the search for its origin. When "in fine" the genealogical moment forces itself upon Nietzsche's prospect, the question of theodicy is transformed into one of language. Where the question is a justification of the will, it is the wil~<br>

Abstract: Il existe entre ces deux « hommes de l'Église » une multitude d'affinités. Leurs pensées respectives sont dans cette étude mise en regard d'un phénomène qui révèle, par contraste, leur accord intime : le « modernisme ». Les paradoxes du visible et de l'invisible, de la conscience et du dogme, de l'Église et de l'universalité salutaire, de la philosophie enfin par rapport à la théologie sont tour à tour évoqués. En puisant largement dans les œuvres de ces deux maîtres, l'A. entend montrer comment elles donnent accès au Mystère révélé. Si le « modernisme » n'est plus aujourd'hui un drame d'actualité, si le style et parfois le langage de ces deux penseurs n'est plus le nôtre, leur lucidité spirituelle, elle, nous est plus nécessaire que jamais. Between these two "men of the Church" there are many affinities. In the present article their respective ideas are considered in the light of a phenomenon which reveals, by contrast, their intimate accord: "modernism". The paradoxes of the visible and the invisible, of conscience and dogma, of the Church and the universality of salvation, and finally of philosophy in its relationship to theology, are evoked one after the other. By digging widely into the works of these two masters, the author shows how they open the way to the revealed Mystery. If "modernism" is no longer today a contemporary line of thought, and if the style and, at times, the language of these two thinkers are no longer ours, even so their spiritual lucidity is more necessary to us than ever.<br>

Abstract: L'expérience et l'empathie définissent deux grandes quêtes de la phénoménologie contemporaine, l'une chez Edmond Husserl et l'autre chez Max Scheler. Dans un tout autre ordre et selon une tout autre perspective, Bernard de Clairvaux fait néanmoins ici figure de pionnier : dans sa conceptualisation de l'experientia d'une part et sa réflexion autour de la compassio d'autre part. Loin de toujours dénoncer négativement la métaphysique, on s'attachera ici à montrer en quoi, positivement cette fois, la mystique ouvre vers un autre « type de discours » et déploie des « possibles » à réinterroger pour aujourd'hui. Appuyés sur une relecture des Sermons sur le Cantique et du Traité de l'amour de Dieu, la mise en œuvre du « champ de l'expérience », la nouveauté du « langage de l'affect », et « l'empathie amoureuse » de l'homme à Dieu, constituent ainsi les différents temps d'une possible redécouverte philosophique de la mystique cistercienne pour notre temps. Experience and empathy define two great quests of contemporary phenomenology, one in the thought of Edmond Husserl the other in the thought of Max Scheler. In an altogether different order and according to an altogether different perspective, Bernard of Clairvaux appears here as the pioneer: in his conceptualization of experientia on the one hand and his reflection upon compassio on the other. Far from pursuing a negative denunciation of metaphysics, we will attempt to show here how, positively in this instance, metaphysics opens upon another « type of discourse » and displays the « possibles » to be reexamined today. Supported by a rereading of the Sermons on the Canticle and the Treatise on the Love of God, the application of the « field of experience », the novelty of « language of affect », and man's amorous empathy » with God, thus constitute the different moments of a possible philosophical rediscovery of Cistercian mysticism for our time.<br>

Author(s): Condillac Juliet Flower<br>
Abstract: Rousseau opposed both traditional and modern (empiricist) thinking when he made self-love the cornerstone of his system. Other modes of thought treat self-consciousness as constituted primarily by temporal desire. Rousseau raises love, for him the suspension of desire, to a position of ontological primacy in regard to self-consciousness. Like Pascal, he throws the empirical existence of the self into radical question and finds it to be as insubstantial and empty a concept as the Western tradition has found it-from Ecclesiastes and Socrates on. Rousseau declines the moralistic reproof of the self, however, and emphasizes its insubstantiality as its one strength, although a fictional one. The self exists only in the mode of a hypothesis (the fictional "as if"): it is a failure at being. But to amour (and to pitié) it makes all the difference and is worthy of their support.<br>

Abstract: Modern critical theory is commonly thought of as a collection of diverse methods, schools, systems, and approaches. There is, however, a significant pattern in the diversity. This pattern is generated by the conflict between the widespread effort of twentieth-century theorists to make criticism scientific and the internal resistance to that effort presented by the hermeneutic impulse. The scientific tradition is characterized and unified by a set of common theoretical principles and by a common sequence of transformations that each school within it undergoes. The result of these transformations is that every proposed scientific model for criticism changes into an interpretive method and the project of scientific criticism is subverted.<br>

Article Title:  أسطورة الخلق في شرق أفريقيا / The Myth of Creation in East Africa <br>
Publisher: American University in Cairo. Department of English and Comparative Literature<br>
Issue: i222581<br>
Date: 1 1, 1967<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Nabila<br>
Abstract: The "Myth of Creation" in its East African formulation is the central chapter in a book entitled, The Sacred Meadows, by an Egyptian anthropologist who did his field work in the early seventies among the Lamu community in Kenya on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The translator, in her own introduction to the translation, presents the outline of the book and provides the geographical and cultural context of the community in question. The author, in this translated chapter, sets out by exposing his theoretical position which combines both Structuralism and Functionalism. Insights from Claude Lévi-Strauss and Bronislaw Malinowski as well as those of Paul Ricoeur and Victor Turner join to develop the author's notion of myth and its symbolic mode. Then the text of the myth, in its Lamuan formulation, is narrated, followed by a close reading and analysis of its binary oppositions, mediating terms, and the underlying existential contradiction at its crux. Angels, jinn, light, fire, earth, wind, water, Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Satan, serpent, etc. are the agents of this sacred narrative and cosmic drama. The textual unfolding of the myth is followed by an analysis, which makes use of the structural method and explores the semantic connotations of Swahili words and idioms to explain the logic of the symbolic exchange and the rigor of thought. The themes of unity and multiplicity and their different combinations are delineated in this analysis and the repetitions and their relation to transcendence are explained.<br>

Author(s): Young Donald<br>
Abstract: This article develops parallels between how individuals make sense of both lived experience and narrative performance in order to suggest how the process of following a narrative can give rise to affectively engaging states of mind or flows of thought that I term experiential meanings. Although potentiated through the artistry of performance, these meanings result from listeners' own interpretational processes and therefore become experiential resources available for use in their lives.<br>

Author(s): Whitten Michael F.<br>
Abstract: In their interpretations of magical acts and utterances, anthropologists frequently argue that magic and technology are informed by two different kinds of logic, the former "expressive" in character, the latter "instrumental." A close analysis of magical hunting songs used by the Aguaruna of Amazonian Peru reveals that the songs are part of a general ordering process that encompasses the strategic use of thoughts, speech, objects, and acts to achieve practical ends. In Aguaruna thought the expressive imagery of magical songs is an instrumental tool that shapes events in the performer's world.

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i226394<br>
Date: 11 1, 1977<br>
Author(s): Witherspoon Robert<br>
Abstract: An ethnographic study of the words and actions common to a shelter for people considered homeless and mentally ill shows how distinct forms of reasoning and personal agency relate to a set of practical concerns and political exigencies. Whereas the shelter's staff rely on and promote a referential language and direct, active forms of agency, its residents depend on tactical, persuasive uses of language and oblique, reactive forms of agency. Yet because the staff have the upper hand politically, their orientations to language, thought, and action take a more central role in encouraging people to act in sincere and reasonable ways. The residents draw on ideas of sincerity, reason, and personal accountability, but in makeshift ways, with the result that the ideas are caught up in the rhetoric of self-presentation. The article's findings underscore the need for anthropologists to attend to the diverse means, and political, linguistic, and cultural grounds, of human reason and agency.

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i226487<br>
Date: 3 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Young Patricia A.<br>
Abstract: The field of bioethics has been dominated by the tenets and assumptions of Western philosophical rationalistic thought. A principles and rights-based approach to discussions of moral dilemmas has sustained and reinforced a pervasive reductionism, utilitarianism, and ethnocentrism in the field. Recent explorations of casuistry and hermeneutics suggest a movement toward an expanded theoretical and conceptual framing of medical ethical problems. Increased attention to moral phenomenology and a recognition of the importance of social, cultural, and historical determinants that shape moral questioning should facilitate collaborative work between anthropologists and ethicists. In this article, I examine the philosophical orientation of U.S. bioethics and the relationship of the social sciences to the field of medical ethics. Deterrents to collaboration between anthropologists and bioethicists are explored. Finally, I review past and possible future contributions of anthropology to the field of bioethics and, more generally, to medical ethics.<br>

Abstract: The pietists took this too far. In educational terms it is interesting to look at Rousseau and Pestalozzi as they thought through how educational theory may be re-worked with such considerations in view, though of course they each went their own distinctive way when proposing answers (on this, see:

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: e90012057<br>
Date: 10 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): DAVIS ANDREW<br>
Abstract: This article proposes that Romantic sonatas exploit in their formal structures multiply directed temporal narratives, comprising a temporal stream and various other streams that can be broadly characterized as
         atemporal. The temporal stream articulates the principal sonata trajectory and correlates with the concept known in structural narratology as thefirst narrative; the atemporal streams reside on alternate temporal levels and remain external to, or disengaged from, that of the first narrative. The structural and expressive implications of this opposition, together with the view of sonata-formal conventions made available in recent work on Sonata Theory, provide a framework within which the article explicates Chopin’s robust dialogue, in the first movement of his Piano Sonata in B Minor, Op. 58, with Classical German-Austrian sonata conventions and contemporary Romantic aesthetic currents. The reading provides a foundation for reassessing Chopin’s work in the sonata genre, the norms and expressive potential of which he is often thought of as never fully apprehending.<br>

Abstract: The aim of the article is to present some aspects of Paul Ricœur’s thought, especially his reflection on the servile will. Firstly I present Ricœur’s philosophy of will (in the context of phenomenology of the voluntary and involuntary) and the concept of fallibility. Then I demonstrate the main aspects of Ricœurian rethinking and enlarging of Husserl’s phenomenology what leads to hermeneutic formula: the symbol gives rise to thought. Eventually, I argue that Ricœur’s hermeneutic phenomenology creates a specified anthropological view and understanding of the human condition. This understanding will later become a part of the ‘hermeneutics of the self.’<br>

Abstract: Introduced in France since a decade, the work of Moishe Postone appears as a global new interpretation of Marx. It hinges on the thesis according to which Marx does not propose a criticism of capitalism from the angle of work, but a criticism of work under capitalism. This article assesses the significance of this heterodox Marxism by trying to situate its epistemological background between a structuralist interpretation and a phenomenological interpretation of Marx. It shows that Postone builds an original structuralism, combining Althusser and Hegel, but struggles to link it up with a theory of subjectivation and action up to a thought which aims for the social transformation of and the emancipation from capitalism.<br>

Abstract: In this article, I explore the question, “What is the relationship between appropriation of Indigenous thought and what might be called ‘deep learning’ based in years of education in Indigenous contexts.” Beginning with an examination of meanings ascribed to cultural appropriation, I bring texts from Gee on secondary discourses, Foucault on the production of discourse, and Wertsch on the deep structures underpinning discourse into conversation with critical fieldwork experiences extracted from years of research and teaching. Ultimately hopeful, I conclude the article with direction from Indigenous scholars on appropriate cultural protocol in the use of Indigenous knowledges by non-Aboriginal people in educational contexts.<br>

Abstract: Abstract. This paper demonstrates the sorts of questions that arise for sociologically informed disability studies scholarship in the midst of the interactional scenes of access struggles in an educational workplace environment. From my experiences in the third largest building of a large Canadian university, I have recollected ordinary talk that justifies the exclusion of disabled people and have pieced together narratives representing things-possible-to-say-today about accessibility struggles. By using an interpretive sociological approach, this paper explores how meanings of disability are generated through talk that justifies the exclusive shape and inaccessible structures of university life. I demonstrate that access is not a synonym for justice but is a beginning place for critical questioning where social relations between body and space can be thought anew. This paper adds to sociologically informed disability studies scholarship by analyzing how the ordinary everyday narration of disability acts as a social power reproducing the status-quo even as the material environment changes.<br>

Abstract: Recent scholarship has given considerable attention to lyric poetry as a form of sensuous knowledge. This approach emphasizes the corporeal origins of poetry, its genesis in the body or in language viewed as material. The question of sensuous knowledge is central to the larger theoretical issue of modernity itself, in which lyric holds a central yet ambiguous status. The question of sensuous knowledge is ultimately a question of meaning. However, modern thought — thought pertaining to “modernity” — is fundamentally circular. This would seem to establish an epistemological impasse for aesthetics. But I argue that this circularity offers an important, and necessary, way to limit knowledge and thereby ground an ethical subjectivity. My essay places formalism at the heart of sensuous knowledge. In this essay I develop an account of the importance of abstraction in sensuous knowledge by way of Kant's concept of
         Darstellung, “presentation [of sensory experience].” The “presentation” is the object as it has undergone a structural process of internalization and been made available for psychic use as meaning; that requires a recognition of loss. Where this is important for literature is that twentieth-century American poetry frequently uses very personal images of family life as a way of conveying sincerity about corporeal experience. I use this discussion of circularity in modern aesthetic thought to argue that there is a risk to taking shortcuts to meaning through images of the material bodies of children. In these contemporary poems by Gary Snyder, Sharon Olds and Rita Dove, the poets reject loss in favor of a very modern “affirmation” of the material. But affirmation and the visual image as a sign of affirmation cannot alone bind meaning to us. That meaning must be internalized through theworkof poetic presentation.<br>

Abstract: This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of the “(as yet) untold story” to consider the relationship between James Joyce's 1904 short story “Eveline” (in
         Dubliners) and Colm Tóibín's award-winning 2009 novel,Brooklyn. Although Tóibín has denied the influence of Joyce in general, there are many similarities in the storyworlds of the two protagonists, Eveline Hill and Eilis Lacey: Eveline wishes to leave her father's home in Dublin but stays, whilst Eilis would prefer to remain at home but is forced to emigrate. Both act according to their perception of their mother's wishes and the rightness of their decisions has preoccupied readers. Through close analysis of thought and speech presentation, this essay shows that interpretive responses to the actions of Eveline and Eilis are inextricably linked to the formal qualities of each text.<br>

Abstract: Tropes for poetic relationality proliferate and concatenate. And there is so much more to say. The topic of poetic copia is indeed so abundant as to suggest myriad forking paths of contemplation and investigation. Hidden within the present reflections are dozens of doors leading to other rooms of thought that this article unfortunately does not have the luxury to open. The poets of the Latin American neobaroque—including Argentines Néstor Perlongher, Osvaldo Lamborghini, and Arturo Carrera, Uruguyans Roberto Echavarren and Eduardo Milán, Cuban American José Kozer, and Peruvian Argentine Reynaldo Jimenez—are in deep dialogue with cannibalistic poetics, as De Campos argues in his analysis of “anthropophagous reason” (which he defines as a “ludic space of polyphony and of language in convulsion”).
         
               In the twentieth and twenty-first century there is also a suggestive plethora of poetic frauds, hoaxes, and impersonations—the Ern Malley hoax and Christopher Reid's143
            Katerina Brac, to name just two. Multilingual poetics, with its play on shifting linguistic identities, interlanguage, and polyphony, presents another avenue that would be fruitful for exploration; as does new media poetics that makes use of digital technology. As cultural processes that mingle past and present texts, such cannibalistic poetry participates in a form of cultural philosophy
               that unseats dualistic notions of genius and non-genius, source and derivative, and argues implicitly or explicitly against the metaphysics of origin.144<br>

Abstract: Having just devoted a chapter to “Derrida's Theologies of Translation” (228–46), Apter follows this list with a further exegesis of Derrida's seminal role in highlighting the issue of translation in deconstructive thought (249–53). She then moves on to discuss Abdelfattah Kilito's elegantly ironic book Lan tatakallana lughati (Thou Shalt Not Speak My Language Syracuse, 2006)—a work whose linguistic interdiction hasn't prevented it from receiving rapid translations into French and English—before closing the chapter with further comments on Derrida. It is refreshing finally to find some discussion of a theorist based outside Paris or the United States, and yet like many Moroccan intellectuals, Kilito does much of his critical writing in French, appearing in such journals as
      Poétique; he recently published in Paris a kind of sequel to his 2002 volume,Je parle toutes les langues, mais en arabe(Actes Sud, 2013). In discussing the work of a Moroccan theorist who holds a PhD from the Sorbonne, recipient in 1996 of the Prix du rayonnement de la langue française of the Académie Française, Apter has not moved so far from the Rive Gauche after all.<br>

Abstract: It is the function of poetry in its narrative and dramatic form, to propose to the imagination and to its mediation various figures that constitute so many thought experiments by which we learn to link together the ethical aspects of human conduct and happiness and misfortune. By means of poetry we learn how reversals and fortune result from this or that conduct, as this is constructed by the plot in the narrative.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: Over the years SPEP outgrew campus meetings and moved into convention hotels, just as it seemed to outgrow phenomenology and existentialism, leading to a big discussion, sometime in the eighties I believe, over whether to rename it the Society for Continental Philosophy. This, of course, was the second dispute about the naming of the society. Bob Scharff tells us about the first dispute in his paper, when the original title could have resulted in SEPP rather than SPEP. The second proposal could have changed us from SPEP to SCP. I was involved in those discussions, I believe, as a member of the Executive Committee, but I don't remember why the original name was retained. Maybe because SCP would have been too hard to pronounce. Certainly phenomenology and existentialism never disappeared from the scene, so maybe it was thought that we would have to adopt an acronym like SPEPPMCTHF. Our society got much bigger as well as more complex compared with its humble origins, in an incremental growth and transformation we didn't always notice if we attended every year.<br>

Abstract: Following this line of thought, we might wonder why leading up to the execution of Davis on September 21 abolitionists around the world rallied and protested trying to save his life, while at the same time on that very Wednesday evening little attention was paid to another execution, that of Lawrence Brewer, the infamous Texan who tied a black hitchhiker to the back of his truck and dragged him to death. He, too, proclaimed his innocence of the murder of James Byrd Jr. until his dying breath. Reportedly there were celebrations of Brewer's death by people who thought that he got what he deserved for his heinous racist hate crime. The outcry against the execution of Davis at the very same moment as the jubilance over the execution of Brewer could be seen as a strangely perverse symptom of the history of racism trying to put things right by rejoicing over one execution while raging over the other. Even after the executions, there were comparisons between Davis refusing a last meal in order to pray silently with friends and family and Brewer ordering several pizzas, cheeseburgers, pounds of BBQ, tacos, and other comfort food and then refusing to eat it, which disgusted some commentators and prison officials, who suggested that Brewer was not only undignified but also ungrateful.<br>

Abstract: Here is a final evocation of the unique nonsortal essence, which implicitly, I believe, argues for a nonsortal sense of oneself, works against the temptation to see “I” as merely a numerical individuation comparable to two identical peas, and thus also suggests a filled significant or existential-moral meaning for the question of nonsortal individuality.
            
                  It perhaps is to be found first in Leibniz and then in the formulation in C. S. Pierce and John M. E. McTaggart, but I will share Roderick Chisholm's version of it with you.32
               
                  What is at stake here is not whether memory is essential for identifying by way of criteria oneself throughout time but, rather, whether there is a nonsortal loose and odd sense of oneself and one's identity that may be more basic and may persist in the absence of memory—as the basis for our proper strong sense of having an identifying knowledge of ourselves. We may consider that even prior to such a thought experiment as I here propose we are already perhaps familiar with the small child's ability to make first-person references without having an arsenal of identifying properties that the parent and others have, for example, regarding his physiognomy, voice timbre, kind, lineage, gender, kinship, ethnicity, nationality, and so on and so forth. And we are more or less familiar with real or imagined cases of the amnesiac who says “I” and yet does not know who in the world she is; that is, she is bereft of any identifying properties but still achieves “I” inerrantly.33<br>

Abstract: No doubt the rise of religion has not only posed a particular dilemma for critical theory but also provided a curious place to end this reflection. Having started my career doing philosophy of religion it is somewhat surprising to meet religion again as I turn to what surely must be at least a later phase of my career. I am reminded of Antonio's line from the Italian film
            C'eravamo Tanto Amati, translated asWe All Loved Each Other So Much: “We thought we could change the world, but the world changed us.” “Philosophers only interpret the world, the point is to change it,” so said Marx. But in a curious way those who would change the world are changed by it.<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: Meanwhile in academia, in philosophy, positivism was still very much alive; analytic or Anglo-American philosophy dominated the universities and the professional societies. But the undergraduates were often, instead, busy reading
               existentialism, with Camus, Sartre, Nietzsche, and Kierkegaard discussed in coffeehouses and beer halls. Heidegger was just being discovered, an existential/sometimes religious Heidegger. Bill Richardson'sFrom Phenomenology to Thought, introducing Heidegger, was published in 1963.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: The section entitled “Psychoanalysis: Between Neuroscience and Phenomenology” consists of two articles that probe the limits of psychoanalysis and its relation to other ways of thinking about consciousness and experience. Elizabeth Rottenberg's article, “Foreign Bodies: Psychoanalysis and Neuroscience,” considers the Oedipal dimensions of psychoanalysis's relationship to neurology. Rottenberg suggests that the desire to correlate the phenomena of psychic life with the structures and functions of the brain can be understood as a wish to return to the primal scene of the separation from neurology that was psychoanalysis's founding moment. Returning to this founding moment whereby Freud broke with the French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, Rottenberg argues that fundamental to psychoanalysis is a radical conception of trauma as essentially unlocatable, and this conception leads psychoanalysis to resist correlation with neuroscience. Laura McMahon's article, “Home Invasions: Phenomenological and Psychoanalytic Reflections on Embodiment Relations, Vulnerability, and Breakdown,” puts the psychoanalytic accounts of childhood development offered by Freud and Donald Winnicott into conversation with the phenomenological work of Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty. Drawing on these diverse traditions of thought, framed by an analysis of Ingmar Bergman's 1968 film
      Shame, McMahon explores the ways in which not only our bodies but also our lived space, as an extension of our embodied engagement with the world, are vulnerable to assault.<br>

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: A good model for envisioning how a hermeneutic phenomenology would engage Deleuze can be developed by drawing from resources established elsewhere in Ricoeur's thought. What I have in mind, specifically, is his reading of Freud in the book
         Freud and Philosophy.
               There Ricoeur reads Freud's work as “a mixed or even ambiguous discourse, which at times states conflicts of force subject to an energetics, at times relations of meaning subject to a hermeneutics.”22
            
               Freud's energetics, on the one hand, offers a naturalistic account of desire in which it is understood in terms of a cathexis—the placement and displacement of energy. And yet, psychoanalysis continually points back to the work of interpretation in which the psychoanalyst is dealing with conscious representations. The coexistence of these two discourses gives rise to an aporia, which Ricoeur formulates in the following way: “What is the status of representation or ideas in relation to the notions of instinct, aim of instinct and affect? How can an interpretation of meaning through meaning be integrated with an economics of cathexis, withdrawal of cathexis, anticathexis?”23
            
               To solve this aporia, Ricoeur goes on to show that these two discourses in Freud's work are not actually opposed. Instead, as he puts it, “the energetics implies a hermeneutics and the hermeneutics discloses an energetics.”24

Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: This framework also enhances our ability to answer two other questions. First, how is it that human action both imitates the past and mobilizes it as a resource for innovation? I follow Ricoeur and others in working to open what has often been thought of as a closed hermeneutic circle. Although they labored to unpack it, thinkers as formidable as Martin Heidegger and later Hans-Georg Gadamer nevertheless expressed concern that this circle was in fact the philosophical equivalent of a death spiral (Gadamer
         1998, 190–92, 265–66, 293–94; Heidegger1996, 142–43). Ricoeur hopefully proposed that the hermeneutic circle be considered “not a vicious but a healthy circle” (1984, 1:3). Ricoeur perceived the many latent possibilities in humanity's abilities to create and deploy news stories about an old past. But his work needs to be infused with a rhetorical sensibility in order to make this a convincing view. I believe that rhetorical scholars would be well served by returning to Ricoeur to explore how the rhetorical interest in judgment and action might contribute to our understanding of this “healthy” spiral.<br>

Abstract: One of my favorite anecdotes comes from Bertrand Russell, whose afternoon ride in the country with Shaw one day ended in a terrific collision that permanently disabled his bicycle but left the playwright's two-wheeler relatively unscathed. Forced to take the slow train back home alone, Russell recalled that “at every station[,] Shaw with his bicycle appeared on the platform, put his head in the carriage and jeered.” While the philosopher muses that Shaw probably “regarded the whole incident as proof of the virtues of vegetarianism,”
      
            for me, the story is emblematic of how, as we move forward and arrive at each new juncture in intra- and international discussions of matters of health, politics, technology, economics, and humanity, we discover that Shaw is already there, insistently provoking us with just how far Shavian thought can reach.29<br>

Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: In this connection, two additional Ricoeurian points are worth emphasizing. First, Shaw does not present incontestable evidence to warrant his assertion that we exit the womb untarnished. And there is a good reason for this omission. No such corroboration exists, either in speculative thought or actual experience. Shaw knows this, even if he does not explicitly cite Kant on the limits of human knowledge. For this reason, he couches his deepest feelings about the sanctity of creation and the purity of nascence in terms of a “frame of reference”
         
               —what we may call faith—without which our lives could easily be an endless nightmare of unrelieved pessimism. Shaw may enlist Paley and the elaborate inner workings of the famous watch to proffer the notion that there is a designer behind all of the intricate design we see in nature, but he is well aware that while argument by analogy is suggestive, it is not necessarily irrefutable.48
            
               After all, given enough time, the counterargument goes, blind chance could have achieved the exact same results many are anxious to attribute to divine intelligence. For Shaw, then, the extrapolated likeness between the maker of a timepiece and the maker of a universe, with respect to complexity, organization, and purpose, does not constitute a rigorous proof. Nevertheless, it does provide him with sufficient grounds for a rational belief in things unseen. Shaw designates his ethereal architect the Life Force and equates it with Will, Spirit, and the mainspring of life, Creative Evolution. On this faith-based view, Shaw defines the Life Force and its ends as the paramount “good” in the ethical sense and conceives every newborn as similarly good because it comes into being already gifted with a subset of the same Will, Spirit, and Creativity that animates the world. From this angle, we can justifiably say that both Ricoeur and Shaw ground their abiding faith and the hope that flows from it in t~<br>

Article Title: “Time and History in Blake's<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.22.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: William Blake's poem
         Jerusalem(1804–20), like all Perennial utopias, achieves a dialectical synthesis of the ideal and the actual through the narrative focalization of a religious experience at the level of character, one that is at once transhistorical and universal. By reading the poem through the lens of the Perennial paradigm, we discover that the temporal aspects ofJerusalemare intimately tied to the religious dimensions of Blake's utopian vision. In addition to giving us a new way to understand the well-documented distinctiveness of Blake's religious message, the Perennial paradigm shows Blake's soteriology inJerusalemto be utopian rather than salvationist (that is to say, individual-religious as opposed to collective-political). Because of the ultimately subjective nature of apprehension of the Divine Vision, Blake's utopian thought is not “clearly a forward-directed anticipatory and visionary concept,” as Magnus Ankarsjö has recently argued (15). Blake does not rally the reader towards some “ensuing peaceful millennium” (15) but rather to find enlightenment in the eternal moment. In light of Blake's suspicion of ratiocination, combined with his deliberate use of narrative focalization of Albion's religious vision, readingJerusalemas a Rational utopia grounded in Judeo-Christian of notions of Apocalypse is to miss Blake's core religious message.<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: An obvious criticism of Burke's idea of rhetorical transcendence is that it is utopian in the unrealistic sense. It seems so abstract in its focus on generalized terminology and images that it may have no possible concrete object. Burke realized this utopian quality reminiscent of the lack of actualized topos in More's utopian “no-place.” As rhetorician James Zappen explains, “These acts of pure persuasion are devoid of partisan advantage-seeking but also devoid of persuasive purpose. As such, they might not even exist.”
      
               The important thing to take away from Burke's ramblings, though, is the humanistic sense that the search for perfection is inherent in human nature and that understanding this utopian impulse can only help us to live and to seek happiness in a world of competing power and advantage: “Let us observe, all about us, forever goading us, though it be in fragments, the motive that attains its ultimate identification in the thought, not of the universal holocaust, but of the universal order…. [E]ach kind strives toward the perfection of its kind, and so toward the kind next above it, while the strivings of the entire series head in God as the beloved cynosure and ninecure, the end of all desire.”35
            
               By36
            GodBurke means an ultimate ideal transcending all other symbols and fulfilling all desire—the kind of nirvana that would eliminate the need for further utopia-making altogether. This, of course, is not achievable in the course of history, but the mythic experience of it would activate a downward movement in the process, bringing the transcendent ideals back into the pragmatic world of discourse and human affairs. This would be the function of utopia in Burkean terms, and it would result in a habit of mind that would amount to a large-scale educational scheme—dare I say, the education of desires. If the young were informed of the dialectical-rhetorical process of transcendence from the beginning, ~<br>

Abstract: To what extent, then, is this ironization—this celebration and cerebration of indeterminacy—consistent with a progressive and dynamic mode of Utopian thought? Or might it indeed be supposed that this inscription of a plurality of perspectives is not only consistent with but essential to a mode of Utopianism as an expression of the manifestation of imagination in a moment at which art and theory converge—insofar as such contradictions allow for the fact that, as Walt Whitman suggested, we are “large” and “contain multitudes”
         
               —and inasmuch as (in Karl Popper's words) “irrefutability is not a virtue of theory … but a vice,” in that “every genuine test of a theory is an attempt to falsify it”?105
            
               Could the imaginary testing of theory advanced by art offer the beginning of a grounding of theory in historical materiality? Could art build its Utopian foundations precisely by deconstructing them?106<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: If Utopia is as permanent as is desire, its survival does not depend on either Marx or communism. Nonetheless, Utopia may be just what Marx needs now, lending to Marxism a preoccupation with space and the city and dreams that it lacks—a significant enhancement that Harvey in
         Spaces of Hopeand, earlier, Lefebvre have articulated. More to the point, the much celebrated failure of communism and Marxism—to date—makes Utopia even more relevant now. While Vidler recognizes a correspondence between his own thinking and Jameson's, he believes that Utopia is all but impossible outside of already transformed conditions: an impossible situation that would inevitably negate any value for Utopia, confirming Vidler's proposition “that utopian thought killed the possibility of utopian thought,” because of its hubris, combined with its very impossibility. In this regard, according to Vidler: “Fredric Jameson has proposed that utopian thought whether in prose or design can offer alternatives in a time of lock-down and melt down…. [B]ut for this to happen, architects have to regain their sense of social responsibility, and their political sanity, vote for a world ruled by communitarian and socialist ethics and practices, and not for a world ruled by the myth that the next technological discovery will provide a solution.”
