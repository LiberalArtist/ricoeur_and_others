  CHAPTER 9  The Distinctiveness of the Society of Jesus’s Mission in Pedro de Ribadeneyra’s Historia ecclesiastica del schisma del reyno de Inglaterra (1588) from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76ttq">Exploring Jesuit Distinctiveness</a><br>
  Author(s) Weinreich Spencer J.<br>
  Abstract: “Two more private and particular considerations encouraged me in the work. The first, that I am a Spaniard; the second, that I am a priest of the Society of Jesus.”¹ Such was the explanation offered by the priest and scholar Pedro de Ribadeneyra (1526–1611) for the production of the
                  Historia eclesiastica del scisma del reyno de Inglaterra(henceforth, the “Historia”), his polemical account of the English Reformation. Troublingly, virtually all scholarship on theHistoriahas concentrated on the former factor, to the detriment of our appreciation of the latter.

  Author(s) Alberg Jeremiah<br>
  Abstract: I begin with a quote from the introduction to René Girard’s
                     Achever Clausewitz.¹ I want to use this quote to extract a kind of operational definition of what it means to “achever,” or, according to the English translation, “to complete,” a thinker and then use this as a programmatic outline for this attempt to understand Rousseau and his status as a religious thinker.

  Book Title: Transpacific Displacement-Ethnography, Translation, and Intertextual Travel in Twentieth-Century American Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Huang Yunte<br>
  Abstract: Yunte Huang takes a most original "ethnographic" approach to more and less well-known American texts as he traces what he calls the transpacific displacement of cultural meanings through twentieth-century America's imaging of Asia. Informed by the politics of linguistic appropriation and disappropriation,
      Transpacific Displacementopens with a radically new reading of Imagism through the work of Ezra Pound and Amy Lowell. Huang relates Imagism to earlier linguistic ethnographies of Asia and to racist representations of Asians in American pop culture, such as the book and movie character Charlie Chan, then shows that Asian American writers subject both literary Orientalism and racial stereotyping to double ventriloquism and countermockery. Going on to offer a provocative critique of some textually and culturally homogenizing tendencies exemplified in Maxine Hong Kingston's work and its reception, Huang ends with a study of American translations of contemporary Chinese poetry, which he views as new ethnographies that maintain linguistic and cultural boundaries.<br>

  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppvzv">Transpacific Displacement</a><br>
  Abstract: What I have described as transpacific displacement is a historical process of dislocation and relocation of cultural meanings via ethnography, translation, and intertextual travel. Interestingly, this complicated cross-over, of which Imagism’s appropriation and reinvention of “Chinese” poetics constitute an important part, now seems to have taken an unexpected turn: readers of contemporary Chinese poetry have been told that the work in front of them is influenced, inspired by Imagism.

  Book Title: Transpacific Displacement-Ethnography, Translation, and Intertextual Travel in Twentieth-Century American Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Huang Yunte<br>
  Abstract: Yunte Huang takes a most original "ethnographic" approach to more and less well-known American texts as he traces what he calls the transpacific displacement of cultural meanings through twentieth-century America's imaging of Asia. Informed by the politics of linguistic appropriation and disappropriation,
      Transpacific Displacementopens with a radically new reading of Imagism through the work of Ezra Pound and Amy Lowell. Huang relates Imagism to earlier linguistic ethnographies of Asia and to racist representations of Asians in American pop culture, such as the book and movie character Charlie Chan, then shows that Asian American writers subject both literary Orientalism and racial stereotyping to double ventriloquism and countermockery. Going on to offer a provocative critique of some textually and culturally homogenizing tendencies exemplified in Maxine Hong Kingston's work and its reception, Huang ends with a study of American translations of contemporary Chinese poetry, which he views as new ethnographies that maintain linguistic and cultural boundaries.<br>

  Abstract: What I have described as transpacific displacement is a historical process of dislocation and relocation of cultural meanings via ethnography, translation, and intertextual travel. Interestingly, this complicated cross-over, of which Imagism’s appropriation and reinvention of “Chinese” poetics constitute an important part, now seems to have taken an unexpected turn: readers of contemporary Chinese poetry have been told that the work in front of them is influenced, inspired by Imagism.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12877vs">The Making of the Humanities, vol. III</a><br>
  Author(s) Richter Virginia<br>
  Abstract: In the first half of the nineteenth century, philological readings of the Scriptures and new approaches in geology – set down, most importantly, in Charles Lyell’s
                  Principles of Geology(1830-1833) – uncovered the various strata of the Book of Books and the Book of Nature, respectively. The result of applying the historical-critical method to the Scriptures was precisely the discovery of its historicity: as philologists and – mainly Protestant – theologians such as Friedrich Schleiermacher and David Friedrich Strauss – whoseThe Life of Jesus, Critically Examined(1835-1836) was disseminated in Britain in George Eliot’s influential translation (1849) – could<br>

  Abstract: On the night of June 16, 1980, Furio Jesi, Italian scholar, critic, poet, novelist, actor and political activist, died in his home, suffocated by an accidental gas leak from the water heater.¹ He had turned thirty-nine only a month before, but his curriculum vitae was already long enough for several people twice his age: he had written nearly twenty monographs on subjects including Egyptology, mythology, German literature, and Hebrew mysticism, as well as newspaper articles, novels, translations, poetry, and a spate of unpublished manuscripts. In 1979, typically, he had produced two books,

  Book Title: The Mission of Demythologizing-Rudolf Bultmann's Dialectical Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Congdon David W.<br>
  Abstract: Since 1941, Rudolf Bultmann’s program of demythologizing has been the subject of constant debate, widely held to indicate Bultmann’s departure from the dialectical theology he once shared with Karl Barth. In the 1950s, Barth referred to their relationship as that of a whale and an elephant: incapable of meaningful communication. This study proposes a contrary reading of demythologizing as the hermeneutical fulfillment of dialectical theology on the basis of a reinterpretation of Barth’s theological project. As such, the volume argues that dialectical theology is fundamentally governed by a missionary logic. Bultmann’s hermeneutical theology extends this dialectical, missionary theology into the field of interpretation. Contrary to many critics, the message of God’s saving work in Christ, and not modern science, funds Bultmann’s hermeneutical program. Like Barth’s own revolution, Bultmann’s program addresses a false relation between gospel and culture. Negatively, demythologizing is a program of deconstantinizing, opposing the objectifying conflation of kerygma and culture that he calls “myth.” Positively, demythologizing is a form of intercultural hermeneutics, composed of preunderstanding and self-understanding. Demythologizing is therefore a missionary hermeneutic of intercultural translation.<br>

  Book Title: To Make the Hands Impure: Art, Ethical Adventure, the Difficult and the Holy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): NEWTON ADAM ZACHARY<br>
  Abstract: How can cradling, handling, or rubbing a text be said, ethically, to have made something happen? What, as readers or interpreters, may come off in our hands in as we maculate or mark the books we read? For Adam Zachary Newton, reading is anembodied practice wherein "ethics" becomes a matter of tact in the doubled sense of touch and regard. With the image of the book lying in the hands of its readers as insistent refrain, To Make the Hands Impure cuts a provocative cross-disciplinary swath through classical Jewish texts, modern Jewish philosophy, film and performance, literature, translation, and the material text. Newton explores the ethics of reading through a range of texts, from the Talmud and Midrash to Conrad's Nostromo and Pascal's Le Memorial, from works by Henry Darger and Martin Scorsese to the National September 11 Memorial and a synagogue in Havana, Cuba. In separate chapters, he conducts masterly treatments of Emmanuel Levinas, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Stanley Cavell by emphasizing their performances as readers a trebled orientation to Talmud, novel, and theater/film. To Make the Hands Impure stages the encounter of literary experience and scriptural traditions he difficult and the holy through an ambitious, singular, and innovative approach marked in equal measure by erudition and imaginative daring.<br>

  Abstract: Hospitality is a multi-faceted concept that has been received by, and worked into, various academic realms and disciplines, such as philosophy, politics, anthropology, aesthetics, ethics, and translation studies. The essays collected in this volume, by a wide range of international contributors, examine how, in the wake of the work of Levinas and the late Derrida, this concept has entered into and transformed the thinking of these disciplines.<br>

  Book Title: Regard for the Other: Autothanatography in Rousseau, De Quincey, Baudelaire, and Wilde-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt E. S.<br>
  Abstract: Although much has been written on autobiography, the same cannot be said of autothanatography, the writing of one's death. This study starts from the deconstructive premise that autobiography is aporetic, not or not only a matter of a subject strategizing with language to produce an exemplary identity but a matter also of its responding to an exorbitant call to write its death. The I-dominated representations of particular others and of the privileged other to whom a work is addressed, must therefore be set against an alterity plaguing the I from within or shadowing it from without. This alterity makes itself known in writing as the potential of the text to carry messages that remain secret to the confessing subject. Anticipation of the potential for the confessional text to say what Augustine calls the secret I do not know,the secret of death, engages the autothanatographical subject in a dynamic, inventive, and open-ended process of identification. The subject presented in these texts is not one that has already evolved an interior life that it seeks to reveal to others, but one that speaks to us as still in process. Through its exorbitant response, it gives intimations of an interiority and an ethical existence to come. Baudelaire emerges as a central figure for this understanding of autobiography as autothanatography through his critique of the narcissism of a certain Rousseau, his translation of De Quincey's confessions, with their vertiginously ungrounded subject-in-construction, his artistic practice of self-conscious, thorough-going doubleness, and his service to Wilde as model for an aporetic secrecy. The author discusses the interruption of narrative that must be central to the writing of one's death and addresses the I's dealings with the aporias of such structuring principles as secrecy, Levinasian hospitality, or interiorization as translation. The book makes a strong intervention in the debate over one of the most-read genres of our time.<br>

Reading Ruth with beginning Hebrew students while I was, for the first time, preparing a translation for publication turned out to be a stroke of holy luck. The translation is substantially different and better because we were beginning together.

  Abstract: It can be argued that printmaking in Europe grew up alongside the printed Christian Bible. The print’s beginnings in Western Europe¹ coincided roughly with the development of the printing press and movable type. Indeed, the impact of the biblical print is in some ways analogous to that of the printed text. Just as the printing press made possible the broader dissemination of the Bible, the print made biblical images widely available. Likewise, translations of the Bible into local vernaculars made the text accessible to those who could not read the Latin Vulgate, just as the printed image “told” the biblical<br>

  Author(s) Oscanyan Frederick S.<br>
  Abstract: SINCE ITS RECENT introduction as an elementary-school philosophy text, Professor Matthew Lipman’s
                  Harry Stottlemeier's Discoveryhas enjoyed a string of successes.¹ First employed in an experimental class in Montclair, New Jersey, in 1970, it is now being used in Newark, New Haven, Omaha, San Antonio, Milwaukee, Pasadena, and Cleveland, and it is moving overseas in Danish, French, and Spanish translations. Its use is associated with astounding increases in reading scores, as well as strong improvements in logic and verbal abilities.² It has helped spawn the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children³ and has encouraged the founding of a<br>

  1  Crucifixion as Wisdom: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155j3m5">The Wisdom and Foolishness of God</a><br>
  Author(s) Barclay John M. G.<br>
  Abstract: The title of this volume—
                  The Wisdom and the Foolishness of God—is drawn from the paradoxical maxim that Paul enunciates in 1 Cor. 1:25: “for the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength” (translations from the New Testament my own). Paul’s arresting expression borders on blasphemy: to speak of the foolishness and the weakness of God is to contradict standard assumptions about the divine, assumptions necessary to maintain God’s status as God. The way Paul’s maxim has reverberated down the centuries, spawning one form of radical theology after<br>

  2  The invention of the unconscious from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155j66d">Resisting history</a><br>
  Abstract: The quest for the historical Jesus was not restricted to the universities or the established Churches. Across Britain and the United States, working-class radicals debated the historical basis of the Gospel records. Before George Eliot’s translation of the
                  Leben Jesuappeared, plebeian secularists had issued cheap pirated editions of Strauss’s work. Their turn to historical enquiry was driven by a very different set of motives to those which animated Eliot and her ecclesiastical colleagues.¹ Some, including the Chartist ex-cobbler Thomas Cooper, believed that historical criticism would reveal the ‘legendary incrustations’ that had corrupted the true history of Christ.² Like Strauss<br>

  Book Title: Women’s writing in contemporary France-New writers, new literatures in the 1990s<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): WORTON MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: The 1990s witnessed an explosion in women’s writing in France, with a particularly exciting new generation of writer’s coming to the fore, such as Christine Angot, Marie Darrieussecq and Regine Detambel. Other authors such as Paule Constant, Sylvie Germain, Marie Redonnet and Leila Sebbar, who had begun publishing in the 1980s, claimed their mainstream status in the 1990s with new texts. The book provides an up-to-date introduction to an analysis of new women’s writing in contemporary France, including both new writers of the 1990s and their more established counter-parts. The editors’ incisive introduction situates these authors and their texts at the centre of the current trends and issues concerning French literary production today, whilst fifteen original essays focus on individual writers. The volume includes specialist bibliographies on each writer, incorporating English translations, major interviews, and key critical studies. Quotations are given in both French and English throughout. An invaluable study resource, this book is written in a clear and accessible style and will be of interest to the general reader as well as to students of all levels, to teachers of a wide range of courses on French culture, and to specialist researchers of French and Francophone literature.<br>

  Abstract: As noted in the introduction to this chapter, the MT and LXX list the first six of the twelve so–called ‘minor prophets’ in different order. For the purposes of this brief survey, the MT order will be followed: it is the one given in most English translations. The book of the twelve intensifies the question of the relationship between unity and diversity in the HBOT: it is one book but within it are twelve books each attributed to a different prophet. Recent scholarship has explored thematic and structural evidence of connections between the books, applying appropriate methodologies, both diachronic<br>

  Author(s) Launderville Dale<br>
  Abstract: Standardisation is necessary for coordinated group activity. There must be some fixed point or process that keeps the diverse members of the group acting in concert. With regard to the sacred text of the Bible, the translator is called to be faithful to the text. Yet as the Word of God, the message is communicated by God’s speaking it and the members of the community hearing it. The letters on the page participate in this communicative act and facilitate it as a fixed point within the process of communication. The translation of God’s Word via human words is more than<br>

  Word of God or Word of God’s People: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt163t9t9">Opening the Bible</a><br>
  Abstract: The most significant factor contributing to the weighty significance of the Bible is probably the phrase ‘the word of the Lord’ or ‘the word of God’ (
                     debar yhwh) in its various equivalents in Hebrew and in translations. Church councils, church authorities, preachers, teachers, and so many others contribute to our understanding of the phrase, from literal to highly metaphoric. Leuven professor Msgr Raymond Collins in that most orthodox of reference works,The New Jerome Biblical Commentary,in his article on Inspiration, writes: ‘This traditional formula [the word of God], apparently simple, is extremely complex and polyvalent.’²<br>

  The Symbology of the Serpent in the Gospel of John from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16ptndz">John, Jesus, and History, Volume 2</a><br>
  Author(s) Charlesworth James H.<br>
  Abstract: Over the past two decades, specialists on the Gospel of John have customarily focused on the translation, composition-history, and exegesis of this masterpiece. Less attention is addressed to the symbolic world of the Evangelist. That dimension of Johannine studies is now much clearer, thanks to archaeological research and the study of symbolism (see Charlesworth 2006 and 2008), otherwise known as symbology. The present work will illustrate this emerging clarity by exploring the deeper and fuller meaning of an incredibly rich and well-known section of the Fourth Gospel: John 3:13–17.<br>

  Introducing Historical Poetics: from:

  Abstract: Theory vs. history; form vs. content; artistry vs. ideology; close reading vs. contextualization: these dichotomies are intrinsic to the way literary scholars have come to think of their subject, especially within the—now globally influential—U.S. academy. This volume explores a critical tradition, known as Historical Poetics, that offers a way of negotiating between these familiar oppositions, blending literary theory, history of poetic forms, cultural history, philosophy of history, and (often less overtly) philosophical aesthetics. In the following chapters, this exploration is undertaken on four different fronts—new translations that make available important theoretical work from the past, contributions to<br>

  Book Title: The Literatures of the French Pacific-Reconfiguring Hybridity<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): FORSDICK CHARLES<br>
  Abstract: Hybridity theory, the creative dissemination and restless to-and-fro of Homi Bhabha’s Third Space or of Stuart Hall’s politics of difference, for example, has opened up understandings of what may be produced in the spaces of cultural contact. This book argues that the particularity of the forms of mixing in the literatures of the French Pacific country of New Caledonia contest and complexify the characterisations of hybrid cultural exchange. From the accounts of European discovery by the first explorers and translations of the stories of oral tradition, to the writings of settler, déporté, convict, indentured labourer and their descendants, and contemporary indigenous (Kanak) literatures, these texts inscribe Oceanian or Pacific difference within and against colonial contexts. In a context of present strategic positioning around a unique postcolonial proposal of common destiny, however, mutual cultural transformation is not unbounded. The local cannot escape coexistence with the global, yet Oceanian literatures maintain and foreground a powerful sense of ancestral origins, of an original engendering. The spiral going forward continually remembers and cycles back distinctively to an enduring core. In their turn, the Pacific stories of unjust deportation or heroic settlement are founded on exile and loss. On the other hand, both the desire for, and fears of, cultural return reflected in such hybrid literary figures as Déwé Gorodé’s graveyard of ancestral canoes and Pierre Gope’s chefferie internally corrupted in response to the solicitations of Western commodity culture, or Claudine Jacques’ lizard of irrational violence, will need to be addressed in any working out of a common destiny for Kanaky-New Caledonia.<br>

  Abstract: The sites of translation from indigenous to European languages, considered in this chapter as further and particular spaces of writing and reading hybridity between cultures, derive from different periods of New Caledonian post-contact history. They also come from different areas of an archipelago that includes the main island of
                  Grande Terre, the Isle of Pines and Belep, to the south and to the north respectively, and the Loyalty Islands – Maré, Lifou, and Ouvéa.

  Abstract: The previous chapters looked at two different kinds of hybrid texts that have resulted from European-Kanak contact: the texts of the European explorers in the eighteenth century and the translations into French of texts of oral tradition in the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries. The present chapter extends the examination of the hybridity of New Caledonian culture(s), their mix of differences and commonalities, by considering the respective approaches to a trope present in the work of every group of writers, from the colonial period to the postcolonial present. This is the theme of exile, or living in-between the lost home,<br>

  Book Title: Medium, Messenger, Transmission-An Approach to Media Philosophy<br>
  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Krämer Sybille<br>
  Abstract: Medium, Messenger, Transmissionuses the figure of the messenger as a key metaphor for the function of all transmission media. Sybille Krämer illustrates this argument with a diverse range of situations involving some form of transmission, including the circulation of money, the translation of languages, the spread of infectious diseases, processes of transference and countertransference as seen in psychoanalysis, and even the development of cartography. This rich study provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of media philosophy while illuminating transmission media as active mediators in all systems of exchange.<br>

  Book Title: The Mutual Cultivation of Self and Things-A Contemporary Chinese Philosophy of the Meaning of Being<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Chad Austin<br>
  Abstract: Yang Guorong is one of the most prominent Chinese philosophers working today and is best known for using the full range of Chinese philosophical resources in connection with the thought of Kant, Hegel, Marx, and Heidegger. In The Mutual Cultivation of Self and Things, Yang grapples with the philosophical problem of how the complexly interwoven nature of things and being relates to human nature, values, affairs, and facts, and ultimately creates a world of meaning. Yang outlines how humans might live more fully integrated lives on philosophical, religious, cultural, aesthetic, and material planes. This first English translation introduces current, influential work from China to readers worldwide.<br>

  Book Title: Grand Hotel Abyss-Desire, Recognition and the Restoration of the Subject<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Safatle Vladimir<br>
  Abstract: Long-expected translation of the Portuguese academic bestseller Grande Hotel Abismo. In the last two decades recognition - arguably one of the most central notions of the dialectical tradition since Hegel - has once again become a crucial philosophical theme. Nevertheless, the new theories of recognition fail to provide room for reflection on transformation processes in politics and morality. This book aims to recover the disruptive nature of the dialectical tradition by means of a severe critique of the dominance of an anthropology of the individual identity in contemporary theories of recognition. This critique implies a thorough rethinking of basic concepts such as desire, negativity, will and drive, with Hegel, Lacan and Adorno being our main guides. The Marxist philosopher György Lukács said that the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer, Adorno, etc.) left us with nothing but negativity towards the state of the world. Their work failed to open up a concrete possibility of practical engagement in this world. All too eager to describe the impasses of reason, the Frankfurt philosphers remained trapped in a metaphorical Grand Hotel Abyss (Grand Hotel Abgrund). It was as living and being guardian of lettered civilization in a beautiful and melancholy grand hotel, of which the balconies face a gaping abyss. But perhaps in this way Lukács gave – and no doubt without realizing it himself – a perfect definition of contemporary philosophy, namely to confront chaos, to peer into what appears to a certain rationality as an abyss and to feel good about it. Touching Hegelian dialectics, critical theory and psychoanalysis, Grand Hotel Abyss gives a new meaning to the notion of negativity as the first essential step for rethinking political and moral engagement.<br>

  The Human in Question: from:

  Author(s) KOSKY JEFFREY L.<br>
  Abstract: Most of the English-speaking audience was introduced to the new French phenomenology, the subject of this volume, through the work of Jean-Luc Marion. In particular, the translation of Marion’s
                  God Without Beingwas the first major work of these authors to achieve widespread attention. Because of this, the new French phenomenology is associated with a “theological turn.” No doubt,God Without Beingjustifies being labeled a theological work. Its project was to give revelation or to think a transcendent God absolutely and unconditionally. The divine transcendence could be given by liberating God from those determinations, which, Marion argued, reduced it<br>

  Abstract: With the translation of

Henry’s previous phenomenological books, such asThe Essence of ManifestationandPhilosophy and Phenomenology of the Body, can be read as significant philosophical works in themselves or alternatively as leading toward his later, more explicitly religious writings.¹ Whether in his dense phenomenological reflections or his intense religious meditations, Henry’s language is provocative, and I would like to second Jean-Luc Marion’s initial negative reaction.

  Book Title: Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western Esotericism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kripal Jeffrey J.<br>
  Abstract: From rumors about gnostic orgies in antiquity to the explicit erotic symbolism of alchemical texts, from the subtly coded eroticism of medieval kabbalah to the sexual magic practiced by contemporary occultists and countercultural translations of Asian Tantra, the history of Western esotericism is rich in references to the domains of eros and sexuality. This volume, which brings together an impressive array of top-level specialists, is the first to analyze the eroticism of the esoteric without sensationalism or cheap generalizations, but on the basis of expert scholarship and attention to textual and historical detail.

  Book Title: Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western Esotericism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kripal Jeffrey J.<br>
  Abstract: From rumors about gnostic orgies in antiquity to the explicit erotic symbolism of alchemical texts, from the subtly coded eroticism of medieval kabbalah to the sexual magic practiced by contemporary occultists and countercultural translations of Asian Tantra, the history of Western esotericism is rich in references to the domains of eros and sexuality. This volume, which brings together an impressive array of top-level specialists, is the first to analyze the eroticism of the esoteric without sensationalism or cheap generalizations, but on the basis of expert scholarship and attention to textual and historical detail. While there are few domains where the imagination may so easily run wild, the various contributions seek to distinguish fact from fiction-only to find that historical realities are sometimes even stranger than the fantasies. In doing so, they reveal the outlines of a largely unknown history spanning more than twenty centuries.<br>

  Abstract: Certain questions are essential for interpretation. One question to be addressed before asking what a text originally meant is, did the text originally state that? For example, if we want to understand what the author of 1 John originally meant by the phrase “the Spirit, the water, and the blood” (5:7–8), we had better be certain that the author of 1 John composed it.¹ How reliable are the Greek manuscripts on which our modern translations are based?<br>

  1  The Meaning of Atheism from:

  Abstract: The word ‘atheism’ is a translation of the Greek
                  atheos, which combines the prefixa(meaning ‘not’ or ‘without’) withtheos(meaning ‘god’). Accordingly the term is most commonly employed as ‘disbelief in, or denial of, the existence of God’. However, this definition is not as straightforward as it appears. In the first place, and most obviously, what is being disbelieved in or denied will change according to the various definitions of God being employed.

  Book Title: Translating the English Bible-From Relevance to Deconstruction<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Goodwin Philip W.<br>
  Abstract: In his detailed and thought-provoking work, Philip Goodwin conducts a thorough analysis of the challenges facing the Biblical translator, with particular focus on the problematic dominance of the King James Version of the Bible in our imaginations – a dominance which has had a deleterious effect upon the accuracy and originality of the translator's work. Goodwin considers the first two chapters of the Lukan narratives in depth, comparing and contrasting a breadth of widely disparate translations and drawing on a rich body of Biblical scholarship to support his thesis. A wide-ranging discussion of other linguistic issues is also conducted, touching on such vital matters as incorporating the contextual implications of the original text, and the attempt to challenge the reader's pre-existing encyclopaedic knowledge. Goodwin evolves a fresh and comprehensive answer to the difficulties of the translator's task, and concludes by providing his own original and charming translation of the first two chapters of Luke's Gospel. 'Translating the English Bible' provides a fascinating insight into the processes of translation and will interest anyone seeking accuracy and fidelity to the Scriptural message. It will also enlighten readers seeking a challenging translation of Luke that casts off the shackles of the 'Holy Marriage' tradition of Biblical translation.<br>

  Chapter Three  Start as you mean to go on? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf395">Translating the English Bible</a><br>
  Abstract: We have seen in the previous chapter that a Relevance based theory of translation (which we christened
                  RTT) presents a number of attractions in forming a broadly based account for a phenomenon which plays an enormously significant role in human behaviour and culture yet has notoriously defied rigorous analysis. The attractions on which we focussed centred on the simplicity of the account, its integration with communication theory as a whole and with other aspects of human behaviour, and its potential for effecting an intellectual rapprochement with other quite different approaches to the problems of human communication, approaches which are far<br>

  Abstract: We saw in Chapter Two that in his exposition of a Relevance Theory of Translation, Gutt introduces the idea of ‘communicative clues’ and ‘direct translation’ at a crucial point in his argument.¹ A communicative clue is a feature of an utterance or a text which guides the hearer or reader to how the communicator intends it to achieve relevance. Gutt proposes eight kinds of communicative clue, and suggests that what he names direct translation ‘calls for the preservation of all communicative clues … [B]y preserving all the communicative clues of the original, such translation would it make it possible for<br>

  Chapter Six  Repetitive texture and four kinds of literalism from:

  Abstract: We ended the last chapter with the potentially disruptive finding that
                  anyfeature of a text may be a communicative clue, and may indeed turn out to be the most important clue to how a given text achieves relevance for a particular reader. As we have seen repeatedly, there is a longstanding practice in biblical translation of attending to only some of the clues to relevance, and this arises because the translator’s mind is clouded by the idea of ‘equivalence’. Because she or he thinks that her task is to produce a target text which is somehow equivalent (however that<br>

  Book Title: Theology in Language, Rhetoric, and Beyond-Essays in Old and New Testament<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Lundbom Jack R.<br>
  Abstract: Theology in Language, Rhetoric, and Beyond' places before a broad audience of students and general readers theological essays on both the Old and New Testaments. Theology is seen to derive from a number of sources: the biblical language, biblical rhetoric and composition, academic disciplines other than philosophy, and above all a careful exegesis of the biblical text. The essay on Psalm 23 makes use of anthropology and human-development theory; the essay on Deuteronomy incorporates Wisdom themes; the essay called "Jeremiah and the Created Order" looks at ideas not only about God and creation but also about the seldom-considered idea of God and a return to chaos; and the essay on the "Confessions of Jeremiah" examines, not the words that this extraordinary prophet was given by God to preach, but what he himself felt and experienced in the office to which he was called. One essay on "Biblical and theological themes" includes a translation into the African language of Lingala, which weaves together the story of early Christianity with the more recent founding of churches in Africa and Asia. Jack R. Lundbom argues eloquently through these essays that theology is rooted in biblical words, in themselves, in rhetoric and their different contexts.<br>

  Author(s) BANDIA PAUL F.<br>
  Abstract: It can be safely argued that over the last couple of decades the discipline of translation history has broadened its horizon beyond mainly Western traditions to include other histories and historical perspectives, thus ensuring pluralism as a basis for constituting a truly comprehensive history of translation. This has generally been a healthy response to Berman’s (1984) assertion that there can be no truly comprehensive theory of translation without a preliminary study of the many and varied histories of translating languages and cultures. It is therefore interesting to look at some of the ways in which translation history has managed to<br>

  Abstract: There is no doubt that history and translation are bound together. Translation represents not only a central process in historical work, but is, in itself, a historical practice. However, so far these ties have not forged connections across the two disciplines. It must be acknowledged that the difference between the status of translation and history in the research community is such that the use of translation by historians has long been considered “normal” and “natural,” while translators studying the history of their profession (so far of little interest to those who are historians by trade) are in general careful not<br>

For example, it is generally accepted that “the oldest known recorded evidence of legal translation is the Egyptian-Hittite Peace Treaty of 1271 BC” (Sarcevic 1997, 23). It would be both impossible and futile to try to pinpoint the reasons for this lack of interest.

  Author(s) BANDIA PAUL F.<br>
  Abstract: It can be safely argued that over the last couple of decades the discipline of translation history has broadened its horizon beyond mainly Western traditions to include other histories and historical perspectives, thus ensuring pluralism as a basis for constituting a truly comprehensive history of translation. This has generally been a healthy response to Berman’s (1984) assertion that there can be no truly comprehensive theory of translation without a preliminary study of the many and varied histories of translating languages and cultures. It is therefore interesting to look at some of the ways in which translation history has managed to<br>

  Microhistory of Translation from:

  Author(s) ADAMO SERGIA<br>
  Abstract: The problem of historical awareness in research concerned with translation is—this is my main assumption—an issue which still deserves a great deal of reflection and investigation. I believe that the challenges posed by historical paradigms and historiographic models can open the study of translation to the dimension of the past with the whole deep, intricate and problematic nexus of questions it brings along with it. In the considerations that follow I would like to take up some of these questions with reference to clues offered by a particular paradigm, that of microhistory, and interrelate them with the claims<br>

  Author(s) FOZ CLARA<br>
  Abstract: There is no doubt that history and translation are bound together. Translation represents not only a central process in historical work, but is, in itself, a historical practice. However, so far these ties have not forged connections across the two disciplines. It must be acknowledged that the difference between the status of translation and history in the research community is such that the use of translation by historians has long been considered “normal” and “natural,” while translators studying the history of their profession (so far of little interest to those who are historians by trade) are in general careful not<br>

  Abstract: Of the many articles that have been written over the years on the subject of legal translation, only a few address the history of legal translation.¹ This lack of interest is surprising since legal translation predates even Bible translation. For example, it is generally accepted that “the oldest known recorded evidence of legal translation is the Egyptian-Hittite Peace Treaty of 1271 BC” (Sarcevic 1997, 23). It would be both impossible and futile to try to pinpoint the reasons for this lack of interest. One of its consequences, however, is that many false or misleading statements have been made about legal<br>

  Author(s) Swann Brian<br>
  Abstract: Translating Native American languages is a very different process from translating European languages. For one thing, the translation of European languages does not usually present real physical and spiritual dangers.¹ For another, there are the complexities of collaboration between non-Native academics and Native American culture-bearers, formerly “informants.” Moreover, translators have to decide how to transform oral expression into a written form, and in addition they may have to produce their own grammars and dictionaries, as part of what Julie Brittain and Marguerite MacKenzie in this volume term “a unique constellation of factors.” This constellation can also include “the interaction of<br>

  Abstract: While some theorists have suggested that translation is impossible (Payne 1971), to a large degree Western civilization and culture has depended upon translated documents originally written in one language into some other, usually more common, language. A large portion of our current understanding of philosophy, history, mythology, and religion comes to us through translated documents. What could we know of Aristotle, Plato, Moses, or Muhammad without contemporary translations of their writings into our mother tongue? From the philosophy of Immanuel Kant to the literature of Victor Hugo, the breadth of human knowledge is inextricably linked to the translation of documents<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter we discuss a number of issues pertinent to the translation of Canadian Aboriginal oral literature, specifically that of the Algonquian peoples of the Quebec-Labrador peninsula (eastern Canada). Our discussion focuses on a collection of “oral texts” (the Innu-Naskapi collection) with which we have been involved as translators since 1985 (MacKenzie) and 1996 (Brittain).¹ Working collaboratively with native speakers of the Aboriginal language, we have now published English translations of several stories from this collection (e.g., MacKenzie 2004; Brittain and Mac-Kenzie et al. 2004, 2005). The Innu-Naskapi collection was recorded on cassette tape in 1967 and 1968. It<br>

  Abstract: I do not think it a stretch to say that translating Native verbal arts occupies an unseen boundary with its comings and goings between what is actually said, what is interpreted, then invented out of those words, and the written text that is presented as a faithful rendition of what was originally stated or sung. And while translation is of course reliant upon getting the words straight, I think the heart of translation is centrally about re-expressing the rhythms and movements expressed by those words. As we are all very much aware, words have the ability to move us. And<br>

  Author(s) Haag Marcia<br>
  Abstract: The central problem of translation, namely, the competition between faithfulness to meaning and preservation of form, grows more attenuated as translation moves from simple conveyance of information to artistic forms. Generally, in working with translations among European languages, the translator struggles with word choices when one language contains a particular word that denotes or connotes an idea that the other language does not. Then the translator seeks synonyms, or may resort to a phrase that more completely captures the sense intended. The translator may also have to deal with problems of grammatical structure: a language may lack a particular verbal<br>

  Author(s): Schwabe Claudia<br>
  Abstract: New Approaches to Teaching Folk and Fairy Talesprovides invaluable hands-on materials and pedagogical tools from an international group of scholars who share their experiences in teaching folk- and fairy-tale texts and films in a wide range of academic settings.This interdisciplinary collection introduces scholarly perspectives on how to teach fairy tales in a variety of courses and academic disciplines, including anthropology, creative writing, children's literature, cultural studies, queer studies, film studies, linguistics, second language acquisition, translation studies, and women and gender studies, and points the way to other intermedial and intertextual approaches. Challenging the fairy-tale canon as represented by the Brothers Grimm, Charles Perrault, Hans Christian Andersen, and Walt Disney, contributors reveal an astonishingly diverse fairy-tale landscape.The book offers instructors a plethora of fresh ideas, teaching materials, and outside-the-box teaching strategies for classroom use as well as new and adaptable pedagogical models that invite students to engage with class materials in intellectually stimulating ways. A cutting-edge volume that acknowledges the continued interest in university courses on fairy tales,New Approaches to Teaching Folk and Fairy Talesenables instructors to introduce their students to a new, critical understanding of the fairy tale as well as to a host of new tales, traditions, and adaptations in a range of media.<br>

  Book Title: Inca Garcilaso and Contemporary World-Making-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Fernández Christian<br>
  Abstract: This edited volume offers new perspectives from leading scholars on the important work of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (1539-1616), one of the first Latin American writers to present an intellectual analysis of pre-Columbian history and culture and the ensuing colonial period. To the contributors, Inca Garcilaso's
      Royal Commentaries of the Incaspresented an early counter-hegemonic discourse and a reframing of the history of native non-alphabetic cultures that undermined the colonial rhetoric of his time and the geopolitical divisions it purported. Through his research in both Andean and Renaissance archives, Inca Garcilaso sought to connect these divergent cultures into one world.This collection offers five classical studies ofRoyal Commentariespreviously unavailable in English, along with seven new essays that cover topics including Andean memory, historiography, translation, philosophy, trauma, and ethnic identity. This cross-disciplinary volume will be of interest to students and scholars of Latin American history, culture, comparative literature, subaltern studies, and works in translation.<br>

Several factors explain this fact: the socioethnic background of the author, the literary quality of the work, the nature of the sources consulted for its composition, and the fact that until late into the nineteenth century it would remain the only published text solely dedicated to the topic of Incan history.

                  Royal Commentaries(1609) as a text for our day, but also to advance the notion that Garcilaso’s ability to appeal to different readerships throughout the centuries, and perhaps in the future, is grounded in the strategies of translation and commentary that Garcilaso detected in the work of Marsilio Ficino (1433–99), Plato’s Renaissance translator and commentator.¹ Another point argues that Garcilaso’s familiarity with Plato’s ideas on the origin of the world and the natural diversity of its cultures allows Garcilaso’s to mount<br>

  Chapter Six  SOME RECENT RECONSIDERATIONS OF RATIONALITY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxpb96">Knowledge and Human Liberation</a><br>
  Abstract: The concept of rationality has been subjected to numerous critiques in the history of modernity, and all these critiques have been helpful in opening rationality to crosscultural translations and examinations. Despite numerous anthropological critiques of a Eurocentric notion of rationality which looks at other people such as the tribal people having a primitive mind, a modernistic and West-centric view of rationality is still very much on the throne. This situation seems to be slightly altering in the realm of philosophical discourse with some recent foundational interrogations of rationality offered by thinkers such as alasdair macIntyre and Stephen Toulmin, who urge<br>

  Chapter 19  ANTHROPOLOGY, DEVELOPMENT AND THE MYTH OF CULTURE from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxpchs">Philosophy and Anthropology</a><br>
  Author(s) Feleppa Robert<br>
  Abstract: Anthropologists have become increasingly involved as participants on development teams, but their great potential to promote sustainable development is hindered by vestiges of one of cultural anthropology’s founding myths. It is the notion of cultures construed as self-contained symbol systems, conceptually opaque to all but true insiders, with an implied notion of correct translation, which makes it an ‘all or nothing’ matter. This notion is also linked to long-standing concerns in the field with moral relativism, value neutrality and colonialism. As a result, within the community of anthropologists working in development, two somewhat opposed positions have arisen: one holds that<br>

  Abstract: In keeping with his view of poetry as encouraging complex and dialectical transformations of the actual, this chapter will discuss how Heaney grants both the effectiveness and the plurality of identifications of Irishness through a further structure, translation. Heaney has spoken a lot about complex structures of meaning and identity, and he has stressed the importance of plurality and influence in his thinking, and in his writing. We have seen his political amphibiousness as well as his displacement and dislocation of foundational attachments to place. We have also seen that he is keen to use the aesthetic as a tool<br>

Among them is a fragment that today is very much in the minds of Husserl scholars.

                     Looking up, Reading the Words as his contribution for the Skulptur Projekte in Münster, Germany, in 1997. The installation consists of a steel mast thirteen metres in height, culminating in a bridge-like structure that supports twenty-two metal antennae deployed in the shape of an oval. These antennae provide the means of securing a series of letters that form German words.

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, I argued that debates about cosmopolitanism, environmental issues, global poverty, and transnational migration have helped to draw into view the norm of all-affectedness as the central reference point for thinking about democratic legitimacy. It is easy enough to think that the principle of all affected interests exhausts the question of
                  whoshould constitute the democratic polity. But the principle of affectedness also relates to questions of effective agency, that is, to the capacity to do things. It refers to thehowof democracy as well the identity of who is affected. The translation of the all<br>

The literal translation ofentrañableas “close/intimate” does not completely describe the intent of the word in Spanish, which implies love that is strong, protective, nurturing, and instinctual (Paul Stucky). The Mennonite church in Teusaquillo, Bogotá has created a space for victims of political violence, which serves as a protective womb, where victims enter vulnerable and desperate and find hope, generosity, and a commitment to peace and justice. The response to thisamor entreñableis reciprocal and restorative. The repetitions of giving and receiving, grieving and celebrating<br>

  Abstract: The crises at the end of the Ming and Qing dynasties, crises caused by dynastic weakness and the threat of foreign domination, had obvious effects on the writing of vernacular fiction, drawing in new authors and giving rise to new themes and new techniques.¹ Of the two crises, the late Qing was the more complex, with economic and cultural challenges superimposed on the military and political threats. Moreover, two additional factors were at work in this period: the new media of newspapers and journals, and foreign fiction, available in translation for the first time.<br>

  Perspective and Focalization in Eighteenth-Century Descriptions from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wn0r6q">Narrative Concepts in the Study of Eighteenth-Century Literature</a><br>
  Author(s) Fludernik Monika<br>
  Abstract: As Cynthia Wall has so magisterially illustrated in
                     The Prose of Things(2006), descriptions of rooms hold a marginal position in eighteenth-century texts. This is due partially to conventions of writing and partially to the absence of fixed furniture arrangements before the end of the eighteenth century. On the one hand, literary descriptions before the eighteenth century were often stylistic exercises in rhetorical enumeration. Mieke Bal, in her superb essay on description, cites (a translation of) alocus amoenuspassage from Longus’s novelDaphnis and Chloë:<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wn0r6q">Narrative Concepts in the Study of Eighteenth-Century Literature</a><br>
  Author(s) Ikonen Teemu<br>
  Abstract: The study of the so-called transnational novel has demonstrated the variety of practices of rewriting inside and across linguistic borders in the eighteenth century Europe (see e.g. Montandon, 1999; Stewart, 2009). Original works from the period are hard to distinguish from translations, translations of translations, pseudo-translations, authorial revisions, free adaptations, impostures, crudely abridged editions and other versions (Stewart, 2009, pp. 164-65). According to Coulet (1992), French authors were particularly busy revising their own works. Significant changes in narration and plot were common. Well-known is marquis de Sade’s transposition from first-person narration in

  Abstract: Until recently the work of French philosopher and musician Vladimir Jankélévitch (1903–1985) has been scarcely acknowledged in the English-speaking world. Over the last few years, some of his texts have appeared in English translation, in part because of the growing recognition of the importance of his moral philosophy for figures such as Paul Ricoeur, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida.¹ It is little known, for example, that Emmanuel Levinas acknowledged Jankélévitch as a source of the notion of the “absolutely” or “wholly other” (

But things are more complex than they appear to be at first sight.

                  Zueignung) to Faust and to Zhukovsky’s “Imitation of Goethe”? Nabokov had composed a verse translation of Goethe’s poem into Russian in 1923. He published that poem in 1932 on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Goethe’s death.² He was thoroughly familiar with Zhukovsky’s<br>

  Book Title: The Translator’s Doubts-Vladimir Nabokov and the Ambiguity of Translation<br>
  Publisher: Academic Studies Press<br>
  Author(s): TRUBIKHINA JULIA<br>
  Abstract: Using Vladimir Nabokov as its “case study," this volume approaches translation as a crucial avenue into literary history and theory, philosophy and interpretation. It attempts to bring together issues in translation and the shift in Nabokov studies from its earlier emphasis on the “metaliterary" to the more recent “metaphysical" approach. Addressing specific texts (both literary and cinematic), the book investigates Nabokov’s deeply ambivalent relationship to translation as a hermeneutic oscillation on his part between the relative stability of meaning, which expresses itself philosophically as a faith in the beyond, and deep metaphysical uncertainty. While Nabokov’s practice of translation changed profoundly over the course of his career, his adherence to the Romantic notion of a “true" but ultimately elusive metaphysical language remained paradoxically constant.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxsjwj">The Translator’s Doubts</a><br>
  Abstract: This book singles out translation as a way of talking about literary history and theory, philosophy, and interpretation. Vladimir Nabokov is its case study. The advantage of making Nabokov a case study for an investigation of questions of translation is obvious. It is hard to separate Vladimir Nabokov from the act of translation, in all senses of the word—ranging from “moving across” geographical borders and cultural and linguistic boundaries to the transposing of the split between “here” and “there” and “then” and “now” (the essential elements of exile, components of every émigré experience) onto a metaphysical plane sometimes suggested<br>

  Abstract: In the summer of 1922, Gamaiun, a Russian publishing company in Berlin, commissioned the twenty-three-year-old Nabokov to translate
                  Alice in Wonderlandinto Russian. As Nabokov’s biographer Brian Boyd aptly noted, Nabokov apparently “found the translation easy work afterColas Breugnon,” his first serious work of translation.¹ Though Nabokov later claimed he had translated Romain Rolland and Lewis Carroll simultaneously, Boyd, based on the evidence of Nabokov’s letters from Cambridge, dates the Carroll translation to the summer of 1922. The translation, with Sergei Zalshupin’s illustrations, was published in 1923 asAnia v strane chudes(“Ania in Wonderland”) under Nabokov’s pen name<br>

  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxsjwj">The Translator’s Doubts</a><br>
  Abstract: In this conclusion, I would like to provide an overview that situates Nabokov vis-à-vis the Russian and Western traditions of translation, and to bring together in this context the central issues of Nabokov’s ambivalent relationship to translation. These issues include his origin—his own “secret stem,” leading back to Russian Romanticism—as well as translation as a vehicle for expressing Nabokov’s own strongly held ideas about art. While Nabokov’s practice of translation undergoes significant changes in the course of his career, his adherence to the idea of some “true,” “metaphysical” language—ever elusive and ever present—remains surprisingly constant.<br>

  CHAPTER FOUR  The Worst Witch from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jbtr6">Stranger Magic</a><br>
  Abstract: The tale of ‘The Prince of the Black Islands’, which is also known in Burton’s translation as ‘The Tale of the Ensorcelled Prince’, and in the most recent French version, simply as ‘The Tale of the Young Man’, closes the first cycle of stories in the
                  Nights. With its happy ending (for some), it ties and knots several threads, and proves the power of the ransom tale. The next cycle, ‘The Porter and the Three Ladies of Baghdad’, will drive home harder the salvific function of the storyteller’s art. Every story in both these groups plunges into depths of inexplicable,<br>

  CHAPTER TWELVE  Money Talks from:

                     Arabian Nights’ Entertainments, with the opening instalment of a satire calledThe Golden Spy – The Introduction; or the First Nights[sic]Entertainment. The author, Charles Gildon, dedicated his book to ‘The author ofA Tale of a Tub’ and with scurrilous, Swiftian scorn, adopts the first person of alouis d’or, a gold coin from the luxurious spendthrifts across the Channel, to excoriate the abuses of contemporary society.<br>

  Abstract: In Weimar in 1815, around three decades after the first performance of

  CHAPTER THREE  Ugly Impulses and a Muddy Heart from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt78n">Overcoming Our Evil</a><br>
  Abstract: A few commentators have noted in passing the similarity between Xunzi’s apparent teaching that “human nature is evil” and Augustine’s notions of original sin. H. H. Dubs inaugurated this line of thought in a 1956 article, in which he argued tendentiously that “like Augustine, [Xunzi] saw that the only safe foundation for authoritarianism is the belief that human nature is fundamentally evil, for then man cannot trust his own reasoning.”¹ More recently A. C. Graham and P. J. Ivanhoe have both rejected this judgment of similarity to Augustine and have argued that a more accurate translation of Xunzi’s slogan

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bdzr">Rhetoric in an Antifoundational World</a><br>
  Author(s) Roberts Patricia<br>
  Abstract: A recurrent issue in the study of public discourse is whether a public sphere might be so constituted as to be both free and liberatory: free in the sense that it would be perfectly inclusive; liberatory in that it would enable participants to identify and critique coercion in institutions. Jürgen Habermas’s lifelong project might best be understood as an attempt to define the characteristics of a sphere with both such qualities, as well as to argue the feasibility of attaining it. The recent translation of Habermas’s early book,
                  The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, is particularly important in this<br>

  Book Title: Faces of History-Historical Inquiry from Herodotus to Herder<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLEY DONALD R.<br>
  Abstract: In this book, one of the world's leading intellectual historians offers a critical survey of Western historical thought and writing from the pre-classical era to the late eighteenth century. Donald R. Kelley focuses on persistent themes and methodology, including questions of myth, national origins, chronology, language, literary forms, rhetoric, translation, historical method and criticism, theory and practice of interpretation, cultural studies, philosophy of history, and "historicism."Kelley begins by analyzing the dual tradition established by the foundational works of Greek historiography-Herodotus's broad cultural and antiquarian inquiry and the contrasting model of Thucydides' contemporary political and analytical narrative. He then examines the many variations on and departures from these themes produced in writings from Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian antiquity, in medieval chronicles, in national histories and revisions of history during the Renaissance and Reformation, and in the rise of erudite and enlightened history in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Throughout, Kelley discusses how later historians viewed their predecessors, including both supporters and detractors of the authors in question.The book, which is a companion volume to Kelley's highly praised anthology
      Versions of History from Antiquity to the Enlightenment,will be a valuable resource for scholars and students interested in interpretations of the past.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32btm9">On the Nature of Consciousness</a><br>
  Abstract: The idea that synesthesias show the inner side of a cross-modal translation capacity at the base of symbolic cognition offers a solution to one of the oldest disagreements in cognitive psychology — the Würzburg controversy over the underlying nature of thought. The debate is still very much with us in the contrast between those who understand thought as a propositional logic (Pylyshyn, 1984) and those who posit its basis in abstract visual-spatial imagery (Shepard, 1978; Lakoff, 1987; Johnson, 1987).<br>

                  psycheaion, in contrast to what I have termed the horizontal sensus communis. Just as psyche-aion was described in terms of the same processes of fluidic dynamics as the “thought of the heart,” it also seems entirely plausible from a contemporary cognitive perspective to understand the range of experiences emerging with deep meditation and psychedelic drugs as cross-modal synesthetic translations across the more abstract or formal stages of perceptual microgenesis.

  Abstract: We have been dealing with the cognitive processes that underlie experiences which we have variously termed higher states of consciousness, transpersonal experience, or presentational states. These have been understood as a reconstitution on the level of symbolic cognition of presence-openness as the basic structure of perception in motile sentient creatures. Horizonal openness and the flow gradients of the ambient array are “real,” “existent,” and inherent to the structure of sentience, but would only be realized as such, as felt meaning for its own sake, on the human level. Presence-openness emerges into presentational symbolic cognition through the synesthetic translation of the<br>

  Abstract: The extremely broad subject of the translation of the Qurʾan into Hebrew has not been studied in sufficient detail. Further study would undoubtedly shed valuable light on the relations between the Jews and Islam during the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Little is known of the context that produced the Hebrew translations, nor their purpose. One of the reasons is, perhaps, the often ambiguous relationship between the Jews and Islam’s sacred text. This relationship speaks directly to issues of religious identity and ethnic belonging, as expressed in the theological and philosophical debate, and implies the acceptance of another conceptual<br>

  Jewish and Muslim Philosophy: from:

  Abstract: Muslim and Jewish philosophers not only studied, interpreted, and commented upon the writings of Aristotle, but also played an important, indeed crucial, role in transferring his philosophy and science to the Christian West. Indeed, the emergence of Aristotle as the philosopher in thirteenth-century Scholastic philosophy is due in great measure to the Latin translations from Arabic of the writings of Avicenna, Averroes, Maimonides, and others. The Middle Ages was the golden age for both Muslim and Jewish philosophy. It was a period of significant contributions in science, as well as in the development of a rational explication of revealed religion.<br>

  Introduction from:

  Author(s) BERMANN SANDRA<br>
  Abstract: There has probably never been a time when issues of nation, language, and translation have been more important or more troubling than they are today. In a world where individual nation-states are increasingly enmeshed in financial and information networks, where multiple linguistic and national identities can inhabit a single state’s borders or exceed them in vast diasporas, where globalization has its serious—and often violent—discontents, and where terrorism and war transform distrust into destruction, language and translation play central, if often unacknowledged, roles. Though the reasons for this are undeniably complex, they are, at least in broad terms, understandable.<br>

  Abstract: In the very last note of

The essays concern the role of the intellectual as translator of what gets forgotten in the contemporary world, the possibility of translating law from culture to culture, the actual practice of simultaneous translation, the translatability and<br>

  Abstract: If one were to search today for a way of reflecting on the destiny of language and literature in an age dominated increasingly by electronic media, there is probably no better place to start—and perhaps even to end—than with the question of translation. This might seem a somewhat surprising assertion to make, given the widespread tendency to associate the rise of electronic media with what is usually called the “audiovisual,” as distinct from the linguistic, discursive, or textual. Such an association is, of course, by no means simply arbitrary. In 1999, the dollar value produced by the sales<br>

  Author(s) STATEN HENRY<br>
  Abstract: Within or, at the boundaries of, literary studies, the most radical extension of the contemporary reflection on the “ethics of translation” is unquestionably that of Gayatri Spivak, with its relentless pursuit of inaccessible cultural otherness. What makes this pursuit so difficult to follow, as some critics have complained, is the accompanying metacritical reflection, adhering simultaneously to Marxism, radical feminism, and deconstruction, on the positionality of the theorizing Metropolitan eye in all its varieties, especially those most closely related to Spivak’s own perspective: the Metropolitan first-world feminist and the “diasporic” intellectual who has come from the Third World to ply her<br>

  Author(s) EAGLESTONE ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: Many commentators have suggested that translation is central to the ethical philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas. Not, clearly, translation from one language to another, in the sense of translating, say, German into French, nor translation in the sense of introducing intellectual developments from one national tradition into another, although Levinas is widely credited with introducing phenomenological thought into France in 1930. The commentators suggest that Levinas offers translation in a wider sense between what he calls “Hebrew” and “Greek,” where the names for the languages stand in for much wider frameworks or worldviews. However, although this is a constructive approach that<br>

  Abstract: It is often claimed today that comparative literature is a kind of translation and, being a practice less transparent than translation, should take translation as its model. This claim feels avant-garde: it resonates with the “linguistic turn” that informed most of the humanistic disciplines during the last quarter of the last century and vividly survives today in neighboring disciplines, like English, foreign languages, history, and anthropology, with their concerns for globalization, the media, and the mentalities of postcolonialism. But whether the translation model for comparative literature is to be a step forward, a step back, or the source of a<br>

  Abstract: Several recent studies focus on translations in order to deconstruct notions of the other and, thereby, to reveal the foreign originary light filtered through the domesticating (here read colonizing, racist, sexist, etc.) lenses of a translating self. Such studies that rigorously locate translations in the moments and places of their translation (rather than in some translatable essence) may expose some general presumptions of lay readers who overlook the translated-ness of a translation. In doing so, however, they obviate the possibility of not only translation, but also reading. That is to say, in finding difference, in explicating the ways in which<br>

The article is of interest because it offers the example of a mysterious technique, “used by the Pagolak-speaking tribe to translate their tongue into the dialects of their neighbors. ‘What was remarkable about this method was that while it produced translations that foreign listeners could understand and accept, it also concealed from them the original meaning of every statement made.’”¹ The narrator is<br>

  [PART THREE Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz7m">Nation, Language, and the Ethics of Translation</a><br>
  Abstract: Social groups both fear and need difference, and three of the essays in this section are linked by this double preoccupation. The other essays explore difference from a slightly different angle: within the very concepts of translation and naming, and across the line, if there is such a line, which divides lived history from memory.<br>

  Author(s) VENUTI LAWRENCE<br>
  Abstract: These comments are drawn from Victor Hugo’s 1865 preface to his son François-Victor’s version of Shakespeare’s works. They are worth examining, not simply because Hugo uses translation as the basis for a critique of nationalism, but because his critique at once exposes and is itself riddled with contradictions that have characterized the relations between translation and national identities, regardless of the language and culture in which the translating is performed. Formulating the contradictory implications of Hugo’s comments, then, will be a useful way to introduce my reflections on nationalist agendas in translation.<br>

  Abstract: The question of metrical translation—its history, theory, and practice—is not often posed in current translation studies, except perhaps by translators who confront “a choice between rhyme and reason,” as Nabokov asked himself in translating Pushkin: “Can a translation while rendering with absolute fidelity the whole text, and nothing but the text, keep the form of the original, its rhythm and its rhyme?”¹ Like swearing an oath to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth before going on trial, the translator who vows to be true to “the whole text, and nothing but the text” must be<br>

  Author(s) BERMANN SANDRA<br>
  Abstract: René Char’s “Feuillets d’Hypnos” brings before us the lived history of the French resistance, joining traumatic memory with hopes for a future of freedom and human dialogue. Closely intertwined with Char’s own actions as captain on the maquis, the collection of prose poems offers a rare engagement with historical experience in poetic form, both a tragic affirmation of life and, in its own right, a means of resistance. But I also argue here that this example of historical poetry illustrates some important connections between the writing of lived historical event and translation. Both are linguistic acts dedicated to the “survival”<br>

  Abstract: Looking to the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the essays in this section examine the role of translation in an increasingly interwoven, globalizing world. Here, translations become exemplary “traveling texts,” capable of highlighting the complex interactions between still vital nationalisms on the one hand, and growing local and international cultures on the other. Four of these essays explore colonial and postcolonial issues in texts from francophone Africa, India, South Africa, and Latin America, while the fifth and final essay takes its literary example from the war-torn Balkans. As each “thick description” suggests, though in very different ways, translations today demand an<br>

  Abstract: The first part of my title refers to the discomfort of many Latin American intellectuals when faced with a postcolonial “model” into which they feel they are expected to fit; a model whose terms have been formulated from, and in reference to, a “center” whose interventions, however well intentioned, continue to be seen as imperialistic and/or simplistic. This is a postcolonialism with which modern Latin American intellectuals and scholars have, at best, a mediated relation, one necessitating multiple reformulations and translations. Furthermore, this is a postcolonialism the nature of which very much depends on its site of enunciation, a postcolonialism<br>

  Book Title: Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna (Ibn Sina)-With a Translation of the Book of the Prophet Muhammad's Ascent to Heaven<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Heath Peter<br>
  Abstract: Islamic allegory is the product of a cohesive literary tradition to which few contributed as significantly as Ibn Sina (Avicenna), the eleventh-century Muslim philosopher. Peter Heath here offers a detailed examination of Avicenna's contribution, paying special attention to Avicenna's psychology and poetics and to the ways in which they influenced strains of theological, mystical, and literary thought in subsequent Islamic-and Western-intellectual and religious history. Heath begins by showing how Avicenna's writings fit into the context and general history of Islamic allegory and explores the interaction among allegory, allegoresis, and philosophy in Avicenna's thought. He then provides a brief introduction to Avicenna as an historical figure. From there, he examines the ways in which Avicenna's cosmological, psychological, and epistemological theories find parallel, if diverse, expression in the disparate formats of philosophical and allegorical narration. Included in this book is an illustration of Avicenna's allegorical practice. This takes the form of a translation of the Mi'raj Nama (The Book of the Prophet Muhammad's Ascent to Heaven), a short treatise in Persian generally attributed to Avicenna. The text concludes with an investigation of the literary dimension Avicenna's allegorical theory and practice by examining his use of description metaphor. Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna is an original and important work that breaks new ground by applying the techniques of modern literary criticism to the study of Medieval Islamic philosophy. It will be of interest to scholars and students of medieval Islamic and Western literature and philosophy.<br>

  Abstract: The

When I first contemplated studying Islamic allegory, I planned to analyze a series of allegories or allegoreses dealing with the single theme of the mi‘râj, heavenly ascent or journey. The most prominent example of this theme in Islamic literature is the prophet Muḥammad’s own mi‘râj, with the accompanying tradition of his Night Journey (isrâ) from the sacred Mosque (in Mecca) to the Further Mosque (in Jerusalem).² This story exists primarily in the form<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hj1hn">Translating Childhoods</a><br>
  Abstract: At ten years old Estela was considered by her mother to be “the right hand” of the family. Estela used her knowledge of English to make and answer phone calls, schedule appointments, sort and decipher the daily mail, fill out forms, apply for credit, help her younger sister with homework, and read stories-in-translation to her youngest siblings. She also helped with general household tasks: washing dishes, vacuuming, and making purchases at the corner store.

  Book Title: The King James Version at 400-Assessing Its Genius as Bible Translation and Its Literary Influence<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Towner Philip H.<br>
  Abstract: In this collection of essays, thirty scholars from diverse disciplines offer their unique perspectives on the genius of the King James Version, a translation whose 400th anniversary was recently celebrated throughout the English-speaking world. While avoiding nostalgia and hagiography, each author clearly appreciates the monumental, formative role the KJV has had on religious and civil life on both sides of the Atlantic (and beyond) as well as on the English language itself. In part 1 the essayists look at the KJV in its historical contexts—the politics and rapid language growth of the era, the emerging printing and travel industries, and the way women are depicted in the text (and later feminist responses to such depictions). Part 2 takes a closer look at the KJV as a translation and the powerful precedents it set for all translations to follow, with the essayists exploring the translators’ principles and processes (with close examinations of “Bancroft’s Rules" and the Prefaces), assessing later revisions of the text, and reviewing the translation’s influence on the English language, textual criticism, and the practice of translation in Jewish and Chinese contexts. Part 3 looks at the various ways the KJV has impacted the English language and literature, the practice of religion (including within the African American and Eastern Orthodox churches), and the broader culture. The contributors are Robert Alter, C. Clifton Black, David G. Burke, Richard A. Burridge, David J. A. Clines, Simon Crisp, David J. Davis, James D. G. Dunn, Lori Anne Ferrell, Leonard J. Greenspoon, Robin Griffith-Jones, Malcolm Guite, Andrew E. Hill, John F. Kutsko, Seth Lerer, Barbara K. Lewalski, Jacobus A. Naudé, David Norton, Jon Pahl, Kuo-Wei Peng, Deborah W.

  The King James Bible in Early Modern Political Context from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjgtt">The King James Version at 400</a><br>
  Author(s) Ferrell Lori Anne<br>
  Abstract: “The Bible only,” the English churchman William Chillingworth wrote in 1638, “is the religion of Protestants.” Whether it was also the religion of England’s Protestant church is the question that prompts this essay. It is a question rarely asked. A number of recent books, shrewdly timed to take advantage of the 400th anniversary of the so-called King James Bible, have focused our attention onto that enterprise of 1611 and the processes, political and scholarly, that allowed other early modern Bibles to be rendered into English. We are now well educated in the Bible’s literary influence, reception, and modes of translation.<br>

  Luther’s Approach to Bible Translation and the KJV from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjgtt">The King James Version at 400</a><br>
  Author(s) Tomlin Graham<br>
  Abstract: Perhaps the two most influential documents that emerged from the Reformation period were Martin Luther’s translation of the Bible into German, which finally appeared in full in 1534, and the King James Version, whose 400th anniversary the English-speaking world celebrated in 2011. Both had an extensive and profound effect on the languages into which they were translated. Luther combined the various forms of contemporary German into one common vernacular usage, which became the basis for a standardized spoken and written language for centuries to come. The King James Version shaped the English language both in England itself and also in<br>

  Author(s) Scanlin Harold P.<br>
  Abstract: The ink was barely dry on the first copies of the KJV when one of the translation committee’s fiercest critics issued a pamphlet decrying its translation choices and recommending ten specific changes, enumerating ten examples of errors and urging that his corrections be sent to all churches that have bought Bibles. That critic was Hugh Broughton, generally considered to be one of the best Hebrew scholars of the day but also known to lack the temperament to be a part of a committee translation. His treatise,

  The Role of the Metatexts in the King James Version as a Means of Mediating Conflicting Theological Views from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjgtt">The King James Version at 400</a><br>
  Author(s) Naudé Jacobus A.<br>
  Abstract: Translations of sacred texts have often been accompanied by metatexts, which function to guide the reader in interpreting the text. The King James Version as it was originally published in 1611 included various kinds of metatexts. This paper examines three metatexts—two metatexts consisting of the two prefaces found in the preliminaries, and the set of marginal notes accompanying the translation. One preface was a three-page dedication to the king. A second, eleven-page preface to the translation articulated the aims and goals of the translators with great clarity. It also carefully specified the nature of the marginal notes as metatexts<br>

  Author(s) Burridge Richard A.<br>
  Abstract: Throughout the extraordinary year of celebration, 2011, there was much discussion and debate, even arguments, about the original purpose of the KJV—religious, political, or cultural?—and what the translators might have thought about it all in the light of this year of celebrations, not to mention the intervening four hundred years. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the original principles and priorities of the translators of the King James Version as explicitly expressed in the prefaces to their translation. Having determined these principles and priorities from the original prefaces to the KJV, I then want to<br>

  Abstract: Perhaps unsurprisingly, in both cases, though the KJV’s literal translation is unexceptionable, the original meaning has been misunderstood. “The root of the matter” is generally used today to mean the essential or inner part of something, the core,² but roots are more properly the origin of things than their essence.

  Abstract: Part of the reason for taking on this subject, I guess, was the memory of teenage irritation, more than fifty years ago, when I found myself increasingly frustrated at the many occurrences of “thou,” “thee,” and “ye”; the suffixes “-eth” and “-est”; and “hath,” “spake,” “wist,” “wax,” and “brethren.” It was all so old-fashioned, out of date, not language I would use in any other context than reading the Bible. So I suppose I wanted an opportunity to say how I came to find the KJV less and less satisfactory and satisfying as a translation. Not simply for me in<br>

  Author(s) Greenspoon Leonard J.<br>
  Abstract: In a recent study of the relationship between the King James Version and English-language biblical translations by/for Jews, I concluded: “In no other language or culture does a single non-Jewish version exert such influence over Jewish translations.”¹ In order to establish a firm foundation for this declaration, two propositions must be demonstrated. The first, which is implicit in my statement, is that the KJV exerted a significant influence on subsequent Jewish English-language texts. The second, which I might term explicit, is that there are no parallels for such extensive influence by any other non-Jewish version in another language or culture.<br>

  Author(s) Peng Kuo-Wei<br>
  Abstract: The history of Protestant Chinese Bible translation is a long and complex one, 1 and therefore the role of the KJV in Protestant Chinese Bible translation needs to be discussed stage by stage. The first stage begins with the translation work of the first Protestant missionaries; the second stage begins with the first (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt at a Chinese Union Version; the third stage is an era of a plethora of Chinese Bible translations; and the last stage I wish to discuss starts with the translation process that led to the completion of a Union Version.<br>

  Abstract: The phrase “lost in translation” is such a cliché that it even became the title of a movie.

  Author(s) Alter Robert<br>
  Abstract: If there is a single attribute large numbers of readers attach almost reflexively to the King James Version, it would most likely be eloquence. The warrant for this attribution is abundantly evident.
                  Eloquence, a term often associated with oratory, perhaps especially delivered orally, suggests a powerful marshalling of the resources of language to produce a persuasive effect, and that quality is manifested in verse after verse of the 1611 translation. It is an intrinsic quality of this English rendering of the Bible that no doubt has been heightened by the virtually canonical status the King James Bible came to enjoy<br>

  Abstract: The aim of this paper is to explore a little of the theological framework that lies behind the effort of translation and also to show the way in which the act of translation itself became a key theological metaphor, a way of understanding and unpacking the truth that the translators believed was at the heart of the words with which they were working. In particular I want to look at what Lancelot Andrewes, whose name headed the list of translators, was thinking and saying about translation in the midst of his work on the KJV, and also at the way<br>

  Author(s) Seidman Naomi<br>
  Abstract: In a field as well trodden as that of Bible translation, a would-be translator has two curiously dissimilar tasks. On the one hand, Bible translators at least since Jerome have insisted on the importance of “going back to the original text,” of coming closer to this original than previous efforts had succeeded in doing. On the other hand, new translations, particularly in the modern period, also aspire to differentiate themselves from their precursors who have worked in the same language, to gain the sort of status that accrues to new translations and is justly withheld from mere revisions.¹ Proximity and<br>

  Abstract: Two hundred years ago, at the spring fair of 1804, Friedrich Wilmans of Frankfurt am Main published Hölderlin’s translation of the two tragedies by Sophocles, under whose dual star all modern thinking about the subject, his status as self-responsible and autonomous citizen, his volition and his fate, stands:
                  Oedipus Rex and Antigone. It is Antigone whom the chorus describes as follows: ‘You alone among mortals live according to your own law.’ Her path thus takes her ‘down into the realm of the dead’.¹ The chorus means this partly as a rebuke: to obey her own and only her own laws<br>

  Book Title: Ciaran Carson-Space, Place, Writing<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER NEAL<br>
  Abstract: Ciaran Carson is one of the most challenging and inventive of contemporary Irish writers, exhibiting verbal brilliance, formal complexity, and intellectual daring across a remarkably varied body of work. This study considers the full range of his oeuvre, in poetry, prose, and translations, and discusses the major themes to which he returns, including: memory and history, narrative, language and translation, mapping, violence, and power. It argues that the singularity of Carson’s writing is to be found in his radical imaginative engagements with ideas of space and place. The city of Belfast, in particular, occupies a crucially important place in his texts, serving as an imaginative focal point around which his many other concerns are constellated. The city, in all its volatile mutability, is an abiding frame of reference and a reservoir of creative impetus for Carson’s imagination. Accordingly, the book adopts an interdisciplinary approach that draws upon geography, urbanism, and cultural theory as well as literary criticism. It provides both a stimulating and thorough introduction to Carson’s work, and a flexible critical framework for exploring literary representations of space.<br>

  CHAPTER SIX  Babel-babble: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjcgf">Ciaran Carson</a><br>
  Abstract: Translation is a longstanding and recurrent component of Ciaran Carson’s work, not only as practice, process, and artefact – as his recent book-length versions of Dante’s
                  Inferno, Brian Merriman’sThe Midnight Court, and the Old Irish epic,The Táin, attest – but also as a theme or trope that relates to the multifarious effects of language itself. In this regard ‘translation’ concerns itself with the ways in which transactions between words, idioms, discourses, and languages reveal the difference that is internal to all language. Or, as Walter Benjamin expresses it, ‘all translation is only a somewhat provisional way of coming to terms<br>

  Abstract: How does one introduce Maryse Condé to the uninitiated reader? Condé’s centrality to Francophone studies and her popularity outside academic circles make this question more than merely rhetorical. Indeed, her fame has spread beyond the academic circle of scholars and students in Francophone studies – far beyond, in fact. English, German, Dutch, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish translations of her work testify to her growing global audience. Her oeuvre has earned her a number of accolades that reflect her widespread appeal: the French government named her Commandeur de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2001 and Chevalier de la<br>

  Book Title: Translating Life-Studies in Transpositional Aesthetics<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): STEAD ALISTAIR<br>
  Abstract: This volume brings together eighteen substantial essays by distinguished scholars, critics and translators, and two interviews with eminent figures of British theatre, to explore the idea and practice of translation. The individual, but conceptually related, contributions examine topics from the Renaissance to the present in the context of apt exploration of the translation process, invoking both restricted and extended senses of translation. The endeavour is to study in detail the theory, workings and implications of what might be called the art of creative transposition, effective at the level of interlingual transcoding, dynamic rewriting, theatrical and cinematic adaptation, intersemiotic or intermedial translation, and cultural exchange. Many of the essays focus on aspects of intertextuality, the dialogue with text, past and present, as they bear on the issue of translation, attending to the historical, political or cultural dimensions of the practice, whether it illuminates a gendered reading of a text or a staging of cultural difference. The historic and generic range of the discussions is wide, encompassing the Elizabethan epyllion, Sensibility fiction, Victorian poetry and prose, modern and postmodern novels, but the book is dominated by dramatic or performance-related applications, with major representation of fresh investigations into Shakespeare (from A Midsummer Night’s Dream to The Tempest) and foregrounding of acts of self-translation on stage, in the dramatic monologue and in fiction. Contributions from theatre practitioners such as Sir Peter Hall, John Barton and Peter Lichtenfels underscore the immense practical importance of the translator on the stage and the business of both acting and directing as a species of translation.<br>

  Abstract: This volume, comprising many individual but conceptually interrelated studies, sets out to multiply perspectives on the concept of translation, making it intellectually generative, an invaluable prompter to reinterpretation of texts and fresh theoretical reflections on pertinent critical issues. Mindful that the ideally singular light radiating from translation as conceived by the translators of the King James Bible might actually be refracted through manifold interpretations, our twenty-two collaborators read and reread through what we would call the prism of translation, shedding on the concept and the texts, to bend one of Philip Larkin’s luminous epithets, a ‘many-angled light’.<br>

  Author(s) WELLS STANLEY<br>
  Abstract: A Midsummer Night’s Dreamis profoundly and constantly—though also delicately and humorously—concerned with processes of change, of translation from one state to another, and its audience is frequently made aware that for human beings translation—any kind of translation—is likely to be a difficult process requiring that obstacles be overcome, and that it may involve loss as well as gain. The most prominent, and most frequently discussed, aspect of translation in the play is from the unmarried to the married state. In no other play by Shakespeare is the process of courtship leading to marriage so central<br>

  Abstract: The question that we would like to open up in this essay is how can we talk about ‘character’. Working together on an edition of
                  Romeo and Juliet, one of us being a theatre director and the other a literary critic, we have found that an area where vocabularies clash most often is that of attributing motivation to the characters’ roles. This emerges most clearly in the translation of these roles from the page to the stage but attribution of motives can be informed by a reversed translation from stage practice to reading strategy. Such attribution immediately calls into play<br>

  Abstract: The subtitle of Hazlitt’s
                  Liber Amoris; or, the New Pygmalion, published anonymously in 1823, promises a retelling of Ovid’s Augustan myth of transformation set in Regency England, a translation from classical to modern times. Unlike Ovid’s poetic invention of a distant mythological past, Hazlitt’s prose version takes place in the quotidian world of London’s lodging houses. However, early nineteenth-century London has no pagan Venus who can effect the metamorphosis required by Hazlitt’s narrator. Obviously, like Mary Shelley’sFrankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus(1818), the subtitle is ironic, and questions the pertinence of classical mythology to the modern world. There is<br>

  Abstract: It took rather longer than I care to admit before I was prepared to concede that Ruskin’s ‘intrinsic value’ is itself a term without intrinsic value.¹ The phrase is at best a promissory note, at worst a semantic relic to ward off the evil eye of commodity. One would suspect that I was taken with, and by, the idea of a talismanic key; an idea which I then read into Ruskin’s words in order to find there the confirmation that I desired.

  Abstract: Any artistic production inevitably involves an act of translation, a transference of a form, commodity, or idea across a boundary, be that boundary one of time, space, language, or cultural medium. Shakespeare and his works are among the most durable and flexible of translated media, and seem unlikely to be easily exhausted. Particularly interesting are the ways in which ‘Shakespeare’ operates both as an enabling medium and as an object who is himself translated. Within the economy of translation, the facilitating medium is a common point of reference, a shared experience which first makes conceivable the possibility and desirability of<br>

  Abstract: Some texts—one thinks, almost at random, of

It is my contention in this essay that Allan Hollinghurst’s second and, so far, best novel,The Folding Star(1992),³ is a tragicomic gay romance which is concerned in many ways with translation itself as well as with various kinds of ‘shadowy transposition’.⁴ Translating intriguingly across sexual orientations (straight, gay), cultures (English, Belgian) and periods (principally, twofins de siècle, the 1890s<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjkzw">French Studies in and for the 21st Century</a><br>
  Author(s) Rothwell Andrew<br>
  Abstract: As is now widely recognised, translation has played a major role at key historical periods in the development of national cultures and vernacular languages across Europe, with France being no exception. The terms
                  traductionandtraducteurwere introduced into French in the sixteenth century by Etienne Dolet (1509–46), a humanist and translator regarded as the first translation theorist (and infamously burnt at the stake for a doctrinally deviant ‘mistranslation’ of Plato). Translation in the Renaissance, a preoccupation of the Pléiade poets as it was of Montaigne, served both to make Classical works available to a wider audience and to<br>

  Author(s) Chafer Tony<br>
  Abstract: In the 1970s, staff in the School of Languages and Area Studies (SLAS) at Portsmouth Polytechnic (as it was then) decided to develop a new type of language degree. At that time, the traditional model was the ‘lang and lit’ degree programme. Students who wanted to study languages were more or less obliged to combine the study of their chosen language(s) with the study of (mostly) the literary classics of that country. There were a few exceptions: York University, for example, offered programmes in language and linguistics, Salford and Bath specialised in translation, while Aston offered students the opportunity to<br>

  Book Title: Utopia-Second Edition<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): HARP JERRY<br>
  Abstract: Saint Thomas More's
      Utopiais one of the most important works of European humanism and serves as a key text in survey courses on Western intellectual history, the Renaissance, political theory, and many other subjects. Preeminent More scholar Clarence H. Miller does justice to the full range of More's rhetoric in this masterful translation. In a new afterword to this edition, Jerry Harp contextualizes More's life andUtopiawithin the wider frames of European humanism and the Renaissance."Clarence H. Miller's fine translation tracks the supple variations of More's Latin with unmatched precision, and his Introduction and notes are masterly. Jerry Harp's new Afterword adroitly places More's wonderful little book into its broader contexts in intellectual history."-George M. Logan, author ofThe Meaning of More's "Utopia""Sir Thomas More'sUtopiais not merely one of the foundational texts of western culture, but also a book whose most fundamental concerns are as urgent now as they were in 1516 when it was written. Clarence H. Miller's wonderful translation of More's classic is now happily once again available to readers. This is the English edition that best captures the tone and texture of More's original Latin, and its notes and introduction, along with the lively afterward by Jerry Harp, graciously supply exactly the kinds of help a modern reader might desire."-David Scott Kastan, Yale University<br>

In the Chinese portion, the embodiment of the Round Brightness is the multiplejing, which can be analyzed through their representations.

  Abstract: Translation is based, as Walter Benjamin intimates in his essay on translation, "Die Aufgabe des Übersetzers" ("The Task of the Translator"; 1923), on an exhilarating paradox and a fundamental metaphysical conundrum. Benjamin's thesis is that translation is possible, indeed necessary, because all languages are connected to one original language (on language and translation in Benjamin see also Andrew Benjamin, "The Absolute"; Jacobs; and Fynsk). Benjamin calls this original language "pure language" ("die reine Sprache"). But perhaps "related" is a better word than "connected" since in Benjamin's thought there is a strong sense of origin and genealogy—of kinship ("Verwandtschaft"). It<br>

As part of a government mission to Europe, he lived in France from 1871 to 1874, during which time he studied law, philosophy, history, and literature. After returning to Japan he opened his own school for French language studies, and undertook a translation of Rousseau’s

  Abstract: Tsujimura Kōichi studied philosophy at Kyoto University under Tanabe Hajime,* and went on to assume his teacher’s chair from 1948 until retiring in 1982. More formative for his thinking, however, was the Zen he practiced with Hisamatsu Shin’ichi,* coupled with the thought of Martin Heidegger, whom he knew personally from travels in Germany. His translations and essays often elucidated Zen texts and Heidegger’s thought in the light of one another to introduce novel interpretations of both. For example, Tsujimura translated Heidegger’s term

  Book Title: The Hermes Complex-Philosophical Reflections on Translation<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>

  Abstract: When Hermes handed over to Apollo his finest invention, the lyre, in exchange for promotion to the status of messenger of the gods, he relinquished the creativity that gave life to his words.The trade-off proved frustrating: Hermes chafed under the obligation to deliver the ideas and words of others and resorted to all manner of ruses in order to assert his presence in the messages he transmitted. His theorizing descendants, too, allow their pretentions to creatorship to interfere with the actual business of reinventing originals in another language.Just as the Hermes of old delighted in leading the traveller astray, so his descendants lead their acolytes, through thickets of jargon, into labyrinths of eloquence without substance.Charles Le Blanc possesses the philosophical tools to dismantle this empty eloquence: he exposes the inconsistencies, internal contradictions, misreadings, and misunderstandings rife in so much of the current academic discourse en translation, and traces the failings of this discourse back to its roots in the anguish of having traded authentic creativity for mere status.<br>

  TRANSLATOR’S FOREWORD from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wr8cv">The Hermes Complex</a><br>
  Author(s) Folkart Barbara<br>
  Abstract: In this remarkable book, Charles Le Blanc subjects the received wisdom of academic translation studies to the scrutiny made possible by a formidable philosophical culture. Engaging with his elegant, rigorous and unflinchingly polemical argumentation has been for me, as I hope it will for the reader of this translation, an immensely stimulating experience. It has also provided validation of a position I have long been defending in my own writings: if the translator is unable to make the original hers, she will fail to bring it to life in the target-language. At every turn of the phrase, then, I have<br>

  Book Title: Listening Long and Late-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Everwine Peter<br>
  Abstract: "What a rich array of music lies within
      Listening Long and Late.With refreshing authenticity, Everwine weds playfulness to practice, lyricism to narrative, pathos to the ordinary. Indeed, he has listened 'long and late' to the music of such venerable masters as Tu Fu, the hidden genius on the street, and the anonymous Aztec poets of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Everwine writes with the same 'deified heart' that divines the mystery of his quotidian subjects in a language that is at once plain and poetic. His own work seamlessly segues into his translations from the Hebrew and Nahuatl, as if all the poems belonged to the same poet, which they in fact do, as the glorious multitudes of Peter Everwine, one of the masters of our age."-Chard deNiord<br>

  CHAPTER 14  Defeating Evil from Within: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7pds6">Religion after Religion</a><br>
  Abstract: The greatest scholarship requires the closest study. Gershom Scholem’s classic essay “Redemption through Sin” remains one of the most influential essays written not only in Jewish Studies but in the History of Religions more generally.¹ It was a tour de force, serving at once as programmatic seed, historiographic manifesto, research agenda, and transvaluational breakthrough. Even after many translations and republications, this essay remains positioned in Scholem’s corpus as a vital synthesis of his innovative creativity. But the paradoxical morality articulated by Scholem in “Redemption through Sin” only appears to be utterly novel. In fact, it emerges more and more clearly<br>

  Book Title: The Aesthetics of Mimesis-Ancient Texts and Modern Problems<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Halliwell Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Mimesis is one of the oldest, most fundamental concepts in Western aesthetics. This book offers a new, searching treatment of its long history at the center of theories of representational art: above all, in the highly influential writings of Plato and Aristotle, but also in later Greco-Roman philosophy and criticism, and subsequently in many areas of aesthetic controversy from the Renaissance to the twentieth century. Combining classical scholarship, philosophical analysis, and the history of ideas--and ranging across discussion of poetry, painting, and music--Stephen Halliwell shows with a wealth of detail how mimesis, at all stages of its evolution, has been a more complex, variable concept than its conventional translation of "imitation" can now convey.<br>

  Book Title: Writing Outside the Nation-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): SEYHAN AZADE<br>
  Abstract: Some of the most innovative writers of contemporary literature are writing in diaspora in their second or third language. Here Azade Seyhan describes the domain of transnational poetics they inhabit. She begins by examining the works of selected bilingual and bicultural writers of the United States (including Oscar Hijuelos, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Eva Hoffman) and Germany (Libuse Moníková, Rafik Schami, and E. S. Özdamar, among others), developing a new framework for understanding the relationship between displacement, memory, and language. Considering themes of loss, witness, translation, identity, and exclusion, Seyhan interprets diasporic literatures as condensed archives of cultural and linguistic memory that give integrity and coherence to pasts ruptured by migration.<br>

These judgments were shallow, as we are now in a position to see. Eros’ sweetness is inseparable from his bitterness, and each participates, in a way not yet obvious at all, in our human will to knowledge. There would seem to be some resemblance between the way Eros acts in the mind of a lover and the way knowing<br>

  Abstract: In the 1980s, cultural anthropology in the United States was transformed by a growing body of critical literature that focused on the politics of ethnography. Historians of anthropology, anthropologists themselves, and literary critics have turned their attention toward the writing of fieldwork as a locus of power relations and historical contexts.¹ The text itself, the document that certifies the authenticity of fieldwork, has come under scrutiny from critics who view ethnography not as a transparent window onto another culture but rather as a poetic and rhetorical translation, inevitably partial and contested.

  Author(s) Verdon John<br>
  Abstract: That higher life forms exist in the two physical categories of female and male is universally self-evident and is not of itself a problem. Beyond this basic understanding, however, the two sexes become associated with a vast panorama of cultural phenomena, including categorical ascriptions of social roles, behavioural expectations, and personality characteristics. How does the simple, incontrovertible, and universal fact of biological dimorphism generate the staggering complexity of cultural, social, and psychological dynamics of the human condition? It is the translation of the biological into social/cultural experience that is the heart of an epistemology of gender. An elaboration of the<br>

  Book Title: The Future of the Word-An Eschatology of Reading<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Kriner Tiffany Eberle<br>
  Abstract: In scripture, Jesus promises a future that potentiall infuses all texts: "my words will not pass away" (Matt 24:28). This book argues that texts--even literary texts--, have an eschatology, too, a part of God's purpose for the cosmos. They, with all creation, moves toward participation in the new creation, in the Trinity's expanding, creative love. This eschatological future for texts impacts how we understand meaning making, from the level of semiology to that of hermeneutics. This book tells he story of how readers participate in the future of the word, the eschatology of texts. If texts have a future i the kingdom of God, then readers' engagement with them--everything from preservation and utterance to translation, criticism, and call and response--can cultivate those futures in the love of the Trinity. Kriner explores how the fallenness and failures of texts, alongside readers' own failures, while seeming to challenge the future of the word, ultimately point to reading as a posture of reconciliation, in which reader and text meet in the Maranatha of all text.<br>

  Abstract: The period of the High Middle Ages (twelfth-thirteenth century) is often regarded as a ‘renaissance’ of the ancient philosophy from a cultural historical point of view. This is especially true for Aristotelism, that was rediscovered from the twelfth century onwards through a real boom in Latin translations of original texts by Aristotle (translated both directly from Greek and indirectly from Arabic), spuria and Arabic commentaries. Although the largest part of the

  Abstract: This essay concerns both the translation and the understanding of the verb τελειόω in relation to love in 1 John 4. The way that τελειόω has traditionally been translated into English, I believe, has in some measure concealed a significant aspect of the point that 1 John 4 is making, and I hope to take a step toward bringing that aspect into the open.<br>

  NOTES ON LATIN AMERICAN-CANADIAN LITERATURE from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.cttq93rp">Reordering of Culture</a><br>
  Author(s) Etcheverry Jorge<br>
  Abstract: LATIN AMERICAN-CANADIAN LITERATURE is currently undergoing rapid development. Practically nonexistent, until the second half of the 1970s except for the presence of certain writers, it is now laying claim to a well-defined space within the “Canadian mosaic.” Symptomatic of this trend is the fact that publishing houses such as Coach House, Wallace, Québec Amérique, and others,¹ are publishing Canadian-Latin American authors in English and French translation. Apart from this activity, there are also publishing efforts in the Latin American ethno-cultural sphere itself, characterized by editorial criteria that vary from publisher to publisher; however, all these publishers give priority to the<br>

  Book Title: Everyone Says No-Public Service Broadcasting and the Failure of Translation<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): CONWAY KYLE<br>
  Abstract: Quebec has never signed on to Canada's constitution. After both major attempts to win Quebec's approval - the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords - failed, Quebec came within a fraction of a percentage point of voting for independence. Everyone Says No examines how the failure of these accords was depicted in French and English media and the ways in which journalists' reporting failed to translate the differences between Quebec and the rest of Canada. Focusing on the English- and French-language networks of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Kyle Conway draws on the CBC/Radio Canada rich print and video archive as well as journalists' accounts of their reporting to revisit the story of the accords and the furor they stirred in both French and English Canada. He shows that CBC/Radio Canada attempts to translate language and culture and encourage understanding among Canadians actually confirmed viewers' pre-existing assumptions rather than challenging them. The first book to examine translation in Canadian news, Everyone Says No also provides insight into Canada's constitutional history and the challenges faced by contemporary public service broadcasters in increasingly multilingual and multicultural communities.<br>

  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/9781442695344">Herder's Political Thought</a><br>
  Abstract: Herder’s thought displays a richness and subtlety that with some notable exceptions has been inadequately appreciated in the Anglo-American tradition. There are now sufficient translations from which it is possible to obtain a far richer grasp of the complexity of his ideas, but there is still considerable work that needs to be done in this regard. This lack is itself indicative of the relatively scant scholarly attention paid in the English-speaking world to one of Germany’s most important thinkers of the eighteenth century. Despite the general acknowledgment of his profound influence on the development of a wide range of disciplines<br>

  Author(s) Manenti Davide<br>
  Abstract: In the early nineteenth century, Schleiermacher noted that ‘understanding is an unending task’ and ‘the talent for misunderstanding is infinite’.² In more recent times, meaning has been understood as an endless deferral; the more one tries to grasp it, the more it appears ungraspable. This rings especially true if we consider the particular form of understanding that is translation. Since the meaning of a text is closely attached to its ‘letter’ – its sound or signifier – translation can never be a simple transfer of meaning. Indeed, no matter how accurately one brings meaning ‘home’,³ the result is inevitably approximate,<br>

  Abstract: Following Katherine Mansfield’s death in 1923, critical reviews of her work started to appear in France, fuelling an interest which concentrated primarily on her life and personal writing, and only secondarily on her fiction. This thirst for biographical detail gave impetus to the translations of the

  Author(s) Huang Alexander C. Y.<br>
  Abstract: Literary translation is a love affair. Depending on the context, it could be love at first sight or hot pursuit of a lover’s elusive nodding approval. In other instances it could be unrequited love, and still others a test of devotion and faith; or else an eclectic combination of any of these events. Translation involves artistic creativity, not a workshop of equivalences. As human civilizations developed and intersected, translation emerged as a necessary form of communication and a way of life. It highlighted and put to productive use the space between cultures, between individuals with different perspectives and within one’s<br>

  Abstract: This anthology collects texts and papers from the Paul de Man archive, including essays on art, translations, critical fragments, research plans, interviews, and reports on the state of comparative literature. The volume engages with Paul de Man's institutional life, gathering together pedagogical and critical material to investigate his profound influence on the American academy and theory today. It also contains a number of substantial, previously unpublished and untranslated texts by de Man from the span of his writing career. As a new collection of primary sources this volume further stimulates the growing reappraisal of de Man's work.<br>

Despite the distinction and importance of his other novels, Flaubert had to reconcile himself to the fact that he became known, once and forever, as the author ofMadame Bovary. The popularity of the novel has increased rather than diminished with time. Numberless translations exist in various languages; the word “bovarysme” has become part of the French language; the myth surrounding the figure of Emma Bovary is so powerful that, as in the case of Don Quixote, or<br>

  Book Title: “The Useless Mouths” and Other Literary Writings-  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Le Bon de Beauvoir Sylvie<br>
  Abstract: "The Useless Mouths" and Other Literary Writings brings to English-language readers literary writings--several previously unknown--by Simone de Beauvoir. Culled from sources including various American university collections, the works span decades of Beauvoir's career. Ranging from dramatic works and literary theory to radio broadcasts, they collectively reveal fresh insights into Beauvoir's writing process, personal life, and the honing of her philosophy. The volume begins with a new translation of the 1945 play The Useless Mouths, written in Paris during the Nazi occupation. Other pieces were discovered after Beauvoir's death in 1986, such as the 1965 short novel "Misunderstanding in Moscow," involving an elderly French couple who confront their fears of aging. Two additional previously unknown texts include the fragmentary "Notes for a Novel," which contains the seed of what she later would call "the problem of the Other," and a lecture on postwar French theater titled Existentialist Theater. The collection notably includes the eagerly awaited translation of Beauvoir's contribution to a 1965 debate among Jean-Paul Sartre and other French writers and intellectuals, "What Can Literature Do?" Prefaces to well-known works such as Bluebeard and Other Fairy Tales, La Bâtarde, and James Joyce in Paris: His Final Years are also available in English for the first time, alongside essays and other short articles. A landmark contribution to Beauvoir studies and French literary studies, the volume includes informative and engaging introductory essays by prominent and rising scholars. Contributors are Meryl Altman, Elizabeth Fallaize, Alison S. Fell, Sarah Gendron, Dennis A. Gilbert, Laura Hengehold, Eleanore Holveck, Terry Keefe, J. Debbie Mann, Frederick M.

  Book Title: Cannibal Metaphysics-  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Skafish Peter<br>
  Abstract: The iconoclastic Brazilian anthropologist and theoretician Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, well known in his discipline for helping initiate its "ontological turn," offers a vision of anthropology as "the practice of the permanent decolonization of thought." After showing that Amazonian and other Amerindian groups inhabit a radically different conceptual universe than ours-in which nature and culture, human and nonhuman, subject and object are conceived in terms that reverse our own-he presents the case for anthropology as the study of such "other" metaphysical schemes, and as the corresponding critique of the concepts imposed on them by the human sciences. Along the way, he spells out the consequences of this anthropology for thinking in general via a major reassessment of the work of Claude Lévi-Strauss, arguments for the continued relevance of Deleuze and Guattari, dialogues with the work of Philippe Descola, Bruno Latour, and Marilyn Strathern, and inventive treatments of problems of ontology, translation, and transformation. Bold, unexpected, and profound,
      Cannibal Metaphysicsis one of the chief works marking anthropology's current return to the theoretical center stage.<br>

  Book Title: The Thought of Death and the Memory of War-  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
  Abstract: War lays bare death and our relation to it. And in the wars-or more precisely the memories of war-of the twentieth century, images of the deaths of countless faceless or nameless others eclipse the singularity of each victim's death as well as the end of the world as such that each death signifies. Marc Crépon's The Thought of Death and the Memory of War is a call to resist such images in which death is no longer actual death since it happens to anonymous others, and to seek instead a world in which mourning the other whose mortality we always already share points us toward a cosmopolitics. Crépon pursues this path toward a cosmopolitics of mourning through readings of works by Freud, Heidegger, Sartre, Patocka, Levinas, Derrida, and Ricœur, and others. The movement among these writers, Crépon shows, marks a way through-and against-twentieth-century interpretation to argue that no war, genocide, or neglect of people is possible without suspending how one relates to the death of another human being. A history of a critical strain in contemporary thought, this book is, as Rodolphe Gasché says in the Foreword, "a profound meditation on what constitutes evil and a rigorous and illuminating reflection on death, community, and world." The translation of this work received financial support from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<br>

Marc Crépon's The Thought of Death and the Memory of War is a call to resist such images in which death is no longer actual death since it happens to anonymous others, and to seek instead a world in which mourning the other whose mortality we always already share points us toward a cosmopolitics. Crépon pursues this path toward a cosmopolitics of mourning through readings of works by Freud, Heidegger, Sartre, Patocka, Levinas, Derrida, and Ricœur, and others. The movement among these writers, Crépon shows, marks a way through-and against-twentieth-century interpretation to argue that no war, genocide, or neglect of people is possible without suspending how one relates to the death of another human being. A history of a critical strain in contemporary thought, this book is, as Rodolphe Gasché says in the Foreword, "a profound meditation on what constitutes evil and a rigorous and illuminating reflection on death, community, and world." The translation of this work received financial support from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<br>

  Abstract: Suggesting a space of translation occupied by hybrid forms of communication, the improvised meeting place outlined here naturally suggests kinship with the well-known and roughly contemporary concepts of third space (Homi Bhabha) and ThirdSpace (Edward Soja); in fact, cultural studies texts and theses regularly bracket these ideas together. This is flattering, and in seeking to differentiate the dynamics of the meeting place from their larger theorizations of a politically emancipatory intercultural domain, the object is not to prove either priority or superiority. Quite the reverse, the description of colonial encounter that discloses a postcolonial potential is probably the concrete everyday<br>

  J. Hillis Miller: from:

  Author(s) Pease Donald<br>
  Abstract: Several abrupt turns mark the critical career of J. Hillis Miller and withhold from his works that sense of stability and continuity that a lifelong pursuit of a single critical project might otherwise provide. They do so, moreover, because they seem precipitated more by Miller’s translation and adaptation of the positions of other critics than by reversals in his own thinking. First, there was the New Critical dissertation at Harvard; then, after a one-year stay at Williams in 1952-53, the years of phenomenological criticism at Johns Hopkins from 1953 to 1972, and more recently the move to deconstruction at Yale.<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy Beside Itself-On Deconstruction and Modernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Marshall Donald<br>
  Abstract: The writings of French philosopher Jacques Derrida have been the single most powerful influence on critical theory and practice in the United States over the past decade. But with few exceptions American philosophers have taken little or no interest in Derrida’s work, and the task of reception, translation, and commentary has been left to literary critics. As a result, Derrida has appeared as a figure already defined by essentially literary critical activities and interests. Stephen Melville’s aim in Philosophy Beside Itself is to insist upon and clarify the distinctions between philosophy and criticism. He argues that until we grasp Derrida’s philosophical project as such, we remain fundamentally unable to see his significance for criticism. In terms derived from Stanley Cavell’s writings on modernism, Melville develops a case for Derrida as a modernist philosopher, working at once within and against that tradition and discipline. Melville first places Derrida in a Hegelian context, the structure of which he explores by examining the work of Heidegger, Lacan, and Bataille. With this foundation, he is able to reappraise the project of deconstructive criticism as developed in Paul de Man’s Blindness and Insight and further articulated by other Yale critics. Central to this critique is the ambivalent relationship between deconstructive criticism and Lacanian psychoanalysis. Criticism—radical self-criticism—is a central means through which the difficult facts of human community come to recognition, and Melville argues for criticism as an activity intimately bound to the ways in which we do and do not belong in time and in community. Derrida’s achievement has been to find a new and necessary way to assert that the task of philosophy is criticism; the task of literary criticism is to assume the burden of that achievement. Stephen Melville is an assistant professor of English at Syracuse University, and Donald Marshall is a professor of English at the University of Iowa.<br>

  Book Title: The Brain Is the Screen-Deleuze and the Philosophy of Cinema<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Flaxman Gregory<br>
  Abstract: In the nearly twenty years since their publication, Gilles Deleuze’s books about cinema have proven as daunting as they are enticing—a new aesthetics of film, one equally at home with Henri Bergson and Wim Wenders, Friedrich Nietzsche and Orson Welles, that also takes its place in the philosopher’s immense and difficult oeuvre. With this collection, the first to focus solely and extensively on Deleuze’s cinematic work, the nature and reach of that work finally become clear. Composed of a substantial introduction, twelve original essays produced for this volume, and a new English translation of a personal, intriguing, and little-known interview with Deleuze on his cinema books, The Brain Is the Screen is a sustained engagement with Deleuze’s cinematic philosophy that leads to a new view of the larger confrontation of philosophy with cinematic images.

Berthoud, in his in-depth critique of Jameson, “Narrative and Ideology” (1985), states, “The attempt to construct a narrative grammar to account for our capacity to recognize and discuss plots or stories extractable from narrative texts has been thoroughly discredited.”² These two statements should certainly be qualified.

  Abstract: Translatio, the act of transferring authority, significance, of transplanting, grafting, of transposing, was a concept that for the literate meant that ideas, meanings, words, or things would be moved from one sphere to another.¹ The very act of removal was intended to convey the carefully interlocked sets of meanings that had obtained in the original sphere to the new sphere, thus investing the new medium with the power of the old.

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttvb35">Strategies of Deconstruction</a><br>
  Abstract: It is often said that Jacques Derrida’s early critiques of Husserl and Saussure provide the most carefully argued introductions to his “deconstructive” approach to the tradition of Western philosophy. Indeed, it has been said that one virtue of his early texts of the late 1960s is that in them Derrida still
                  argued. Many writers on Derrida have found that his texts generally measure up to the highest standards of scholarly rigor. Thus in the preface to the English translation ofLa voix et le phénomène, Newton Garver writes that “Derrida’s critique of Husserl is a first-class piece of analytical work<br>

  Book Title: Roberto Bolaño's Fiction-An Expanding Universe<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): ANDREWS CHRIS<br>
  Abstract: Andrews provides new readings and interpretations of Bolaño's novels, including
      2666,The Savage Detectives, andBy Night in Chilewhile at the same time examining the ideas and narrative strategies that unify his work. He begins with a consideration of the reception of Bolaño's fiction in English translation, examining the reasons behind its popularity. Subsequent chapters explore aspects of Bolaño's fictional universe and the political, ethical, and aesthetic values that shape it. Bolaño emerges as the inventor of a prodigiously effective "fiction-making system," a subtle handler of suspense, a chronicler of aimlessness, a celebrator of courage, an anatomist of evil, and a proponent of youthful openness. Written in a clear and engaging style,Roberto's Bolano's Fictionoffers an invaluable understanding of one of the most important authors of the last thirty years.<br>

  Abstract: This is a book of literary criticism. Although I have had the lucky privilege of being one of Roberto Bolaño’s translators, translation will not be my main concern in the following pages. And although Bolaño responded to my queries in the last year and a half of his life, I have no biographical revelations to offer. These opening disclaimers made, I would like to comment briefly on the ways the critical approach adopted here is related—indirectly—to the work of translation and to the life of the author studied.<br>

  Book Title: The Force of the Example-Explorations in the Paradigm of Judgment<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Allen Amy<br>
  Abstract: During the twentieth century, the view that assertions and norms are valid insofar as they respond to principles independent of all local and temporal contexts came under attack from two perspectives: the partiality of translation and the intersubjective constitution of the self, understood as responsive to recognition. Defenses of universalism have by and large taken the form of a thinning out of substantive universalism into various forms of proceduralism.<br>

  Book Title: The Disclosure of Politics-Struggles Over the Semantics of Secularization<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lara María Pía<br>
  Abstract: For Lara, secularization means three things: the translation of religious semantics into politics; a transformation of religious notions into political ideas; and the reoccupation of a space left void by changing political actors that gives rise to new conceptions of political interaction. Conceptual innovation redefines politics as a horizontal relationship between governments and the governed and better enables societies (and individual political actors) to articulate meaning through action -- that is, through the emergence of new concepts. These actions, Lara proves, radically transform our understanding of politics and the role of political agents and are further enhanced by challenging the structural dependence of politics on religious phenomena.<br>

  Abstract: In previous chapters I have often referred to Reinhart Koselleck’s work, especially his method of conceptual history, which I consistently find useful with regard to questions of translation and innovation in the emergence of secularized forms of political concepts. Koselleck is also helpful for understanding the dynamic feedback between the formulation of a concept and the social reality that creates the space in which the concept is accepted and used. In this chapter I will focus on Koselleck’s largely negative assessment of the ways in which the problem of politics versus morality has been addressed in Enlightenment thought. Koselleck’s model<br>

  Book Title: Religion and the Specter of the West-Sikhism, India, Postcoloniality, and the Politics of Translation<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mandair Arvind-Pal S.<br>
  Abstract: Mandair rethinks the intersection of religion and the secular in discourses such as history of religions, postcolonial theory, and recent continental philosophy. Though seemingly unconnected, these discourses are shown to be linked to a philosophy of "generalized translation" that emerged as a key conceptual matrix in the colonial encounter between India and the West. In this riveting study, Mandair demonstrates how this philosophy of translation continues to influence the repetitions of religion and identity politics in the lives of South Asians, and the way the academy, state, and media have analyzed such phenomena.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I continue to trace the movement of cultural translation designated by the term “Sikh theology” into the humanities program of the modern Western university, specifically the discourse of the history of religions. To do this it is necessary to determine how the subject of Sikhism, or the Sikh subject, came to be determined as a distinctly “religious” subject. I argue that a certain understanding of violence, or, rather, a set of unexamined assumptions about the relationship between religion and violence, is necessary for the construction and deployment of this subject as “religious” in the modern academic study<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7560/717985">Why the Humanities Matter</a><br>
  Abstract: There’s much interest in the cultural study of Other music: from East LA Chicano rap, U.S./Mexico border Norteño-techno, to Turkish-German hip-hop. Such interest can lead to interesting musical encounters that give rise to new rhythmic expressions; it can tell us something, too, of distributional paths governed by global capitalism. However, just like the dominant trend in approaches to the study of the self, society, language, translation, and cultural phenomena thus far discussed, so here too we see an enduring presence of a philosophical idealism. Whether identified as an alternative literacy program, as a politics of resistance to global capitalism, or<br>

  TWELVE  Patrimonial Khipu in a Modern Peruvian Village: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7560/769038">Narrative Threads</a><br>
  Author(s) Salomon Frank<br>
  Abstract: This chapter concerns a central Peruvian community that owns and ceremonially uses inherited cord records in perpetuating kinship corporations directly continuous with those of Inka and perhaps pre-Inka times. We know of these corporations because the village in question, San Andrés de Tupicocha in Huarochirí Province, Peru, is self-described in the only known early-colonial source that explains an Andean religious system in an Andean language, namely, the Quechua Huarochirí Manuscript (ca. 1608; translations include Salomon and Urioste 1991 and Taylor 1987). The cord records, though not themselves of pre-Hispanic antiquity, form a material link in a chain of institutional continuity<br>

  Book Title: Paradigms for a Metaphorology-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Savage Robert<br>
  Abstract: In
         Paradigms for a Metaphorology, originally published in 1960 and here made available for the first time in English translation, Hans Blumenberg (1920-1996) approaches these questions by examining the relationship between metaphors and concepts. Blumenberg argues for the existence of "absolute metaphors" that cannot be translated back into conceptual language. These metaphors answer the supposedly naïve, theoretically unanswerable questions whose relevance lies quite simply in the fact that they cannot be brushed aside, since we do not pose them ourselves but find them already posed in the ground of our existence. They leap into a void that concepts are unable to fill.<br>

  Book Title: Cultural Capital, Language and National Identity in Imperial Spain-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): BINOTTI LUCIA<br>
  Abstract: This innovative study examines the cultural mechanisms in early modern Spain that led to the translation, imitation and selective adoption of the values embodied by the Italian Renaissance. These mechanisms served to delineate a national tradition that addressed the needs of a changing society and gave a "Spanish" physiognomy to the Italian experience, which ultimately led to the Golden Age. By examining such important texts as the sentimental fictions of Diego de San Pedro and Juan de Flores, the Spanish translation of Orlando Furioso, Don Quixote, and the Polifemo, Binotti first describes the conditions imposed on book production by both the expectations of an elite audience and the limitations of the printing market while outlining the process of the creation of an expressive poetic language and the quest for literary models. She then looks at Ambrosio de Morales' chronicles and Bernardo de Aldrete's Del Origen, showing how a cultural discourse founded on foreign scholarship paved the way for the establishment of innovative-and autochtonous-methods of historical and scientific analysis in the early seventeenth-century. LUCIA BINOTTI is an associate professor in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt1x73vt">Cultural Capital, Language and National Identity in Imperial Spain</a><br>
  Abstract: The great success of sentimental fiction during the first half of the sixteenth century indicates that, although these kinds of works may have originally been addressed to an exclusive readership pre-eminently preoccupied with the cultivation of courtly ideals and behaviors, they quickly attracted a much more heterogeneous public. This community was composed not only of noblemen intent on discovering the emblems of a longed-for world which was swiftly waning, but also of a bourgeois audience that found in these texts the elements of a behavioral code that could improve their status. From this perspective, the editorial fortune of the translations<br>

  Book Title: Modern German Thought from Kant to Habermas-An Annotated German-Language Reader<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Large Duncan<br>
  Abstract: German-language thinkers such as Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud are central to modernity. Yet their reception in the English-speaking world has largely depended on translations, a situation that has often hampered full engagement with the rhetorical and philosophical complexity of the German history of ideas. The present volume, the first of its kind, is a response to this situation. After an introduction charting the remarkable flowering of German-language thought since the eighteenth century, it offers extracts -- in the original German -- from sixteen major philosophical texts, with extensive introductions and annotations in English. All extracts are carefully chosen to introduce the individual thinkers while allowing the reader to pursue broader themes such as the fate of reason or the history of modern selfhood. The book offers students and scholars of German a complement to linguistic, historical, and literary study by giving them access to the wealth of German-language philosophy. It represents a new way into the work of a succession of thinkers who have defined modern philosophy and thus remain of crucial relevance today. The philosophers: Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Georg Lukács, Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, Jürgen Habermas. Henk de Berg is Professor of German at the University of Sheffield. Duncan Large is Professor of German at Swansea University.<br>

  Abstract: Heidegger polarizes opinion. To some, he is the most important philosopher of the twentieth century; to others, he is little more than a mystifying word-spinner. The perplexingly difficult nature of his work derives to a significant extent from his exploitation of the resources of the German language, so — even more than with most other philosophers — there is a clear advantage in reading him in the original rather than in translation. In the immediate postwar period, the vogue for Existentialism favored Jean-Paul Sartre (whose early philosophy was largely based, as Hubert L.

  Abstract: The title ‘Poetry in Motion’ suits the travel across language, culture, and time that constitutes literary translation.

In particular, how do we bring across Baroque lyric: rhymed, metered, allusive, with incisively doubled meaning or gorgeously encrusted figuration. Should highly ornate originals be simplified in translation, in order to make them understand able? The<br>

  Book Title: Arno Schmidt's 'Zettel's Traum'-An Analysis<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Langbehn Volker Max<br>
  Abstract: Arno Schmidt (1914-1979) is considered one of the most daring and influential writers of postwar Germany; the Germanist Jeremy Adler has called him a "giant of postwar German literature." Schmidt was awarded the Fontane Prize in 1964 and the Goethe Prize in 1973, and his early fiction has been translated into English to high critical acclaim, but he is not a well-known figure in the English-speaking world, where his complex work remains at the margins of critical inquiry. Volker Langbehn's book introduces Schmidt to the English-speaking audience, with primary emphasis on his most famous novel, 'Zettel's Traum'. One reviewer called the book an "elephantine monster" because of its unconventional size (folio format), length (1334 pages and over 10 million characters), and unique presentation of text in the form of notes, typewritten pages, parallel columns, and collages. The novel narrates the life of the main characters, Daniel Pagenstecher, Paul Jacobi and his wife Wilma, and their teenage daughter Franziska. In discussing the life and works of Edgar Allan Poe, the four engage in the problems connected with a translation of Poe. Langbehn's study investigates how literary language can mediate or account for the world of experiences and for concepts. Schmidt's use of unconventional presentation formats challenges us to analyze how we think about reading and writing literary texts. Instead of viewing such texts as a representation of reality, Schmidt's novel destabilizes this unquestioned mode of representation, posing a radical challenge to what contemporary literary criticism defines as literature. No comprehensive study of 'Zettel's Traum' exists in English. Volker Langbehn is associate professor of German at San Francisco State University.<br>

The center column reflects the events of the years between 1965 and 1969, the time frame in which Zettel’s Traum was actually written.

Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

By accepting uncritically the presuppositions that lie behind psychoanalytic metapsychology, Juillerat abrogates, in my view, ethnological responsibility, that is, the responsibility to measure in a receptive manner the presuppositions of ones hermeneutic against those of the culture one is studying. Though his attention to ethnographic detail leads Juillerat to refine psychoanalytic doctrine, it confirms the epistemological and hermeneutic assumptions of that doctrine (e.g., notions of the unconscious, id, ego, and superego, drives, repression, and, indeed, psychic space). Yafar myth and ritual as he presents them become allegories of that doctrineallegories, I would argue, of allegories. There would appear to be no escape, were it not for the Yafar voices that sound through Juillerats psychoanalytically predetermined presentations. (He offers us almost no contextualized verbatim texts in these essays, though he does in his monographs.) They remind us that, as LviStrauss demonstrated, myths are readily translated one into another, particularly when they are decontextualized. What is of ethnographic, indeed, psychoanalytic import is howand perhaps whytranslation is arrested and a particular myth (e.g., the Oedipal tale) becomes so authoritative that it has the power of promiscuous reduction. Though fascinated by the range of Yafar cultural expression, Juillerat fails to consider the implications of Yafars refusal to reduce their corpus of mythology and ritual to a single mytha singular ritual.<br>

Abstract: Scholars and their students interested in the field would do well to begin with these studies, despite some unevenness in period, place, and theme. Developments in the twentieth century, for example, are not well served, especially as their globalization bursts all traditional boundaries in the discipline, making a historical perspective essential to an understanding of ongoing transformations in literate life everywhere, not just in the West. Similarly, the absence of illustrations undermines the potential value of these books as introductions to the history of reading. Much of the work here depends on the material objects that readers actually had; without images of them, the reader develops less of a sense of the field. Finally, the exclusion of the essays on correspondence from the original collection is deeply regrettable; Chartier’s summary of their implications in the introduction hardly does justice to them, especially to the important study of the 1847 postal survey by Dauphin and two other colleagues. The translations are generally accurate, but the indexes are barely adequate.<br>

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau. For reading the current essay, my particular thanks to Catherine Desbarats, Eric Jabbari, James Ron, and Michael Wasser, as well as to Tim Rowse, Desley Deacon, Ann Curthoys, and John Docker for helpful suggestions. I am of course solely responsible for the content. The research for this essay was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. 1 Jean Comaroff and John L.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 437 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne political, economic, and cultural colonialism-fields the authors argue are in any case impossible to disaggregate.9 The programmatic claims that lend Of Revelation and Revolution its force also, however, cause some interesting tensions in the book. The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86. Those influenced by the Comaroffs in this respect include David Chidester, Savage Systems: Colonialism and Comparative Religion in Southern Africa (Charlottesville, Va., 1996); Leon de Kock, Civilising Barbarians: Missionary Narrative and African Textual Response in Nineteenth-Century South Africa (Johannesburg, 1996); Doug Stuart, "'Of Savages and Heroes': Discourses of Race, Nation and Gender in the Evangelical Missions to Southern Africa in the Early Nineteenth Century" (PhD dissertation, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London, 1994).

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 443 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne does not fail to capture some aspects of social and political reality. This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76. On Tswana views of the firearms frontier, see Robert Moffat to Richard Miles, Lattakoo [Kuruman], December 5, 1827, in Isaac Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman: Being the Journals and Letters of Robert and Mary Moffat, 1820-1828 (London, 1951), 274. Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another. On Cape influence, see also Johannes du Bruyn, "James Read en die Thlaping, 1816-1820," Historia 35 (1990). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman.

Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 450 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh between orthodoxy as the missionaries perceived it and African prophetic innova- tion were fluid and could be crossed in both directions, explaining the anxiety of white missionaries to bring Christianity back under control. In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 451 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne colonial worlds are apprehended and narrated?"43 I think this is a genuine point of tension for the Comaroffs, and quite rightly for many others. Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work. Taylor is of course a Christian Hegelian, whose view of the emergence of the modern self is certainly influenced by Hegelian dialectics, in however inexplicit a fashion.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L. Comaroff, "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," Public Culture 12, no. 2 (2000): 334. This issue has been reprinted as Comaroff and Comaroff, eds., Millennial Capitalism and the Culture of Neoliberalism (Durham, N.C., 2001).

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word. Elizabeth Elbourne is an associate professor in the Department of History at McGill University, where she teaches British and South African history. She is also currently a visiting fellow in the History Program of the Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University. Her publications include Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (2002), as well as various articles, most recently "Domesticity and Disposession: British Ideologies of 'Home' and the Primitive at Work in the Early Nineteenth-Century Cape," in Wendy Woodward, Patricia Hayes, and Gary Minkley, eds., Deep Histories: Gender and Colonialism in Southern Africa (2002). She earned her D.Phil. in 1992 from the University of Oxford, under the supervision of Terence Ranger. Her major fields of interest include colonialism, gender, and religion, especially the early nineteenth- century British white settler empire and southern Africa. Her current work in progress explores the creation of networks around the idea of being "aborig- inal" in the early nineteenth-century British empire, and is focusing on links between New South Wales, the Cape Colony, New Zealand, and Canadian colonies as well as on activists in Great Britain. She is also writing on liberalism and Khoekhoe citizenship at the Cape. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 459 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]]<br>

Abstract: The Captivity of Innocencesuccessfully concludes an innovative study of primeval myth in J’s Genesis. Its argument about exilic authorship serves as a springboard for a free and erudite exploration of biblical concerns with name, exile, and the paradoxes of divine-human relations. Very few biblical scholars today can compass this range of biblical, literary, and philosophical literature with such finesse. At a time when biblical studies incorporate a wider range of methods than ever, LaCocque, like Roland Barthes (whom he cites), powerfully combines traditional and more contemporary intellectual paradigms. Advanced students and scholars will find inThe Captivity of Innocencea far-reaching and engaging reading of Genesis 11 by a virtuoso of biblical studies.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: The very centrality of its questions to literary studies may be the greatest handicap for
   Translating Investments.Words That Matter, especially in its recovery of grammatical theory, had more surprises page-for-page. Here the big ideas are perforce more familiar, the innovations more incremental. The reward, however, is a fine sense of metaphor as a cultural project across an especially broad range of terrain in early modern England. Anderson insists, and teaches us to insist, on the local, historical conditions of metaphor’s torpor and vitality, how writers thought about and went about killing and quickening the trope she calls “the scaffolding of human culture” (216).<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Abstract: AbstractThis paper isolates movement as a topic for analysis in Roman imperial history. Movement is regarded under three aspects: translation (of texts, practices, ideas), migration (of officials, merchants, students, etc.), and communication (i.e. the movement of written documents). Interrelationships among the three aspects of movement are identified and discussed, as are the shared impact of translation, migration, and communication on issues of cultural and social identity and political negotiation and control. The article argues that movement changes the role of the state as well as relations between individual and states, augments the use of writing in society, transforms identities, and gives impulse to internal and external regulations. The implications of movement are understood as both pragmatic and formal, altering relations to space and time and influencing ways of organizing and thinking. The author surveys current work in the field and identifies potential areas for future research. The paper draws heavily on both literary and documentary sources and discusses material from the late republic through late antiquity, paying particular attention to continuities and discontinuities between early and later periods of the Roman empire.<br>

Author(s): Somers Margaret R.<br>
Abstract: The English translation of Habermas's The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere converges with the revival of the "political culture concept" in the social sciences. Surprisingly, Habermas's account of the Western bourgeois public sphere has much in common with the original political culture concept associated with Parsonian modernization theory in the 1950s and 1960s. In both cases, the concept of political culture is used in a way that is neither political nor cultural. Explaining this peculiarity is the central problem addressed in this article and its companion piece, which appeared in Sociological Theory, volume 3, number 2 (1995). I hypothesize that this is the case because the concept itself is embedded in an historically constituted political culture (here called a conceptual network)-a structured web of conceptual relationships that combine into Anglo-American citizenship theory. The method of an historical sociology of concept formation is used to analyze historically and empirically the internal constraints and dynamics of this conceptual network. The method draws from new work in cultural history and sociology, social studies, and network, narrative, and institutional analysis. This research yields three empirical findings: this conceptual network has a narrative structure, here called the Anglo-American citizenship story; this narrative is grafted onto an epistemology of social naturalism; and these elements combine in a metanarrative that continues to constrain empirical research in political sociology.<br>

Abstract: מסה זו עוסקת בסוציולוגיה של התרגום בתנאים של יחסי כוח תיאולוגיים וקולוניאליים בין שפות. בעקבות ולטר בנימין, פול ריקר, ז'אק דרידה והספרות הפוסט-קולוניאלית, אדגים כיצד תחומים בלתי ניתנים לתרגום הופכים את התרגום לאשליה משיחית. דרך דוגמאות מתוך ספרות הנכבה שנכתבה בערבית אני מבקש להראות כיצד התחומים הבלתי ניתנים לתרגום מוצפים במסמנים לא יציבים ובמצבים אפורתיים של מבוי סתום. למשל, השימוש במילה נכבה אינו עקבי אלא תלוי בהקשר של זמן הכתיבה וזמן התרגום. בערבית אפשר למצוא לבד מנכבה גם את המושגים כארת'ה, הזימה, נכסה ומאסאה. בעברית אפשר למצוא שימוש באסון, בתבוסה, בטרגדיה או בנכבה. גם המסמנים ההיסטוריוגרפיים ומסמני הזמן והמרחב בספרות הנכבה אינם יציבים אלא משתנים תמידית. תובנות אלה מציעות אסטרטגיות תרגום שמתבססות על הטיות זמן מתאימות (למשל זמן הווה מתמשך במקום זמן עבר), על היעזרות בהערות חיצוניות לטקסט ועל שערוב מסוים של העברית. What is translation under asymmetrical conditions of power? How do colonial and theological practices shape the relationships between languages? Drawing on Walter Benjamin, Paul Ricoeur, Jacque Derrida, and postcolonial literature in general, I show how untranslatable texts stemming from such asymmetry result in insurmountable gaps which render the messianic "perfect translation" impossible. Using examples from literature on the Palestinian Naqba, I examine how untranslatable texts (from Arabic to Hebrew) are inflated with unstable signifiers, which themselves are contingent on the time/space aspect of the translation. Using these examples, I demonstrate the extent to which translation from Arabic to Hebrew necessitates peculiar political and aesthetic strategies which are sensitive to colonial and theological conditions.<br>

Abstract: The story of the Fall inscribes the myth of a fallen language as the absolute other of the original sacred. Hence the dualistic scheme between a fallen materiality and a metaphysical God. This article explores how the death of this God is not merely a secular turn, but the opening of a different, anti-theological, or fallen religiosity that allows us to trace the sacred in unexpected places—also within fallen language. Translation and literature will be explored as instances where language performs its own fallenness— its materiality, arbitrariness and difference—and thereby releases a sacred expression. The essay considers 17th-century theologian Martin de Barcos' letters regarding translation, Derrida's essay 'Des Tours de Babel' and notions of literariness based on Blanchot and Mallarmé.<br>

Author(s): Scott-Baumann Alison<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Author(s): Wodak Ruth<br>
Abstract: This article discusses different theoretical and methodological approaches in the humanities and social sciences which strive to analyse and understand, interpret and explain texts and discourses in systematic, qualitative ways. After reviewing some of the salient theories in the social sciences (such as objective hermeneutics and critical hermeneutics), I argue that critical discourse studies require a 'trichotomy' consisting of explanation, interpretation and critique. Other approaches such as Ricoeur's 'hermeneutic arc' seem to neglect important structural and material dimensions of context as well as critical self-reflection. Moreover, I argue that much intuitive and non-transparent speculation in Hermeneutics might be transcended if more historical, cultural, linguistic and philological knowledges would be systematically and explicitly integrated into the analysis of text and discourse, in a retroductable manner. The latter possibility is illustrated by applying an interdisciplinary framework to some brief examples (e.g. intercultural and historical translation studies; the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse studies).<br>

Abstract: The nine responses to my focus article 'Re-constructing Babel: Discourse analysis, hermeneutics and the Interpretive Arc' are cross-disciplinary, as is the article itself. They come from discourse studies (Van Dijk, Billig, Wodak), cognitive science (Tepe, Yeari and Van den Broek, Van Dijk), Old Testament studies (Billig), hermeneutics (Pellauer, Scott-Baumann), history (Gardner) and literature (Pratt). I identify and address five main issues which I see these responses raising for discourse interpretation: the role of author intent and the original sociocultural context in interpretation; principles of translation, particularly in relation to the Babel story; issues of certainty and subjectivism in interpretation, again including the Babel story; the role and limitations of cognitive approaches, and the potential of images like 'unfolding the matter of the text' to be realized in teaching hands-on discourse work; and finally a call to new listening in the encounter with hermeneutics, as a route to freshening the field I like to call Discourse Interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Ernst Troeltsch distinguished between naive, apologetic and evolutionistic absoluteness.
From the original spontaneity of 'naive absoluteness' and its artificial (partly super-
naturalistic, partly rationalistic) defence as 'apologetic absoluteness' (in the Middle Ages and
in the Enlightenment, respectively) there came forth in Hegel the idea of 'evolutionistic
absoluteness' — an ingenious but untenable attempt to reconcile the solid apologetic
conception of absoluteness of that day with the dynamics of history by presenting it as the
outcome and terminus of historical progression. See Troeltsch, Die Absolutheit des Christen-
tums, 87ff. Cf. J. Klapwijk, Tussen historisme en relativisme, 222-29. At present the belief in
progress and thus also the mix of it with the idea of absoluteness is no longer a subject of
discussion.<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

worldview. Whether or not we realize it, we all have certain presuppositions and biases that
affect the way we view all of life and reality. A worldview is like a set of lenses which taint our
vision or alter the way we perceive the world around us.' (http://christianworldview.net/,

Abstract: By inquiring into the translatability of Judaism and philosophy, we reawaken an ancient problem that asks after philosophy’s relation with religion:
         What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?Translation is a rejuvenated means of wrestling with this irksome question, which seeks to understand how multiple approaches to meaning and being can exist concurrently or whether any interaction forfeits multiplicity for the primacy of one form over all others. The specific issue that linguistic versions of the problem address is whether or not the languages that Judaism and philosophy speak are separate and distinct and if those distinctions are established on deeper, non-linguistic ground. For this reason, translation not only raises the problem of articulacy and context in interlingual translations, it also alludes to an ontological or metaphysical separation that speaks of different, non-shared worlds. Whether or not a translation theory addresses, repairs or upholds the opposition between religion and philosophy is in question, and translation becomes a vehicle for discussing what Jerusalem has to offer Athens and what Athens has for Jerusalem. In this essay, I examine the translation problem as an attempt to repair or re-gloss the relation between Judaism and philosophy by way of Michael Fagenblat’s recovery of Emmanuel Levinas’ thought in his work,A Covenant of Creatures: Levinas’s Philosophy of Judaism(2010).<br>

Abstract: The paper explores the meaning of conversion for African Christians in South Africa by looking at some of the indigenous terms that have populated the Christian vocabulary. The paper focuses on terms like
         ukuguquka, ukukholwa, ibandla, ikholwa, igqobhoka, inkonzo,andinkolo. These terms are found among people who speak Nguni languages. It shows how they were used in pre-Christian context and traces their evolution in Christian contexts. Research conducted in the Reformed Presbyterian Church, St John’s Apostolic Faith Mission, and Methodist Churches in Cape Town between 1997 and 2001 has indicated that conversion was not a simple religious process but involved diverse political, economic and social aspects. Conversion involved a transformation of an African Christian identity from the margins to the centre. It also involved extensive negotiation of what it means to be Christian through the translation of Christian content into an African idiom. The paper goes through various terms and how their original meanings were discarded for new ones.<br>

Abstract: It has become commonplace to describe Machado de Assis's characters and narrators as deeper than those of his contemporaries, and his novels as representations more creatively ambiguous than most literary depictions of nineteenth-century Brazil. In this essay I argue that throughout his novels psychological depth is a function of moral imagination; and a troubled moral imagination is a necessary condition for the literary representation of the modern self. Machado's protagonists are able to fashion the public presentation of their selves by imagining alternatives to their origins, desires, and social predicaments. They have in their pasts a burden they need to overcome, and while doing so they find themselves in conditions of freedom and harm. Evil then arises as a consequence of moral dynamism, in so far as it becomes a project for undoing the other. The genesis of a radical conception of free will and evil in Machado's narratives goes back to his translation of Victor Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea (1866). His concern with a more meticulous characterization of inwardness deepens between Iaiá Garcia (1878) and Dom Casmurro (1899), when adopting the structure of a confessional narrative he arrives at a balance between disguised motives (malice), double chronology (nostalgia), and human life as an unfolding, reversible, and self-aware process (metamorphosis). To frame Machado's strategy for depicting moral change, I take from Augustine's Confessions the suggestion that retrospection is the only way of restoring the identity of someone whose self is marked by his or her sense of dissimilarity with the past. Finally, from Kant and Paul Ricoeur I draw the elements for a further consideration of evil as an invitation to think differently about seeing, judging, and narrating human life.<br>

Abstract: Edward Jerningham's "Impenitence" (1800)—a translation of Bossuet's "Sermon du mauvais riche" (1662)—is remarkably dissimilar to its French original. This article investigates the rhetorical reasons behind this discrepancy. These reasons concern the problems of promoting a French model of eloquence in a fiercely anti-French climate and—even more problematic—promoting a text whose main theme is a denunciation of the rich in a period of extreme counter-revolutionary fervor. Jerningham's text shows that in facing potentially resistant readers, the strategies of a translator are those of a rhetor.<br>

ignorant délibérément toutes les pages que j'ai consacrées
à l'explicitation de ma problématique - peut présenter
mes recherches empiriques sur l'histoire du droit d'asile
comme une critique «idéologique» de la «démocratie»,
inspirée par la philosophie de Foucault (péché capital
pour les tenants du libéralisme); voir Ph. Raynaud,
«Heurs et malheurs du citoyen», Le Débat, 75,
mai-août 1993, pp. 124-125. Pour une discussion

Abstract: This paper offers a study of fray Luis de León's Spanish translation of the
         Song of songsas well as of hisComentarioon the same text. It aims to shed light on the mystic-erotic paradigm, which underlies this work, as this paradigm is conceived in both the Judeo-Christian and the Greco-Roman traditions. In addition, attention is paid to questions concerning the interpretation and reception of the biblical text, as outlined in the hermeneutic work of Paul Ricoeur.<br>

Abstract: Maurice Leenhardt's ethnographic work in New Caledonia spanned nearly half a century, from 1902-1948. The first part of this field research is described and analysed, as background to his later anthropological writings. Leenhardt's specific position as a missionary-ethnographer is discussed, its advantages and disadvantages weighed. A liberal missionary perspective is found, in this case, to be conducive to a portrayal of cultural process. Leenhardt's translation methodology and his relations with key informants are detailed. Transcription, the means by which ethnographic texts are constituted by more than a single subject, is speculatively extended to ethnographic practice generally. Field research may be seen as a collective, reciprocal endeavour through which textualised translations are made. This viewpoint calls into question common notions of description, interpretation and authorship in the writing of ethnography.<br>

Abstract: Of the many surviving Romanesque cartularies, very few are illuminated. After reviewing general considerations of the oral, textual, and visual elements at play in these works, this paper then focuses on the Vierzon Cartulary, particularly on the processes of its charters' transcription to codex. Specifically, this paper argues the performative role of the scribe and illuminator, who, by their transformation of the mise-en-page, appropriation of papal notarial authority, and translation of sealing practice, participated in a new diplomatic ceremony of conveyance. This paper advances a reconsideration of text-image relations to account for ritual performance, both actual and symbolic.<br>

Abstract: Recent work on conventional metaphor together with reinterpretations of classic studies of "soul substance" and mana are examined to assess the dangers of overinterpretation--the attribution of nonexistent theologies and metaphysics--by ethnographers. In our project of cultural translation, are we prone to attribute deeper salience to other peoples' way of talk than they in fact imply?<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we use concepts from actor-network theory (ANT) to interpret the sequence of events that led to business process change (BPC) failure at a telecommunications company in the United States. Through our intensive examination of the BPC initiative, we find that a number of issues suggested by ANT, such as errors in problematization, parallel translation, betrayal, and irreversible inscription of interests, contributed significantly to the failure. We provide nine abstraction statements capturing the essence of our findings in a concrete form. The larger implication of our study is that, for sociotechnical phenomena such as BPC with significant political components, an ANT-informed understanding can enable practitioners to better anticipate and cope with emergent complexities.<br>

Journal Title: Cultural Anthropology<br>
Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i383702<br>
Date: 2 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): ZizekAbstract: Arguing that without a differentiated and relational notion of the cultural, the social sciences would he crippled, reducing social action to notions of pure instrumentality, in this article, I trace the growth of cultural analysis from the beginnings of modern anthropology to the present as a layered set of experimental systems whose differential lenses create epistemic objects with increasing precision and differential focus and resolution. Arguing that culture is not a variable-culture is relational, it is elsewhere or in passage, it is where meaning is woven and renewed, often through gaps and silences, and forces beyond the conscious control of individuals, and yet the space where individual and institutional social responsibility and ethical struggle take place-I name culture as a set of central anthropological forms of knowledge grounding human beings' self-understandings. The challenge of cultural analysis is to develop translation and mediation tools for helping make visible the differences of interests, access, power, needs, desires, and philosophical perspective. In particular, as we begin to face new kinds of ethical dilemmas stemming from developments in biotechnologies, expansive information and image databases, and ecological interactions, we are challenged to develop differentiated cultural analyses that can help articulate new social institutions for an evolving civil society.<br>

Abstract: This article argues for a definition of translation as a form of writing under constraint. Quite straightforwardly, the translator must write the original text again in a language other than the one in which it was originally composed. Both inhibiting and enabling, that restriction is also translation's resource, ensuring its distinctiveness as a writing practice and providing the key to its unique transformative possibilities. Like lipogrammatical writing, translation is inaugurated by its constraint. The article explores the affinity between translation and the lipogram with reference to Georges Perec's La Disparition, where the prohibition of the letter e initiates a peculiarly inventive kind of writing. Peculiarly inventive, because the effects generated by writing without a given letter of the alphabet, or by writing a given text again in another, altogether different, language, are essentially unprogrammable: we do not know what is going to happen.<br>

Abstract: Serge Lifar built his career during the 1930s, a decade crucial to understanding his 'années noires'-or 'black years', as the French historian Henry Rousso called the period of the German occupation of Paris (1940—1944). Lifar's powerful and respected position at the Paris Opéra, the social connections he had built and maintained and the psychological impact of exile: all these elements help clarify Lifar's accommodating attitude towards the German occupants of his adopted city. During the 1930s Lifar came to be accepted in French intellectual society as the 'heir' of Serge Diaghilev. Through his publications he made a powerful contribution to the process by which Diaghilev's Ballets Russes assumed its paramount position in the development of modern ballet, a process set in motion by the impresario himself. Lifar played this role chiefly in France. In the English-speaking world, where relatively few of his books appeared in translation, other writers served to canonise the Diaghilev endeavour, albeit for somewhat different ends. A list of Lifar's publications in Russian and other languages (French above all) displays the growing influence of his actions and authority, the power of his connections (inherited primarily from Diaghilev), and his relentless will to overcome the problems of emigration as he secured not only success as a dancer and choreograph but also a public reputation as an intellectual. The recent discovery of new evidence has led to the identification of the respected Pushkin authority Modeste Hofmann as the writer whose unacknowledged work enabled Lifar to establish himself as an historian. This evidence, provided by Hofmann's grandsons André and Vladimir Hofmann, raises serious questions about the authority of Lifar's books. An interplay of subjective relationships is woven into the texture of these narratives in which survival and ambition, a paternal attitude and filial respect, exist in constant tension. Neither the making of these books nor the myth of Russian dance which they espouse can be understood without placing their authors in the milieu they shared in Paris as Russian émigrés.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur Nabila<br>
Abstract: The "Myth of Creation" in its East African formulation is the central chapter in a book entitled, The Sacred Meadows, by an Egyptian anthropologist who did his field work in the early seventies among the Lamu community in Kenya on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The translator, in her own introduction to the translation, presents the outline of the book and provides the geographical and cultural context of the community in question. The author, in this translated chapter, sets out by exposing his theoretical position which combines both Structuralism and Functionalism. Insights from Claude Lévi-Strauss and Bronislaw Malinowski as well as those of Paul Ricoeur and Victor Turner join to develop the author's notion of myth and its symbolic mode. Then the text of the myth, in its Lamuan formulation, is narrated, followed by a close reading and analysis of its binary oppositions, mediating terms, and the underlying existential contradiction at its crux. Angels, jinn, light, fire, earth, wind, water, Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Satan, serpent, etc. are the agents of this sacred narrative and cosmic drama. The textual unfolding of the myth is followed by an analysis, which makes use of the structural method and explores the semantic connotations of Swahili words and idioms to explain the logic of the symbolic exchange and the rigor of thought. The themes of unity and multiplicity and their different combinations are delineated in this analysis and the repetitions and their relation to transcendence are explained.<br>

Abstract: For both Levinas and Derrida, the practice of philosophy, understood as commentary by the former and deconstruction by the latter, was founded on borrowing terms from other languages and finding their equivalents in French. This argument is developed through a discussion of two texts, Levinas's early Talmudic reading, “The Temptation of Temptation,” and Derrida's deconstruction of
         The Merchant of Venicein “What Is a ‘Relevant’ Translation?” This essay shows how translated terms are interwoven into these texts. It also shows that translation is essential to Levinas's and Derrida's creative conceptualization, and to the performativity of their philosophies, meaning that Levinas and Derrida open their language to other languages in order to create concepts. It finally argues that in both Derrida and Levinas the question of the limits of translation, namely, of the moment in which translation becomes conversion, is left open.<br>

Abstract: This article examines Jean Hatzfeld's
         Machete Season: The Killers in Rwanda Speak, a collection of testimonials by perpetrators of the genocide in Rwanda. While surveying popular representations of killers in Rwanda, circulating theories about the 1994 genocide and the veracity of these killers' accounts, this article also investigates the production, edition, and translation of these killers' interviews. In particular, it focuses on Jean Hatzfeld's role as editor of these killers' testimonies and Innocent Rwililiza's position as translatorinterviewer. Contextualizing elements missing from these interviews——namely, concepts from Rwandan language, history, and culture, as well as broader psychosocial dimensions both pre- and post-genocide——this article problematizes Hatzfeld's depiction of these ““ordinary killers.””<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: The world is a large and various place. Those wishing to chart new planetary cartographies are finding many languages to study beyond the French–German–English triad that long dominated Western comparative studies, and they are developing new methods appropriate to the expanded scope of our field. The tough linguistic and political analyses that Emily Apter rightly wishes comparatists to pursue will best be carried forward by widening our cultural and linguistic horizons, and by employing the full variety of critical and theoretical approaches that can be included in our cartographic toolboxes today.<br>

Abstract: The point here is that whoever I am in terms of my personal identity and my capacity or incapacity to identify myself through sortal terms as a being in the world with others, I will have no doubt who is in pain or who will have the pain. Here, again, is a sense of “I” in which I can be aware of myself and refer to myself without it being necessary to employ any nonindexical or third-personal referents.<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: Liudmila Ulitskaia’s 2006 novel, Daniel’ Shtain, pervodchik (Daniel Stein, Translator), explores the experience of the Russian-speaking diaspora in the aftermath of World War II through a focus on Jewish immigrants in Israel who convert to Christianity. The novel’s treatment of the divisive topic of Jewish to Christian conversion is enabled by the author’s reliance on the theoretical and allegorical values of translation. Evoking advancements in twentieth-century translation studies through its broad treatment of translation and critique of the investment in the notion of fidelity to the original, be it language or identity, the novel advocates for the acceptance of the transformations and the resulting hybridity of the Jewish diasporic self. Daniel Stein, Translator specifically highlights the influence of the Soviet nationalities policies and the Nazi occupation of eastern Europe on the identity metamorphoses of Soviet Jews. By promoting the legitimacy of the expressions of Jewish identity by immigrants from the USSR through her novel, Ulitskaia proposes an expanded and anti-essentialist view of Jewish identity that would include individuals traditionally viewed as apostates.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo se inicia refletindo sobre as várias maneiras que Gilberto Freyre usou o conceito-chave de mestiçagem e os campos culturais diferentes aos quais ele estendeu o seu uso — arquitetura, culinária, esporte, literatura, urbanismo, sociologia e até mesmo sexo. Chamando a atenção para os conceitos ou metáforas alternativas que se encontram na obra de Freyre — interpenetração, mistura, hibridismo, etc. — o artigo se volta para a discussão de uma metáfora que Freyre não usou, apesar de ter se tornado usual desde sua época: tradução cultural. Após uma breve história da idéia de tradução cultural, que inclui uma discussão de suas vantagens e desvantagens, o artigo termina com um estudo de caso de tradução tanto metafórica como cultural do conceito ocidental de liberdade para o Japão após a restauração imperial de 1868.<br>
