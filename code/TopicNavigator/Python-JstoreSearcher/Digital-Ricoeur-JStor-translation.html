  Abstract: Among the great American ethnomusicologists, David P. McAllester has had an eminent sense of the possibilities of an actual poetics emerging from the verbal materials with which he has dealt. His principal area of ethnographic concern has been Navajo, and he has worked with Navajo music and poetry (and their complex interworkings) for close to thirty-five years. The present essay was originally published alongside Jerome Rothenbergʹs experimental translations of the Navajo horse-songs (see above, pp. 381, 387), for which McAllester served as transmitter and adviser. Though their strategies for translation diverge significantly, McAllesterʹs view, circa 1966, of the spirit of<br>

  Abstract: What I have described as transpacific displacement is a historical process of dislocation and relocation of cultural meanings via ethnography, translation, and intertextual travel. Interestingly, this complicated cross-over, of which Imagism’s appropriation and reinvention of “Chinese” poetics constitute an important part, now seems to have taken an unexpected turn: readers of contemporary Chinese poetry have been told that the work in front of them is influenced, inspired by Imagism. As the story goes, Chinese poets, such as Bei Dao and Gu Cheng, living in the poetic wasteland of the Cultural Revolution, turned to Western literature for inspiration. The books circulated<br>

  Abstract: In the first half of the nineteenth century, philological readings of the Scriptures and new approaches in geology – set down, most importantly, in Charles Lyell’s
                  Principles of Geology(1830-1833) – uncovered the various strata of the Book of Books and the Book of Nature, respectively. The result of applying the historical-critical method to the Scriptures was precisely the discovery of its historicity: as philologists and – mainly Protestant – theologians such as Friedrich Schleiermacher and David Friedrich Strauss – whoseThe Life of Jesus, Critically Examined(1835-1836) was disseminated in Britain in George Eliot’s influential translation (1849) – could<br>

  Book Title: The Mission of Demythologizing-Rudolf Bultmann's Dialectical Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Congdon David W.<br>
  Abstract: Since 1941, Rudolf Bultmann’s program of demythologizing has been the subject of constant debate, widely held to indicate Bultmann’s departure from the dialectical theology he once shared with Karl Barth. In the 1950s, Barth referred to their relationship as that of a whale and an elephant: incapable of meaningful communication. This study proposes a contrary reading of demythologizing as the hermeneutical fulfillment of dialectical theology on the basis of a reinterpretation of Barth’s theological project. As such, the volume argues that dialectical theology is fundamentally governed by a missionary logic. Bultmann’s hermeneutical theology extends this dialectical, missionary theology into the field of interpretation. Contrary to many critics, the message of God’s saving work in Christ, and not modern science, funds Bultmann’s hermeneutical program. Like Barth’s own revolution, Bultmann’s program addresses a false relation between gospel and culture. Negatively, demythologizing is a program of deconstantinizing, opposing the objectifying conflation of kerygma and culture that he calls “myth.” Positively, demythologizing is a form of intercultural hermeneutics, composed of preunderstanding and self-understanding. Demythologizing is therefore a missionary hermeneutic of intercultural translation.<br>

  Book Title: To Make the Hands Impure: Art, Ethical Adventure, the Difficult and the Holy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): NEWTON ADAM ZACHARY<br>
  Abstract: How can cradling, handling, or rubbing a text be said, ethically, to have made something happen? What, as readers or interpreters, may come off in our hands in as we maculate or mark the books we read? For Adam Zachary Newton, reading is anembodied practice wherein "ethics" becomes a matter of tact in the doubled sense of touch and regard. With the image of the book lying in the hands of its readers as insistent refrain, To Make the Hands Impure cuts a provocative cross-disciplinary swath through classical Jewish texts, modern Jewish philosophy, film and performance, literature, translation, and the material text. Newton explores the ethics of reading through a range of texts, from the Talmud and Midrash to Conrad's Nostromo and Pascal's Le Memorial, from works by Henry Darger and Martin Scorsese to the National September 11 Memorial and a synagogue in Havana, Cuba. In separate chapters, he conducts masterly treatments of Emmanuel Levinas, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Stanley Cavell by emphasizing their performances as readers a trebled orientation to Talmud, novel, and theater/film. To Make the Hands Impure stages the encounter of literary experience and scriptural traditions he difficult and the holy through an ambitious, singular, and innovative approach marked in equal measure by erudition and imaginative daring.<br>

  Abstract: Hospitality is a multi-faceted concept that has been received by, and worked into, various academic realms and disciplines, such as philosophy, politics, anthropology, aesthetics, ethics, and translation studies. The essays collected in this volume, by a wide range of international contributors, examine how, in the wake of the work of Levinas and the late Derrida, this concept has entered into and transformed the thinking of these disciplines.<br>

  Book Title: Regard for the Other: Autothanatography in Rousseau, De Quincey, Baudelaire, and Wilde-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt E. S.<br>
  Abstract: Although much has been written on autobiography, the same cannot be said of autothanatography, the writing of one's death. This study starts from the deconstructive premise that autobiography is aporetic, not or not only a matter of a subject strategizing with language to produce an exemplary identity but a matter also of its responding to an exorbitant call to write its death. The I-dominated representations of particular others and of the privileged other to whom a work is addressed, must therefore be set against an alterity plaguing the I from within or shadowing it from without. This alterity makes itself known in writing as the potential of the text to carry messages that remain secret to the confessing subject. Anticipation of the potential for the confessional text to say what Augustine calls the secret I do not know,the secret of death, engages the autothanatographical subject in a dynamic, inventive, and open-ended process of identification. The subject presented in these texts is not one that has already evolved an interior life that it seeks to reveal to others, but one that speaks to us as still in process. Through its exorbitant response, it gives intimations of an interiority and an ethical existence to come. Baudelaire emerges as a central figure for this understanding of autobiography as autothanatography through his critique of the narcissism of a certain Rousseau, his translation of De Quincey's confessions, with their vertiginously ungrounded subject-in-construction, his artistic practice of self-conscious, thorough-going doubleness, and his service to Wilde as model for an aporetic secrecy. The author discusses the interruption of narrative that must be central to the writing of one's death and addresses the I's dealings with the aporias of such structuring principles as secrecy, Levinasian hospitality, or interiorization as translation. The book makes a strong intervention in the debate over one of the most-read genres of our time.<br>

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, eac~<br>

  Abstract: If we interpret deconstruction as a form of translation as transference, we have moved into the territory of psychoanalysis. Indeed, if poetic majesty acts to unseat sovereign majesty through the cut that carries with it rebirth, as in the story of Little Red Riding Hood, then psychoanalysis may be the discourse best equipped for articulating the dynamics of this wound that is also a source of life. In other words, psychoanalysis may provide the tools with which to analyze the thorny relationship between violence and life, particularly through the concepts of death drive and sublimation.

  Abstract: Eberhard Jüngel’s masterpiece,

  Book Title: The Mutual Cultivation of Self and Things-A Contemporary Chinese Philosophy of the Meaning of Being<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Chad Austin<br>
  Abstract: Yang Guorong is one of the most prominent Chinese philosophers working today and is best known for using the full range of Chinese philosophical resources in connection with the thought of Kant, Hegel, Marx, and Heidegger. In The Mutual Cultivation of Self and Things, Yang grapples with the philosophical problem of how the complexly interwoven nature of things and being relates to human nature, values, affairs, and facts, and ultimately creates a world of meaning. Yang outlines how humans might live more fully integrated lives on philosophical, religious, cultural, aesthetic, and material planes. This first English translation introduces current, influential work from China to readers worldwide.<br>

  Book Title: Grand Hotel Abyss-Desire, Recognition and the Restoration of the Subject<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Safatle Vladimir<br>
  Abstract: Long-expected translation of the Portuguese academic bestseller Grande Hotel Abismo. In the last two decades recognition - arguably one of the most central notions of the dialectical tradition since Hegel - has once again become a crucial philosophical theme. Nevertheless, the new theories of recognition fail to provide room for reflection on transformation processes in politics and morality. This book aims to recover the disruptive nature of the dialectical tradition by means of a severe critique of the dominance of an anthropology of the individual identity in contemporary theories of recognition. This critique implies a thorough rethinking of basic concepts such as desire, negativity, will and drive, with Hegel, Lacan and Adorno being our main guides. The Marxist philosopher György Lukács said that the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer, Adorno, etc.) left us with nothing but negativity towards the state of the world. Their work failed to open up a concrete possibility of practical engagement in this world. All too eager to describe the impasses of reason, the Frankfurt philosphers remained trapped in a metaphorical Grand Hotel Abyss (Grand Hotel Abgrund). It was as living and being guardian of lettered civilization in a beautiful and melancholy grand hotel, of which the balconies face a gaping abyss. But perhaps in this way Lukács gave – and no doubt without realizing it himself – a perfect definition of contemporary philosophy, namely to confront chaos, to peer into what appears to a certain rationality as an abyss and to feel good about it. Touching Hegelian dialectics, critical theory and psychoanalysis, Grand Hotel Abyss gives a new meaning to the notion of negativity as the first essential step for rethinking political and moral engagement.<br>

Accordingly the term is most commonly employed as ‘disbelief in, or denial of, the existence of God’. However, this definition is not as straightforward as it appears. In the first place, and most obviously, what is being disbelieved in or denied will change according to the various definitions of God being employed.

  Book Title: Translating the English Bible-From Relevance to Deconstruction<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Goodwin Philip W.<br>
  Abstract: In his detailed and thought-provoking work, Philip Goodwin conducts a thorough analysis of the challenges facing the Biblical translator, with particular focus on the problematic dominance of the King James Version of the Bible in our imaginations – a dominance which has had a deleterious effect upon the accuracy and originality of the translator's work. Goodwin considers the first two chapters of the Lukan narratives in depth, comparing and contrasting a breadth of widely disparate translations and drawing on a rich body of Biblical scholarship to support his thesis. A wide-ranging discussion of other linguistic issues is also conducted, touching on such vital matters as incorporating the contextual implications of the original text, and the attempt to challenge the reader's pre-existing encyclopaedic knowledge. Goodwin evolves a fresh and comprehensive answer to the difficulties of the translator's task, and concludes by providing his own original and charming translation of the first two chapters of Luke's Gospel. 'Translating the English Bible' provides a fascinating insight into the processes of translation and will interest anyone seeking accuracy and fidelity to the Scriptural message. It will also enlighten readers seeking a challenging translation of Luke that casts off the shackles of the 'Holy Marriage' tradition of Biblical translation.<br>

  Book Title: Theology in Language, Rhetoric, and Beyond-Essays in Old and New Testament<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Lundbom Jack R.<br>
  Abstract: Theology in Language, Rhetoric, and Beyond' places before a broad audience of students and general readers theological essays on both the Old and New Testaments. Theology is seen to derive from a number of sources: the biblical language, biblical rhetoric and composition, academic disciplines other than philosophy, and above all a careful exegesis of the biblical text. The essay on Psalm 23 makes use of anthropology and human-development theory; the essay on Deuteronomy incorporates Wisdom themes; the essay called "Jeremiah and the Created Order" looks at ideas not only about God and creation but also about the seldom-considered idea of God and a return to chaos; and the essay on the "Confessions of Jeremiah" examines, not the words that this extraordinary prophet was given by God to preach, but what he himself felt and experienced in the office to which he was called. One essay on "Biblical and theological themes" includes a translation into the African language of Lingala, which weaves together the story of early Christianity with the more recent founding of churches in Africa and Asia. Jack R. Lundbom argues eloquently through these essays that theology is rooted in biblical words, in themselves, in rhetoric and their different contexts.<br>

To be sure, as Jameson (1984) acknowledges in his preface to the English translation of the latter text, the specifically architectural use of the adjective is distinct, indeed narrower, in referring mostly (and often indeterminately) to a cluster or trend of building designs that sought release from the rigid sleekness of normative architectural<br>

  Abstract: This edited volume offers new perspectives from leading scholars on the important work of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (1539-1616), one of the first Latin American writers to present an intellectual analysis of pre-Columbian history and culture and the ensuing colonial period. To the contributors, Inca Garcilaso's
      Royal Commentaries of the Incaspresented an early counter-hegemonic discourse and a reframing of the history of native non-alphabetic cultures that undermined the colonial rhetoric of his time and the geopolitical divisions it purported. Through his research in both Andean and Renaissance archives, Inca Garcilaso sought to connect these divergent cultures into one world.This collection offers five classical studies ofRoyal Commentariespreviously unavailable in English, along with seven new essays that cover topics including Andean memory, historiography, translation, philosophy, trauma, and ethnic identity. This cross-disciplinary volume will be of interest to students and scholars of Latin American history, culture, comparative literature, subaltern studies, and works in translation.<br>

  Author(s) Dallmayr Fred<br>
  Abstract: Anthropologists have become increasingly involved as participants on development teams, but their great potential to promote sustainable development is hindered by vestiges of one of cultural anthropology’s founding myths. It is the notion of cultures construed as self-contained symbol systems, conceptually opaque to all but true insiders, with an implied notion of correct translation, which makes it an ‘all or nothing’ matter. This notion is also linked to long-standing concerns in the field with moral relativism, value neutrality and colonialism. As a result, within the community of anthropologists working in development, two somewhat opposed positions have arisen: one holds that<br>

We have seen his political amphibiousness as well as his displacement and dislocation of foundational attachments to place. We have also seen that he is keen to use the aesthetic as a tool<br>

  Book Title: The Translator’s Doubts-Vladimir Nabokov and the Ambiguity of Translation<br>
  Publisher: Academic Studies Press<br>
  Author(s): TRUBIKHINA JULIA<br>
  Abstract: Using Vladimir Nabokov as its “case study," this volume approaches translation as a crucial avenue into literary history and theory, philosophy and interpretation. It attempts to bring together issues in translation and the shift in Nabokov studies from its earlier emphasis on the “metaliterary" to the more recent “metaphysical" approach. Addressing specific texts (both literary and cinematic), the book investigates Nabokov’s deeply ambivalent relationship to translation as a hermeneutic oscillation on his part between the relative stability of meaning, which expresses itself philosophically as a faith in the beyond, and deep metaphysical uncertainty. While Nabokov’s practice of translation changed profoundly over the course of his career, his adherence to the Romantic notion of a “true" but ultimately elusive metaphysical language remained paradoxically constant.<br>

These issues include his origin—his own “secret stem,” leading back to Russian Romanticism—as well as translation as a vehicle for expressing Nabokov’s own strongly held ideas about art. While Nabokov’s practice of translation undergoes significant changes in the course of his career, his adherence to the idea of some “true,” “metaphysical” language—ever elusive and ever present—remains surprisingly constant.<br>

  Abstract: A few commentators have noted in passing the similarity between Xunzi’s apparent teaching that “human nature is evil” and Augustine’s notions of original sin. H. H. Dubs inaugurated this line of thought in a 1956 article, in which he argued tendentiously that “like Augustine, [Xunzi] saw that the only safe foundation for authoritarianism is the belief that human nature is fundamentally evil, for then man cannot trust his own reasoning.”¹ More recently A. C. Graham and P. J. Ivanhoe have both rejected this judgment of similarity to Augustine and have argued that a more accurate translation of Xunzi’s slogan

  Abstract: A recurrent issue in the study of public discourse is whether a public sphere might be so constituted as to be both free and liberatory: free in the sense that it would be perfectly inclusive; liberatory in that it would enable participants to identify and critique coercion in institutions. Jürgen Habermas’s lifelong project might best be understood as an attempt to define the characteristics of a sphere with both such qualities, as well as to argue the feasibility of attaining it. The recent translation of Habermas’s early book,

  Book Title: Faces of History-Historical Inquiry from Herodotus to Herder<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLEY DONALD R.<br>
  Abstract: In this book, one of the world's leading intellectual historians offers a critical survey of Western historical thought and writing from the pre-classical era to the late eighteenth century. Donald R. Kelley focuses on persistent themes and methodology, including questions of myth, national origins, chronology, language, literary forms, rhetoric, translation, historical method and criticism, theory and practice of interpretation, cultural studies, philosophy of history, and "historicism."Kelley begins by analyzing the dual tradition established by the foundational works of Greek historiography-Herodotus's broad cultural and antiquarian inquiry and the contrasting model of Thucydides' contemporary political and analytical narrative. He then examines the many variations on and departures from these themes produced in writings from Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian antiquity, in medieval chronicles, in national histories and revisions of history during the Renaissance and Reformation, and in the rise of erudite and enlightened history in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Throughout, Kelley discusses how later historians viewed their predecessors, including both supporters and detractors of the authors in question.The book, which is a companion volume to Kelley's highly praised anthology
      Versions of History from Antiquity to the Enlightenment,will be a valuable resource for scholars and students interested in interpretations of the past.<br>

These have been understood as a reconstitution on the level of symbolic cognition of presence-openness as the basic structure of perception in motile sentient creatures. Horizonal openness and the flow gradients of the ambient array are “real,” “existent,” and inherent to the structure of sentience, but would only be realized as such, as felt meaning for its own sake, on the human level.

  Abstract: The extremely broad subject of the translation of the Qurʾan into Hebrew has not been studied in sufficient detail. Further study would undoubtedly shed valuable light on the relations between the Jews and Islam during the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Little is known of the context that produced the Hebrew translations, nor their purpose. One of the reasons is, perhaps, the often ambiguous relationship between the Jews and Islam’s sacred text. This relationship speaks directly to issues of religious identity and ethnic belonging, as expressed in the theological and philosophical debate, and implies the acceptance of another conceptual<br>

  Abstract: Looking to the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the essays in this section examine the role of translation in an increasingly interwoven, globalizing world. Here, translations become exemplary “traveling texts,” capable of highlighting the complex interactions between still vital nationalisms on the one hand, and growing local and international cultures on the other. Four of these essays explore colonial and postcolonial issues in texts from francophone Africa, India, South Africa, and Latin America, while the fifth and final essay takes its literary example from the war-torn Balkans.

  Book Title: Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna (Ibn Sina)-With a Translation of the Book of the Prophet Muhammad's Ascent to Heaven<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Heath Peter<br>
  Abstract: Islamic allegory is the product of a cohesive literary tradition to which few contributed as significantly as Ibn Sina (Avicenna), the eleventh-century Muslim philosopher. Peter Heath here offers a detailed examination of Avicenna's contribution, paying special attention to Avicenna's psychology and poetics and to the ways in which they influenced strains of theological, mystical, and literary thought in subsequent Islamic-and Western-intellectual and religious history. Heath begins by showing how Avicenna's writings fit into the context and general history of Islamic allegory and explores the interaction among allegory, allegoresis, and philosophy in Avicenna's thought. He then provides a brief introduction to Avicenna as an historical figure. From there, he examines the ways in which Avicenna's cosmological, psychological, and epistemological theories find parallel, if diverse, expression in the disparate formats of philosophical and allegorical narration. Included in this book is an illustration of Avicenna's allegorical practice. This takes the form of a translation of the Mi'raj Nama (The Book of the Prophet Muhammad's Ascent to Heaven), a short treatise in Persian generally attributed to Avicenna. The text concludes with an investigation of the literary dimension Avicenna's allegorical theory and practice by examining his use of description metaphor. Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna is an original and important work that breaks new ground by applying the techniques of modern literary criticism to the study of Medieval Islamic philosophy. It will be of interest to scholars and students of medieval Islamic and Western literature and philosophy.<br>

The most prominent example of this theme in Islamic literature is the prophet Muḥammad’s own mi‘râj, with the accompanying tradition of his Night Journey (isrâ) from the sacred Mosque (in Mecca) to the Further Mosque (in Jerusalem).² This story exists primarily in the form<br>

  Book Title: The King James Version at 400-Assessing Its Genius as Bible Translation and Its Literary Influence<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Towner Philip H.<br>
  Abstract: In this collection of essays, thirty scholars from diverse disciplines offer their unique perspectives on the genius of the King James Version, a translation whose 400th anniversary was recently celebrated throughout the English-speaking world. While avoiding nostalgia and hagiography, each author clearly appreciates the monumental, formative role the KJV has had on religious and civil life on both sides of the Atlantic (and beyond) as well as on the English language itself. In part 1 the essayists look at the KJV in its historical contexts—the politics and rapid language growth of the era, the emerging printing and travel industries, and the way women are depicted in the text (and later feminist responses to such depictions). Part 2 takes a closer look at the KJV as a translation and the powerful precedents it set for all translations to follow, with the essayists exploring the translators’ principles and processes (with close examinations of “Bancroft’s Rules" and the Prefaces), assessing later revisions of the text, and reviewing the translation’s influence on the English language, textual criticism, and the practice of translation in Jewish and Chinese contexts. Part 3 looks at the various ways the KJV has impacted the English language and literature, the practice of religion (including within the African American and Eastern Orthodox churches), and the broader culture.

  Abstract: In a field as well trodden as that of Bible translation, a would-be translator has two curiously dissimilar tasks. On the one hand, Bible translators at least since Jerome have insisted on the importance of “going back to the original text,” of coming closer to this original than previous efforts had succeeded in doing. On the other hand, new translations, particularly in the modern period, also aspire to differentiate themselves from their precursors who have worked in the same language, to gain the sort of status that accrues to new translations and is justly withheld from mere revisions.¹ Proximity and<br>

  Book Title: Ciaran Carson-Space, Place, Writing<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER NEAL<br>
  Abstract: Ciaran Carson is one of the most challenging and inventive of contemporary Irish writers, exhibiting verbal brilliance, formal complexity, and intellectual daring across a remarkably varied body of work. This study considers the full range of his oeuvre, in poetry, prose, and translations, and discusses the major themes to which he returns, including: memory and history, narrative, language and translation, mapping, violence, and power. It argues that the singularity of Carson’s writing is to be found in his radical imaginative engagements with ideas of space and place. The city of Belfast, in particular, occupies a crucially important place in his texts, serving as an imaginative focal point around which his many other concerns are constellated. The city, in all its volatile mutability, is an abiding frame of reference and a reservoir of creative impetus for Carson’s imagination. Accordingly, the book adopts an interdisciplinary approach that draws upon geography, urbanism, and cultural theory as well as literary criticism. It provides both a stimulating and thorough introduction to Carson’s work, and a flexible critical framework for exploring literary representations of space.<br>

In this regard ‘translation’ concerns itself with the ways in which transactions between words, idioms, discourses, and languages reveal the difference that is internal to all language. Or, as Walter Benjamin expresses it, ‘all translation is only a somewhat provisional way of coming to terms<br>

  Book Title: Translating Life-Studies in Transpositional Aesthetics<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): STEAD ALISTAIR<br>
  Abstract: This volume brings together eighteen substantial essays by distinguished scholars, critics and translators, and two interviews with eminent figures of British theatre, to explore the idea and practice of translation. The individual, but conceptually related, contributions examine topics from the Renaissance to the present in the context of apt exploration of the translation process, invoking both restricted and extended senses of translation. The endeavour is to study in detail the theory, workings and implications of what might be called the art of creative transposition, effective at the level of interlingual transcoding, dynamic rewriting, theatrical and cinematic adaptation, intersemiotic or intermedial translation, and cultural exchange. Many of the essays focus on aspects of intertextuality, the dialogue with text, past and present, as they bear on the issue of translation, attending to the historical, political or cultural dimensions of the practice, whether it illuminates a gendered reading of a text or a staging of cultural difference. The historic and generic range of the discussions is wide, encompassing the Elizabethan epyllion, Sensibility fiction, Victorian poetry and prose, modern and postmodern novels, but the book is dominated by dramatic or performance-related applications, with major representation of fresh investigations into Shakespeare (from A Midsummer Night’s Dream to The Tempest) and foregrounding of acts of self-translation on stage, in the dramatic monologue and in fiction. Contributions from theatre practitioners such as Sir Peter Hall, John Barton and Peter Lichtenfels underscore the immense practical importance of the translator on the stage and the business of both acting and directing as a species of translation.<br>

  Abstract: Saint Thomas More's
      Utopiais one of the most important works of European humanism and serves as a key text in survey courses on Western intellectual history, the Renaissance, political theory, and many other subjects. Preeminent More scholar Clarence H. Miller does justice to the full range of More's rhetoric in this masterful translation.

  Abstract: Readers of Arlette Farge’s writings have marveled at the world of eighteenth-century France that she has opened before our eyes. Whether in her stylish and lyrical French or in excellent English translation, her books have brought to life women and men of Paris in their workshops, bedrooms, and kitchens; on their doorsteps and in their streets and taverns; making appeals to their parish church and summoned before the commissariat of police. She has retrieved stories of love and abandonment among young working people and servants; of quarrels between apprentices and masters, with the master’s wife standing in the middle; of<br>

  Book Title: The Hermes Complex-Philosophical Reflections on Translation<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Folkart Barbara<br>
  Abstract: When Hermes handed over to Apollo his finest invention, the lyre, in exchange for promotion to the status of messenger of the gods, he relinquished the creativity that gave life to his words.The trade-off proved frustrating: Hermes chafed under the obligation to deliver the ideas and words of others and resorted to all manner of ruses in order to assert his presence in the messages he transmitted. His theorizing descendants, too, allow their pretentions to creatorship to interfere with the actual business of reinventing originals in another language.Just as the Hermes of old delighted in leading the traveller astray, so his descendants lead their acolytes, through thickets of jargon, into labyrinths of eloquence without substance.Charles Le Blanc possesses the philosophical tools to dismantle this empty eloquence: he exposes the inconsistencies, internal contradictions, misreadings, and misunderstandings rife in so much of the current academic discourse en translation, and traces the failings of this discourse back to its roots in the anguish of having traded authentic creativity for mere status.<br>

  Book Title: The Aesthetics of Mimesis-Ancient Texts and Modern Problems<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Halliwell Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Mimesis is one of the oldest, most fundamental concepts in Western aesthetics. This book offers a new, searching treatment of its long history at the center of theories of representational art: above all, in the highly influential writings of Plato and Aristotle, but also in later Greco-Roman philosophy and criticism, and subsequently in many areas of aesthetic controversy from the Renaissance to the twentieth century. Combining classical scholarship, philosophical analysis, and the history of ideas--and ranging across discussion of poetry, painting, and music--Stephen Halliwell shows with a wealth of detail how mimesis, at all stages of its evolution, has been a more complex, variable concept than its conventional translation of "imitation" can now convey.<br>

  Abstract: Some of the most innovative writers of contemporary literature are writing in diaspora in their second or third language. Here Azade Seyhan describes the domain of transnational poetics they inhabit. She begins by examining the works of selected bilingual and bicultural writers of the United States (including Oscar Hijuelos, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Eva Hoffman) and Germany (Libuse Moníková, Rafik Schami, and E. S. Özdamar, among others), developing a new framework for understanding the relationship between displacement, memory, and language. Considering themes of loss, witness, translation, identity, and exclusion, Seyhan interprets diasporic literatures as condensed archives of cultural and linguistic memory that give integrity and coherence to pasts ruptured by migration.<br>

Greek is also pertinent in the etymological sense of the word, and Stevens said he had this sense in mind. ʺI was thinking of aesthetics as the equivalent of aperçus, which seems to have been the original meaningʺ (L469, 1944; cf.

Historians of anthropology, anthropologists themselves, and literary critics have turned their attention toward the writing of fieldwork as a locus of power relations and historical contexts.¹ The text itself, the document that certifies the authenticity of fieldwork, has come under scrutiny from critics who view ethnography not as a transparent window onto another culture but rather as a poetic and rhetorical translation, inevitably partial and contested.

  Book Title: The Future of the Word-An Eschatology of Reading<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Kriner Tiffany Eberle<br>
  Abstract: In scripture, Jesus promises a future that potentiall infuses all texts: "my words will not pass away" (Matt 24:28). This book argues that texts--even literary texts--, have an eschatology, too, a part of God's purpose for the cosmos. They, with all creation, moves toward participation in the new creation, in the Trinity's expanding, creative love. This eschatological future for texts impacts how we understand meaning making, from the level of semiology to that of hermeneutics. This book tells he story of how readers participate in the future of the word, the eschatology of texts. If texts have a future i the kingdom of God, then readers' engagement with them--everything from preservation and utterance to translation, criticism, and call and response--can cultivate those futures in the love of the Trinity. Kriner explores how the fallenness and failures of texts, alongside readers' own failures, while seeming to challenge the future of the word, ultimately point to reading as a posture of reconciliation, in which reader and text meet in the Maranatha of all text.<br>

  Book Title: Everyone Says No-Public Service Broadcasting and the Failure of Translation<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): CONWAY KYLE<br>
  Abstract: Quebec has never signed on to Canada's constitution. After both major attempts to win Quebec's approval - the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords - failed, Quebec came within a fraction of a percentage point of voting for independence. Everyone Says No examines how the failure of these accords was depicted in French and English media and the ways in which journalists' reporting failed to translate the differences between Quebec and the rest of Canada. Focusing on the English- and French-language networks of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Kyle Conway draws on the CBC/Radio Canada rich print and video archive as well as journalists' accounts of their reporting to revisit the story of the accords and the furor they stirred in both French and English Canada. He shows that CBC/Radio Canada attempts to translate language and culture and encourage understanding among Canadians actually confirmed viewers' pre-existing assumptions rather than challenging them. The first book to examine translation in Canadian news, Everyone Says No also provides insight into Canada's constitutional history and the challenges faced by contemporary public service broadcasters in increasingly multilingual and multicultural communities.<br>

  Abstract: In the early nineteenth century, Schleiermacher noted that ‘understanding is an unending task’ and ‘the talent for misunderstanding is infinite’.² In more recent times, meaning has been understood as an endless deferral; the more one tries to grasp it, the more it appears ungraspable. This rings especially true if we consider the particular form of understanding that is translation. Since the meaning of a text is closely attached to its ‘letter’ – its sound or signifier – translation can never be a simple transfer of meaning. Indeed, no matter how accurately one brings meaning ‘home’,³ the result is inevitably approximate,<br>

  Abstract: Literary translation is a love affair. Depending on the context, it could be love at first sight or hot pursuit of a lover’s elusive nodding approval. In other instances it could be unrequited love, and still others a test of devotion and faith; or else an eclectic combination of any of these events. Translation involves artistic creativity, not a workshop of equivalences. As human civilizations developed and intersected, translation emerged as a necessary form of communication and a way of life. It highlighted and put to productive use the space between cultures, between individuals with different perspectives and within one’s<br>

  Book Title: “The Useless Mouths” and Other Literary Writings-  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Le Bon de Beauvoir Sylvie<br>
  Abstract: "The Useless Mouths" and Other Literary Writings brings to English-language readers literary writings--several previously unknown--by Simone de Beauvoir. Culled from sources including various American university collections, the works span decades of Beauvoir's career. Ranging from dramatic works and literary theory to radio broadcasts, they collectively reveal fresh insights into Beauvoir's writing process, personal life, and the honing of her philosophy. The volume begins with a new translation of the 1945 play The Useless Mouths, written in Paris during the Nazi occupation. Other pieces were discovered after Beauvoir's death in 1986, such as the 1965 short novel "Misunderstanding in Moscow," involving an elderly French couple who confront their fears of aging. Two additional previously unknown texts include the fragmentary "Notes for a Novel," which contains the seed of what she later would call "the problem of the Other," and a lecture on postwar French theater titled Existentialist Theater. The collection notably includes the eagerly awaited translation of Beauvoir's contribution to a 1965 debate among Jean-Paul Sartre and other French writers and intellectuals, "What Can Literature Do?" Prefaces to well-known works such as Bluebeard and Other Fairy Tales, La Bâtarde, and James Joyce in Paris: His Final Years are also available in English for the first time, alongside essays and other short articles. A landmark contribution to Beauvoir studies and French literary studies, the volume includes informative and engaging introductory essays by prominent and rising scholars. Contributors are Meryl Altman, Elizabeth Fallaize, Alison S. Fell, Sarah Gendron, Dennis A. Gilbert, Laura Hengehold, Eleanore Holveck, Terry Keefe, J. Debbie Mann, Frederick M.

  Author(s): Skafish Peter<br>
  Abstract: The iconoclastic Brazilian anthropologist and theoretician Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, well known in his discipline for helping initiate its "ontological turn," offers a vision of anthropology as "the practice of the permanent decolonization of thought." After showing that Amazonian and other Amerindian groups inhabit a radically different conceptual universe than ours-in which nature and culture, human and nonhuman, subject and object are conceived in terms that reverse our own-he presents the case for anthropology as the study of such "other" metaphysical schemes, and as the corresponding critique of the concepts imposed on them by the human sciences. Along the way, he spells out the consequences of this anthropology for thinking in general via a major reassessment of the work of Claude Lévi-Strauss, arguments for the continued relevance of Deleuze and Guattari, dialogues with the work of Philippe Descola, Bruno Latour, and Marilyn Strathern, and inventive treatments of problems of ontology, translation, and transformation. Bold, unexpected, and profound,
      Cannibal Metaphysicsis one of the chief works marking anthropology's current return to the theoretical center stage.<br>

  Book Title: The Thought of Death and the Memory of War-  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
  Abstract: War lays bare death and our relation to it. And in the wars-or more precisely the memories of war-of the twentieth century, images of the deaths of countless faceless or nameless others eclipse the singularity of each victim's death as well as the end of the world as such that each death signifies. Marc Crépon's The Thought of Death and the Memory of War is a call to resist such images in which death is no longer actual death since it happens to anonymous others, and to seek instead a world in which mourning the other whose mortality we always already share points us toward a cosmopolitics. Crépon pursues this path toward a cosmopolitics of mourning through readings of works by Freud, Heidegger, Sartre, Patocka, Levinas, Derrida, and Ricœur, and others. The movement among these writers, Crépon shows, marks a way through-and against-twentieth-century interpretation to argue that no war, genocide, or neglect of people is possible without suspending how one relates to the death of another human being. A history of a critical strain in contemporary thought, this book is, as Rodolphe Gasché says in the Foreword, "a profound meditation on what constitutes evil and a rigorous and illuminating reflection on death, community, and world." The translation of this work received financial support from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<br>

  Abstract: Several abrupt turns mark the critical career of J. Hillis Miller and withhold from his works that sense of stability and continuity that a lifelong pursuit of a single critical project might otherwise provide. They do so, moreover, because they seem precipitated more by Miller’s translation and adaptation of the positions of other critics than by reversals in his own thinking. First, there was the New Critical dissertation at Harvard; then, after a one-year stay at Williams in 1952-53, the years of phenomenological criticism at Johns Hopkins from 1953 to 1972, and more recently the move to deconstruction at Yale.<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy Beside Itself-On Deconstruction and Modernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Marshall Donald<br>
  Abstract: The writings of French philosopher Jacques Derrida have been the single most powerful influence on critical theory and practice in the United States over the past decade. But with few exceptions American philosophers have taken little or no interest in Derrida’s work, and the task of reception, translation, and commentary has been left to literary critics. As a result, Derrida has appeared as a figure already defined by essentially literary critical activities and interests. Stephen Melville’s aim in Philosophy Beside Itself is to insist upon and clarify the distinctions between philosophy and criticism. He argues that until we grasp Derrida’s philosophical project as such, we remain fundamentally unable to see his significance for criticism. In terms derived from Stanley Cavell’s writings on modernism, Melville develops a case for Derrida as a modernist philosopher, working at once within and against that tradition and discipline. Melville first places Derrida in a Hegelian context, the structure of which he explores by examining the work of Heidegger, Lacan, and Bataille. With this foundation, he is able to reappraise the project of deconstructive criticism as developed in Paul de Man’s Blindness and Insight and further articulated by other Yale critics. Central to this critique is the ambivalent relationship between deconstructive criticism and Lacanian psychoanalysis. Criticism—radical self-criticism—is a central means through which the difficult facts of human community come to recognition, and Melville argues for criticism as an activity intimately bound to the ways in which we do and do not belong in time and in community. Derrida’s achievement has been to find a new and necessary way to assert that the task of philosophy is criticism; the task of literary criticism is to assume the burden of that achievement. Stephen Melville is an assistant professor of English at Syracuse University, and Donald Marshall is a professor of English at the University of Iowa.<br>

  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Flaxman Gregory<br>
  Abstract: In the nearly twenty years since their publication, Gilles Deleuze’s books about cinema have proven as daunting as they are enticing—a new aesthetics of film, one equally at home with Henri Bergson and Wim Wenders, Friedrich Nietzsche and Orson Welles, that also takes its place in the philosopher’s immense and difficult oeuvre. With this collection, the first to focus solely and extensively on Deleuze’s cinematic work, the nature and reach of that work finally become clear. Composed of a substantial introduction, twelve original essays produced for this volume, and a new English translation of a personal, intriguing, and little-known interview with Deleuze on his cinema books, The Brain Is the Screen is a sustained engagement with Deleuze’s cinematic philosophy that leads to a new view of the larger confrontation of philosophy with cinematic images.

Indeed, it has been said that one virtue of his early texts of the late 1960s is that in them Derrida still

He begins with a consideration of the reception of Bolaño's fiction in English translation, examining the reasons behind its popularity. Subsequent chapters explore aspects of Bolaño's fictional universe and the political, ethical, and aesthetic values that shape it. Bolaño emerges as the inventor of a prodigiously effective "fiction-making system," a subtle handler of suspense, a chronicler of aimlessness, a celebrator of courage, an anatomist of evil, and a proponent of youthful openness. Written in a clear and engaging style,Roberto's Bolano's Fictionoffers an invaluable understanding of one of the most important authors of the last thirty years.<br>

  Abstract: For Lara, secularization means three things: the translation of religious semantics into politics; a transformation of religious notions into political ideas; and the reoccupation of a space left void by changing political actors that gives rise to new conceptions of political interaction. Conceptual innovation redefines politics as a horizontal relationship between governments and the governed and better enables societies (and individual political actors) to articulate meaning through action -- that is, through the emergence of new concepts. These actions, Lara proves, radically transform our understanding of politics and the role of political agents and are further enhanced by challenging the structural dependence of politics on religious phenomena.<br>

In this chapter I will focus on Koselleck’s largely negative assessment of the ways in which the problem of politics versus morality has been addressed in Enlightenment thought. Koselleck’s model<br>

  Author(s): Mandair Arvind-Pal S.<br>
  Abstract: Mandair rethinks the intersection of religion and the secular in discourses such as history of religions, postcolonial theory, and recent continental philosophy. Though seemingly unconnected, these discourses are shown to be linked to a philosophy of "generalized translation" that emerged as a key conceptual matrix in the colonial encounter between India and the West. In this riveting study, Mandair demonstrates how this philosophy of translation continues to influence the repetitions of religion and identity politics in the lives of South Asians, and the way the academy, state, and media have analyzed such phenomena.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I continue to trace the movement of cultural translation designated by the term “Sikh theology” into the humanities program of the modern Western university, specifically the discourse of the history of religions.

I argue that a certain understanding of violence, or, rather, a set of unexamined assumptions about the relationship between religion and violence, is necessary for the construction and deployment of this subject as “religious” in the modern academic study<br>

  Book Title: Paradigms for a Metaphorology-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Savage Robert<br>
  Abstract: In
         Paradigms for a Metaphorology, originally published in 1960 and here made available for the first time in English translation, Hans Blumenberg (1920-1996) approaches these questions by examining the relationship between metaphors and concepts. Blumenberg argues for the existence of "absolute metaphors" that cannot be translated back into conceptual language. These metaphors answer the supposedly naïve, theoretically unanswerable questions whose relevance lies quite simply in the fact that they cannot be brushed aside, since we do not pose them ourselves but find them already posed in the ground of our existence. They leap into a void that concepts are unable to fill.<br>

  Abstract: Resisting translation, both

These subliminal associations reflect two very different senses of aesthetic modernism, or rather, contribute to the valorization of a French-oriented as opposed to a German-oriented history of modern art, in which French painting rather than German music plays the leading role. Thisparti prisis so self-evident that the last crucial stage of European modernism, from the 1880s to the 1920s, is comprehended in terms of avant-gardism, that is to say, in<br>

  Abstract: Aristotle’s 
                  Nicomachean Ethics is enormously influential for a subsequent tradition of reflection on happiness in the West. Despite the complexities of its reception, it is arguably the text that lays out the terms of a debate that will endure over centuries.¹ For a later tradition, it becomes the archetype of the classical idea of happiness, and it still remains one of the most lucid and compelling accounts of that idea, unsurpassed in the rigor and sophistication of its analyses. Now, I will argue that the Nicomachean Ethics can be viewed as a “translation” of the Solonian conception of happiness, with<br>

  Book Title: Cultural Capital, Language and National Identity in Imperial Spain-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): BINOTTI LUCIA<br>
  Abstract: This innovative study examines the cultural mechanisms in early modern Spain that led to the translation, imitation and selective adoption of the values embodied by the Italian Renaissance. These mechanisms served to delineate a national tradition that addressed the needs of a changing society and gave a "Spanish" physiognomy to the Italian experience, which ultimately led to the Golden Age. By examining such important texts as the sentimental fictions of Diego de San Pedro and Juan de Flores, the Spanish translation of Orlando Furioso, Don Quixote, and the Polifemo, Binotti first describes the conditions imposed on book production by both the expectations of an elite audience and the limitations of the printing market while outlining the process of the creation of an expressive poetic language and the quest for literary models. She then looks at Ambrosio de Morales' chronicles and Bernardo de Aldrete's Del Origen, showing how a cultural discourse founded on foreign scholarship paved the way for the establishment of innovative-and autochtonous-methods of historical and scientific analysis in the early seventeenth-century. LUCIA BINOTTI is an associate professor in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.<br>

  Abstract: Heidegger polarizes opinion. To some, he is the most important philosopher of the twentieth century; to others, he is little more than a mystifying word-spinner. The perplexingly difficult nature of his work derives to a significant extent from his exploitation of the resources of the German language, so — even more than with most other philosophers — there is a clear advantage in reading him in the original rather than in translation. In the immediate postwar period, the vogue for Existentialism favored Jean-Paul Sartre (whose early philosophy was largely based, as Hubert L.

Across what bridge, by what mode, can a text arrive at the further shore – ‘[a] esotra parte, en la ribera’ – transformed to a new language and occupying a foreign literary context, yet with intangible spirit intact?¹ Does it best travel naked or robed, empty-handed or with baggage? In particular, how do we bring across Baroque lyric: rhymed, metered, allusive, with incisively doubled meaning or gorgeously encrusted figuration.

  Book Title: Arno Schmidt's 'Zettel's Traum'-An Analysis<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Langbehn Volker Max<br>
  Abstract: Arno Schmidt (1914-1979) is considered one of the most daring and influential writers of postwar Germany; the Germanist Jeremy Adler has called him a "giant of postwar German literature." Schmidt was awarded the Fontane Prize in 1964 and the Goethe Prize in 1973, and his early fiction has been translated into English to high critical acclaim, but he is not a well-known figure in the English-speaking world, where his complex work remains at the margins of critical inquiry. Volker Langbehn's book introduces Schmidt to the English-speaking audience, with primary emphasis on his most famous novel, 'Zettel's Traum'. One reviewer called the book an "elephantine monster" because of its unconventional size (folio format), length (1334 pages and over 10 million characters), and unique presentation of text in the form of notes, typewritten pages, parallel columns, and collages. The novel narrates the life of the main characters, Daniel Pagenstecher, Paul Jacobi and his wife Wilma, and their teenage daughter Franziska. In discussing the life and works of Edgar Allan Poe, the four engage in the problems connected with a translation of Poe. Langbehn's study investigates how literary language can mediate or account for the world of experiences and for concepts. Schmidt's use of unconventional presentation formats challenges us to analyze how we think about reading and writing literary texts. Instead of viewing such texts as a representation of reality, Schmidt's novel destabilizes this unquestioned mode of representation, posing a radical challenge to what contemporary literary criticism defines as literature. No comprehensive study of 'Zettel's Traum' exists in English. Volker Langbehn is associate professor of German at San Francisco State University.<br>

  Abstract: According to Schmidt, 
                  Zettel’s Traum borrows its “SpaltenTechnick” from Finnegans Wake. By structuring Zettel’s Traum into three columns or “TextSträhnen,” Schmidt expects that the reader will be able to follow the information provided in the columns.¹ To ease the reading process, Schmidt divides the three columns according to theme. The center column reflects the events of the years between 1965 and 1969, the time frame in which Zettel’s Traum was actually written. Daniel Pagenstecher, as the central narrator of the events, assists Paul and Wilma Jacobi, likewise writers and old school friends, in the translation of Poe’s works into German.<br>

Abstract: At least in the traditions I have been discussing here, paradigms do not die. As new ones are born, the old ones can survive and even prosper. Throughout the 1990s, the first paradigm continued to be visible in a number of publications, including the journal
      Anthropological Linguisticsand William BrightsOxford Studies in Anthropological Linguistics. Brights series features two books that fit squarely within the first paradigm: Cecil H. Browns (1999) comparative study of loanwords in Native American languages and Richard FeinbergsOral Traditions of Anuta, a Polynesian Outlier in the Solomon Islands(1998), which consists of 15 pages of introduction and 233 pages of Anutan texts with English translation. There are several features that qualify Feinbergs book as a good example of the kind of salvage anthropology practiced by Boas and some of his collaborators (e.g., George Hunt) at the beginning of the 20th century. The texts are monologic and elicited precisely for the purpose of transforming oral history, perceived as on its way to extinction, into a written record. As we find out from Feinbergs candid description of the methods he used (1998:7), the stories collected in the early 1970s were transcribed with techniques that closely resemble those used by the anthropologists hired by the Bureau of American Ethnology before the invention of the portable tape recorder.<br>

Abstract: The final collapse of the rhetorical empire was assured when Harvard president Charles William Eliot established the elective system in the 1870s that effectively ended the curriculum in Greek and Latin within which rhetorical texts commanded so prominent a place. Later, Harvard also led the way in abandoning entrance requirements in Greek and Latin, removing pressure on the primary and secondary schools to compel the study of classical languages. The hold of rhetoric in translation proved subsequently to be much weaker than anyone imagined; vernacularization itself was thus implicated in rhetoric’s demise.<br>

Abstract: Taking my cue from Homi Bhabha’s twofold thesis that the colonial and postcolonial history has been characterized by the colonizers’ construction of a binary opposition between pure, homogeneous, and culturally superior Europe and the equally homogeneous but inferior and decadent other of Europe and that the traditionalist, nativist, and nationalist movements of anticolonial resistance have all more or less bought into that binary scheme repressive of hybridity and internal heterogeneity, I suggest the following sociopolitically concrete reformulation of the dialectic.
         42First of all, any claim of pure and homogeneous religious identity made today must initially be put within its proper postcolonial‐neocolonial context via a hermeneutic of suspicion and examined in regard to the degree to which it may or may not be stained with the enduring impact of the centuries‐long imposition of economic, political, and cultural master‐slave relations. For example, when today a European or Euro‐American Christian community calls for a return to the “pure,” “orthodox” tradition in total opposition to modernity—variously called “the world,” “the liberal nation‐state,” “the secular humanistic culture,” and so forth—and castigates feminist and other liberationist voices of resistance springing up both within itself and outside for having been contaminated by modernity, it is apropos to ask if that gesture of repudiation and return is an attempt to maintain an originary myth of pure and homogeneous identity in another package after modernity’s totalizing binary opposition of Europe and Other has been discredited and condemned. Especially, if that community today asserts once more the long‐standing Christian view that Christianity is the only true way, one is all the more drawn to wonder whether that assertion now camouflages a lingering residue of and an effort to perpetuate by other means the sense of culturally superior identity it enjoyed for so long, being at the center ~<br>

Abstract: In 1974, in the second issue of
      Critical Inquiry, David Richter, then an assistant professor at Queens College and a student of Sheldon Sacks, predicted that the future of theory would be a battle among genre critics. He had already decided that the neo‐Aristotelians, the Chicago school, had won out over neo‐Kantians and the New Critics.16Thus Tzvetan Todorov and Paul Hernadi, he predicted, would be read, not E. D. Hirsch and Murray Krieger. However, at the same time that he was making his predictions, Denis Donoghue and Frank Kermode were arguing, in footnotes, over the correct translation, meaning, and applicability of Jacques Derrida’s “Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences.”<br>

Abstract: There is a good body of work in recent French philosophy on the issue of recognition. Emmanuel Renault, Christian Lazerri, and the antiutilitarian MAUSS (Mouvement anti‐utilitariste en sciences sociales) come readily to mind. Axel Honneth and Charles Taylor are influential, but so, too, are Bourdieu and other French sociologists. In spite of the original contributions of these French authors, none of their work has been made available to English readers to date. A first step toward filling this lack has been made with this translation of the final opus of the recently deceased Paul Ricoeur on the theme of recognition.<br>

Abstract: The
            ātman‐brahman equation is best regarded as the achievement of Vedāntic interpretation rather than as a straightforward translation of the Upaniṣadic formula,tat tvam asi. This is the conclusion one draws from Joel Brereton’s seminal article, “Tat Tvam Asiin Context,”Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft136, no. 1 (1986): 98–109.<br>

Abstract: Rewritings of texts that are still under copyright illuminate this process. First published in Italian in 1995 and subsequently issued in a Dutch translation in 1996, Pera’s rewriting of
         Lolitafrom the eponymous character’s perspective was blocked from publication in the United States by Vladimir Nabokov’s son, Dmitri, who claimed copyright infringement. The case was settled with Dmitri Nabokov writing a preface to the novel and half of Pera’s royalties going to PEN (Poets, Playwrights, Essayists, and Novelists).13According to Nabokov, Pera is trading on the celebrity ofLolita, “seek[ing] inspiration, fortune and fame” from his father’s world‐famous novel. Taking Pera’s lawyer up on his argument thatLo’s Diaryis a “transformative” work, Nabokov observes: “My Fair Lady,West Side Story, Stoppard’sRosencrantz and Guildenstern, Updike’sS, Jean Rhys’sWide Sargasso Sea… all had been safely tucked into the public domain when the ‘transformations’ were penned.Lolitaisn’t in the public domain, and won’t be until well into the next millennium when its copyright expires” (Nabokov1999, viii). The distinction, no doubt, is important; texts under copyright require dues to be paid, and their authors or estates can file suit to see their rights honored. Yet in their attempts to keep unauthorized rewritings at bay, they reveal a mechanism that is inherent to all rewriting, the effects of which are of the order of brand recognition.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 598771<br>
Date: 8 2009<br>
Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: Benjamin's friend Siegfried Kracauer had a better chance to bring Frankfurt‐style critical theory to America, since
         From Caligari to Hitler(1947) andTheory of Film(1960) were published here. The former could be called a study of a cinematic public sphere, though a decidedly dysfunctional one, while the latter (introduced in its latest edition by Hansen) ranks as the most ambitious treatise on the cinema written by anyone from this school of thought. YetTheory of Filmhas until recently been largely ignored. I contributed to this neglect inThe Major Film Theories, being relatively ignorant at the time of Kracauer's journalism of the 1920s. And, indeed, Kracauer'sTheory of Filmdid seem like an orphan, in dialogue with no active discourse community—Frankfurt school or otherwise—especially in comparison to Bazin, whose works, collected around the same time, were written within an unbroken and vibrant French tradition of criticism. Kracauer came off badly in the inevitable comparison with Bazin at a time when realist theory as a whole, and Bazin's star in particular, had dimmed considerably. Kracauer was thus doubly cursed, at least until the 1990s when he benefited from Benjamin's fame and from the fine bibliographic recovery effort of Tom Levin, whose translation ofThe Mass Ornamentappeared in 1995.55These essays, more than Kracauer's book‐length works, encouraged the kind of detailed and imaginative historical research that Anglo‐American film scholars had been pursuing, especially in the area of early cinema and the culture it grew out of. Think of Gunning's wide‐ranging array of essays; one could say that he writes, consciously or not, in the Frankfurt school manner. Critical theory put film in its place, so to speak, and interrogated it from that place. Perhaps its impact could only be felt when American film studies began to realize that media was integral to a discipline no longer bounded by dates or by specific technologies.<br>

Article Title: Resacralizing the World: The Fate of Secularization in Enlightenment Historiography<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 605587<br>
Date: 6 2010<br>
Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Despite these oppositions, secularization and resacralization should be regarded as complementary phenomena that arose in response to the problem of a radically transcendent, hidden God. The studies under review, then, are of crucial importance, but their full significance requires a supplementary analysis. Novel conceptions of society, the nation, Scripture, and personhood followed from an intensification of divine transcendence, and, at the same time, necessitated a reworking of the immanent relations between worldly persons, institutions, and things. It was not merely that secularization, now understood by Bell and others as the translation of divine authority into a worldly register, entailed that the latter incorporate the properties and prerogatives once reserved for God alone. Enlightenment-era efforts to resacralize the self as an object of a totalizing force—situated either in the mystic divine or in a purely immanent, materialist conception of nature—suggest another dynamic at work: the closing of the chasm between the divine and terrestrial spheres and the identification of one with the other. Even if human effort was increasingly regarded as the source of one's understanding of the world, the humans undertaking this work had become newly alien to themselves, and in a manner that recalled the radical distance of the divine.<br>

Abstract: But even when the token is received in trust, there is no debt created since the final gift has not yet arrived. One might feel obligation in anticipation of the gift, but such obligation differs from that in which a gift would actually have been received rather than a gift one might receive. Because of the translation of obligation into the future, it opens up a space for exchange without debt. One can take this token in trust and then offer gratitude in return to God without debt, without obligation in freedom. Derrida constructed the pure gift in order to preserve it from exchange and reciprocity. He did not thereby think that the gift so purified would not affect the world of exchange, forever hovering aloft. Rather, his preferred way of describing the gift is as an interruption, a trace, or cinders that would in some oblique or indirect way haunt or challenge the ordinary economy. By contrast, because the giving of the promise indebts God to the one promised in some sense, this token and final gift enters into the already existing exchange of gifts in human culture or the political sphere. Derrida’s gift, in some of its formulations, could silence immanent political criticism. Tillich feared that aphasia in the political was the consequence of dialectical theology when it refused to allow God to interact with the world for fear of tainting God’s wholly otherness. This refusal would prevent the token offered in promise, as well as the one promised, from entering into the give‐and‐take of life with the token in hand or the trust of the word, even though it can radically challenge by its interruption of gift economy.<br>

Abstract: A few days following the announcement of Israel's independence, Blanchot wrote to Lévinas to ask after his reaction given that Lévinas had in earlier discussions emphasized his position that Zionism did not seem to be in accordance with Judaism's destiny. Lévinas responds by explaining his current ambivalence, one that is punctuated, on the one side, by a sense of the miraculous and, on the other, by the feeling that such an event reduces Judaism to the level of the mundane, to the “thirst of ministers, ambassadors, functionaries, and military officers who will finally have their protocols” (Lévinas, “Lettre à Maurice Blanchot sur la création de l'État d'Israël,”
            La Règle du Jeu, no. 41 [Oct. 2009]: 249). See the English translation of this letter in this issue ofCritical Inquiry, p. XXX.<br>

Following a prologue that delineates conventional scholarly approaches and a detailed verse-by-verse exegesis and translation of the text, LaCocque provides thematic analysis under the headings of myth, psychoanalysis, and deconstruction. All three approaches emphasize flexibility of meaning in the canonical text.The Captivity of Innocenceinsightfully argues that Genesis 11 concludes J’s version of ancient history, in which the human search for immortality always fails: “All monuments to human prowess crumble. … A common stupidity smothers them to death” (13).<br>

Abstract: This straight-forward reading of the passage has been obscured by interpreters, ancient and modern, who interpret מחניהם as referring to “their camps” (plural) and thus assert the existence of a requirement to maintain purity in all cities. For a coherent understanding of the syntax and content of this passage, it is necessary to understand the form as singular (“their camp”). Note the form מחניך alongside מחנך in Deut. 23:15, both meaning “your camp” (singular). Among the moderns, the fact that מחניהם in our verse is singular has been noted by J. Licht (
         A Commentary on the Book of Numbers, vol. 1 [Jerusalem, 1985], 59–60 [Heb.]), and Levine (Numbers 1–20, 182, 186), and it is assumed by the JPS translation. I plan on elaborating on these points in a study in progress, “The Wilderness Camp Paradigm in the Holiness Source and the Temple Scroll: From Purity Laws to Cult Politics.”<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: This approach goes beyond the Durkheimian distinction between positive and negative dimensions of the social or the uneasy transposition of the notion of “evil” into a problem of translation. In French, Pickering pointed out “le mal” denotes a fusion of theological evil with (secular) suffering (physical and mental pain). The meaning has to be derived from the context of the use of the word (9). The associations implied in the French word “mal,” however, have to be carefully disassembled in an anthropological theorization of morality. By starting off from one of the core concerns of anthropology, witchcraft, and sorcery, and a fresh reading of these ethnographic accounts with a focus on morality, Csordas establishes evil as an analytic category facilitating cross-cultural understanding of human experiences related to destructive emotions, acts, and practices. In my view this move is particularly useful because it allows not only for the cross-cultural analysis of the relationships between evil and morality but also for those of differently named instances of human malevolence, of harm, hatred, violence, abuse, destructiveness, aggression, etc., in social and cultural circumstances that are often treated separately in terms of history, culture, or politics.<br>

Abstract: AbstractThis paper isolates movement as a topic for analysis in Roman imperial history. Movement is regarded under three aspects: translation (of texts, practices, ideas), migration (of officials, merchants, students, etc.), and communication (i.e. the movement of written documents). Interrelationships among the three aspects of movement are identified and discussed, as are the shared impact of translation, migration, and communication on issues of cultural and social identity and political negotiation and control. The article argues that movement changes the role of the state as well as relations between individual and states, augments the use of writing in society, transforms identities, and gives impulse to internal and external regulations. The implications of movement are understood as both pragmatic and formal, altering relations to space and time and influencing ways of organizing and thinking. The author surveys current work in the field and identifies potential areas for future research. The paper draws heavily on both literary and documentary sources and discusses material from the late republic through late antiquity, paying particular attention to continuities and discontinuities between early and later periods of the Roman empire.<br>

Abstract: Per una trattazione completa delle caratteristiche della yamanba e dei racconti po-
polari in cui compare, si rimanda al prezioso testo di Yanagita Kunio, Yama no jinsei (La
vita di montagna), in Töno monogatari. Yama no jinsei (I racconti di Töno. La vita di mon-
tagna), Tökyö, Iwanami, 1992 (1976), oltre che all'opera Nihon no minwa 400sen (Quat-
trocento racconti popolari del Giappone), a cura di Nagata Yoshinao (Tökyö, Kin'ensha,
1991).
In Öba, il riferimento alia yamanba può essere esplicito, come nel capitolo Yamanba
di Kiri no tabi I-II (Viaggio nella nebbia I-II, 1980; ÖMZ, VI, pp. 391-405) e in Rösoku
no uo (II pesce candela), della raccolta Umi ni yuragu ito (Fili ondeggianti nel mare, 1989;
ÖMZ, IX, pp. 306-326), o implicito, come già in Sanbiki no kani, dove la protagonista
ha la capacità di intuire i pensieri degli interlocutori.
Rösoku no uo è stato tradotto in inglese da Tanaka Yukiko: Candle Fish, in Unmapped
Territories. New Women Fiction from Japan, Seattle, Women in Translation, 1991.
La raccolta di ritratti romanzati di amici conosciuti in Alaska, Umi ni yuragu ito, è
valsa alia scrittrice il Premio Letterario Kawabata Yasunari (Kawabata Yasunari bungaku-
shö) del 1989. L'opera compone una trilogia insieme ai romanzi Kiri no tabi I-II e Naku
tori no (Cantano, gli uccelli, 1985). Quest'ultimo ha ottenuto il Premio Letterario Noma
1986 (Noma bungeishö).<br>

Abstract: Consacré à la section de L'Étoile intitulée « Le nom propre », cet article fait aussi ressortir l'influence sur Rosenzweig, à côté de Luther, de Samson Rafael Hirsch, dans sa traduction et son commentaire du Pentateuque. « L'appel du nom propre » de Rosenzweig sert ensuite de base à une réflexion sur la notion de « devoir de mémoire »: toujours adressé à quelqu'un, jamais abstraitement universel, ce devoir est également de nature éthique, c'est-à-dire politique. Centered upon the section of The Star… entitled « The proper name », this paper also brings out the influence upon Rosenzweig of Samson Rafael Hirsch, in his translation and commentary of the Pentateuch. Rosenzweig's « Call of the proper name » is then used as a point of departure for reflecting upon the « duty to remember »: this duty, which is always turned towards a singularity and never abstractly universal, also is ethical in nature, i.e., political.<br>

Abstract: The English translation of Habermas's The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere converges with the revival of the "political culture concept" in the social sciences. Surprisingly, Habermas's account of the Western bourgeois public sphere has much in common with the original political culture concept associated with Parsonian modernization theory in the 1950s and 1960s. In both cases, the concept of political culture is used in a way that is neither political nor cultural. Explaining this peculiarity is the central problem addressed in this article and its companion piece, which appeared in Sociological Theory, volume 3, number 2 (1995). I hypothesize that this is the case because the concept itself is embedded in an historically constituted political culture (here called a conceptual network)-a structured web of conceptual relationships that combine into Anglo-American citizenship theory. The method of an historical sociology of concept formation is used to analyze historically and empirically the internal constraints and dynamics of this conceptual network. The method draws from new work in cultural history and sociology, social studies, and network, narrative, and institutional analysis. This research yields three empirical findings: this conceptual network has a narrative structure, here called the Anglo-American citizenship story; this narrative is grafted onto an epistemology of social naturalism; and these elements combine in a metanarrative that continues to constrain empirical research in political sociology.<br>

Abstract: מסה זו עוסקת בסוציולוגיה של התרגום בתנאים של יחסי כוח תיאולוגיים וקולוניאליים בין שפות. בעקבות ולטר בנימין, פול ריקר, ז'אק דרידה והספרות הפוסט-קולוניאלית, אדגים כיצד תחומים בלתי ניתנים לתרגום הופכים את התרגום לאשליה משיחית. דרך דוגמאות מתוך ספרות הנכבה שנכתבה בערבית אני מבקש להראות כיצד התחומים הבלתי ניתנים לתרגום מוצפים במסמנים לא יציבים ובמצבים אפורתיים של מבוי סתום. למשל, השימוש במילה נכבה אינו עקבי אלא תלוי בהקשר של זמן הכתיבה וזמן התרגום. בערבית אפשר למצוא לבד מנכבה גם את המושגים כארת'ה, הזימה, נכסה ומאסאה. בעברית אפשר למצוא שימוש באסון, בתבוסה, בטרגדיה או בנכבה. גם המסמנים ההיסטוריוגרפיים ומסמני הזמן והמרחב בספרות הנכבה אינם יציבים אלא משתנים תמידית. תובנות אלה מציעות אסטרטגיות תרגום שמתבססות על הטיות זמן מתאימות (למשל זמן הווה מתמשך במקום זמן עבר), על היעזרות בהערות חיצוניות לטקסט ועל שערוב מסוים של העברית. What is translation under asymmetrical conditions of power? How do colonial and theological practices shape the relationships between languages? Drawing on Walter Benjamin, Paul Ricoeur, Jacque Derrida, and postcolonial literature in general, I show how untranslatable texts stemming from such asymmetry result in insurmountable gaps which render the messianic "perfect translation" impossible. Using examples from literature on the Palestinian Naqba, I examine how untranslatable texts (from Arabic to Hebrew) are inflated with unstable signifiers, which themselves are contingent on the time/space aspect of the translation. Using these examples, I demonstrate the extent to which translation from Arabic to Hebrew necessitates peculiar political and aesthetic strategies which are sensitive to colonial and theological conditions.<br>

Abstract: On the occasion of the recent publication of a complete translation into French of Sein und Zeit, the author of the article means to approach the work with a "prejudice of innocence." Three philosophical questions are first treated. Reflection on time introduces the theological debate. For Heidegger, theology, as metaphysics on which it depends, is marked by "the forgetfulness of being." But does not the lack in him of a stand on moral conscience reveal a weakness of his thought on otherness? As for his theory of "concern", because it does not go back to its hebrew sources it fails to make "creatureliness" thinkable. The debate would deserve to be resumed starting from a philosophical analysis of the anamnesis.<br>

Abstract: El objetivo del presente trabajo es constituir el primer aporte en español a los estudios sobre cine documental coreano mediante el análisis comparado de Our School (Kim Myeong Jun, 2006), Cheonggyecheon Medley (Kelvin Kyung Kun Park, 2010) y Annyong Sayonara (Kim Tae Il y Kato Kumiko, 2005), los cuales son estudiados según las propuestas teóricas de Bhabha —mímesis, hibridización y traducción—, con el fin de repensar y reflexionar sobre las diversas y contradictorias maneras en que se desenvuelven los modelos de memoria, olvido e identidad en el cine documental contemporáneo surcoreano que retoman, directa o indirectamente, la temática del colonialismo. The objective of this paper is to make the first contribution in Spanish to Korean documentary film studies through the comparative analysis of Our School (Kim Myeong Jun, 2006), Cheonggyecheon Medley (Kelvin Kyung Kun Park, 2010) and Annyong Sayonara (Kim Tae Il and Kato Kumiko, 2005). These movies will be analyzed by retaking and discussing Bhabha's theoretical framework —mimesis, hybridization and translation— to suggest that South Korean documentary film's past memories conform so a contradictory space of reminiscence in which the pattern of oblivion, collaboration, victims and national identity is reshaped.<br>

Abstract: Pour comprendre la genèse du spinozisme, nous avons misé sur la personnalité libertine cachée du maître en latinité de Spinoza, van den Enden dont Meinsma a fait l'élève du philosophe, occultant ainsi l'importance historique du cercle de v. d. Enden au profit de celui de Spinoza. L'étude du combat politique de v. d. Enden et des libertins français contre Louis XIV nous a révélé les œuvres politiques anonymes du maître de Spinoza : Vrye Politijke Stellingen (t. I : 1665, extraits manuscrits des t. 2 et 3), puis Kort Verhael Van Nieuw Nederlants (1662). Nous redécouvrions par suite le Philedonius (1657). Nous avons établi la filiation directe entre ces œuvres et celles de Spinoza dans leur tentative de donner une traduction profane de la tradition hermético-alchimique. In order to understand the genesis of spinozism, we have relied on the free-thinking and secret personality of Spinoza's master in latinity, v. d. Enden whom Meinsma made his philosophers' disciple, thus concealing the historical importance of v. d. Enden's circle for the benefit of Spinoza's. The study of the political struggle waged by v. d. Enden and by French freethinkers against Louis XIV showed us the anonymous political works of Spinoza's master : Vrye Politijke Stellingen (pt. 1, 1665; mss extracts pts 2 and 3); then Korte Verhael Van Nieuw Nederlants (1662). Thus we rediscovered the Philedonius (1657). We have shown a direct line between these works and those of Spinoza in their attempt to give a lay translation of the secret Alchemical and Hermetic tradition.<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i23730852<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Kontler László<br>
Abstract: This article addresses the methodological issues involved in the study of interlingual translation as an avenue of reception in the history of ideas. In particular, it assesses the possible uses of linguistic contextualism and conceptual history (Begriffsgeschichte) in this endeavour. It argues that both of these approaches have been, or are capable of being, far more sensitive towards the phenomenon of reception and, indeed, this is an area where cross-fertilization between them (often commended in general but rarely if ever in specific terms) is a practical possibility. Perspectives from Rezeptionsgeschichte may provide useful tools for building bridges between them. A few case studies in translation history are then critically examined, and on the basis of the foregoing methodological reflections propositions are made for further refining the approach taken in those case studies.<br>

Abstract: Walter Benjamin's famous "The
Task of the Translator": "Translation is a mode. To comprehend it as a mode one must go
back to the original, for that contains the law governing the translation: its translatability."
Walter Benjamin (1973), 70-1.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917941<br>
Date: 12 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Loevlie Elisabeth M.<br>
Abstract: The story of the Fall inscribes the myth of a fallen language as the absolute other of the original sacred. Hence the dualistic scheme between a fallen materiality and a metaphysical God. This article explores how the death of this God is not merely a secular turn, but the opening of a different, anti-theological, or fallen religiosity that allows us to trace the sacred in unexpected places—also within fallen language. Translation and literature will be explored as instances where language performs its own fallenness— its materiality, arbitrariness and difference—and thereby releases a sacred expression. The essay considers 17th-century theologian Martin de Barcos' letters regarding translation, Derrida's essay 'Des Tours de Babel' and notions of literariness based on Blanchot and Mallarmé.<br>

Journal Title: Discourse Studies<br>
Article Title: Text as action, action as text? Ricoeur, λογοσ and the affirmative search for meaning in the 'universe of discourse'<br>
Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Scott-Baumann Alison<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Article Title: Complex texts: Analysing understanding, explaining and interpreting meanings<br>
Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Wodak Ruth<br>
Abstract: This article discusses different theoretical and methodological approaches in the humanities and social sciences which strive to analyse and understand, interpret and explain texts and discourses in systematic, qualitative ways. After reviewing some of the salient theories in the social sciences (such as objective hermeneutics and critical hermeneutics), I argue that critical discourse studies require a 'trichotomy' consisting of explanation, interpretation and critique. Other approaches such as Ricoeur's 'hermeneutic arc' seem to neglect important structural and material dimensions of context as well as critical self-reflection. Moreover, I argue that much intuitive and non-transparent speculation in Hermeneutics might be transcended if more historical, cultural, linguistic and philological knowledges would be systematically and explicitly integrated into the analysis of text and discourse, in a retroductable manner. The latter possibility is illustrated by applying an interdisciplinary framework to some brief examples (e.g. intercultural and historical translation studies; the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse studies).<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>

Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: The nine responses to my focus article 'Re-constructing Babel: Discourse analysis, hermeneutics and the Interpretive Arc' are cross-disciplinary, as is the article itself. They come from discourse studies (Van Dijk, Billig, Wodak), cognitive science (Tepe, Yeari and Van den Broek, Van Dijk), Old Testament studies (Billig), hermeneutics (Pellauer, Scott-Baumann), history (Gardner) and literature (Pratt). I identify and address five main issues which I see these responses raising for discourse interpretation: the role of author intent and the original sociocultural context in interpretation; principles of translation, particularly in relation to the Babel story; issues of certainty and subjectivism in interpretation, again including the Babel story; the role and limitations of cognitive approaches, and the potential of images like 'unfolding the matter of the text' to be realized in teaching hands-on discourse work; and finally a call to new listening in the encounter with hermeneutics, as a route to freshening the field I like to call Discourse Interpretation.<br>

Introduction and Notes, Cambridge 1907, 388:,,ή δ'έρμηνεία. To express and interpret thought
is the special function of language (διάλεχτος)." Die gleiche Bedeutung hält sich auch sonst
durch. So in der Poetik 1450 b 14 „die Übersetzung des Denkens durch die Worte"; vgl.
zur Stelle Incrim Bywater, Aristotle of the Art ofPoetry, Oxford 1909, S. 175. Auch A. Gudeman,
Aristoteles Peri Poietikes, Berlin und Leipzig 1934, S. 189 mit dem Hinweis auf die hermeneia
als „phonetische Mitteilung" wie die Vogelstimmen in den biologischen Schriften. Aber
auch dort bedeutet hermeneia immer die Mitteilung von etwas. In der ps.-aristotelischen
Rhetorica ad Alexandrum geht es um klare und zivilisierte Ausdrucksfähigkeit (zum Beispiel
1428 a 10, 1435 a 21, 1435 a 4/5, 1436 a 21, 1441 b 22), in der Topik und De Sophisticis
Elenchis um die Art sich vernünftig auszudrücken oder um zweideutige Ausdrucksweise
(zum Beispiel: 139 b 13, 166 b 13). Mit „Deuten" oder „Verstehen" hat die peripatetische
hermeneia wie auch der allgemein klassische Sprachgebrauch nichts zu tun.<br>

Author(s): Kowalewicz Michel Henri<br>
Abstract: Few of the German word creations of modern times were assimilated into other European languages to such an extent as the concept of >Weltanschauung<. The historical reception of the concept in France confirms the principle formulated by Paul Ricœur that asserts the existence of »untranslatable« terms and recommends that we dispense with their translation, and that we make use of such expressions in the original language so as not to distort their content. Why should the notion of >Weltanschauung< have exerted such a strong influence, especially on the French language? The question arises naturally. The translation of >Weltanschauung< into the Polish »światopogląd« is too strongly associated with the tradition of Marxist-Leninist doctrine. It is worth taking stock and systematically working through such issues surrounding the translation of such philosophically important terms. This will help ensure that those key concepts of German philosophy that continue to be important in the Humanities as studied in various European languages, obtain a more uniform and binding form.<br>

Abstract: On slesa in "Suka," see Hiltebeitel, Rethinking the Mahabharata, 306, where
these comments apply also to Fitzgerald's advocacy ("Many Voices," 17, n. 58) of
a "straightforward" translation of the marvel of the mountains in the Suka story
as a sufficient reading. See similarly J. Brockington, Review of Rethinking the
Mahäbhärata, 601-2, on the phrase artham vicintayan in this story which suggests
both "pondering the meaning" and (as I was certainly aware) "keeping in mind
his purpose," but not "no more than" the latter.<br>

Publisher: Presses de Sciences Po<br>
Issue: i24672910<br>
Date: 9 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Mazurel Hervé<br>
Abstract: L'histoire des sensibilités suscite encore une méfiance persistante, avant tout parce que son projet intellectuel demeure mal identifié, parce que l'historiographie a souvent laissé penser que ses origines s'ancraient uniquement dans la continuité du projet de Lucien Febvre et de l'histoire des mentalités à la française. Or, en vérité, celle-ci n'est autre que la traduction historiographique d'un mouvement philosophique beaucoup plus ample et ancien, né du basculement incarné par Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche et Sigmund Freud, ces penseurs du soupçon, qui nous ont appris à repérer derrière les idées, la raison et la conscience, le rôle des désirs et des appétits, le jeu des pulsions et des sentiments. Rendant ainsi l'homme moins transparent à luimême, l'historien du sensible vise, outre à restituer l'historicité de notre vie sensible, à réévaluer la part des affects dans la détermination des conduites humaines. Pour ce faire, il s'appuie également sur la riche nébuleuse des savoirs critiques élaborés ensuite, dans l'Allemagne de la première moitié du 20e siècle, sous les appellations de « psychologie sociale » ou « historique » ou, à la manière nietzschéenne, de « psychologie des profondeurs ». The history of sensibility still continues to elicit suspicion, first and foremost because this intellectual project remains poorly defined, historiography often having led us to believe that its roots stemmed solely from Lucien Febvre's endeavours and the French history of mentalities. And yet in truth, the history of sensibility is nothing less than the historiographical translation of a much broader and older philosophical movement, born of the tipping point provoked by Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. Those great sceptical thinkers taught us to unmask the role of desires, appetites and impulses behind our ideas, reason and consciousness. In addition to recreating the historicity of our lives of sensibility and thus rendering man less transparent to himse~<br>

A further implication of his affinity with Nietzsche is that he is more critical of
Marx and Marxism than is Althusser. See for instance Peter Dews, 'The Nouvelle
Philosophie and Foucault', in Economy and Society, Vol. 8, Number 2 (May 1979),
pp. 131—171. For a more général context see also the equally clear and instructive

Author(s): Seerveld Calvin<br>
Abstract: Cf. George Steiner, A/ter Babel, Aspects of Language and Translation (Oxford Univer-
sity Press, 1975), for perhaps the best comparative analysis of state-of-the-art in translation
theory. George Steiner himself seems to prefer a special sort of interlinear literalist
option (but not 'a word-for-word' transference) that has the translator remain selflessly
submerged within the original tongue, producing a centaur idiom in which one's own
longue takes on a 'deliberate strangeness', and the product becomes virtually an unknown
tongue 'which can transcend the constraints of imprécise objective reference' (pp.307-33).
Steiner approves of Hölderlin's approach, and crédits Chesteron on Du Bellay and Leyris
on Hopkins as superb approximations of the true translation (pp.407-13).<br>

Abstract: Scheler's position is precariously subtle: the "person" is neither exhausted in his "acts"
nor something subsisting through their temporal succession, but, rather, a supra-temporal
being who acts into time and who "is and experiences himself only as a being that executes
acts"; the "whole person is contained in every fully concrete act, and the whole person 'varies' in
and through every act - without being exhausted in his being in any of these acts, and
without 'changing' like a thing in time" (Formalismus, p. 395f. [English translation, p. 385]; see
above, n. 27, for full references).<br>

Article Title: CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY. A REFORMATION PERSPECTIVE<br>
Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i24709683<br>
Date: 1 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Glas Gerrit<br>
Abstract: In the passage at issue Cooper quotes Dooyeweerd via the English translation of Ber-
kouwer (1957). Berkouwer in turn quoted Dooyeweerd's (1940, 181) article on the problem of
time, which does contain the passage about the human soul which "naar het getuigenis van de
Schrift door den tijdelijlten dood niet getroffen wordt, maar ook na de aflegging van het
"lichaam", d.i. van heel den tijdelijken in individualiteits-structuur besloten beslaansvorm, blijft
voortbestaan." But the translation is incorrect! The translators of Berkouwer's book rendered
the passage as follows: "The soul. Scripture shows, is not affected by temporal death, but after
the end of the body (i.e. of all the temporal aspects of man), it continues as a form of existence
with an individuality structure" (Cooper 1989, 251). The Dutch text, Berkouwer (1957, 285,
note 148), quotes Dooyeweerd correctly. In Dooyeweerd the term 'individuality structure'
refers to the body; the translators related it, wrongly, to the soul. It is likely that this has
occasioned Cooper's misunderstanding. The passage should read: "As Scripture testifies, [the
human soul] is not touched by temporal death, but continues to exist even after the shedding
of the 'body', i.e. [the shedding] of the entire temporal, individuality-structure-enclosed form of
existence."<br>

Author(s): GOLDBERG SYLVIE ANNE<br>
Abstract: This article explores the reception of Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi in France in light of the many and diverse reactions his books and lectures engendered at major conferences and meetings. It describes how the American scholar became one of the leading figures among French intellectuals after the first translation of his book Zakhor in 1984 and his first lecture at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in 1987, which resulted in a series of annual lectures over the next ten years. Following the readings of Jacques Derrida, Paul Ricœur, Pierre Vidal-Naquet, and François Furet, among other intellectuals, the eminent standing achieved by Yerushalmi coincided with a special "moment." At a time when doubt was cast on the testimonies of living witnesses and when the words of Holocaust deniers and of members of the French Resistance were treated on equal terms, the politics of memory challenged the status of history and historians. This paper aims to recover the atmosphere of these past decades and to elucidate how Yerushalmi's name has become inseparable from the issues linked with the debates about history and memory.<br>

Author(s): Blond Louis<br>
Abstract: By inquiring into the translatability of Judaism and philosophy, we reawaken an ancient problem that asks after philosophy’s relation with religion:
         What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?Translation is a rejuvenated means of wrestling with this irksome question, which seeks to understand how multiple approaches to meaning and being can exist concurrently or whether any interaction forfeits multiplicity for the primacy of one form over all others. The specific issue that linguistic versions of the problem address is whether or not the languages that Judaism and philosophy speak are separate and distinct and if those distinctions are established on deeper, non-linguistic ground. For this reason, translation not only raises the problem of articulacy and context in interlingual translations, it also alludes to an ontological or metaphysical separation that speaks of different, non-shared worlds. Whether or not a translation theory addresses, repairs or upholds the opposition between religion and philosophy is in question, and translation becomes a vehicle for discussing what Jerusalem has to offer Athens and what Athens has for Jerusalem. In this essay, I examine the translation problem as an attempt to repair or re-gloss the relation between Judaism and philosophy by way of Michael Fagenblat’s recovery of Emmanuel Levinas’ thought in his work,A Covenant of Creatures: Levinas’s Philosophy of Judaism(2010).<br>

Abstract: The paper explores the meaning of conversion for African Christians in South Africa by looking at some of the indigenous terms that have populated the Christian vocabulary. The paper focuses on terms like
         ukuguquka, ukukholwa, ibandla, ikholwa, igqobhoka, inkonzo,andinkolo. These terms are found among people who speak Nguni languages. It shows how they were used in pre-Christian context and traces their evolution in Christian contexts. Research conducted in the Reformed Presbyterian Church, St John’s Apostolic Faith Mission, and Methodist Churches in Cape Town between 1997 and 2001 has indicated that conversion was not a simple religious process but involved diverse political, economic and social aspects. Conversion involved a transformation of an African Christian identity from the margins to the centre. It also involved extensive negotiation of what it means to be Christian through the translation of Christian content into an African idiom. The paper goes through various terms and how their original meanings were discarded for new ones.<br>

Owing to the critical inquiry that anthropology now makes into its own procedures, questions can be raised about the role played by semi-empirical categories, rhetorical phrases and enunciative stances in the formulation of discourses depending on the semiotic triangle.<br>

Abstract: It has become commonplace to describe Machado de Assis's characters and narrators as deeper than those of his contemporaries, and his novels as representations more creatively ambiguous than most literary depictions of nineteenth-century Brazil. In this essay I argue that throughout his novels psychological depth is a function of moral imagination; and a troubled moral imagination is a necessary condition for the literary representation of the modern self. Machado's protagonists are able to fashion the public presentation of their selves by imagining alternatives to their origins, desires, and social predicaments. They have in their pasts a burden they need to overcome, and while doing so they find themselves in conditions of freedom and harm. Evil then arises as a consequence of moral dynamism, in so far as it becomes a project for undoing the other. The genesis of a radical conception of free will and evil in Machado's narratives goes back to his translation of Victor Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea (1866). His concern with a more meticulous characterization of inwardness deepens between Iaiá Garcia (1878) and Dom Casmurro (1899), when adopting the structure of a confessional narrative he arrives at a balance between disguised motives (malice), double chronology (nostalgia), and human life as an unfolding, reversible, and self-aware process (metamorphosis). To frame Machado's strategy for depicting moral change, I take from Augustine's Confessions the suggestion that retrospection is the only way of restoring the identity of someone whose self is marked by his or her sense of dissimilarity with the past. Finally, from Kant and Paul Ricoeur I draw the elements for a further consideration of evil as an invitation to think differently about seeing, judging, and narrating human life.<br>

Author(s): Carlos Claudia<br>
Abstract: Edward Jerningham's "Impenitence" (1800)—a translation of Bossuet's "Sermon du mauvais riche" (1662)—is remarkably dissimilar to its French original. This article investigates the rhetorical reasons behind this discrepancy. These reasons concern the problems of promoting a French model of eloquence in a fiercely anti-French climate and—even more problematic—promoting a text whose main theme is a denunciation of the rich in a period of extreme counter-revolutionary fervor. Jerningham's text shows that in facing potentially resistant readers, the strategies of a translator are those of a rhetor.<br>

Abstract: Social scientists who study peasant groups in Brazil have come across some unfamiliar expressions. In searching for an explanatory analogical key which would make a translation possible, economic and political referents have commonly been used. The author argues that one must take seriously the existence of a 'biblical culture' that cannot be simply reduced to other codes. This is illustrated by the notion of captivity which has usually been taken as refering to authoritarianism, capitalism, expropriation, proletarianization, etc. The author suggests that although contextually all this may be true, the main reference has to do with what Paul Ricoeur has termed the symbolism of evil. Empirical material drawn from his own and other social scientists' researches in the Amazon is used to illustrate this possibility, which seems to bear significant theoretical and political consequences. Symbolism, the notion of text as regards the relation between cultural phenomenon and social conditions, the relation between autonomy and dependence, different notions of time and history are some of the themes that come up either as new perspectives regarding old issues or as subproducts of this line of reasoning. Los científicos sociales que estudian grupos campesinos en Brasil han descubierto expresiones poco usuales para ellos. Buscando una clave explicativa analógica que hiciera posible una traducción, se han usado generalmente ciertos referentes de naturaleza económica y política. El autor argumenta que es necesario tomar en serio la existencia de una 'cultura bíblica,' que no puede ser simplemente reducida a otro código. Eso se ilustra con la noción de cautiverio, que normalmente se entiende como referencia al autoritarismo, al capitalismo, a la expropiación, a la proletarización, etc. El autor sugiere que, aunque todo eso pueda ser verdad contextualmente, la referencia principal tiene que ver con lo que Paul Ricoeur denominara simbolismo del mal, lo que a su vez se articula con ~<br>

Author(s): Noiriel Gérard<br>
Abstract: L'œuvre de Max Weber commence à être mieux connue du public français grâce à la traduction d'un nombre croissant de ses écrits et à la parution d'un grand nombre d'ouvrages le concernant. L'examen de ces publications récentes montre que les polémiques opposant sociologues et philosophes à propos du «vrai» Weber, polémiques qui se sont intensifiées au cours des années 1960, polarisent aujourd'hui encore le débat sur cet auteur. Néanmoins, les nouveaux éclairages concernant «l'épistémologie» wébérienne permettent de mieux cerner le dilemme auquel Weber a été confronté, dilemme qui reste le nôtre: comment un chercheur en sciences sociales peut-il justifier et défendre sa pratique empirique, sans abandonner le terrain des sciences sociales au profit d'une argumentation sur les fondements de la connaissance empruntée aux philosophes néokantiens? Max Weber's work is beginning to enjoy a wider audience in France due to the translation of a growing number of his writings and the publication of many works devoted to him. An examination of these recent publications shows that the polemics opposing sociologists and philosophers with regard to the "real" Weber – arguments that intensified during the 1960s – are still alive today. Nevertheless, the new perspectives on Weberian "epistemology" allow us gain a sharper view of the dilemma that once confronted Weber and continues to confront us: how can a researcher in the social sciences justify and defend his or her empirical practice without abandoning the terrain of the social sciences and shifting to an argument on the foundations of knowledge borrowed from neo-Kantian philosophy?<br>

Author(s): Desrosières Alain<br>
Abstract: Dans le cadre du séminaire Bonheur et Travail qui a débouché sur une enquête de l'Insee, Céline Bessière et Frédérique Houseaux ont pu « suivre des enquêteurs » et tirer de leurs observations de terrain quelques conclusions sur la production de données statistiques. Une passation mouvementée du questionnaire auprès d'un salariéagricole agricole montre l'importance de la situation d'enquête ainsi que celle des malentendus sur les mots utilisés. Les auteurs proposent de s'appuyer sur ces «ratés» de la relation d'enquête pour mettre en lumière le rôle souvent oublié de l'enquêteur. Elles suggèrent enfin de rapprocher enquêteurs et concepteurs et d'utiliser les données produites en gardant à l'esprit le travail de traduction qui a présidé à leur fabrication. Christian Baudelot et Michel Gollac en tirent la conclusion qu'il faut «faire avec» et refusent de renoncer aux gains de connaissance qu'apportent les enquêtes statistiques. Ils plaident qu'à condition de ne pas s'y enfermer, on peut les utiliser pour combattre l'ethnocentrisme même qui a pu présider à leur recueil. Florence Weber s'interroge sur la nature de l'interaction entre enquêteur Insee et enquêté: «relation anonyme et formulaire d'enquête» se conjuguent pour la rapprocher des relations qu'entretiennent d'autres agents subalternes de l'État avec les administrés. En jouant sur la nature des questions posées, on déplace simplement le lieu où se produisent les malentendus, à la fois instructifs et constructifs. Enfin, Alain Desrosières se demande «à quoi sert une enquête». Si les mêmes critiques, formulées depuis des décennies, n'ont jamais fait obstacle à la répétition des enquêtes statistiques, c'est que leur enjeu n'est pas seulement cognitif mais aussi politique. Il faut donc restituer la visée d'usage des enquêtes et les moyens sociaux des produits et des énoncés statistiques. Within the scope of the Happiness and Work seminar that led to an Insee survey, Céline Bessière and Frédérique Houseaux were able t~<br>

It aims to shed light on the mystic-erotic paradigm, which underlies this work, as this paradigm is conceived in both the Judeo-Christian and the Greco-Roman traditions. In addition, attention is paid to questions concerning the interpretation and reception of the biblical text, as outlined in the hermeneutic work of Paul Ricoeur.<br>

Abstract: Here, we should beware of the English translation, which tends to reify the two Chinese
characters 仏教.Literally, they indicate “teachings [of the] Buddha,” or "Buddhist teachings，”
with a further step being their identification with "Buddhism." Like the concept of “religion”
that emerged at the end of the nineteenth century to translate a Western concept, there is a sub-
tle shift between the idea of "Buddhist teachings” and the further use of the same term to indi-
cate "Buddhism."<br>

Publisher: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland<br>
Issue: i330145<br>
Date: 9 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Clifford James<br>
Abstract: Maurice Leenhardt's ethnographic work in New Caledonia spanned nearly half a century, from 1902-1948. The first part of this field research is described and analysed, as background to his later anthropological writings. Leenhardt's specific position as a missionary-ethnographer is discussed, its advantages and disadvantages weighed. A liberal missionary perspective is found, in this case, to be conducive to a portrayal of cultural process. Leenhardt's translation methodology and his relations with key informants are detailed. Transcription, the means by which ethnographic texts are constituted by more than a single subject, is speculatively extended to ethnographic practice generally. Field research may be seen as a collective, reciprocal endeavour through which textualised translations are made. This viewpoint calls into question common notions of description, interpretation and authorship in the writing of ethnography.<br>

Article Title: Sealing Signs and the Art of Transcribing in the Vierzon Cartulary<br>
Publisher: College Art Association of America<br>
Issue: i354373<br>
Date: 12 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Stock Robert A.<br>
Abstract: Of the many surviving Romanesque cartularies, very few are illuminated. After reviewing general considerations of the oral, textual, and visual elements at play in these works, this paper then focuses on the Vierzon Cartulary, particularly on the processes of its charters' transcription to codex. Specifically, this paper argues the performative role of the scribe and illuminator, who, by their transformation of the mise-en-page, appropriation of papal notarial authority, and translation of sealing practice, participated in a new diplomatic ceremony of conveyance. This paper advances a reconsideration of text-image relations to account for ritual performance, both actual and symbolic.<br>

Abstract: Recent work on conventional metaphor together with reinterpretations of classic studies of "soul substance" and mana are examined to assess the dangers of overinterpretation--the attribution of nonexistent theologies and metaphysics--by ethnographers. In our project of cultural translation, are we prone to attribute deeper salience to other peoples' way of talk than they in fact imply?<br>

Abstract: This paper takes up Richard Kearney's work The God Who May Be, specifically in the context of postmodern debates concerning epistemological claims regarding the other. Kearney's hermeneutics of religion attempts to forge a middle path between ontotheological philosophies of religion and various quasi-religious manifestations of postmodernism; however, my main concern is to address certain points of disagreement between Kearney and proponents of a deconstructive "religion without religion" principally Jacques Derrida and John D. Caputo. The main issue at stake is just how other God is, which is itself a specific case of a broader question concerning otherness per se. Caputo et al. claim that religious assertions about God are fundamentally undecidable, which means that they are "infinitely translatable" and "substitutable," that we can never tell what is a translation of what, but the ultimate point is that it "does not matter" The undecidable nature of religious claims includes the very claim that religion is a discourse about God, which is why deconstructive religion without religion is a messianic hope for "the impossible" devoid of any content. Kearney objects that such radical undecidability leaves us lost in the desert ofkhora with no way to distinguish, even imperfectly and provisionally, between God and Satan, good and evil, the widow and the terrorist. In this paper I claim that Kearney succeeds in finding this via tertia between the Scylla of dogmatism and the Charybdis of complete indeterminacy by thinking God in two important ways: as persona-prosopon (which avoids confusing God with khora or monstrosity) and as posse (which keeps us from dogmatism). /// O presente artigo toma em particular consideração a obra de Richard Kearney The God Who May Be, especificamente no contexto dos debates pós-modernos acerca do estatuto epistemológico da alteridade. A abordagem hermeneutica que Kearney faz da religião procura estabelecer um caminho médio entre as filosofia~<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we use concepts from actor-network theory (ANT) to interpret the sequence of events that led to business process change (BPC) failure at a telecommunications company in the United States. Through our intensive examination of the BPC initiative, we find that a number of issues suggested by ANT, such as errors in problematization, parallel translation, betrayal, and irreversible inscription of interests, contributed significantly to the failure. We provide nine abstraction statements capturing the essence of our findings in a concrete form. The larger implication of our study is that, for sociotechnical phenomena such as BPC with significant political components, an ANT-informed understanding can enable practitioners to better anticipate and cope with emergent complexities.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i383702<br>
Date: 2 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): ZizekAbstract: Arguing that without a differentiated and relational notion of the cultural, the social sciences would he crippled, reducing social action to notions of pure instrumentality, in this article, I trace the growth of cultural analysis from the beginnings of modern anthropology to the present as a layered set of experimental systems whose differential lenses create epistemic objects with increasing precision and differential focus and resolution. Arguing that culture is not a variable-culture is relational, it is elsewhere or in passage, it is where meaning is woven and renewed, often through gaps and silences, and forces beyond the conscious control of individuals, and yet the space where individual and institutional social responsibility and ethical struggle take place-I name culture as a set of central anthropological forms of knowledge grounding human beings' self-understandings. The challenge of cultural analysis is to develop translation and mediation tools for helping make visible the differences of interests, access, power, needs, desires, and philosophical perspective. In particular, as we begin to face new kinds of ethical dilemmas stemming from developments in biotechnologies, expansive information and image databases, and ecological interactions, we are challenged to develop differentiated cultural analyses that can help articulate new social institutions for an evolving civil society.<br>

Abstract: Dans un contexte d'utilisation croissante des comparaisons internationales par les instances politiques à des fins de pilotage des systèmes éducatifs, par le biais notamment de rétablissement de normes de compétences et donc d'évaluation en vue de l'introduction de réformes, cette contribution entend d'abord réitérer la nécessaire distinction, opérée par Max Weber dès 1922, entre l'entreprise scientifique et l'action politique, mais aussi et surtout rappeler le principe de séparation et de médiation dont relève la démarche comparative en éducation. Les concepts qui composent une langue, circulent et s'imposent dans un monde social renvoient à une histoire, à des usages dynamiques, et sont culturellement enracinés. Négliger cet ancrage social et culturel des mots expose à la construction de la comparabilité sur de seules équivalences fonctionnelles; bien que les pressions en ce sens soient fortes, c'est probablement le moyen le plus sûr de comparer l'incomparable (Marcel Détienne). La rationalité purement instrumentale qui favorise la diffusion de tels cadres ou schémas interprétatifs paraît en effet indifférente aux questions du sens et de la culture, outre qu'elle est irrationnelle sur le plan axiologique, si l'on suit Weber. L'étrangeté, si ce n'est l'altérité, tend à s'y effacer. On se demandera donc quels enjeux impose désormais au comparatiste l'illusion de la spontanéité de la traduction réduite à une équivalence fonctionnelle. Dans la responsabilité de médiation qui incombe au chercheur, c'est à un travail de clarification et d'intercompréhension (inspiré de Taylor) qu'invite la recherche, substituant à la standardisation des mots l'éclairage critique des variations semiotiques que génère leur usage. Governments are making increasing use of international comparisons as a tool to run and reform education systems, through the establishment of competency norms and assessment standards. In light of this trend, this paper wishes not only to reiterate the crucial d~<br>

Abstract: Cette réflexion s'inscrit dans l'héritage de Paul Ricœur, à la recherche d'une philosophie de la traduction. Langage, langues, traduction entrant dans le jeu du processus de la constitution du sens, la traduction devient le moment privilégié d'une reconstruction de l'unité plurielle du discours humain et ouvre la voie à une éthique de l'hospitalité langagière et de la convivialité. Le don de la langue et des langues introduit un élément de gratuité qui corrige l'obsession contemporaine pour la marchandisation généralisée des mondes vitaux et laisse entrevoir un possible fondement non violent du lien social dans une perspective de solidarité et de sollicitude pour les personnes concrètes. Je propose d'établir une relation entre le don des langues en tant qu'élément constitutif de la communauté des parlants et la dette de l'hospitalité langagière impliquant une forme de responsabilité envers les autres à la fois spécifique et exemplaire. Au don gratuit de la langue et des langues qui nous permet d'accéder au monde et de nous rencontrer avec autrui, en réalisant entièrement nous-mêmes, correspond la dette d'exercer et de développer notre humanité dans le langage et à travers le langage. This study reflects on the philosophy of translation in light of the heritage of Paul Ricœur. Language, languages and translation all belong to the process of constitution of sense and here translation is of particular importance for the reconstitution of the plurality of human discourse in its unity and opens the way to an ethics of linguistic hospitality and sociability. The gift of language and of languages introduces an element of gratuity to correct the contemporary obsession with the general commercialization of the life world and suggests a possible non-violent foundation for the social bond in the perspective of solidarity and sollicitude for concrete persons. I propose to establish a relation between the gift of languages as a constitutive element of the community of speakers a~<br>

Abstract: Metaphors are expressions in artificial, contrived, alien languages, and we understand metaphors by constructing translation schemes linking our natural, literal languages to these theoretically contrived metaphorical languages. The relation between a literal natural language and a metaphorical contrived language is like the relationship between a natively known language and a system of subsequently acquired languages etymologically emerging from that basic natural language. This model for understanding metaphorically contrived language is kin to the familiar model explaining how speakers of a language such as Latin may come to decipher a language like Spanish through projecting to Spanish what they know of Latin without the aid of a translation manual. A metaphor is, thus, seen as a sentence in a nonnatural language, itself derived from and at least partially translatable with the natural, literal language of the metaphor's author or audience. Les métaphores sont des expressions relevant de langues artificielles, construites, étrangères et nous les comprenons en construisant des schémas de traduction reliant notre langue naturelle littérale à ces langues métaphoriques théoriquement construites. La relation entre une langue naturelle littérale et une langue métaphorique construite est analogue à la relation entre une langue acquise primitivement et un système de langues apprises ensuite et qui dérivent étymologiquement de cette langue de base. Ce modèle, qui permet de comprendre un langage métaphorique construit, est apparenté au modèle familier expliquant comment les gens qui possèdent une langue telle que le latin arrivent à déchiffrer une langue telle que l'espagnol en projetant sur l'espagnol ce qu'ils savent du latin sans recourir à un dictionnaire. Une métaphore est donc considérée comme une phrase d'une langue non naturelle, dérivée elle-même de et au moins en partie traductible dans la langue naturelle littérale de l'auteur de la métaphore ou de ses lecteurs~<br>

Author(s): GRONDIN Jean<br>
Abstract: La pensée de Hans-Georg Gadamer veut jeter un pont entre les deux périodes de la philosophie heideggérienne en développant les conséquences herméneutiques de l'expérience du destin de l'être. Ce destin en vient à se réfléchir dans une « conscience du travail de l'histoire ». Par cette expression il est possible de donner une traduction adéquate du « wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewußtsein ». Le problème herméneutique de la vérité peut donc être posé sur le fondement de la finitude et de l'histoiricité de la compréhension. L'expérience de la vérité est maintenant comprise comme un πάθος qui s'inscrit dans la ποίησις, la créativité poétisante du travail de l'histoire. L'aspect créateur d'une vérité qui affirme sa finitude permet d'établir un lien entre les philosophies herméneutiques de Gadamer et de Paul Ricœur. Hans-Georg Gadamer's thinking aims at bridging the gap between the two stages of Heidegger's philosophy by developing the hermeneutical consequences entailed in the experience of the destiny of being. This destiny comes to a reflection of itself in a « consciousness of the work of history ». By this expression it is possible to give an adequate translation of the « wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewusstsein ». The hermeneutical problem of truth can thus be posed on the basis of the finitude and historicity of undersstanding. The experience of truth is now understood as a πάθος inscribed in the ποίησις, the « poetizing » creativity of the « work of history ». The creative aspect of a truth that affirms its own finitude enables one to establish a link between the hermeneutical philosophies of Gadamer and Paul Ricœur.<br>

Author(s): JERVOLINO DOMENICO<br>
Abstract: Cet article offre une vision globale de l'œuvre de Ricœur, l'auteur proposant d'y lire une logique de développement en spirale, parce que dans les ouvrages les plus tardifs du philosophe nous trouvons un retour de la recherche sur la volonté — inscrite dans le cadre d'une anthropologie philosophique — qui avait inspiré son projet de jeunesse. Mouvement en spirale, et non retour circulaire aux origines, car entre le début et la fin il n'y a pas coïncidence mais enrichissement après un long détour à travers l'univers du langage. Ce détour — selon l'hypothèse de travail de l'auteur — progresse à travers trois paradigmes: symbole, texte et traduction. Dans la traduction travaillent le propre et l'étranger, le soi et l'autre, l'autre que nous retrouvons en nous et qui ne se réduit pas à l'altérité de l'autre homme. Un concept pluriel d'humanité — qui est pourtant une — y est à l'oeuvre. Le travail jamais accompli de la traduction suggère enfin l'idée d'une herméneutique de l'inachèvement. This article offers a global vision of Ricœur's work, in which the author suggests the existence of a spiral development, insofar as in the most recent works we find a return to the same research on the will — within the context of a philosophical anthropology — that inspired the project of Ricœur's youthful years. Spiral movement and not circular return to the origin, because the beginning and the end do not coincide but rather enrich one another, after a long detour of many decades through the universe of language. This detour — according to author's working hypothesis — has progressively developed through three paradigms: symbol, text and translation. In translation, what is at work is the familiar and the foreign, the self and the other, the other that we find in ourselves and that cannot be reduced to the otherness of the other man. In translation we find a plural concept of humanity, which is nevertheless one. The never complete work of translation suggests ultimately the idea of ~<br>

Author(s): DÉLOYE YVES<br>
Abstract: S'appuyant sur l'histoire électorale française, l'article tend à établir que l'appréhension traditionnelle de la notion de compétence politique autonomise par trop cette dernière d'autres matrices sociales, culturelles ou religieuses qui contribuent pourtant à forger l'Opinion que se font les citoyens au moment des élections. Parce qu'il privilégie l'échelle des acteurs et celle des communautés locales, parce qu'il partage le souci de restituer les logiques de mobilisation et de participation électorales, et donc de retrouver les formes différenciées de politisation(s) des citoyens, le regard socio-historique favorise le renouvellement des paradigmes susceptibles de rendre compte des mécanismes de production sociale de la compétence à opiner « politiquement ». Au paradigme de la domination privilégié, on associera ici celui de la « traduction » susceptible de penser la politisation en termes d'échanges et de transferts culturels. Based on French electoral history, the article tends to establish that the traditional apprehension of the notion of political competence exaggerates its autonomy from the other social, cultural or religious matrices which contribute to forging citizens' opinions at the time of the elections. Because it privileges the level of the actors and that of the local communities, because it shares the concern to restore the logics of mobilization and electoral turnout, and thus to find the various familiar forms of politicization of the citizens, the socio-historical approach facilitates the renewal of paradigms able to account for the mechanisms of social production of « political » beliefs. To the paradigm of privileged domination, we associate that of the « translation » making it possible to account for politicization in terms of exchanges and cultural transfers.<br>

Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
Issue: i40123173<br>
Date: 11 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Briggs Kate<br>
Abstract: This article argues for a definition of translation as a form of writing under constraint. Quite straightforwardly, the translator must write the original text again in a language other than the one in which it was originally composed. Both inhibiting and enabling, that restriction is also translation's resource, ensuring its distinctiveness as a writing practice and providing the key to its unique transformative possibilities. Like lipogrammatical writing, translation is inaugurated by its constraint. The article explores the affinity between translation and the lipogram with reference to Georges Perec's La Disparition, where the prohibition of the letter e initiates a peculiarly inventive kind of writing. Peculiarly inventive, because the effects generated by writing without a given letter of the alphabet, or by writing a given text again in another, altogether different, language, are essentially unprogrammable: we do not know what is going to happen.<br>

Author(s): VEROLI PATRIZIA<br>
Abstract: Serge Lifar built his career during the 1930s, a decade crucial to understanding his 'années noires'-or 'black years', as the French historian Henry Rousso called the period of the German occupation of Paris (1940—1944). Lifar's powerful and respected position at the Paris Opéra, the social connections he had built and maintained and the psychological impact of exile: all these elements help clarify Lifar's accommodating attitude towards the German occupants of his adopted city. During the 1930s Lifar came to be accepted in French intellectual society as the 'heir' of Serge Diaghilev. Through his publications he made a powerful contribution to the process by which Diaghilev's Ballets Russes assumed its paramount position in the development of modern ballet, a process set in motion by the impresario himself. Lifar played this role chiefly in France. In the English-speaking world, where relatively few of his books appeared in translation, other writers served to canonise the Diaghilev endeavour, albeit for somewhat different ends. A list of Lifar's publications in Russian and other languages (French above all) displays the growing influence of his actions and authority, the power of his connections (inherited primarily from Diaghilev), and his relentless will to overcome the problems of emigration as he secured not only success as a dancer and choreograph but also a public reputation as an intellectual. The recent discovery of new evidence has led to the identification of the respected Pushkin authority Modeste Hofmann as the writer whose unacknowledged work enabled Lifar to establish himself as an historian. This evidence, provided by Hofmann's grandsons André and Vladimir Hofmann, raises serious questions about the authority of Lifar's books. An interplay of subjective relationships is woven into the texture of these narratives in which survival and ambition, a paternal attitude and filial respect, exist in constant tension. Neither the making of these books nor the~<br>

Abstract: In this article, the author does a reading of the narratives concerning Guatemalan Indian Rigoberta Menchú, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992. The first part analyzes the way in which oral history turns to binary relations like public and private or text and context. In the second part, Claudia de Urna Costa concentrates on problems arising in the production and translation of cultural diversities and once again reinforces binary oppositions like the First and Third Worlds. L'auteur fait une lecture des narratives sur Rigoberta Menchú, indienne guatémaitèque, Prix Nobel de la Paix en 1992. Dans la première partie de l'article, Claudia de Lima Costa analyse la façon par laquelle l'histoire orale se tourne vers les relations binaires telles que publique et privé, texte et contexte. Dans la deuxième partie, elle s'Interroge sur les problèmes de production et traduction des diversités culturelles et, à nouveau, renforce les oppositions binaires comme Premier et Tiers-Monde.<br>

Abstract: Pour décrire les moyens dont dispose l'individu pour se constituer en personne (partagée entre l'identité du caractère, l'idem, et le soi plus personnel et moral de l 'ipse), Paul Ricœur, dans Soi-même comme un autre (Paris, Seuil 1990), emprunte aux linguistes deux ensembles conceptuels: les références identifiantes (noms propres) et les actes d'autodésignation du je. Mais, par ce double biais, la pragmatique linguistique conduirait, selon lui, à une impasse, éludant finalement la question du qui? C'est oublier que, dans l'énonciation, le je lui-même acquiert une certaine épaisseur sémantique. Une poésie mimétique d'action comme la poésie lyrique grecque montre le rôle que peut jouer dans la constitution du moi une identité énonciative collective, qui inscrit d'emblée la dialectique entre l'idem et l'ipse dans le rapport avec les autres, sans référence ni métaphysique ni théologique. To describe the means the individual has for establishing personhood (between character identity, the idem, and the more personnel and moral self of the ipse), Paul Ricoeur, in Oneself as Another (English translation 1992), borrows two conceptual ensembles from linguistics: the identifying references (proper nouns) and the self-designating acts of the self. But, according to him, by taking this double bias, linguistic pragmatics leads to an impasse by finally eluding the question "who". This is to forget that in enunciation, the very self acquires a certain semantic depth. A mimetic poetry of action, like Greek lyrical poetry, shows the role that can be played in the constitution of the self by a collectively enunciated identity, which automatically sets the dialectic between the idem and the ipse in relation to others, without metaphysical or theological reference.<br>

Publisher: American University in Cairo. Department of English and Comparative Literature<br>
Issue: i222581<br>
Date: 1 1, 1967<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Nabila<br>
Abstract: The "Myth of Creation" in its East African formulation is the central chapter in a book entitled, The Sacred Meadows, by an Egyptian anthropologist who did his field work in the early seventies among the Lamu community in Kenya on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The translator, in her own introduction to the translation, presents the outline of the book and provides the geographical and cultural context of the community in question. The author, in this translated chapter, sets out by exposing his theoretical position which combines both Structuralism and Functionalism. Insights from Claude Lévi-Strauss and Bronislaw Malinowski as well as those of Paul Ricoeur and Victor Turner join to develop the author's notion of myth and its symbolic mode. Then the text of the myth, in its Lamuan formulation, is narrated, followed by a close reading and analysis of its binary oppositions, mediating terms, and the underlying existential contradiction at its crux. Angels, jinn, light, fire, earth, wind, water, Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Satan, serpent, etc. are the agents of this sacred narrative and cosmic drama. The textual unfolding of the myth is followed by an analysis, which makes use of the structural method and explores the semantic connotations of Swahili words and idioms to explain the logic of the symbolic exchange and the rigor of thought. The themes of unity and multiplicity and their different combinations are delineated in this analysis and the repetitions and their relation to transcendence are explained.<br>

Abstract: For both Levinas and Derrida, the practice of philosophy, understood as commentary by the former and deconstruction by the latter, was founded on borrowing terms from other languages and finding their equivalents in French. This argument is developed through a discussion of two texts, Levinas's early Talmudic reading, “The Temptation of Temptation,” and Derrida's deconstruction of
         The Merchant of Venicein “What Is a ‘Relevant’ Translation?” This essay shows how translated terms are interwoven into these texts. It also shows that translation is essential to Levinas's and Derrida's creative conceptualization, and to the performativity of their philosophies, meaning that Levinas and Derrida open their language to other languages in order to create concepts. It finally argues that in both Derrida and Levinas the question of the limits of translation, namely, of the moment in which translation becomes conversion, is left open.<br>

Abstract: This article examines Jean Hatzfeld's
         Machete Season: The Killers in Rwanda Speak, a collection of testimonials by perpetrators of the genocide in Rwanda. While surveying popular representations of killers in Rwanda, circulating theories about the 1994 genocide and the veracity of these killers' accounts, this article also investigates the production, edition, and translation of these killers' interviews. In particular, it focuses on Jean Hatzfeld's role as editor of these killers' testimonies and Innocent Rwililiza's position as translatorinterviewer. Contextualizing elements missing from these interviews——namely, concepts from Rwandan language, history, and culture, as well as broader psychosocial dimensions both pre- and post-genocide——this article problematizes Hatzfeld's depiction of these ““ordinary killers.””<br>

Abstract: But despite its humor, de la Torre's piece frames a serious response to the complex legacy of Argentina's dirty war and the dispersions of many sorts that it caused. The whole Listserv dialogue is initiated because of Mercedes Correche's search for her mother, Mónica de la Torre, who was most likely “disappeared” by the Argentine dictatorship in 1977 “after being accused of subversive activities.” The Argentine dictatorship specialized in rhetorically camouflaging its actions against citizens with layers of euphemism, such that the regime itself was referred to as a “special process,” and its method of kidnapping, torturing, and killing its enemies was called “disappearing” them. The dictatorship was marked by “censorship of texts and the persecution of people, when even the appearance of thinking was suspicious.”
         
               The national sense of language changed between 1976 and 1983: “Uncertainty, suspicion, oblique broaching of discourse, masking, fracturing, displacement of the great issues to one's own subjectivity, the search for a center located outside the immediate social milieu: such are the recurrent terms that critics use to identify these years of transition which, now, with the mediation of time, serve well to reflect the spirit of Argentine society during the years of dictatorship.”108
            
               Crucially, de la Torre's narrator rewrites herself as a collectivity. The text offers a parable of multiple subjectivity and generic mixing, in which poems are born among layers of misdirection, and translation is always imperfect. A very real need to locate origins in a place where origins have been violently erased come together in the poetics of “Doubles,” which both acknowledges and resists origins. The literal search for origins, or lineage, coexists with the poet's resistance to the concept of authenticity. By retelling this encounter, de la Torre foregrounds the problem that Roberto Schwarz had pointedly articulated in109~<br>

Abstract: Having just devoted a chapter to “Derrida's Theologies of Translation” (228–46), Apter follows this list with a further exegesis of Derrida's seminal role in highlighting the issue of translation in deconstructive thought (249–53). She then moves on to discuss Abdelfattah Kilito's elegantly ironic book Lan tatakallana lughati (Thou Shalt Not Speak My Language Syracuse, 2006)—a work whose linguistic interdiction hasn't prevented it from receiving rapid translations into French and English—before closing the chapter with further comments on Derrida. It is refreshing finally to find some discussion of a theorist based outside Paris or the United States, and yet like many Moroccan intellectuals, Kilito does much of his critical writing in French, appearing in such journals as
      Poétique; he recently published in Paris a kind of sequel to his 2002 volume,Je parle toutes les langues, mais en arabe(Actes Sud, 2013). In discussing the work of a Moroccan theorist who holds a PhD from the Sorbonne, recipient in 1996 of the Prix du rayonnement de la langue française of the Académie Française, Apter has not moved so far from the Rive Gauche after all.<br>

Abstract: The movement from
            thentonow, so far as ethics and philosophy of religion are concerned, can be largely told in relation to five proper names: Ricoeur, Levinas, Kierkegaard, Derrida, and Marion. Paul Ricoeur was already part ofthen, but as he kept writing, so broadly and so deeply, he became more and more an inescapable part of thenow. The problem is that he did this in so many different ways that he could easily take up all my time and space and then some. Not just in such collections asThinking BiblicallyandFiguring the Sacredbut whenever he wrote about virtually anything, be it time and narrative, memory, metaphor, interpretation, translation, ideology, evil, justice, the self (as other), recognition, or whatever, he provoked our thought about either ethics or religion or both. So, with gratitude and apologies, I'll leave him as the one who has shaped ournow, so far as ethics and religion are concerned, in more different but deep ways than anyone else. He is in any case more important for the first revolution than for the second.<br>

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur specifies “refiguration” as the action of mimesis
         3. This moment, he explains, corresponds with the stage of the interpretive process that Gadamer calls “application” and that Ricoeur has referred to as “appropriation” (Gadamer1998, 30–31, 307–11; Ricoeur 2007, 37, 118). The reader is the focal agent at this phase of the agential spiral. Because of her role in this phase, the reader is indeed essential to the entire threefold process: “Without the reader who accompanies it, there is no configuring act at work in the text; and without a reader to appropriate it, there is no world unfolded before the text” (1985, 2:164). The reader must “refigure” the work by reading it and translating it back into the world in which he exists. In this sense, “the act of reading is … the operator that joins mimesis3to mimesis2” (1985, 2:77).
               Adapting Aristotle's work from the11
            Poeticsand theRhetoric, Ricoeur explains that the phase of mimesis3creates a crucial space for the translation of the imagined world of the work into the actual world of the reader—or, as Ricoeur calls it, the world of reference (1984, 1:71). From this vantage point, a narrative text can be understood as having certain, though not specific, effects on the world outside of language. Texts invite readers to envision a possible world that can be actualized in the material world through their action.<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Ernst Bloch has gained attention in English-speaking scholarship on utopia lately because of translation of his works. Bloch's three-volume utopian work
         The Principle of Hope(trans. 1986) claims to reestablish a lost Marxist idea of utopia. His description of the idea, however, proves to be a mixture of liberal-humanist and Marxist approaches. In particular, he develops an idea of utopia that stems from mysticism and the romantic tradition. This definition of utopia is much broader than what might be encompassed by a concept of utopia in rhetorical theory. It is social dreaming in the broadest sense, including daydreams, myths, fairy tales, and fantastic traveler's tales in addition to the literary utopias that Mannheim had rejected for his socialist utopian categories. As in Ricoeur, however, the emphasis on a mediated, symbolic realm is clear, and Bloch describes the creative arts, literature, music, and architecture as important vehicles for utopia in any given age. However, what is utopian is not just a literary genre but, rather, a function within these arts.<br>

Abstract: Joyce reminds us that this explicit admission of the counterfeit nature of the Utopian project has lain at the heart of literary manifestations of “Utopia” since Thomas More coined that self-emptying term—or indeed since More dubbed his perfection of all parliaments (in his Latin original)
         Mentiranus—or (in Turner's translation)Lietalk.
               The true131
            Eutopiais, by contrast, a realm of absolute truth: it is the land of Swift's Houyhnhnms, who have “no word … to express lying or falsehood.”
               Theirs is a civilization without words for132
            powerorgovernment—one that has attained such perfection that the only topic remaining to debate at its quadrennial assembly is “whether the Yahoos should be exterminated from the face of the earth.”

Abstract: Liudmila Ulitskaia’s 2006 novel, Daniel’ Shtain, pervodchik (Daniel Stein, Translator), explores the experience of the Russian-speaking diaspora in the aftermath of World War II through a focus on Jewish immigrants in Israel who convert to Christianity. The novel’s treatment of the divisive topic of Jewish to Christian conversion is enabled by the author’s reliance on the theoretical and allegorical values of translation. Evoking advancements in twentieth-century translation studies through its broad treatment of translation and critique of the investment in the notion of fidelity to the original, be it language or identity, the novel advocates for the acceptance of the transformations and the resulting hybridity of the Jewish diasporic self. Daniel Stein, Translator specifically highlights the influence of the Soviet nationalities policies and the Nazi occupation of eastern Europe on the identity metamorphoses of Soviet Jews. By promoting the legitimacy of the expressions of Jewish identity by immigrants from the USSR through her novel, Ulitskaia proposes an expanded and anti-essentialist view of Jewish identity that would include individuals traditionally viewed as apostates.<br>

Abstract: This article begins by considering the diverse ways in which Gilberto Freyre used his key concept of mesticagem and the different cultural fields to which he extended it — architecture, cuisine, sport, literature, urban studies, sociology and even sex. Noting the alternative concepts or metaphors in Freyre’s work — interpenetration, mixture, hybridity and so on — it goes on to discuss a metaphor that he did not use, although it has become popular since his time, ‘cultural translation’. A brief history of the idea of cultural translation and a consideration of its strengths and weaknesses leads to a casestudy of both the literal and the metaphorical translation of the western concept of liberty to Japan after the imperial restoration of 1868.<br>
