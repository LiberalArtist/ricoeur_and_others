  Abstract: Inspired by the monomyth of the hero’s path,
                  Station Islandassumes self-consciously what is at the heart of Heaney’s work: the quest for self-definition. His book of changes includes the big-eyed Narcissus of the early poems, the poetic archeologist who delves into the word-hoard to discover new regions of his cultural and personal dark, and the inner emigré who rhymes his journey with paradigmatic figures of the tradition. Each book is a new trial of the self to be mastered before he can make a new beginning. Yet, as he observes, “the difficulty comes when what has happened between the<br>

  Author(s) Hamacher Werner<br>
  Abstract: At intervals of about ten years, Levinas devoted articles to Spinoza.¹ At first glance, these readings stand out for their critical, indeed, polemical tone. In his 1955 “The Case of Spinoza” Levinas accepts Jacob Gordin’s summary verdict: “Spinoza was guilty of betrayal [
                  il existe une trahison de Spinoza]¹ (108 / 155–56). Indeed, in this text we find an even more startling hypothesis, that, by “proposing that Spinoza’s trial be reopened,” Israel’s founding father, David Ben-Gurion, was, Levinas surmises, “seeking to question—more effectively than the missionaries installed in Israel—the great certainty of our history; which ultimately, for Mr.<br>

  Abstract: The fate of both Jesus and the temple is—at least in the eyes of some early Christians—clearly consolidated into one large-scale event. John 2:21 says that, when Jesus spoke of the coming destruction of the temple, he was speaking of his own body. Witnesses at his trial accused him of forecasting the end of the temple—which in fact occurred some forty years later. It seems reasonable to conclude that both the cross and the temple ruins after 70 CE were seen as a dual inauguration of a new and final chapter in Israel’s history. True, the accusation<br>

  Author(s) Tan Justin<br>
  Abstract: The story of the relationship between Christianity and China is a long one (about 1500 years long!), a story of trial and error, of attempts, partial successes, failures and new beginnings. The last decade of the twentieth century seemed to mark one of these new beginnings. The emergence of a peculiar phenomenon in Chinese academia, namely ‘Christian Studies’, and a group of scholars called ‘cultural Christians’, sparked hope of a new cultural season for Christianity in China, a renewed hope for an inculturated Christianity, or more specifically for an in culturated theology. As London-based China watcher, Edmond Tang, says: ‘It<br>

  Author(s) Just Felix<br>
  Abstract: Despite a general preference for the Synoptic Gospels, several features of John’s narrative have often commanded a certain historical respect: the lengthier ministry and its wider geographical location, the more complex relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist, the date of the crucifixion, and the passage that concerns us now—John’s Jewish interrogation of Jesus (Smith 1993, 252–67). C. H. Dodd argued in 1963 that John’s “account of the interrogation is drawn from some source, almost certainly oral, which was well informed about the situation at the time, and had contact with the Jewish tradition about the trial and<br>

  Abstract: The angry and confused discourse about American race relations that followed the O. J.

  Abstract: When Hannah Arendt covered the trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann on behalf of
                  The New Yorker, her account evoked an enormous public response. Not only did she, in the eyes of her critics, blame Jews for complicity with Nazi authorities, she also cast Eichmann in a sympathetic light. Yet, these concerns partially obscured the philosophical force of her argument. How does someone so average become so evil? This final chapter uses Arendt’s depiction of Eichmann to establish a “negative” of an attentive, responsible self. Specifically, Arendt’s Eichmann personifies an ideal that is the opposite of Weil’s attentive self,¹<br>

As already noted, I adapted this notion from J. D. Austin’s “performative utterances,” utterances that, by Austin’s own definition, do not merely report about or stimulate an act but are the very execution of the act itself, such as when someone pledges “I do” in a marriage ceremony or is pronounced “Guilty!” at a trial.¹ The celebratory wedding or the courtroom drama are highly ritualized institutions in modern society, and<br>

One supremely gifted in the creation of memorable dramatic characters, the other skilled in free indirect discourse, and in the first person narrative.

  Abstract: In Greek myth the youthful hero’s initiatory passage from adolescence to adulthood often has a double component: martial deeds (rivalry with or imitation of the father) and a sexual adventure, trial, or temptation. Familiar examples, with success (overt or implicit) in both areas, are the stories of Bellerophon, Peleus, Meleager, Telemachus, Theseus (in Bacchylides 17) and in displaced form the tales of Orestes and Perseus. Failures include Actaeon, Adonis, Hylas, Pentheus, and the “flower children,” Narcissus, Hyacinthus, and Cyparissus. The myth of Theseus (along with that of Perseus) is the success story par excellence.¹ This pattern is still present in<br>

  Publisher: University of Hawai'i Press<br>
  Author(s): Saito Hiro<br>
  Abstract: Seventy years have passed since the end of the Asia-Pacific War, yet Japan remains embroiled in controversy with its neighbors over the war’s commemoration. Among the many points of contention between Japan, China, and South Korea are interpretations of the Tokyo War Crimes Trial, apologies and compensation for foreign victims of Japanese aggression, prime ministerial visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, and the war’s portrayal in textbooks. Collectively, these controversies have come to be called the “history problem." But why has the problem become so intractable? Can it ever be resolved, and if so, how? To answer these questions, Hiro Saito mobilizes the sociology of collective memory and social movements, political theories of apology and reconciliation, psychological research on intergroup conflict, and philosophical reflections on memory and history.<br>

  Abstract: THE CLOSING ARGUMENTS of criminal trials in the United States are both a persuasive and an argumentative genre in which two lawyers take the same defendant, victim, witnesses, and evidence and use their linguistic and communicative skills to create opposing discourses that are intended to make the jurors decide in their side’s favor. In these discourses, lawyers frequently call upon the words or voices (Bakhtin 1981) of others such as witnesses, the law, and cultural products such as the Bible.

                  Inherit the Wind (1960). Here, we think, reason and science ran rings around obscurantism and faith, and that victory marked the end of the Bible’s credibility as an infallible source of divine wisdom. While obviously this did not mark the end of religion, it set strict limits to the scope of religion’s claims, particularly in the public sphere. Religion,<br>

  Abstract: Writing in the wake of the furor over her account of the Eichmann trial, Hannah Arendt reflects on why truth and politics are, in her words, “on rather bad terms.”¹ Her analysis rests on dividing truth into two different types. The first type, rational truth, is the subject of mathematics and philosophy. It has a long history of tension with politics, going back at least to Plato, who worried about the displacement of rational truth by mere opinion. In the modern age, Arendt says, opinion has generally won the day, rendering rational truth politically irrelevant.² The second type, factual truth,<br>

These discourses determine which aspects of a historical event will be collectively remembered and which forgotten. For example, detailed testimony of Holocaust survivors was virtually absent from the public sphere in both Israel and West Germany until the 1961 Eichmann trial in Jerusalem, when the dominant discourses in both countries changed dramatically (see Schlant; Segev; Wieviorka).

  Book Title: A Theory of the Trial-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burns Robert P.<br>
  Abstract: Burns explores the rich narrative structure of the trial, beginning with the lawyers' opening statements, which establish opposing moral frameworks in which to interpret the evidence. In the succession of witnesses, stories compete and are held in tension. At some point during the performance, a sense of the right thing to do arises among the jurors. How this happens is at the core of Burns's investigation, which draws on careful descriptions of what trial lawyers do, the rules governing their actions, interpretations of actual trial material, social science findings, and a broad philosophical and political appreciation of the trial as a unique vehicle of American self-government.<br>

  Abstract: The sense in which a verdict can be said to be correct under the Received View seems relatively straightforward:¹ a verdict will be correct if it is based on accurate fact-finding followed by legal categorization that respects the meanings of the key terms in the instructions. From that perspective, it is difficult even to think of a verdict as “true.”² “Justified” or perhaps “correct,” but never quite “true.” I have proposed another understanding of what, concretely, the trial has become for us that I argue is fair to the different sources of evidence, and have invoked “the mutual support of<br>

  Abstract: The existence of an increased level of environmental consciousness, of the kind experienced in the 1980s, will create new opportunities for change. However, this situation in itself does not prefigure what the outcomes of that change will look like. Relations with our environment will not be set once and for all or encapsulated in one big “action plan,” but will arise out of much trial and error, changed individual behaviour, political dispute and compromise, and diverse policy initiatives developed over time and unique to specific circumstances.<br>

Most obviously, we have inherited a constitution from the period that still attests to the suspension of the political hermeneutic of happiness. Moreover, our understanding of happiness is indubitably in large part the one produced by the eighteenth century. But if these effects continue today, the reader may well wonder where the trial narrative itself is to be found. We can still detect vestigial forms of<br>

  Abstract: One of the main intellectual consequences of the French Revolution was to leave many Europeans with the sense that the optimistic, rationalistic and egalitarian ideology of the Enlightenment had exhausted itself and been discredited with the failure of the radical phase of the revolution. There was a sense on many sides that the Enlightenment had been “on trial” during the French Revolution and that the understanding of human nature and history offered by the Enlightenment had proved inadequate.

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: What about the last dimension of the constitution of moral action, the dimension of practical reason? Ricoeur agrees with Hans‐Georg Gadamer that judgment and interpretation cannot be removed from the application of laws and principles to particular cases. Hence, he also accepts Ronald Dworkin’s argument against legal positivism. Because legal positivism identifies the meaning of a law with its original intent, it is left no recourse in hard cases that seem to be outside the purview of this intent except to appeal to the discretionary power of the judge. In contrast, Ricoeur emphasizes a criterion of validity that looks to the narrative coherence of a legal judgment in view of the history of the legal enterprise. Yet, Ricoeur thinks that Dworkin misses the opportunity to coordinate his “narrativist notion of fit” (p. 114) with a theory of argumentation borrowed from Habermas and the Erlangen School. Just as Rawls’s theory of justice lends formalism to the selection of principles of justice within a community of shared understandings and aspirations, Habermas’s discourse theory lends formalism to Dworkin’s interpretive judgments insofar as interpreters must argue for their interpretations under a set of discourse rules. Indeed, Ricoeur sees the ideal endpoint of a trial as a kind of ideal speech situation in which both winner and loser recognize each other as subjects of rights whose causes should have been heard, who made plausible arguments, and whose arguments were heard (p. 131).<br>

Abstract: One of the most contentious issues that Neal had to deal with in volume 3 concerned the role of the Puritans in the trial and execution of Charles I. He insists that neither Puritanism itself nor the tenets of any group among the Puritans were responsible for the death of Charles I. The seizure of the king by the army and the subsequent purging of parliament, Neal says, “blew up the whole constitution, and buried king, parliament, and presbytery in its ruins.” Episcopal divines, “in order to throw off the king’s misfortunes from themselves, who by their obstinate behaviour had in reality reduced him to the last extremity,” diverted all blame onto the Puritan clergy—as their successors have continued to do to this day, he adds.
      35Neal has no difficulty in presenting detailed evidence of public statements, petitions, and letters from Puritan ministers in London and throughout the country protesting against the trial of the king and subsequently against his sentence and his execution. Neal says that he knows of only two ministers—Hugh Peters and John Goodwin—who did support the trial and execution of the king. “King Charles therefore died by the Hands of Violence, or by the military Sword, assumed and managed in an arbitrary manner by a few desperate Officers of the Army and their Dependants, of sundry Denominations as to Religion, without any regard to the ancient Constitution of their Country, or the fundamental Laws of Society.”36Neal is adamant that “the king’s death was not owing to the distinguishing tenets of any sect or party of Christians,”37and he provides further corroboration from contemporaries to reinforce this challenge to the received wisdom of churchmen past and present. The strongest evidence is the act of attainder of the king’s judges drawn up at the time of the restoration of Charles II.38This judgment makes clear that no specific religious party can be held responsible for the execution of Charles I. Nor does it ascribe responsibility to the~<br>

Abstract: At the end of the month of September, Mrs. Barrett asked her students to pray for missionaries in Afghanistan who had been put on trial for preaching and who were potentially going to be executed. When she asked if any of the students in her class would consider putting themselves in danger to preach God’s word, none volunteered. This led her to ask if any of the students, had they been living “in Corrie’s time,” would have hidden Jews, or gotten “involved in standing up against the Gestapo.” No’s and soft laughter filled the room. The students who spoke said they’d conform to Nazi expectations of behavior rather than hiding Jews:

Abstract: However, the memory of Dimitrov in Leipzig, where the trial of 1933 was held, is minimal. The imposing building of the Federal Administrative Court, where the trials against Karl Liebknecht in 1907 and Dimitrov in 1933 took place, was transformed after the Second World War into the Museum of Fine Arts; it also housed the special museum devoted to the memory of Dimitrov, which had opened in 1952. In 2002, the building was given back to the Administrative Court. While a new building is being constructed to house the artifacts of the Museum of Fine Arts, nobody could answer my inquiries about the whereabouts of the materials from Dimitrov's museum during my visit in Leipzig in December 2003. A plaque in front of the federal building explains its history and mentions the Leipzig trial, but there is no explanation in the famous trial room.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Abstract: Let me just say, for the record, that this is a vast understatement. Orlean goes into astonishing depth on other orchid fanciers like Martin Motes, Savilla Quick, and Bob Fuchs; and not only does she give us more detail than we could ever need about Fuchs, but she goes on to inform us about his father, Freddie, an orchid hunter, his grandfather, Fred, explorer of the swamp, and even his
         great-grandfather, Charles, who moved to Florida and tried to become a farmer before going back to baking. (Finally, after a full ten pages of filler, she returns to the point of the whole digression: a robbery at Fuchs's nursery.) Not content with mentioning one Lee Moore, a man on trial for plant smuggling, she tells us about his childhood, his father, his wife, Chady, the various irrelevant things he and his wife have to say, the list of flowers he has discovered, the newsletter he used to produce, a near-death experience he has had, and his sideline as an antiquities thief. When at last Orlean asks him if he happens to know John Laroche, “Lee squinted and rubbed his chin. ‘Don't think I know the fellow,’ he said” (OT, p. 199).12Orlean is already flailing for the right story to tell.

Abstract: See, e.g., Marjara’s claim that “the demonic influence does leave its spot behind” or Sugimura’s claim that “Satan’s dream leaves a ‘spot or blame’ (V. 119) in Eve’s mind, despite what Adam says to the contrary” (
         Contemplation of Created Things, 273; “Matter of Glorious Trial,” 127).<br>

Abstract: The Kravchenko case today can be seen as an essential phase in the denunciation of Soviet regime crimes. This article reviews the details of the 1949 trial that opposed Kravchenko, a Ukrainian renegade, and the Communist weekly Les Lettres françaises that had launched a vilification campaign against him. The legal specificities of the charge of slander as well as the framework of a Paris criminal court in 1949 imposed particular constraints on the adversaries, whose respective goals – far over and above slander – was a denunciation of Soviet crimes and a condemnation of anti-Sovietism. Lawyers played a decisive role in the interweaving of arguments capable of supporting these opposing viewpoints at the height of the Cold War. This trial, of which the political and ideological stakes were instantly clear to the protagonists of the time, is an atypical and fascinating example of the complex relations that can be woven between justice and severe crises.<br>

Abstract: The trial of Adolf Eichmann, in 1961, is generally considered a turning point in the history of Holocaust memory because it brought the Holocaust into the public sphere for the first time as a discrete event on an international scale. In the same year, Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin's film Chronicle of a Summer appeared in France. While absent from scholarship on memory of the Nazi genocide for over forty years, Chronicle of a Summer contains a scene of Holocaust testimony that suggests the need to look beyond the Eichmann trial for alternative articulations of public Holocaust remembrance. This essay considers the juxtaposition in Chronicle of a Summer of Holocaust memory and the history of decolonization in order to rethink the "unique" place that the Holocaust has come to hold in discourses on extreme violence. The essay argues that a discourse of truth and testimony arose in French resistance to the Algerian war that shaped and was shaped by memory of the Nazi genocide.<br>

Abstract: The structural analysis of myth is a prime focus of anthropological interest, largely because of the efforts of Levi-Strauss. This paper uses some Levi-Straussian ideas to develop a strategy for myth analysis that I call the non-sense-in-myth strategy (NIMS). The strategy is given a trial run on a well-known and (I believe) much-misunderstood myth: Adam and Eve in Eden. The structure identified has an evolutionary character consistent with many modern understandings concerning the nature of human reality. NIMS, a mediator between Levi-Straussian intellectual leaps and a real methodology, indicates the value of cautious optimism concerning the question "Can structural analysis of myth become a scientific endeavor?"<br>

Abstract: Recently, a five-year trial period without a set timetable for compulsory school education in 79 municipalities was concluded in Sweden. The overall idea of the trial was to facilitate local participation, local time governance and flexible learning. Within the pilot trial, each individual pupil's school activities were supposed to be designed to suit his/her needs, interests and prerequisites. This article examines how teachers, principals and students describe students' schoolwork as being located in the intersection between school/home, work/leisure, time/task and individual/collective spheres. Three empirical studies indicate that the essential part of new temporal habits of school concerns a reconstructed task orientation. Time has been taken into the service of tasks and clocktime is not always a taken for granted regulator in educational settings. Potential disadvantages with a more task-oriented education are also discussed.<br>

Publisher: Presses de la Fondation nationale des sciences politiques<br>
Issue: i290822<br>
Date: 6 1, 1972<br>
Author(s): Deleuze Philippe<br>
Abstract: En janvier 1972, dans la France de Georges Pompidou, aux derniers feux de la "nouvelle société" promise depuis Matignon par Jacques Chaban-Delmas, "casseurs" et "gauchistes" sont déjà hors-jeu. Mais le "front des luttes" post-68 se déplace. Les prisonniers entrent en scène, à Toul en décembre 1971 puis à Nancy, ouvrant une mise en accusation de la justice dont le témoignage du docteur Vasseur en 2000 a bien montré que l'instruction n'était pas achevée. Les historiens entreprennent aujourd'hui, sur archives et témoignages, l'exploration de ce lancinant procès. Voici un des premiers exemples de leur travail, au ras des faits et des interprétations d'époque. Dans le sillage des luttes de l'après-68, des prisonniers de droit commun se mobilisèrent à partir de 1971. La mutinerie de Nancy en janvier 1972 fut réprimée mais suscita une mobilisation à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur des prisons françaises. L'auteur l'analyse notamment à partir des archives du Groupe d'information sur les prisons (GIP), mais aussi de la presse et de diverses enquêtes. Le GIP, où militaient aussi des intellectuels de renom, prit ainsi une part importante dans la mise à jour de la réalité carcérale, à l'occasion de ce qui fut le premier grand procès de la prison. /// In the wake of the post-1968 struggles, common law prisoners started mobilizing as of 1971. The Nancy mutiny in January 1972 was repressed, but it brought about mobilization inside and outside French prisons. The author analyzes this from the records of the Prison Information Group (GIP) but also from those of the press and various investigations. The GIP, in which famous intellectuals actively participated, had a big role in showing prison reality clearly in what was the first big prison trial.<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40048296<br>
Date: 3 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Soual Philippe<br>
Abstract: Hegel, refusant le déisme et son Dieu d'entendement et repensant la theologia crucis luthérienne, considère l'événement de la mort de Jésus-Christ sur la croix comme la manifestation dans l'histoire mondiale de l'amour divin trinitaire. La vie éternelle de Dieu est celle de l'amour des trois personnes divines, comme don, dessaisissement de soi et commune extase. Or la Croix révèle cet amour par la kénose du Fils, comprise comme don et mort de la mort. Par là Hegel s'efforce de penser non pas la seule mort de Dieu, mais bien la vie infinie de Dieu qui est conquête de sa vérité dans l'épreuve de l'absolu déchirement, de l'abîme de la croix. Cette vie est, par la croix, gloire de l'amour trinitaire dans le règne de l'Esprit. Hegel, refusing deism and its God of understanding, and pondering anew over the Lutheran theologia crucis, believes that Jésus Christ's death on the Cross is the manifestation of the Trinity's divine love within the history ofthe world. God's eternal life is that ofthe three divine persons embodying gift, the unravelling of one's self and common ecstasy. Now the Cross reveals such a love through the kenosis ofthe Son understood both as gift and death of death. Hence, Hegel strives at thinking not only God's death but, rather, the infinité life of God which is a conquest of its own truth through the trial of the absolute wrench of the abyss of the Cross. Such a life becomes, through the expérience of the Cross, the glory of the love of the Trinity within the realm ofthe Spirit.<br>

Abstract: In the last decades, witness to the Shoa has taken on various forms, from story-telling, to trial depositions and evidence collection, from negotiations for compensations, to "second-generation" accounts. Over the years, what used to be a first-hand narrative, the story of what had been actually seen and felt, has become the account of what have been heard. Since witness to the Shoa, in its various forms, has come to be considered as fundamental "evidence" of the tragedy, second-hands accounts may prove fragile documents to this end. What, therefore, are witness narratives? Are they merely legal documents? How do they stand as historical documents? Will Shoa narratives still have a future while witnesses slowly dwindle and disappear?<br>

Abstract: In 1884 an Ottoman public prosecutor and fellow officials stood trial for abusing their official authorities when attending to an incident in one of Istanbul's neighborhoods. A published verbatim report of the proceedings is used in this article for discussing Ottoman socio-legal change in the late nineteenth century, employing a microhistorical perspective. Following a major reform in the new court system, which was established in the 1860s (the Nizamiye courts), the judicial authorities used the trial in question for transmitting the commitment of the modernizing state to the rule of law, exhibited by the principle of officials' accountability. Features of the reformed judicial system and its distinctive legal culture are demonstrated in this article by unfolding the judicial aspects of this episode and by discussing connections between them and the immediate socio-political and socio-legal contexts of the trial.<br>

Author(s): Heller Kevin Jon<br>
Abstract: This review article discusses the emergence of the subsequent proceedings before the US Military Tribunals from the shadows of the trial of 'Major War Criminals' at the International Military Tribunal as explored in Kevin Jon Heller's The Nuremberg Military Tribunals and the Origins of International Criminal Law. The article applauds Heller's efforts in producing a detailed examination of an understudied aspect of the origins of international criminal law. The essay suggests that given the specific focus of the author on the genealogy of international criminal law, important legal historical questions are left unexamined. It suggests a research agenda that would focus more specifically on the centrality of the Shoah to National Socialism and argues that the current trend in historical scholarship focusing on war crimes trials as a distinct subject of inquiry could provide a fruitful basis for future socio-legal research into the Nazi state and its legal apparatus.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the content given to the term rhetoric and some of the history of its changes. It begins with the sophistic emphasis on persuasion as a means of coming to terms with the phenomenal world around us, through to a modern conception of rhetoric as a deconstructive and critical tool in analysing the power-play of meaning that constitutes texts. This paper tries to reflect on some of these changes, arguing that understanding the term implies that one must also examine the surplus of meaning that informs it. While the word rhetoric is highly ambiguous, this paper tries to demonstrate that such ambiguity need not be viewed as a trial and a hindrance in the search for a correct definition as a precursor for effective discussion on the subject. Instead it argues that an investigation into rhetoric's surplus of meaning is perhaps what constitutes effective discussion in the first place, and that further, such surplus of meaning is one that can be characterised as far more unified than commonly assumed which enables one do more with the term rhetoric than previously thought of, or allowed.

Abstract: The communication of the gospel is sometimes in an 'insider language' of transcendant realities with which the secular world is unfamiliar. How significant an impediment is this? Consider fairy tales are universally understood. They share many of the same elements and functions as testimonies which are at the heart of pentecostalism. We can use stories and testimonies in our ministries? Thus to communicate with secular people we must be willing to put the stories of our lives on trial. The trans-personal dimension must be communicated, for religious experiences can be powerful. The challenge is to find ways to use stories and metaphors to speak to a secularised world of the major doctrines as expressed in The Foursquare Gospel' without losing any of its power.<br>

Abstract: La transition vers l'État de droit et la démocratie qui a eu lieu dans de nombreux pays (Argentine, Chili, Afrique du Sud, Haïti, pour n'en citer que quelques-uns) au cours de ces dernières décennies a remis à l'ordre du jour le problème de l'amnistie. Doit-on, au nom de la réconciliation et de la paix civile, renoncer à traduire en justice les anciens bourreaux ? Ou bien doiton, au nom de la justice due aux victimes, les traduire en justice ? Poser la question de cette façon, c'est suggérer qu'il existe une opposition absolue entre l'amnistie et la justice. Dans notre contribution, nous voudrions montrer que cette opposition n'est pas aussi absolue qu'on le pense et que l'amnistie peut aussi parfois être nécessaire pour préserver ou réinstaurer les conditions de possibilité de la justice. The transition towards a state of law and democracy which has taken place in many countries in the last decades (Argentina, Chili, South Africa, Haïti, to mention just a few) brings up again the problem of amnisty. In the name of reconciliation and civil peace, should former torturers and hangmen be released from justice? Or, to do justice to victims, should they be brought to trial? Put that way, the question suggests an absolute opposition between amnisty and justice. In this article we want to show that this opposition is not so absolute as one might think and that amnisty is sometimes necessary to preserve or to re-instate the condititions for the possibility of justice.<br>

Abstract: Underlying and perhaps uniting these three ways in which Levinas's “Kantian” ethics is anti-Kantian is the way in which his phenomenology is anti-Husserlian. He insists that he is doing phenomenology in the fundamental sense of intentional analysis.
            
                  But he has to admit, “In spite of everything what I do is phenomenology.” Why “in spite of everything”? Partly, no doubt, because it is not a transcendental phenomenology and does not rely on the phenomenological reduction.11
               
                  But the more basic reason is that precisely in the ethical relation where we are called forth to responsibility and called upon to answer at our trial, he is concerned with “an intentionality of a wholly different type” (TI 23) from the objectifying, theoretical vision that is basic to Husserl.12
