  René Girard and World Religions from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1vjqqj6">Mimetic Theory and World Religions</a><br>
  Author(s) Kirwan Michael<br>
  Abstract: Mimetic theory’s encounter with world religions may be pictured as a tension between two powerful vectors or currents. The mainstream is the openness to the truth to be found in non-Christian religions, which we find articulated by the Second Vatican Council in 1965 (within a few years of the publication of
                  Deceit, Desire, and the Novel), and taken forward in a series of official Roman Catholic pronouncements. I trace these developments not with a sectarian intent, but because these declarations comprise a legitimate heuristic: René Girard himself is a committed Catholic Christian, and among mimetic theorists exploring the implications of<br>

  Mimetic Theory and Hermeneutic Communism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1ws7x0t">Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes</a><br>
  Abstract: In the last fifteen years, Girard has engaged in a dialogue with the Italian philosopher Gianni Vattimo. Vattimo is famous for a philosophical approach named
                  pensiero debole(weak thought). “Weak thought” is basically concerned with arguing for philosophical antifoundationalism: drawing on the philosophy of Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Gadamer, Vattimo advocates the rejection of metaphysics and a reinterpretation of truth as the opening of horizons. Vattimo has explained that he came to recognize a “completion” of Heidegger in Girard by reading “the weakening of Being as its sole form of manifesting itself beyond metaphysical oblivion” as “an analogon of the dissolution<br>

  Hans J. Morgenthau In Defense of the National Interest: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Author(s) Goodnight G. Thomas<br>
  Abstract: The dramatic ending of the Second World War—the obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the revelation of the holocaust, the establishment of the United Nations, and the transformation of the Soviet Union from wartime ally to global competitor—challenged prevailing precepts and practices of international relations. Abjuring the traditional language of diplomacy, elite and public policy discourses of the 1940s were spoken within the horizons of global necessities and apocalyptic fears. A Soviet atomic test in 1949 yet again disrupted the contexts of international relations. “In truth, the first atomic explosion on Russian soil has shattered American foreign policy as<br>

  [III Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Abstract: One rewrites in order to improve a text. Sometimes the result is thought to be the better expression of an original meaning; at other times, it extends the idea in a new direction. In any case, textual revision is a process characterized by imperfection, change, negotiation, and fallibility. Traditionally, realism has seemed to be above this process: One identifies the relations of power or suffers the consequences. This attitude is reflected in the standard invocation of the classics of realism, which are seen as equivalent statements of a core doctrine of universal truths. From Thucydides to Machiavelli to Morgenthau, there<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt6fv">Christianity and the Mass Media in America</a><br>
  Abstract: In his classic sociology textbook published in 1909, Charles Horton Cooley assessed the relationship between democracy and religion. ʺThe democratic movement,ʺ he wrote, ʺinsomuch as it feels a common spirit in all men, is of the same nature as Christianity; and it is said with truth that while the world was never so careless as now of the mechanism of religion, it was never so Christian in feeling.ʺ Comparing the ʺhigher spirit of democracyʺ to the ʺteaching of Jesus Christ,ʺ Cooley claimed that Jesus ʺcalls the mind out of the narrow and transient self of sensual appetites and visible appurtenances,<br>

  INTRODUCTION. from:

  Abstract: This dictum evokes a famous verse in the Quran, which affirms that “every living thing is made of water” (
                  wa jaʿalnā min al-māʾi kulla shayʾ in ḥayyin,21:30); it is implicit in Genesis I, where the earth and the heavens are created by a division of the waters; it forms a basic truth claim in modern astronomical science, so that the mere presence of water on a planet may be a sign of life; it is found in many creation myths and much common sense. Thales, who launched the great adventure of Greek philosophy, also affirmed as much. There is<br>

  From a Correspondence on Ossian and the Songs of Ancient Peoples from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1bmzkq4">Symposium of the Whole</a><br>
  Author(s) HERDER JOHANN GOTTFRIED<br>
  Abstract: With Herder we get the outlines for an actual and still viable ethnopoetics—a concept of poetry ʺemancipated from rationalist or Christian context and strictures, opening to world horizons, the dimension of time and cultural relativism, and deepening its meaning as a profound mode of truthʺ (Feldman, Modern Mythology, p. 225). But the universal poetics Herder creates has a new and strict regard for cultural autonomies and particularities—allowing the reentry of the outcast European (ʺfolkʺ) past and the more distant poetries of peoples then falling to European domination. Herderʹs Volkslieder (1778) is a first anthology with ethnopoetic scope: ʺnot<br>

  Book Title: Alef, Mem, Tau-Kabbalistic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfson Elliot R.<br>
  Abstract: This highly original, provocative, and poetic work explores the nexus of time, truth, and death in the symbolic world of medieval kabbalah. Demonstrating that the historical and theoretical relationship between kabbalah and western philosophy is far more intimate and extensive than any previous scholar has ever suggested, Elliot R. Wolfson draws an extraordinary range of thinkers such as Frederic Jameson, Martin Heidegger, Franz Rosenzweig, William Blake, Julia Kristeva, Friedrich Schelling, and a host of kabbalistic figures into deep conversation with one another.
      Alef, Mem, Taualso discusses Islamic mysticism and Buddhist thought in relation to the Jewish esoteric tradition as it opens the possibility of a temporal triumph of temporality and the conquering of time through time. The framework for Wolfson's examination is the rabbinic teaching that the wordemet,"truth," comprises the first, middle, and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet,alef, mem,andtau,which serve, in turn, as semiotic signposts for the three tenses of time-past, present, and future. By heeding the letters ofemetwe discern the truth of time manifestly concealed in the time of truth, the beginning that cannot begin if it is to be the beginning, the middle that re/marks the place of origin and destiny, and the end that is the figuration of the impossible disclosing the impossibility of figuration, the finitude of death that facilitates the possibility of rebirth. The time of death does not mark the death of time, but time immortal, the moment of truth that bestows on the truth of the moment an endless beginning of a beginningless end, the truth of death encountered incessantly in retracing steps of time yet to be taken-between, before, beyond.<br>

  CONCLUSION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn5mn">Alef, Mem, Tau</a><br>
  Abstract: The precise turn of thought charted in this book opens the possibility of a temporal triumph of temporality, the conquering of time through time.¹ In an effort to pave the way to this possibility, I have explored the nexus of time, truth, and death as it emerges hermeneutically from the symbolic world of medieval kabbalah. I have not adhered to the familiar methodology adopted by scholars of Jewish mysticism, focusing on a particular historical period or individual personality; I have organized my thoughts instead around the letters

  CHAPTER THIRTEEN  Actually Existing Theory and Its Discontents from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnqs7">The Language of the Gods in the World of Men</a><br>
  Abstract: If the passing of the so-called master narratives that have shaped modern ways of knowing the world—accounts based on belief in the progress of scientific reason, for example, or human emancipation—is partly a result of discontent with their apparent claims to a monopoly on truth or their rigid laws of developmentalism, there is no little irony in the fact that they are being replaced, in some instances, by what might be called cultural naturalism as the explanatory model of change in the history of culture and power. To be sure, theories linking cultural change and biological evolution have<br>

  Abstract: Where does Plato come into our scheme of things? With him we are dealing with a thinker who carefully worked out a cosmology and eschatology of rebirth. I doubt that he would have done so had he not personally believed in its truth, and, for me, it is senseless to convert figures like the Buddha and Plato into figures of the European Enlightenment or, as some do, into modern and postmodern thinkers. Plato was not interested in conversion, but he addressed his message to those willing to listen, which for the most part meant the members of his academy. Nevertheless,<br>

  Author(s) Palmer Richard E.<br>
  Abstract: I would first like briefly to justify the theme I have chosen, namely: “from word to concept.” The subject matter is a topic belonging both to philosophy and to hermeneutics. In truth, concepts are really one of the distinguishing marks of philosophy. Indeed, philosophy first entered Western culture in this form. For this reason the concept is the first thing I would like to discuss. Of one thing I am sure: the concept, which very often presents itself as something strange and demanding, must begin to speak if it is to be really grasped. For this reason I would first<br>

  Chapter 6  A Critique of Gadamer’s Aesthetics from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pp75p">Gadamer’s Repercussions</a><br>
  Author(s) KELLY MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: There are three main critiques through which Hans-Georg Gadamer develops his conception of aesthetics, which has a central role in his philosophical hermeneutics, which in turn is his principal contribution to philosophy in the twentieth century, all of which he amazingly witnessed. He offers a critique of the philosophy of art which regards art as a lie and that denies it is capable of making truth claims; a critique of aesthetic consciousness as an alienated abstraction from the experience of truth in art; and a critique of the subjectivization of modern aesthetics, which he traces back to Immanuel Kant’s

  Author(s) McCann Ben<br>
  Abstract: It is a truth universally acknowledged that set designers create the space in which films take place. But, as Alessio Cavallaro reminds us, set designers 'never simply replicate reality: they always involve the artificial creation of a world … carefully selected to generate a particular aesthetic or mood that draws the audience into the story'.¹<br>

  6  Religious Language, Reality, and Doctrinal Development from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12878jm">In Defense of Doctrine</a><br>
  Abstract: Evangelicals, eponymously named for their fervor for
                  evangelor gospel, are concerned about truth, particularly the truth content of the good news of Jesus Christ. We are committed to the universal proclamation of the gospel because we operate with the conviction that God has entrusted Christian believers with the only “message of reconciliation” (2 Cor. 5:19) and that it is our duty as “ambassadors for Christ” to implore every man, woman, and child to be reconciled to God (2 Cor. 5:20). We likewise operate with the deeply held conviction that the proclamation that “Christ died for our sins in accordance<br>

  5  The Truth of Myth and the Necessity of Demythologizing from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12878n5">The Mission of Demythologizing</a><br>
  Abstract: Scholars have spilled a lot of ink criticizing Bultmann’s program of demythologizing on the grounds that it ignores the truths that myths, particularly those associated with Christian faith, are uniquely able to communicate. The truth of myth is played off against demythologizing as if the latter rejects myth
                  simpliciter. One often hears that demythologizing is merely the extrication of the kerygma from the shackles of myth on the assumption that Bultmann views everything associated with the label of myth as primitive falsehood. Many suppose that demythologizing carries out its hermeneutical procedure by shucking the husk of what is ancient or<br>

  Author(s) Smith Shively T. J.<br>
  Abstract: Who doesn’t want to speak with force and energy? As seminarians, I suspect you, like Quintilian, want to preach, teach, and write with impact
                     andvigor. Quintilian was a first-century Roman rhetorician who lived in Rome during the time the New Testament writings were being composed and the Christian movement emerging. He gained notoriety for his moving speeches and written rhetorical guidelines. Yet, even he had to admit the truth: force and energy come with practice.<br>

  11  Faith as Trust from:

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we looked at how—in faith—we give attention to God’s Word, perceive that God is gracious, and believe selected doctrines to be true. If we wanted to be persnickety, we might dub these acts of faith
                  works. It takes work on our part to believe in the truth of doctrines. If it takes work to have faith as belief, then we might rightfully ask: How can our faith be saving faith if it is a form of work? Faith as belief looks like one more way to climb the spiritual ladder, right? What happened to<br>

  5  Projecting the Self: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130hnq5">Documenting Ourselves</a><br>
  Abstract: Film is always a construction. Film “truth,” whether it be cinéma vérité,
                  kinopravda, or observational cinema, is a misnomer because film is never objective. Even the placing of the camera for a film consisting of a single “take” (uninterrupted shot) is a manipulation. The camera reflects the filmmaker’s view.¹ Most filmmakers believe, however, that their manipulation creates a “greater truth,” what Flaherty’s wife, Frances, called “that high moment of seeing, that flash of penetration into the heart of the matter” (Jacobs 1979:8). The film’s structure is the mark of the filmmaker’s truth and the truth he or she discerns in<br>

  2  The Shadow of God from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130hsq3">The Unfolding God of Jung and Milton</a><br>
  Abstract: Many of the difficulties modern readers experience with
                     Paradise Lostare reactions to one character, God the Father. The Father, defending himself and combating Satan, often resembles a flawed human being. Consequently, to presume, as the narrator frequently does, that he manifests supreme goodness seems a mockery of truth. Offended, moderns may retort that, far from being supremely good and deserving worship, the Father deserves to be repudiated as evil. Jung's analytical psychology, however, offers a more refined perception, which promotes a more balanced response.<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapter examined Levinas’s transcendental critique, assessed its applicability to Marcel’s work, and offered some hypothetical Marcelian responses. This critique argued for the transcendental priority of the infinite over being—that is, the priority of the Infinite as the condition for the possibility of truth, subjectivity, transcendence, etc.—and took the form of an accusation regarding the inability to account for the other as other. Levinas’s transcendental critique of the tradition (and of Marcel) looks for the other qua other in the tradition and finds the tradition wanting. Marcel’s work, however, takes a different tack.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wzzs4">The Phenomenology of Prayer</a><br>
  Author(s) WIRZBA NORMAN<br>
  Abstract: According to Aristotle (in
                  On Interpretation, 17 A 4–5), prayer is a logos or speech that is not susceptible to truth or falsity. Unlike declarative propositions that assume a possible correspondence between our words and the affairs of the world—a correspondence that can be checked or verified by the methods of scientific observation—prayers do not illuminate or clarify the world in the way that more or less scientific statements do. They cannot be tested according to the rigors of scientific procedure because they follow a different grammar, obey rules of use in which considerations other than truth<br>

  12  Praise—Pure and Personal? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wzzs4">The Phenomenology of Prayer</a><br>
  Author(s) GSCHWANDTNER CHRISTINA M.<br>
  Abstract: In “Education and Prayer,” Emmanuel Levinas complains that our prayer has too often become a purely isolated and individuated experience and that we have lost the social and collective dimension of prayer.¹ Prayer, he suggests, always has a liturgical and communal function. Prayer requires openness and truth and hence has ethical significance and import. Jean-Luc Marion is profoundly influenced by Levinas’s philosophy. His own account of prayer bears traces of Levinas’s thought and orients itself along Levinasian suggestions regarding relation to the other. Yet Marion’s account of prayer lacks precisely the communal, social, and ethical dimension for which Levinas calls.<br>

  Author(s) MCCULLOUGH LISSA<br>
  Abstract: In the opening chapters of
                  Confessions,the question Augustine broaches before all others is whether we must first beg for help from God to know who God is, or must first know who God is in order to beg for help. Is prayer, then, essentially “begging,” and is “begging” the surest avenue to the divine? Or is begging simply the final resort left to us when all other presumed resources have revealed their finitude and exhaustibility, exposing the naked truth of crucifixion? Is God precisely the crucified one who is there when nothing—absolutely nothing—else is, unveiled in the<br>

  Book Title: Gazing Through a Prism Darkly: Reflections on Merold Westphal's Hermeneutical Epistemology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): PUTT B. KEITH<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal has been in the foremost ranks of philosophers who proclaim a new postsecular philosophy. By articulating an epistemology sensitive to the realities of cognitive finitude and moral weakness, he defends a wisdom that begins in both humility and commitment, one that always confesses that human beings can encounter meaning and truth only as human beings, never as gods.The present volume focuses on this wisdom of humility that characterizes Westphal's thought and explores how that wisdom, expressed through the redemptive dynamic of doubt, can contribute to developing a postsecular apologetic for faith.This book can function both as an accessible introduction to Westphal for those who have not read him extensively and also as an informed critical appreciation and extension of his work for those who are more experienced readers.<br>

  CHAPTER 4  Confucianism’s Political Implications for the Contemporary World from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x026n">Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism</a><br>
  Author(s) Herr Ranjoo Seodu<br>
  Abstract: Confucianism, as the dominant philosophical/cultural system of East Asia that has evolved over two millennia, is multidimensional and multilayered. Consequently, its interpretations diverge depending on which elements get emphasized and how they are arranged. Most, if not all, of such interpretations may contain some truth, but no one interpretation may capture the whole monolithic and unchangeable “Truth” of Confucianism. Confucianism is a
                  livingtradition in perpetual motion and survives through mutations, reflecting the needs and concerns of each generation of the cultural community. This does not mean that Confucianism does not contain some essence that would remain constant. Confucian values<br>

  CHAPTER 4  Compulsory Development: from:

                  Tales of the Tikongs(1983), about the euphoria of developmentalism that washed over Tonga and other Pacific-island nations in the 1970s, during the heyday of internationally sponsored development projects.¹ As “the only teller of big truths in the realm,” Manu peddles his “lonely message against Development” throughout the island of Tiko, a fictionalized version of Tonga.² Recounting parables of the pitfalls and failures of progress, Manu broadcasts his warning that “Tiko can’t be developed … unless the ancient gods are killed”<br>

  Abstract: Heidegger and Foucault can be envisioned as thinkers of emancipatory askeses, disciplines of liberation in which each may be seen as engaged in freeing knowledge and truth from embedding contexts of repressive epistemological constraints and their ancillary ethical implications, a freeing through which a certain release is attained.¹ Techniques in which historical accretions are not merely jettisoned but reenvisioned are deployed by Heidegger to deliver the relation of Being and beings in what he calls a concealing-revealing and by Foucault to uncover the disguises truth wears by bringing to light the strategic power relations that generate the practices of knowledge,<br>

  Book Title: Sounding/Silence: Martin Heidegger at the Limits of Poetics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SMITH DAVID NOWELL<br>
  Abstract: Sounding/Silence charts Heidegger's deep engagement with poetry, situating it within the internal dynamics of his thought and within the domains of poetics and literary criticism. Heidegger viewed poetics and literary criticism with notorious disdain: he claimed that his Erlauterungen ("soundings") of Holderlin's poetry were not "contributions to aesthetics and literary history" but rather stemmed "from a necessity for thought." And yet, the questions he poses--the value of significance of prosody and trope, the concept of "poetic language", the relation between language and body, the "truth" of poetry--reach to the very heart of poetics as a discipline, and indeed situate Heidegger within a wider history of thinking on poetry and poetics. opening up points of contact between Heidegger's discussions of poetry and technical and critical analyses of these poems, Nowell Smith addresses a lacuna within Heidegger scholarship and sets off from Heidegger's thought to sketch a philosophical "poetics of limit".<br>

  Abstract: If a woman told the truth about her life, “the world would split open,” the poet Muriel Rukeyser observed.¹ This was gospel for the earliest feminist theologians. Mary Daly gave this now classic explanation, “In hearing and naming ourselves out of the depths, women are naming toward God.”² Or, to paraphrase the playwright Ntozake Shange, as feminist theologians working in the late 1970s and ’80s sometimes did, women found God in themselves and “loved her fiercely.”³ When women told what they had undergone, what had sustained them, oppressed them, and set them free, how they had endured and survived, what<br>

  Author(s) Hamacher Werner<br>
  Abstract: The claim that human rights are
                  rightsand that they are the rights ofhuman beingsmeans two things. First, it means that they apply neither to the empirical totality of a bio- or zoological species nor to any individuals as the privileged (because exemplary) instances of such a species but rather to the human “as such” or “in truth.” Human rights do not define man in his historically contingent appearance, but rather provide an explication of human essence as it presents itself in and of itself after all external attributes have been subtracted.

  Abstract: Metaphor, that old, anarchical alchemist, transmutes belief into truth, illusion into reality, ignorance into knowledge—only then to turn around and do the opposite. How? She lets unsociable differences cross over to dwell with and interpret one another in order to reveal unsuspected identities—fictional, real, and virtual.¹ Water is one thing, electricity is another; but when Faraday crossed them and saw electricity through hydraulics, a new science was born.

  Abstract: Plato’s metaphors tend toward the transcendent, but now the matrix must have its due. Deictic images seek out the factical uniqueness that condemns us to live in both truth and untruth, in openness and in concealment. How can this be if, as it is said, Plato is unable to accommodate the

His solution hinges on the distinction between sensing the individual and, except inphronesis,knowing it as universal, and that gets us nowhere. Can Plato be rescued? Perhaps.

  Book Title: Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): MACKENDRICK KARMEN<br>
  Abstract: Theology usually appears to us to be dogmatic, judgmental, condescending, maybe therapeutic, or perhaps downright fantastical-but seldom enticing. Divine Enticement takes as its starting point that the meanings of theological concepts are not so much logical, truth-valued propositions-affirmative or negative-as they are provocations and evocations. Thus it argues for the seductiveness of both theology and its subject-for, in fact, infinite seduction and enticement as the very sense of theological query. The divine name is one by which we are drawn toward the limits of thought, language, and flesh. The use of language in such conceptualization calls more than it designates. This is not a flaw or a result of vagueness or imprecision in theological language but rather marks the correspondence of such language to its subject: that which, outside of or at the limit of our thought, draws us as an enticement to desire, not least to intellectual desire. Central to the text is the strange semiotics of divine naming, as a call on that for which there cannot be a standard referent. The entanglement of sign and body, not least in interpretations of the Christian incarnation, both grounds and complicates the theological abstractions. A number of traditional notions in Christian theology are reconceived here as enticements, modes of drawing the desires of both body and mind: faith as "thinking with assent"; sacraments as "visible words" read in community; ethics as responsiveness to beauty; prayer as the language of address; scripture as the story of meaning-making. All of these culminate in a sense of a call to and from the purely possible, the open space into which we can be enticed, within which we can be divinely enticing.<br>

It is unsettling to anyone who wants to think of Dewey primarily as a “pragmatist,” since Dewey says the aim of philosophy should be to deal with the meaning of culture and not “inquiry” or “truth.” He says, “Meaning is wider in scope as well as more precious in value than is truthm and philosophy is occupied with meaning rather than with truth” (LW, 3:4).

  Abstract: The question whether the Greek epic tradition is a matter of truth or of fiction remains a central issue in Homeric scholarship, and any answer to it betrays one’s stance with regard to a host of other issues, such as text, tradition, and authorship. Opinions are divided as to whether the Homeric rendition of the heroic past is wholly traditional and so “objective,” or allows of fictional, “original” admixture by an individual poet. What is less often asked is whether the notion of truth itself, in the sense of an acknowledged correspondence between a statement and a state of affairs<br>

  Abstract: Human narrators come in many forms. Some are completely reliable: most epic narrators speak with detachment, and thus with authority. They elicit trust. But human narrators may also be revealed as immoral by giving tongue to lies, by speaking themselves buffoons, unreliable, or dubious. Then their stories will

To use William James’s terms, Mark Twain was both “morbid-minded” and “healthy-minded,” susceptible to literary ambivalences of comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, and melodrama. But melodrama became as necessary to Mark Twain for his depiction of the truth of human affairs as it did for Henry James.

We have worked through the metaphor of consciousness (subjective genitive, the metaphor that consciousness is). Our A = B has issued in symbolic thinking and it has assumed the echoic properties of sentient awareness. We may be inclined to think that our individual minds are the be-all and end-all so far as metaphor is concerned, that metaphor can’t do any better than produce self-reflexive thinkers like ourselves. But in truth, it may just be getting started. It is still expanding and taking on new forms.<br>

  Abstract: Resentment's Virtueoffers a new, more nuanced view. Building on the writings of Holocaust survivor Jean Améry and the work of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Thomas Brudholm argues that the preservation of resentment can be the reflex of a moral protest that might be as permissible, humane or honorable as the willingness to forgive. Taking into account the experiences of victims, the findings of truth commissions, and studies of mass atrocities, Brudholm seeks to enrich the philosophical understanding of resentment.<br>

  Book Title: Intention Interpretation-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): ISEMINGER GARY<br>
  Abstract: "...an excellent and comprehensive discussion of a debate that was initiated in this century in William Wimsatt's and Monroe C. Beardsley's influential article 'The Intentional Fallacy.'...this is a splendidly conceived and very useful collection of essays. Readers will want to take issue with the arguments of individual authors, but this is to be expected in a volume at the cutting edge of a fertile philosophical controversy." --David Novitz, The Philosophical Quarterly "What is the connection, if any, between the author's intentions in (while) writing a work of literature and the truth (acceptability, validity) of interpretive statements about it?" With this question, Gary Isminger introduces a literary debate that has been waged for the past four decades and is addressed by philosophers and literary theorists in Intention and Interpretation. Thirteen essays discuss the role of appeals to the author's intention in interpreting works of literature. A well-known argument by E.D. Hirsch serves as the basic text, in which he defends the appeal to the author's intention against Wimsatt and Beardsley's claim that such an appeal involved "the intentional fallacy." The essays, mostly commissioned by the editor, explore the presuppositions and consequences of arguing for the importance of the author's intentions in the way Hirsch does. Connections emerge between this issue and many fundamental issues in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind as well as in aesthetics. The (old) "New Criticism" and current Post-Structuralism tend to agree in disenfranchising the author, and many people now are disinclined even to consider the alternative. Hirsch demurs, and arguments like his deserve the careful attention, both from critics and sympathizers, that they receive here. Literary scholars and philosophers who are sympathetic to Continental as well as to Anglo-American styles of philosophy are among the contributors. "This is a timely book appearing as it does when postmodernist views of the death of the author are disappearing quickly from the scene. As a collection it exemplifies the best work that is being done on this problem at the moment, and it will no doubt inspire further debate." --The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism "[T]his volume contains important articles illuminating the central debate over the role and relevance of authorial intentions in literary interoperation." --British Journal of Aesthetics<br>

  Book Title: Foundational Theology-A New Approach to Catholic Fundamental Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Jacobs-Vandegeer Christiaan<br>
  Abstract: Fundamental theology is traditionally viewed as the starting point for the various disciplines within Catholic theology; it is the place where solid foundations are established for the further research and engagement with the vast terrain of historical, systematic, philosophical, and sacramental/liturgical theology. In Foundational Theology, a landmark new study, Neil Ormerod and Christiaan Jacobs-Vandegeer seek to ground foundational theology in the normative drive toward meaning, truth, goodness, and beauty, appropriated by the theologian through religious, moral, intellectual, and psychic conversions. In doing so, the work maps out the implications of those fundamental orientations to the specific questions and topics of the Catholic theological tradition: God, Trinity, revelation, and an array of doctrinal points of investigation. The authors in this work provide a comprehensive approach to theological foundations for theologians while employing a new, groundbreaking approach to the discipline through the application of the insights of Bernard Lonergan, one of the foremost Catholic theologians of the modern era.<br>

It is the experience of God’s love flooding our hearts (Rom. 5:5), of being loved by God “before the foundation of the world” (Eph. 1:4). This involves a radical shift in our horizon so that in everything we do we act on a different level, with an expanded range of possibilities for meaning, truth and goodness.

  Book Title: Conrad's Marlow-Narrative and death in 'Youth', Heart of Darkness, Lord Jim and Chance<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wake Paul<br>
  Abstract: Variously described as ‘the average pilgrim’, a ‘wanderer’, and ‘a Buddha preaching in European clothes’, Charlie Marlow is the voice behind Joseph Conrad’s ‘Youth’ (1898), Heart of Darkness (1899), Lord Jim (1900) and Chance (1912). Conrad’s Marlow offers a comprehensive account and critical analysis of one of Conrad’s most celebrated creations, asking both who and what is Marlow: a character or a narrator, a biographer or an autobiographical screen, a messenger or an interpreter, a bearer of truth or a misguided liar? Reading Conrad’s fiction alongside the work of Walter Benjamin, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida and Martin Heidegger, and offering an investigation into the connection between narrative and death, this book argues that Marlow’s essence is located in his liminality – in his constantly shifting position – and that the emergence of meaning in his stories is at all points bound up with the process of his storytelling.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15r3xt2">Narrative Criminology</a><br>
  Author(s) BROOKMAN FIONA<br>
  Abstract: I recently watched the video-recorded interrogation of Jermaine,¹ a young black man who had shot and killed a young white man during a robbery in Washington, DC. I wanted to see how the two detectives managed to persuade the suspect to waive his Miranda rights and, as the detectives put it, “tell his story.” Through trickery and deceit (which involved lies, plot suggestion, and redirecting the conversation) they carefully set the stage for him to confess in detail to the robbery homicide. They judged his account (by other corroborating evidence) to be truthful and he was ultimately convicted of first-degree<br>

  Abstract: The full body of reflection on the truths of the Catholic faith represents the collected wisdom of intelligent and holy men and women from every part of the world over two millennia. Its tributaries include thousands of years of ancient Jewish experience as well as the cultures of Mesopotamia and Egypt; it draws on the entire heritage of classical Greece and Rome, the civilizations of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the scientific revolution, romanticism, modernism, and our globalized postmodern culture. Briefly put, there is nothing quite like it.<br>

  Abstract: The
                     saeculum, the area where the distinction between the profane and the sacred is played out, is the theater for two conversations. The first, between faith and culture, is important because both are ethically normative systems and, if the norms of the culture diverge too greatly from the norms of the faith, then believers live in great tension and the culture is imperfectly open to realities beyond itself. The second dialogue that takes place in thesaeculumis that between faith and reason, because faith gives us revealed truths and reason helps us to find what is true.<br>

  Book Title: Restoring the Right Relationship-  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Brien Mark A<br>
  Abstract: A leading biblical scholar, Hans Heinrich Schmid, believes that righteousness, or the right order of the world, is 'the fundamental problem of our human existence'. It is a key theme in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament's theology of creation and salvation, along with associated themes such as justice, steadfast love/loyalty, truth/ fidelity, compassion/mercy, sin and disorder/chaos. A number of studies of righteousness have been undertaken but most have tended to focus on Israel's call to be righteous, as voiced in particular in the Prophetic Books and the Psalter. In contrast, this book focuses on divine righteousness as the basis for all other notions of righteousness, as this is outlined in the foundational teaching or revelation of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament— namely, the Torah or Pentateuch. It then undertakes a study of how righteousness in the Prophetic Books, the Psalter and the Book of Job relates to this foundational teaching.<br>

  2  Books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt163t86h">Restoring the Right Relationship</a><br>
  Abstract: The occurrences of righteousness in the book of Jeremiah deal with three key relationships. One is between God and the people, the relevant texts being Jeremiah 3:11 (verb); 51:10 (noun); 4:2 (noun in a unique combination with truth [’
                     emet] and justice); and 9:24 (MT 9:23) (noun in another unique combination with steadfast love [khesedh] and justice).² The second is between God and the Davidic king; being combined with justice as a word pair in 22:3, 13, 15; 23:5; 33:15. The third is between God and the prophet (11:20; 12:1; 20:12).³ In the prophecies of restoration<br>

  Author(s) Bergant Dianne<br>
  Abstract: ‘The living Tradition is essential for enabling the Church to grow through time in the understanding of the truth revealed in the Scriptures.’¹ These words from the Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation of Benedict XVI throw light on the relationship between Scripture and Tradition as understood by the Roman Catholic Church. It speaks of the revelatory character of the Scriptures, and of the Tradition as being living and dynamic as it opens the Church to the revelation of God. However, within the broader Christian Church, the relationship between Scripture and Tradition has been a source of contention and, despite the strides that<br>

  CHRISTIANITY AND RATIONAL, UNIVERSAL MORALS from:

  Abstract: That the “ten words” are originally and always the major criteria of religious morals does not mean that the rational, moral conscience (or the “natural” conscience that is, in a limited sense, non
                  revealed) may be incapable of truth. The vicissitudes of the late Middle Ages (especially with the rediscovery of Aristotle and the work of Thomas Aquinas) and then of modernity have shown the importance of the rational, moral conscience—its autonomous ability to construct an ethical form. Theological thought, likewise, has been able to recognize that revelation does not substitute for but rather conserves moral autonomy, which, thus recognized,<br>

  Abstract: It is clear that, for whoever lives within the Judeo-Christian tradition, the first responsibility that issues from the commandment “You shall not kill” consists of deciding to remain within the covenant-pact and thence too of advocating that all men follow the dictates of rational, universal moral law. This responsibility is never obvious; it ever renews itself, and indeed its perennial renewal is an inexhaustible source of wonder and joy. The covenant-pact and the rational recognition of the splendor of the truth of fundamental moral experience, which shines in every man, is not a thing of the past. It is the<br>

  Author(s) HOFFMAN KATHERINE E.<br>
  Abstract: Power relations inherent in the encounter between anthropologist and informant engaged the advocates of reflexive anthropology working in Morocco (Crapanzano 1980; K. Dwyer 1982; Rabinow 2007 [1977]). Their analyses have reconfigured the practice and writing of ethnography over the last three decades. Questions of truth, disclosure, and suspicion shape not only anthropologists’ relationships in the field, but also the data that can be collected and the forms in which it can be presented to outsiders.

  Author(s) Felperin Leslie<br>
  Abstract: We begin with a true story, but one so dense with stories within its stories, so layered with conflicting versions of the truth, that it seems to have garnered the narrational generative capacities of myth. It would take a modern Sheherezade far more than a thousand-and-one nights tounravel the complex skein of fact and fiction that surrounds the ur-narrative of the Gulf War of 1990. But that is not the purpose of this essay: here we are concerned with tracing how that vast story-cycle of fact is entangled with another story, the fictional film

  Abstract: What does

If “method” has a negative value in the title, then the “and” does not connect, but rather represents an alternative. The title could be revised accordingly asTruth or Method.¹ In an even more radical version, one could think of the formulation:Truth against Method.² If “method” is taken as a model and metaphor for the natural sciences, then truth occursoutsidemethod. Thus it is possible to speak of “extramethodical” experiences of truth.<br>

  Abstract: It may seem surprising—and Gadamer himself admits this in retrospect—that
                  Truth and Method,despite the title’s promise of a close examination of truth, begins with an extensive discussion of art (GR195/GW8373). However, art in particular plays a key role in philosophical hermeneutics, and this is because a new experience of truth can be achieved only from art; thus the need arises to free aesthetics from the quarrel with modern science. The modern scientific demand for objectivity forces aesthetic experience to understand itself merely subjectively, as if we were dealing with a form of subjectivity that is<br>

  Abstract: I am an Enlightenment Jew. My Judaism is marked by a commitment to the primacy of the moral, to the authority of truth and reason, and to the equal worth of all human beings. That this Judaism is both feminist and cosmopolitan follows from its commitment to these three great organizing values.

  Abstract: Who am I? This is the question of the human being seeking self-understanding. It is also a question the incurved self cannot ultimately answer, because it seeks to answer this question itself through reflection on its own possibilities and acts. In order for the self to be put into the truth about itself, it must be addressed by a word from outside of itself. This external word constitutes the self and opens it toward the future. Following our discussion in chapter 4, we can distinguish between two different ways of relating to the future: (1) According to a conditional word,<br>

My criterion of truth is how well we have learned to deal with the fear of one small word, “perhaps.” That, I would say, is a general problem for us all. No one gets a pass.

Indeed it is time to honor the history of the animals that we all are and are following, which I have emblematically called Martha’s world, the world to which we all belong in the most deeply material sense.

Plato launched metaphysics as the search for the truth of the Whole; Heidegger attempted to get back to the ground of metaphysics after it reached its supposed end—in one sense in Hegel and in another sense in Nietzsche. Crucial to Plato is the struggle of philosophy with art over the basis of human existence. The infamous line in the tenth book of the

The positive relative properties, goodness and truth, have received extended treatment by the Scholastics, as has the negative absolute property, unity.

In this chapter I would like to turn the argument around and suggest that the mystery of the incarnation invites us to uphold an analogical metaphysics of being. An ecumenical version of this argument was developed in mid-twentieth-century Catholic theology.

This observation makes plain the ways we may be tempted to draw a straight line from the meaning of a text to the truth of that meaning, assuming that both can be exhaustively captured and assessed on the basis of the written word alone.<br>

People got terribly excited when neuroscientists found a brain circuit that “lit up” when you fell in love; perhaps you remember the splash it made in the papers. We were invited to think that this brain activity told us something about the business of falling in love, just as describing spiritual experience at the brain level seems to have explained that experience away.

As Fugard suggests, play-makers like himself sought ‘to witness as truthfully as [they] could, the nameless and destitute (desperate) of this one little corner of the world’ (1983: 172).

  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Bakiner Onur<br>
  Abstract: Bakiner demonstrates how truth commissions have recovered basic facts about human rights violations, forced societies to rethink the violence and exclusion of nation building, and produced a new dynamic whereby the state seeks to legitimize its central position between history and politics by accepting a high degree of societal penetration into the production and diffusion of official national history. By doing so, truth commissions have challenged and transformed public discourses on memory, truth, justice, reconciliation, recognition, nationalism, and political legitimacy in the contemporary world.<br>

The Commission for Historical Clarification, Guatemala’s truth commission, was going to hand over its final report to the nation’s president, Álvaro Arzú, before an audience of high-ranking civilian and military officials and a number of victims’ groups and human rights organizations. Members of the political elite must have been comfortable enough, thinking that the truth commission, systematically deprived of resources and juridical powers to carry out its mandate, would pre sent relatively uncontroversial results.

In addition, in some countries single incidents of violence have led to calls for a commission when the facts about the event remained in the dark for decades. Two examples that come to mind are the 1985 siege and fire in Colombia’s Palace of Justice¹ and the 1994 bombing of the Israeli-Argentine Mutual Association in Buenos Aires.² Perhaps<br>

  Abstract: Chapter 1 identifies autonomy as a key ele ment of what makes a truth-finding panel a

Commissions are neither state bureaucracies nor pure civil society initiatives. Rather, they come into existence and carry out their tasks through interactions between politicians, bureaucracies, supportive and hostile civil society actors, and the commissioners themselves.

However, their historiographical function has been generally overlooked by transitional justice scholars, as well as historians.¹ It is understandable that temporary panels established primarily for human rights investigation, rather than the publication of professional historiography, fail to draw attention to their engagement with the past. In addition, not all truth commissions complement forensic investigation with a historical narrative. Nonetheless, many truth commissions do take part in academic and nonacademic controversies over the causes, patterns, and consequences of political violence: “The<br>

                  andpost-commission processes to assess claims of truth commission impact. In this chapter I explain whether or not, and the specific ways in which, truth commissionsin facttransform the lessons from history into policy, human rights accountability, and changes in shared social norms.

  Abstract: This chapter zooms into truth commissions in two neighboring countries to examine in detail the creation, procedures, and outcomes of truth-finding panels. The first case is Chile’s 1990 National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation (popularly known as the “Rettig Commission” after its president, Raúl Rettig), and the second case is Peru’s 2001 Truth and Reconciliation Commission (popularly known by its Spanish acronym, “CVR”). The Chilean commission, established by the president and his advisers in the absence of considerable civil society participation, faced mandate constraints. The findings and recommendations satisfied the expectations of the government and were mostly incorporated into political<br>

  Abstract: The enormous variation across truth commissions in terms of goals, findings, recommendations, and impact is explored in Chapters 5 and 6. Truth commissions’ explanations of the under lying causes of past violence and violations exhibit considerable variation as well. No doubt some of the differences owe to the context in which violations happen, as well as the nature of the violations themselves. Yet, one often observes divergent historical narratives describing comparable historical contexts. The civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala had much in common, but the Salvadoran Truth Commission’s overall preference for avoidance and brevity shared little with the<br>

  Abstract: In what ways do truth commissions transform the ways in which citizens of contemporary societies think and speak about historical truth, justice, reconciliation, and official historiography? Transitional justice mea sures, and truth commissions in particular, try to raise awareness around histories of violence and violations in the context of rebuilding state institutions and national identity.¹ Most truth commissions combine meticulous human rights investigation with a critique of the national past in order to rebuild the nation.² Aside from pursuing such goals as delivering a measure of justice and reconciliation, avoiding future violence, strengthening democratic institutions, and enhancing peace and stability,<br>

  Conclusion from:

  Abstract: Thirty years ago nobody could have anticipated that a slightly modified inquiry commission, now called
                  truth commission, would have become among the most widely used political-institutional mechanisms to come to terms with the legacies of violent and divisive periods. They have outlived the transitional justice paradigm, as consolidated democracies and nontransitioning regimes began to opt for truth commissions, too. Calls for subnational, national, and international truth commissions to investigate an ever-expanding list of past violations and injustices are found everywhere. In many countries, the supporters and opponents of a past truth commission still argue bitterly about its achievements and shortcomings<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t7jq">Into the Far Country</a><br>
  Abstract: At the heart of modernity lies a diremption between the rational and the historical, the universal and the particular. Reason confidently calls into doubt the historical enterprise, and so the possibility of a historical ground for truth. The unavailability of the historical, near or far, to the rational subject calls into radical doubt narrative forms that give shape to human life. So it is that G. E. Lessing can axiomatically declare that, “
                  contingent truths of history can never become the proof of necessary truths of reason.”¹ The historical cannot form a point of departure, for the historical remains in flux,<br>

  Book Title: Theology in the Flesh-How Embodiment and Culture Shape the Way We Think about Truth, Morality, and God<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Sanders John<br>
  Abstract: Metaphors and other mental tools are used to reason (not just speak) about God, salvation, truth, and morality. Figurative language structures our theological and moral reasoning in powerful ways. This book uses an approach known as cognitive linguistics to explore the incredibly rich ways our conceptual tools, derived from embodied life and culture, shape the way we understand Christian teachings and practices. The cognitive revolution has generated amazing insights into how human minds make sense of the world. This book applies these insights to the ways Christians think about topics such as God, justice, sin, and salvation. It shows that Christians often share a set of very general ideas but disagree on what the Bible means or the moral stances we should take. It explains why Christians often develop a number of appropriate but sometimes incompatible ways to understand the Bible and various doctrines. It assists Christians in understanding those with whom they disagree. Hopefully, simply better understanding how and why people think the way they do will foster better dialogue and greater humility.<br>

  Abstract: Human embodiment and culture deeply shape the way we think about topics such as sin, salvation, divine judgment, and the nature of truth. The particular kind of body humans have helps produce ways of thinking about the world that are specific to the human species. The concepts available for humans to understand our experience are deeply dependent upon the particular sort of body we have. We use these mental structures to reason about and understand all of our experiences, including religious ones. Whether we think about God, morality, salvation, or truth, our concepts are anthropogenic.<br>

  Book Title: Moments of Silence-Authenticity in the Cultural Expressions of the Iran-Iraq War, 1980-1988<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatanabadi Shouleh<br>
  Abstract: The Iran-Iraq War was the longest conventional war of the 20th century. The memory of it may have faded in the wake of more recent wars in the region, but the harrowing facts remain: over one million soldiers and civilians dead, millions more permanently displaced and disabled, and an entire generation marked by prosthetic implants and teenage martyrdom. These same facts have been instrumentalized by agendas both foreign and domestic, but also aestheticized, defamiliarized, readdressed and reconciled by artists, writers, and filmmakers across an array of identities: linguistic (Arabic, Persian, Kurdish), religious (Shiite, Sunni, atheist), and political (Iranian, Iraqi, internationalist). Official discourses have unsurprisingly tried to dominate the process of production and distribution of war narratives. In doing so, they have ignored and silenced other voices.Centering on novels, films, memoirs, and poster art that gave aesthetic expression to the Iran-Iraq War, the essays gathered in this volume present multiple perspectives on the war's most complex and underrepresented narratives. These scholars do not naively claim to represent an authenticity lacking in official discourses of the war, but rather, they call into question the notion of authenticity itself. Finding, deciding upon, and creating a language that can convey any sort of truth at all-collective, national, or private-is the major preoccupation of the texts and critiques in this diverse collection.<br>

  CHAPTER 1  Narrative Psychology and Historical Consciousness: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbw85">Narration, Identity, and Historical Consciousness</a><br>
  Author(s) Polkinghorne Donald E.<br>
  Abstract: Postmodern theory has severely undercut the notion that historians can produce objective and accurate descriptions of past episodes. Instead, it proposes that discovering the factual truth about historical events is extremely problematic because knowledge production is relative to the values and agenda of the inquirer. The question of the validity of historical knowledge has informed the general topic “Making Sense of History,” the theme of the book series of which the present volume is a part. The postmodern critique of the modernist epistemology of the humanities and social sciences has produced considerable consternation and disturbance in most of these disciplines.<br>

  Abstract: The usual answer to this question is a kind of doxology delivered in the name of “the scientific method”: Thou shalt not indulge self-delusion, nor utter unverifiable propositions, nor commit contradiction, nor treat mere history as cause, and so on. Story is not the accepted stuff of science and “logic.” If meaning-making were always dedicated to achieving a “scientific” understanding of the world, that would be one thing. But neither the empiricist’s knowledge through the senses, nor the rationalist’s route through necessary truths suffice: neither alone nor both together capture how ordinary people go about assigning meanings to their experiences—<br>

  Abstract: At no other time more than in the present day has individual, social and institutional memory come under such concerted pressure, critique and exposure as a fragile foundation for truth and facticity. This current reluctance to authenticate social memory is intimately tied to well-known postmodernist depredations, which profoundly disenchanted the authority of tradition and authenticity, and emptied core institutionalised myths of their temporal and semantic continuity. As institutionalised memory fails to provide overarching master narratives that can win cultural consent, it has also become increasingly disjunctive with previously unnarratable history and experience.

Equally wrenching is the current shattering of white males’ world view, in which they long have seen themselves as the central characters on society’s stage.

  Author(s) MAHONEY MARTHA R.<br>
  Abstract: What is race? A social construct, a concept having no natural truth, no truth separate from historical development, and possibly no truth comprehensible apart from domination. The term has meant different things in this country over time; and its social and cultural meanings continue to change within our own time. In law as well as elsewhere in society the term “race” has been used to stand for several different concepts. Even the Supreme Court, when faced with the question, had to recognize that “race” was a contingent category that shifted over time.¹<br>

  Author(s) MAHONEY MARTHA R.<br>
  Abstract: Transformative work against segregation and racial oppression must directly confront racism and the social construction of race. Whiteness and blackness are not merely mirror images of each other. “White” does not only mean “opposite of Other” but also stands for the dominant, transparent norm that defines what attributes of race should be counted, how to count them, and who (as in white employers or mortgage bankers) gets to do the counting. Therefore, destabilizing “Other” -ness doesn’t entirely destabilize the dominance of whiteness. Even though race has no natural reality or truth, it has great social force. More work is required,<br>

                     Key Writings.¹ In the Christian tradition, God too often is perceived as a fixed entity that is absolutely transcendent. Instead, we need a God who would be an inspiration to develop ourselves fully and to live fully our relation to the other, to others, and to the world around us. Even though Irigaray is critical of the Western religious tradition,² in her recent work she more and more understands religion as an indispensable and valuable dimension of human life.<br>

  Abstract: We have to begin by reminding ourselves of this simple truth: that “the Word became flesh”—it was not the flesh that became word, it was not the carnal that became spiritual or must become spiritual. Contrary to the usual accusations brought against Christianity, to spiritualize the flesh and its affectations would simply amount to getting Christianity backwards—it would mean to undo Christianity and worse “in its name.” Finally, it would mean to unravel Christianity’s absolutely nonnegotiable claim, the claim by which Christianity stands or falls, that “the Word became flesh.”<br>

  Book Title: Re-treating Religion: Deconstructing Christianity with Jean-Luc Nancy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nancy Jean-Luc<br>
  Abstract: One of the most complicated and ambiguous tendencies in contemporary western societies is the phenomenon referred to as the turn to religion.In philosophy, one of the most original thinkers critically questioning this turnis Jean-Luc Nancy. Re-treating Religion is the first volume to analyze his long-term project The Deconstruction of Christianity,especially his major statement of it in Dis-Enclosure.Nancy conceives monotheistic religion and secularization not as opposite worldviews that succeed each other in time but rather as springing from the same history. This history consists in a paradoxical tendency to contest one's own foundations-whether God, truth, origin, humanity, or rationality-as well as to found itself on the void of this contestation. Nancy calls this unique combination of self-contestation and self-foundation the self-deconstructionof the Western world.The book includes discussion with Nancy himself, who contributes a substantial Preambleand a concluding dialogue with the volume editors. The contributions follow Nancy in tracing the complexities of Western culture back to the persistent legacy of monotheism, in order to illuminate the tensions and uncertainties we face in the twenty-first century.<br>

  Author(s) KATE LAURENS ten<br>
  Abstract: The central characteristic of monotheism may be, not the exclusive acknowledgement of a single God, but something that Jan Assmann recently named the “Mosaic distinction.”¹ This distinction is twofold. According to Assmann, it primarily designates the discordant difference between true and false religion, and between a true and a false God.² Assmann demonstrates how this distinction turned the natural and obvious presence of religion itself into a
                  problem. Religion had to interrogate its truth instead of simply coinciding with it—“being” its own truth—and in this way its presence was no longer guaranteed, nor was that of its God:<br>

  Abstract: Michel Henry pursued throughout his career a remarkable, and remarkably consistent, account of disclosive mood. As a phenomenologist of affectivity, it is no surprise that Henry focused his attention on specific tonalities that reveal a privileged truth. Early in his career Henry emphasized despair as the privileged tonality, but later he dispensed with despair and instead preferred to speak of anxiety. Despite the change in vocabulary, however, in each case his interpretation of what the disclosive mood discloses is the same.¹ Beyond the sort of disclosure characteristic of any ordinary feeling, a disclosive mood, according to Henry, reveals the self<br>

On the other hand (even though he denies it), his argumentation has crypto-theological accents to it: being, which conceals itself in its own names, like the unutterable God of negative theology, safeguarding its truth in a meditative and almost religious experience.

Out of the flat geometrical order, war emerges as a fully formed three-dimensional world governed by an operational dynamic that allows only hypothetical scenarios, average truths, a spectrum of probabilities. In its tremendous complexity, war is a blurry object in which a pervasive disorder obtains. But even as some seek to exclude the state of war from the realm of epistemology—be it in philosophical and military treatises or in<br>

  Book Title: Returning to Reality-Christian Platonism for our Times<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Tyson Paul<br>
  Abstract: Could it be that we have lost touch with some basic human realities in our day of high-tech efficiency, frenetic competition, and ceaseless consumption? Have we turned from the moral, the spiritual, and even the physical realities that make our lives meaningful? These are metaphysical questions -questions about the nature of reality- but they are not abstract questions. These are very down to earth questions that concern power and the collective frameworks of belief and action governing our daily lives. This book is an introduction to the history, theory, and application of Christian metaphysics. Yet this book is not just an introduction, it is also a passionately argued call for a profound change in the contemporary Christian mind. Paul Tyson argues that as Western culture’s Christian Platonist understanding of reality was replaced by modern pragmatic realism, we turned not just from one outlook on reality to another, but away from reality itself. This book seeks to show that if we can recover this ancient Christian outlook on reality, reframed for our day, then we will be able to recover a way of life that is in harmony with human and divine truth.<br>

But it seems to me that a “middle position” must, by definition, compromise the truths of both religion and economics. Indeed, such a premise accepts what is one of the primary problems with modern economics, namely, the belief in the so-called “equity/efficiency” trade-off. That is, the belief that an economic system can be equitable or it can be efficient, but it cannot be both.<br>

  4  Tradition as Body from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf0ht">Radical Embodiment</a><br>
  Abstract: Tradition Having argued for the body within tradition, I now argue for tradition as body. The metaphorical phrase, “the body of a tradition,” is well-known. Indeed, as such a conventional and familiar a metaphor, its metaphorical power has long been lost in ordinary usage. I suspect though that the original inventor(s) of the phrase intuited some vital truth about the nature of tradition. In any case, I desire to make this metaphor fresh again by arguing that the prereflective givenness of tradition strongly parallels the prereflective givenness of the human body. Our traditions, like our bodies, constitute our life and<br>

  5  Radical Embodiment in Light of the Science and Religion Dialogue from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf0ht">Radical Embodiment</a><br>
  Abstract: In creating humankind God sculpted “the earth being,” according to the etymology of “Adam,” the Hebrew word for “humanity” used in Genesis 2. The portrait of humankind painted by the scriptures of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam regards the human person as a psycho-somatic unity. Scientific evidence increasingly points to the truth that human beings are fundamentally embodied in nature, contrary to the Greek-influenced mind-body dualism that has reigned for most of Western theological and philosophical history. In this chapter I will highlight the significance of our embodiment relative to evolutionary biology and to the nature of consciousness in light of<br>

What transforms approaches to reconciliation from being empty verbal niceties or guilt-assuaging “quick fixes” to dynamic expressions of the gospel? What is it that makes people empathetic, caring, compassionate, forgiving, and ultimately loving toward those who are “other”?

  Abstract: In the previous chapter we said that metaphors provide us with a manner of speaking of God that is neither too human in its univocity, too nebulous in equivocity, too ungrounded as with analogy, while being both functional and context-sensitive. We now take a closer look at how metaphors convey information, the type of information they bear, and their ability to make truth-conditional propositions. As we shall see, these factors directly impact subsequent interpretations of the Bible, including its descriptions of God.<br>

  Abstract: In his 1982 book,
                  The Quest for the Historical Israel: Reconstructing Israel’s Early History, G.W. Ramsey devotes a chapter to the question, ‘If Jericho was not Razed, is our Faith in Vain?’¹ The question is a witty allusion to 1 Corinthians 15:14 (if Christ has not been raised, then … your faith has been in vain). Ramsey asks the question in order to consider how the ‘historical truth’ of an Old Testament narrative affects its theological value. In other words, if Jericho was not utterly destroyed as described in Joshua 6, then does the story lack truth and theological value?<br>

Plato, a pupil of Socrates, uses the analogy of a cave to illustrate his well-known and powerful image of the human condition in his book

  Abstract: The occlusion of the mother’s smile is the death of sacramental presence. The mother’s smile is the kiss of Being, the sign or symbol of all that is gratuitous, all that is gift, and therefore all that is non-calculative, nonmechanical, and non-violent. Its erasure therefore erodes the sacramental foundation of grace. A sacramental “sign,” it is also a phenomenological and metaphysical sign, a “real,” existent form from which breaks forth the splendor of the depths of Being. It signifies the permanence of the truth, goodness, and beauty of the created order. As form, it also refers to infinity, for “it<br>

  Abstract: In Part One, the

Beginning with language, this raises a hermeneutical problem: how to determine meaning, significance, from speech or text. But theskandalonof the body is also a hermeneutical problem: how to “read” the body, especially the present absence of Christ’s “displaced” body, which overextends its bounds and incorporates all bodies. In both cases, we encounter a plurisignificance that is unsettling. It seems there is no possibility of singular or univocal meaning.

  Book Title: Grasping Truth and Reality-Lesslie Newbigin's Theology of Mission to the Western World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Le Roy Stults Donald<br>
  Abstract: When Lesslie Newbigin returned to Britain in 1974 after years of missionary service, he observed that his homeland was as much a mission field as India, where he had spent the majority of his missionary career. He concluded that the Western world needed a missionary confrontation. Instead of the traditional approach to missions, however, Newbigin realized that the Western world needed to be confronted theologically. From his earliest days at Cambridge University, Newbigin developed the theological convictions that shaped his understanding of the Christian faith, and he used these theological convictions as criteria to evaluate the belief system of Western culture and to provide an answer to its dilemma. The Enlightenment reintroduced humanism and dualism into Western culture, which resulted on the loss of purpose and the rise of skepticism. This book discusses Newbigin's theological convictions and how they factored into both his critique of and his solution to Western culture's spiritual and worldview problems. Donald Le Roy cleverly explains Newbigin's solution to reintroduce the Christian belief system into Western culture in order to restore purpose and truth to Westerners and put them back in contact with true reality through Jesus Christ.<br>

  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Ille George<br>
  Abstract: The present study seeks to respond theologically to current discussions about ideas of self from the perspective of God’s action in and towards the world. Its aim is to trace a view of rationality that follows the drama of God’s engagement with the world, thus involving dying and resurrection, ascesis and abundance, suffering witness and Eucharistic communion. Since, as Calvin notes, knowledge of God and knowledge of self are intimately bound together, this exercise of discerning the shape of a theological rationality in the present arena of competing promises of meaning and truth is carried out on two levels: the theological and the anthropological.<br>

  Abstract: The work of Paul Ricoeur has inspired an impressive amount of literature. The formidable breadth of his philosophical compass, including as it does, fields as diverse as literary criticism and analytic philosophy, psychoanalysis and biblical interpretation, not only recapitulates the battles and aspirations of his own generation, but witnesses to the living tension between reflection and action, past and present, academic vogues and enduring truths.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf5zz">Between Vision and Obedience - Rethinking Theological Epistemology</a><br>
  Abstract: Does Ricoeur’s proposal enable us to experience the world as “Creation”? Can we, following the indication of his thought, not only “think” the truth but know it? With these questions we have reached a turning point. Our investigation so far, while mainly “descriptive,” has already raised a number of theological questions in an effort to ground theologically our experience of the world in general, Ricoeur’s philosophical undertaking in particular.

  Abstract: This book adds to a litany of works in recent years that argue for a theological significance of the body. It shares the sentiment of Matthew’s gospel that the theological meaning of the body exceeds outer apparel, even the language used to describe it or the metaphors with which it is dressed. It is indeed “more than clothes.” However, this book resists the temptation to merely propose a carnivalesque or reductionist postmodern account of the human person in which goodness and truth are tied to the pleasures of the body.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf9rs">Contextual Theology</a><br>
  Abstract: The rise of the “new Christianity” has led Christian theologians to retrieve insights within Christian traditions that are helpful as the faith takes root and forms new and vital communities and practices. According to these traditions, good theology is not a search for universal truths that can be applied in all contexts and times, but rather an engagement with the lives of peoples and communities. The eschatological framework of Christian thinking and the centrality of theological theories of God’s grace ensure the openness of Christian thinking to new contexts. The creation of new Christian communities is a social and cultural<br>

  Abstract: Historical and social realities provide textual meaning with its temporal and cultural limits and possibilities. We experience our world because we are part of a world. For our faith to have meaning it must be meaningful in a particular historical, cultural, and social context. The question of whether and how the meaning of the beliefs and practices of Christian faith can be translated into those that share the same truth in other cultures becomes acute. For the claims of Christian conviction to be true they must be commensurable. All this leads to an assertion: once the faith has been shared,<br>

The crisis of postmodernity affects both the “supply” and “demand” of ethics, that is of moral knowledge and action, of truth and agency, and embodying and doing the good. Without a coherent moral ontology there is no coherent understanding of moral realism; we cannot have a coherent view of the good because we cannot account for the moral structure<br>

  Abstract: The words of Jesus pose the greatest challenge to scholars seeking to identify the message of Jesus within his ministry. If the historical Jesus indeed spoke in parables about the kingdom of God—a near-certain likelihood—why does John’s narrative include no Synoptic-like parables, and why is the kingdom of God mentioned only in John 3:3,5? There Jesus declares access to the kingdom requires being born from above, and in John 18:36–37 he describes the character of his kingdom as one of truth; but unlike the teachings of the Synoptic Jesus, John’s kingdom sayings are contrastive statements (the kingdom<br>

  Abstract: In my understanding of theology, the meaning of religious convictions always depends on a particular language game, i.e. on a certain theological context.¹ Because, for example, the sentence “God is love” can point to different meanings depending on to whom and in what context it is said, one can understand it adequately only if one perceives it as embedded in a particular dialogue or language game. Therefore, comparative theology can never result in a universal theory about religions and truth.² Because the meanings of basic religious beliefs within particular traditions are diverse, comparative theology focuses on select details within particular<br>

Traditionally, these theologies of religious diversity have been divided into three major paradigms: exclusivism, inclusivism, and pluralism.
                  Exclusivismmaintains that salvation is given only through Christ to those that explicitly embrace faith, the Church, and/or Christianity.

  Abstract: We have seen that
                  Dei Verbumexpansively recapitulates medieval exegesis. Building on the letter as the intrinsic symbol of the spirit, it understands divine revelation as a system of continuous symbols that join together Christ, his words and works, the apostolic tradition of the church, and the written scriptures and their interpretation. Whenever a synthesis is grounded in symbolism, its aesthetic dimension cannot help but be invoked. Heidegger reminds us, for instance, that symbolism constitutes the essence of art.¹ In the creative fashioning of an artifact, truth itself is preserved as beauty.

Language is no longer the channel through which Being and man come to belong to one another; the fictive essence of language according to Blanchot deprives the subject of self and robs the real of sense. If Heidegger regards poetry as a truthful principle that is the source and foundation of man’s dwelling, Blanchot assigns it an illusory principle that affects both the experience of the writer and the written work itself.

  Abstract: Though lying is not the same as storytelling, the two are not entirely unrelated. Both involve the construction and communication of counterfactual propositions and narratives. The difference between the two is in both the intent of the speaker and the understanding of the audience. Liars know the truth and attempt to conceal it, usually to advantage themselves at the expense of their auditors.

All that separates Don Quixote and Scheherazade is a thin layer of self-consciousness about the fictional nature of their shared enterprise; Scheherazade understands that the truths she tells her husband are embedded in fictions, while Quixote believes that the fictions he tells himself are derived from the truth. Quixote deceives himself, but this does not mean that his fictions are not useful. In many cases his fantastic stories are more valuable to him<br>

  Abstract: Human beings are not fact machines—beings who scan the environment for information and then process it in their extremely large brains to produce pasteurized lumps of truth. Thomas Gradgrind’s vision in Charles Dickens’s
                  Hard Times—a board of fact, composed of commissioners of fact, who will force the people to be a people of fact—has never been realized.¹ Through the course of the novel, Gradgrind comes to understand that human beings are not governed by facts and that they cannot be forced into a world of fact without a substantial amount of violence against their very natures.

  Abstract: “When I was seeking some meaning in literature for myself,” Vizenor recalls, “some identity for myself as a writer, I found it easily in the mythic connections” (quoted in Owens,
                  Other Destinies239). His earlier autobiographical essays, collected inInterior Landscapes: Autobiographical Myths and Metaphors, equate fact with myth and myth with truth in accordance with the etymology ofmyth: “word, truth, speech” (Greekmuthos>*Indo-Europeanmudh, “to think, imagine”). In early Greek usage myth designates an oral pronouncement made to an audience, and Vizenor follows this mold as a maker of myth, neither in the Tolkien political or C.<br>

  Book Title: Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging meditation on the nature and purpose of hermeneutics, Gerald L. Bruns argues that hermeneutics is not merely a contemporary theory but an extended family of questions about understanding and interpretation that have multiple and conflicting histories going back to before the beginning of writing.What does it mean to understand a riddle, an action, a concept, a law, an alien culture, or oneself? Bruns expands our sense of the horizons of hermeneutics by situating its basic questions against a background of different cultural traditions and philosophical topics. He discusses, for example, the interpretation of oracles, the silencing of the muses and the writing of history, the quarrel between philosophy and poetry, the canonization of sacred texts, the nature of allegorical exegesis, rabbinical midrash, the mystical exegesis of the Qur'an, the rise of literalism and the individual interpreter, and the nature of Romantic hermeneutics. Dealing with thinkers ranging from Socrates to Luther to Wordsworth to Ricoeur, Bruns also ponders several basic dilemmas about the nature of hermeneutical experience, the meaning of tradition, the hermeneutical function of narrative, and the conflict between truth and freedom in philosophy and literature. His eloquent book demonstrates the continuing power of hermeneutical thinking to open up questions about the world and our place in it.<br>

  Abstract: It is in the spirit of these words by Heidegger that I want to ask about the discourse of Socrates—how he talks, how he sounds, and also what it is to understand him; and I mean all of this to be taken pointedly as a hermeneutical question. What is it for anyone, including Socrates, to understand Socrates? This is the question at issue in Plato’s

  Abstract: It must be acknowledged that hermeneutics belongs to the realm of opinion, or rhetoric, rather than to the realm of truth, or philosophy.¹ But it seems part of every hermeneutical desire to cross the threshold of rhetoric and to speak, well, philosophically. My purpose in this chapter is to consider one or two ancient examples of this desire. These examples are related to the question of tradition, that is, the question of how we stand with respect to all that comes down to us from the past. A main problem about tradition is that things do not seem exactly to<br>

  Abstract: What is a Continental philosophy of religion?¹ Philosophy of religion, in English-speaking countries, has a clear and distinct identity, and has been enjoying a resurgence: it focuses largely on the truth-claims, rationality, and coherence of religious propositions, and particularly those of “classical theism.”² Yet for those who work in the traditions of philosophy derived from Germany and France, the problems, tasks, concepts, reasoning, and cultural location are markedly different from this identity. When even the individual terms of the phrase “Continental philosophy of religion” are highly contestable, can this title designate any determinate field? In spite of its weaknesses, this<br>

  Abstract: The title of this paper refers to the peculiar and indeed special role played by the concepts of nature, in general, and natural beauty, in particular, in Adorno’s philosophy. In fact, since Adorno’s early works of the 1930s up to his mature works of the 1960s, nature seems to represent what has been systematically repressed in the course of civilization. Hence, if observed from a dialectical point of view and expressed in somehow Pinkfloydian terms, nature appears as something like “the dark side of the truth” (or, in a more Springsteenian fashion, the “darkness” that lies “at the edge of<br>

  Abstract: The enigma of the work of modern art is also the name for its constitutive character. The character of this self-contradicting existence is what makes the work of art into the occasion for a baffling and befuddling encounter. The complement to enigma in the work of art is its truth content. Key to engaging the work of art’s enigma and truth content is the mimetic relation between experience and the work of art. The misalignment between the work of art and human experience is an opportunity for encountering what exists as objective contradiction. The ongoing dance between the mimetic misalignments<br>

  Book Title: Supper at Emmaus-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): OLSEN GLENN W.<br>
  Abstract: Supper at Emmaus traces various important intellectual topics from the ancient world to the modern period. Generally, as in its treatment of the question of whether the long-standing contrast between cyclical and linear views of history is helpful, it introduces important thinkers who have considered the question. A preoccupation of the book is the appearance and reappearance across the centuries of patterns used to organize temporal and cultural experience. After an opening essay on transcendental truth and cultural relativism, the second chapter traces a distinction, common in historical writings during the past two centuries, between an alleged ancient classical "cyclic" view of time and history, used to describe the claimed repetitiveness of and similarities between historical events ("nothing is new under the sun"), and a contrasting Jewish-Christian linear view, sometimes described as providential in that it moves through a series of unique events to some end intended by God. In the latter, history is "about something," the education of the human race or the redemption of humankind. As in each of the remaining essays, the book then attempts to draw out the limitations of what the current consensus on this topic has become. It does this for such things as our current understanding of religious toleration, humanism, natural law, and teleology. Some of the essays, such as those on debate about Augustine's understanding of marriage or the concluding illustrated essay on the baroque city of Lecce, are published for the first time. Others are based on previously published contributions to the scholarly literature, though generally each of these chapters concludes with a postscript that engages with current scholarly debate on the subject.<br>

However, this does not mean that our explanation of human nature and of the human person need be involved or complicated. In fact, anthropology seeks above all a once-off, simple, unitary, integrated explanation of human identity. The search for truth, in fact, is always a search for unity, for simplicity, for harmony, for coherence. In other words, in order to<br>

On the basis of this knowledge they desire and attempt to achieve their ultimate identity, to realize themselves. I have used the terms “to know” and “to achieve” because all persons, as they know themselves and act, experience a discrepancy between the concrete situation they are in (their present identity or situation, concrete, finite, and mundane) and an ultimate ideal to which they aspire (a fullness of identity that is definitive, ideal, or,<br>

On the one hand, the evangelist seldom uses the term “grace”; he does so only on three occasions, in fact.¹ The first is in John 1:14: “And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth.” It is interesting to note how “grace” and “truth” are closely associated in this passage.² The second is as follows: “From his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace” (Jn 1:16): what the Word possesses in fullness, grace, he communicates generously to humanity.

It accomplished this in three stages: at the beginning the imitation theory prevailed, next the expressive theory, and at the end the symbolic theory made a tentative entrance.

Whereas psychoanalytic theory relies on a horizon of truthfulness, psychoanalytic praxis revolves around an alert attention to the probable fictiveness of the analysand’s truth (intentional statements, recovered memories) and the probable truthfulness of his or her fictions (performative acting-out, symbolic transferences).

Truth, then, is deployed as a

                  humus, to be of the soil or the dirt. Yet for millennia people from around the world have searched the heavens for answers to earthly questions. The stars, planets, and comets, it is believed, might offer gifts of illumination, providing potential signs of the future, premonitions of what is yet to come. Unfortunately, celestial bodies do not readily reveal their secrets. Their truth is latent, waiting to be unconcealed. Interpreting their meaning demands effort, and this can be a risky enterprise. Signals can get crossed, and beholders can lose sight of their position. The<br>

  Book Title: The Vision of the Soul-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson James Matthew<br>
  Abstract: Ours is an age full of desires but impoverished in its understanding of where those desires lead-an age that claims mastery over the world but also claims to find the world as a whole absurd or unintelligible. In
      The Vision of the Soul, James Matthew Wilson seeks to conserve the great insights of the western tradition by giving us a new account of them responsive to modern discontents. The western- or Christian Platonist-tradition, he argues, tells us that man is an intellectual animal, born to pursue the good, to know the true, and to contemplate all things in beauty. Wilson begins by reconceiving the intellectual conservatism born of Edmund Burke's jeremiad against the French Revolution as an eff­ort to preserve the West's vision of man and the cosmos as ordered by and to beauty. After defining the achievement of that vision and its tradition, Wilson off­ers an extended study of the nature of beauty and the role of the fine arts in shaping a culture but above all in opening the human intellect to the perception of the form of reality. Through close studies of Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Maritain, he recovers the classical vision of beauty as a revelation of truth and being. Finally, he revisits the ancient distinction between reason and story-telling, between mythos and logos, in order to rejoin the two.Story-telling is foundational to the forms of the fine arts, but it is no less foundational to human reason. Human life in turn constitutes a specific kind of form-a story form. The ancient conception of human life as a pilgrimage to beauty itself is one that we can fully embrace only if we see the essential correlation between reason and story and the essential convertibility of truth, goodness and beauty in beauty. By turns a study in fundamental ontology, aesthetics, and political philosophy, Wilson's book invites its readers to a renewal of the West's intellectual tradition.<br>

  THREE  We Must Retranslate Kalon from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pv897r">The Vision of the Soul</a><br>
  Abstract: Even before the elections in November 2008, particularly astute conservatives had lamented that many of the supposed victories for their cause were in truth nothing to celebrate. In the years since, the volume of this lament has grown to the point of becoming audible within the main corridors of contemporary political debate. Most of these persons were “paleo” or traditional conservatives, who saw in the George W. Bush administration little that was genuinely conservative and much that testified to the further usurpation of the word “conservative,” and of the Republican Party, by a neo-conservative agenda.¹ That agenda was largely repugnant<br>

  Abstract: In the last chapter, I concluded with the observation that the form of Theodor W. Adorno’s philosophy is patterned on his vision of the artwork. We must ask, then, what is art itself and whence comes the truth it reveals? I shall discuss four ways of thinking about art that seem to command the attention of the skeptic who doubts its value as anything more than an empty gesture of liberal humanism. These four ways are also, in a qualified way, consonant with the account, which is a central claim of this book, of the reality of beauty as a<br>

  Abstract: One can readily see how Maritain’s Thomistic reflections on art at once flattered and admonished the artists of Paris’s Left Bank and beyond. He corrected the romantic intuitionism of those who had learned from Kant that artistic beauty was that which pleases universally
                  without a concept, but who had blended that philosopher’s theory of genius with the sensationalism of Hume and Burke so that art had come to be thought of as not only beyond all intelligible rules save those the genius himself imposes, but also derived from something other than the intelligence. Maritain did this by rearticulating whatever truth<br>

  Abstract: It is now time to weave together a number of threads we have followed in earlier parts of this book, and to define what they have to tell us on the role of narrative in human life—and particularly in the life of reason and its vocation to truth. As we have seen in discussing both Burke and Dante, venerable claims have been made in our tradition for the power of the poetic and literary imagination; but Burke’s counter-revolutionary importance should also remind us that many of those claims have been compensatory for losses experienced elsewhere.

  Author(s) KOZOL WENDY<br>
  Abstract: Critics of the U.S. War on Terror have long called for an alternative optic to the relentlessly myopic perspective of American news media. The presumption behind this call to look elsewhere is that doing so will reveal images that are authentic or compelling enough to disabuse American spectators of their ambivalence about the casualties of militarized violence. This logic imagines the grisly “truth” of war to happen somewhere beyond or outside the frame of mainstream representations of combat. What happens, however, when conflict photographers who seek visually graphic and affectively searing images of war find evidence of its banality instead?<br>

  Abstract: In “Sugar,” a short story first published in the

Byatt’s narrator, faced with the terminal illness of her father, finds herself considering how family history is transmitted: the ways in which such transmission is affected by the time and place of narration, the state of mind of the narrator, and the purposes of the storytelling itself. Her father has always been a taciturn man, but in his final illness becomes a storyteller, seeming to want to fill in gaps and set records straight<br>

  Abstract: This statement typifies attitudes about history and memory in midseventeenth-century Chinese memoirs. The author, like everyone everywhere, past or present (for all we know, since there exists no large body of memoirs earlier than the seventeenth century in China and Europe), grants that his memory is incomplete but insists that what he does remember is basically sound.

  Author(s): Myers Jacob D.<br>
  Abstract: The real question for homiletics in our increasingly postmodern, post-Christian contexts is not how are we going to prevent preaching from dying, but how are we going to help it die a good death. Preaching was not made to live. At most, preaching is a witness, a sign, a crimson X marking a demolition site. The church has developed sophisticated technologies in modernity to give preaching the semblance of life, belying the truth: preaching was born under a death sentence. It was born to die. Only when preaching embraces its own death is it able to truly live.<br>

  Abstract: How many times have pastors read this passage at a hospital bedside where the extremities of pain and fear and death hover? Here is compressed a seminal confession of faith that often serves in those moments as the preeminent word of pastoral care.

We become what we hate. The very act of hating something draws it to us. Since our hate is usually a direct response to an evil done to us, our hate almost invariably causes us to respond in the terms already laid down by the enemy.

Trekkers who, without having responded yet to the summons of the Bible, are nevertheless seriously thinking about the human predicament, may be considered (from a Christian perspective) as walking with one leg.

So I assume my readers are ready for an actualization of Christian faith in accordance with the concerns, hesitancies, worries, and questions about affective fulfillment, the meaning of human life, and truth, which were described in the introduction and in chapter 1.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wvwdtb">Rethinking Sincerity and Authenticity</a><br>
  Abstract: Immanuel Kant’s preoccupation with self-congruence reveals itself most famously—or infamously, depending on your point of view—in his absolute prohibition against lying. However, as this first chapter demonstrates, Kant mounts a passionate, repeated, and multidimensional endorsement of self-congruence that encompasses more than the conformity between what I think and what I say. Reading through Kant’s practical philosophy—from the early ethics lectures (1762) through
                  The Metaphysics of Morals(1797) and beyond—one finds Kant’s repeated affirmation of (1) truthfulness, (2) sincerity, (3) autonomy, and (4) character.¹ To clarify Kant’s views, the following discussion focuses on these specific forms of<br>

  Abstract: The discipline of comparative theology is steadily growing and diversifying. While it is often seen as originating within Christian, and predominantly Roman Catholic, theological circles, it is increasingly practiced by Christians of other denominations and by other religious traditions. And comparative theologians of any one tradition are presented with a seemingly endless possibility of choice in terms of which tradition, which text, or which aspect of that tradition to engage in comparative work. Once other religions are recognized as possible resources for constructive religious reflection and insight, there is no limit to where such truth or insight might manifest itself<br>

There is no a priori grasping of truth—although there is an intuitive guess in its regard—but only the arduous path of the imaginative exploration of, and eventual ontological validation of, possible worlds.¹ This dual sense of description of a world of meaning and subscription to it in the form of a corresponding way of life is conveyed by the notion of truth as “attestation.” In the first part of this chapter, therefore, we further probe

When the Church hears the word of God, revelation overflows Scripture itself and passes into the Church’s liturgy, practice, and dogma.¹ When the word is heard the first response is praise (liturgy).

However, the intuitions of a fictionalized biography motivated by love for its subject might convey a “plausible” life bearing a mysterious affinity for “the poet’s work, if not the poet himself.”⁴ This relatively early statement on this subject by Nabokov, made during centennial celebrations of Aleksandr Pushkin’s death, becomes poignant in light of Nabokov’s novel Pale Fire<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005tww">The Essential Caputo</a><br>
  Abstract: The history of Western metaphysics, according to Martin Heidegger, is a centuries-old “oblivion of Being” (
                  Seinsvergessenheit), the shadow of which reaches all the way from Anaximander to Nietzsche (WM, l l/210).¹ If Heidegger himself claims to have recalled Being itself, Being in its truth, Western metaphysics has contented itself with various counterfeits for Being, either with generic categorizations of beings in general, or with a causal first-being, a being which causes other beings. No matter how loudly it protests to the contrary, in metaphysics Being is forsaken in favor of beings. Yet the followers of Thomas Aquinas have argued with<br>

  Abstract: The resources and strategies of negative theology, its “detours, locutions and syntax” (
                  Marg., 6/6),² have always fascinated Jacques Derrida, and that is because for Derrida, as for negative theology, our desire beyond desire is for what lies “beyond being,” to use a venerable expression from Christian Neoplatonism. But what lies “beyond being” for Derrida is tears, prayers and tears, tears shed beyond being (V, 42/40), prayers sent like sighs beyond being, truth, and knowledge. That produces, on the one hand, a remarkable proximity of his work to negative theology, even as, on the other hand, it opens up an abyss<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005tww">The Essential Caputo</a><br>
  Abstract: “Postmodernism,” on my reading, is the issue of a crisis in hermeneutics. It is a radicalization of the problem of
                  hermeneusisthat faces up to the fact that hermeneutics has no metaphysical backup, no Hegelian assurances that the truth is inevitably working itself out, continually being reappropriated again and again. It is a more merciless hermeneutics that does not so much deny “tradition,” as its critics charge, as redefine tradition as a highly factical, fortuitous, and almost hopelessly complex accumulation of competing subtraditions, power plays, and incommensurable language games, along with a dash of wisdom here and there.

  Abstract: Thirteen years into the twenty-first century, much of the promise of the postmodern era has begun to materialize for the field of architecture. Technology has caught up with imagination, and our tolerance for evanescence, contingency, and multiplicity has found consonances in a world of informatics and bioengineering that transgress old boundaries of form, order, and identity. In the field of architecture, the chaotic character of earlier decades (when we drew sharp angles with dissonant relationships to show that we were no longer seeking a singular truth) is morphing into an appreciation and understanding of deep pattern.

Communing with these spirits and with the London of old—nay, with the Southwark of old—we have a contemporary shaman, who reminds us that we stand before a “singlewomen’s graveyard,” although in truth it is a much later site than the one he refers to in the account of the Tudor chronicler and lay cartographer John Stow.

  Abstract: At first glance, our era appears to have discovered its truth. Liberated from its inhibitions, it can now bare itself, naked. It can let its masks fall and shed its costumes. The era of repression (supposing there ever really was one) has given way to an era of disinhibition—but at what price, for whom, and how long will it last? Indeed, in the salty marshes of this nascent century, there is nothing left to hide. All taboos have been lifted; all interdictions banished.

  Book Title: Novelas españolas ambientadas en Italia-Fra Filippo Lippi de Emilio Castelar; Bomarzo de Manuel Mujica Lainez<br>
  Publisher: Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca<br>
  Author(s): SANTOS M.ª ALMUDENA MATEOS<br>
  Abstract: Las fuentes en las que se fundamenta la novela histórica proporcionan, además de una ambientación correcta de la acción, la veracidad necesaria para que el lector reconozca el trabajo llevado a cabo por el autor. Este estudio se centra en descubrir las fuentes históricas, literarias, artísticas, religiosas y culturales de dos novelas muy diferentes que comparten un marco común, el Renacimiento Italiano. Mientras que en Fra Filippo Lippi de Emilio Castelar (1877-1879) la exactitud histórica se presenta sólo en determinados capítulos que parecen ralentizar la acción, en Bomarzo de Manuel Mujica Lainez (1962), lo histórico está tan integrado que es difícil detectar qué parte se corresponde con la historia y cuál con la ficción. Las fuentes consultadas por los autores e incorporadas al texto narrativo proporcionan laexhaustividad necesaria para que el ambiente histórico recreado sea preciso. Al confrontar dichas fuentes con el texto literario se observa cómo, además, el marco creado ayuda a delimitarla psicología de los protagonistas, pues, aunque son personajes históricos, los autores crean una vida de ficción a partir de los hechos históricos. Por otro lado, las referencias literarias (correspondientes a un periodo que va desde los siglos XV y XVI hasta el presente de los autores) aportan el marco necesario para que los protagonistas sean portadores de una nueva inmortalidad. La exactitud de las descripciones, la configuración de los caracteres tanto renacentistas como contemporáneos, las perspectivas artísticas o religiosas, configuran estas dos obras en una serie de coincidencias difíciles de obviar.The sources, which the historical novel is based on, provide the correct setting of the action and the necessary truthfulness for the reader to recognise the work carried out by the author. This research focuses on discovering the historical, literary, artistic, religious and cultural sources of two very different novels that share common framework of the Italian Renaissance. In Fra Filippo Lippi by Emilio Catelar (1877-1879) the historical accuracy is presented only incertain chapters, and slow down the action, whereas in Bomarzo by Manuel Mujica Lainez (1962), historical facts are integrated in such a way that it is difficult to detect which parts belong to fiction or non-fiction. The sources consulted by the authors and which are incorporated into the narrative text provide the necessary detail for the recreated historical environment to be accurate. Additionally, when comparing these historical sources with the literary text, it is obvious how the historical facts help to demonstrate the psychology of the main characters because, although they are historical characters, the authors create a living fiction based on historical events. The literary references, belonging to a period that covers the fifteenth and sixteenth century to the present of authors contribute the necessary details so that the main characters are bearers o fa new immortality. The accuracy of descriptions, the representation of both Renaissance and Contemporary characters and artistic and religious perspectives present us with a series of coincidences too obvious to ignore.<br>

  Author(s) Jonsson-Skradol Natalia<br>
  Abstract: Hannah Arendt remarked that one of the paradoxes inherent in totalitarian states is that, on the one hand, their professed veneration of transformations induces in them a deep-seated fear of stability and permanence, but on the other hand, for these regimes to function, their institutions require a certain degree of predictability and continuity.¹ The Soviet experience, reproduced in different versions multiple times beyond the borders of the country, is a testimony to the truth of this statement. At the same time, it also points to yet another aporia at the heart of the great political and cultural experiment. As the<br>

Later he says of Morelli that toward the end of his career “he could write only with effort, examining at every turn a possible opposite, the hidden fallacy … suspicious that every clear idea was inevitably a mistake or half-truth, mistrusting the words …” (440).

  Author(s) Shannon Daniel E.<br>
  Abstract: Kenneth Schmitz has written on a great number of philosophical subjects, often dealing with questions of humanity and its relation to the transcendentals: being, truth, unity, beauty, and goodness. In some of his writings he has focused not just on the metaphysics, but also on the aesthetics of this relationship. For instance, in a recent essay, “The Lustrous Power of Beauty,” he holds that “To claim that being is itself beautiful is a statement about the fundamental character of reality. It is an affirmation of the positive character of existence” (“Lustrous,” 237).¹ Later in the same lecture, he ties the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284zh3">Person, Being, and History</a><br>
  Author(s) Bates Jennifer<br>
  Abstract: Hegel’s discussion of the genius of the “feeling soul” (
                     Die fühlende Seele) is found in his Anthropology (under “Mind Subjective” in Hegel’s Encyclopedia Philosophy of Mind).¹ The feeling soul is a singular inwardness of feeling. It embraces the corporeal in itself as its substance. It does not experience the multiple parts of the external body as divisions of the soul. Rather (like Aristotle’s sensus communis), it gathers them up into one experience. “[T]he ‘real’ outness of parts in the body has no truth for the sentient soul.”² The feeling soul in the body is “one simple, omnipresent unity.”³<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284zwd">Re-Reading Gregory of Nazianzus</a><br>
  Author(s) CHIODO CAROL<br>
  Abstract: It is well known that for the Cappadocian fathers—and especially for Gregory of Nazianzen—the term “philosophy” signifies “the Christian life” or “the contemplation of Christian truth.”¹ When referring to the contemplation of Christian truth, 
                     philosophein and theologein are almost equivalent in Gregory’s works, though philosophein occurs with greater frequency. Yet, in addition to these basic senses, philosophein carries a controversial meaning, as well. This polemical sense reflects Gregory’s sophistic art and his refined use of logoi: “[the doctor] discoursing learnedly on your disease after you are dead,” as he puts it in one of his orations.²<br>

  Abstract: For his entire life Josef Pieper was in search of the truth, guided by a far-off teacher. His thought did not follow fashion. Two early experiences left their mark on him. Hungry for a philosophical formation, he turned in his youth to Søren Kierkegaard, as did many of his generation. One of his teachers at the 
                     Gymnasium Paulinum nudged him in a different direction, explaining that the “black bread” of Thomas Aquinas is more nourishing than the Dane’s “pastries.” Pieper took the advice, and picked up the prologue to Aquinas’s commentary on the Gospel of John.²<br>

  Abstract: Lumen Gentium 12 teaches that all believers possess “a supernatural sense of the faith” which enables an infallibility in believing. This supernatural sense of the faith is “aroused and sustained by the Spirit of truth.” A theology of the sensus fidelium must begin by attending to the role of the Holy Spirit in divine revelation. It is central to the belief of Christians that God is fully encountered in Jesus Christ, the Crucified and Risen One; that salvation from God is mediated through him; and that, within that salvific encounter, God is revealed to humanity.

The norm for inspiring and regulating that task is the foundational apostolic reception of that salvific and revelatory event, as witnessed to in Scripture and traditioned by the church. The principle for understanding, interpreting, and applying salvific revelation is the Holy Spirit. The Spirit’s organon for that task is the sensus fidelium.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853wm">The Texture of Being</a><br>
  Abstract: It is a commonplace among students of St. Thomas Aquinas that in his view a judgment does not come to rest in its truth until it reaches the thing being judged about. For him the judgment in its fundamental nature is not simply a union of subject and predicate, but is rather the surge of the mind itself towards rest in the being of things 
                  (esse rerum). The judgment terminates not in a mental construction but in the thing itself (ad rem). This has led many Thomists to salute the judgment as the cash value of knowledge. Usually our attention<br>

  Abstract: Gabriel Marcel gave his phenomenological inquiries the name “Philosophy of the Concrete,”¹ and he made no bones about the distance between his philosophy and that of Thomism.² Between these philosophies there can be no question of an 
                  approchement of tone, nor even of manner, but at most a convergence of truths shared differently. Moreover, there can be no doubt that the two philosophies differ in their relation to experience. Within the broad sense of “Christian experience,” Thomas drew upon experientia (empiria) in the narrower sense in order to derive by way of conceptual abstraction the principles of his philosophy, including<br>

  Author(s) JUNG MATTHIAS<br>
  Abstract: The process most often invoked in describing the hallmark of the Axial Age—or, to circumvent tricky problems of timing and synchronicity, of the Axial cultures—is the “discovery of transcendence.” “Transcendence,” however, covers a wide range of meanings. When applied to the distinction between our cognitive grasp of the world and its internal structure, for example, it denotes an epistemological conviction that is entirely neutral with regard to religious truth claims. The Axial Age debate emphasizes another aspect: it takes the religions and philosophical worldviews developed in the Axial cultures to be focused on a transcendent realm, a divine<br>

  Abstract: Lying has always been part of politics. Traditionally, however, the lie was seen as a necessary evil that those in power should keep from their subjects. Even totalitarians tried to hide the brutal truths on which their regimes rested. This disparity gave critics and reformers their sense of purpose: to illuminate for citizens the difference between the way the world appeared and the way it actually functioned. Following the proclamation of victory in the Iraqi war, however, that sense of purpose became imperiled, along with the trust necessary for maintaining a democratic discourse.

  Abstract: If one truth has emerged from the intense scholarly debate during the last two decades over the nature of Old Hollywood, it is that the writing of American film history must avoid the essentialist trap of considering the so-called classic text of that era as an undifferentiated flow of product whose watchwords were sameness and conformity. A correlative of this truth is that, even with its emphasis on package production (with each film in some sense a unique entity unto itself), New Hollywood filmmaking still offers regular forms of textuality that differ from those of the studio era only in<br>

However, the issue is not as simple as responding to a

Usually, globalization is equated with the expansion of economic and financial markets and the proliferation of global networks of communication.

  Abstract: The pronouncement of the nineteenth century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche as transmitted through the deconstructive spirit of Jacques Derrida and the casual remark of the contemporary American poet Tom Whalen on a writer’s pleasure in role-playing mark the wide range of this book’s theme. It contains cognitive, ethical, and aesthetic aspects, centering on masks and metaphors and comprising the sociopsychic implications for Faulkner’s readers of his personae and his imagery.

  Abstract: In the preceding chapter we considered the larger picture of Lonergan’s account of anthropology—his transcendental method. We discussed how an unrestricted desire for ultimate truth and goodness drives the human person through multiple operations on four levels of conscious intentionality. This larger picture remains incomplete, however, for progress is driven not by the operations of isolated individuals, but by the cooperation of persons in community. Ideally these cooperating persons are bound together by mutual love and shared meaning into a dynamic communal matrix that Lonergan calls “the human good.”<br>

  Book Title: Truth Matters-Knowledge, Politics, Ethics, Religion<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Shuker Ronnie<br>
  Abstract: Why should we seek and tell the truth? Does anyone know what truth is? Many are skeptical about the relevance of truth. Truth Matters endeavours to show why truth is important in a world where the very idea of truth is contested. Putting philosophers in conversation with educators, literary scholars, physicists, political theorists, and theologians, Truth Matters ranges across both analytic and continental philosophy and draws on the ideas of thinkers such as Aquinas, Balthasar, Brandom, Davidson, Dooyeweerd, Gadamer, Habermas, Kierkegaard, Plantinga, Ricoeur, and Wolterstorff. Some essays attempt to provide a systematic account of truth, while others wrestle with the question of how truth is told and what it means to live truthfully. Contributors address debates between realists and anti-realists, explore issues surrounding relativism and constructivism in education and the social sciences, examine the politics of truth telling and the ethics of authenticity, and consider various religious perspectives on truth. Most scholars agree that truth is propositional, being expressed in statements that are subject to proof or disproof. This book goes a step farther: yes, propositional truth is important, but truth is more than propositional. To recognize how it is more than propositional is crucial for understanding why truth truly matters.

These challenges set high stakes for ensuring theory and practice are well matched and oriented toward social flourishing.

  Author(s) ELLEFSON OLAF<br>
  Abstract: For Donald Davidson, the concept of truth is central to providing an account of meaning, but remains indefinable yet utterly intuitive.¹ For Stephen Stich, on the other hand, truth (or at least the concept of truth as used by Davidson, Alfred Tarski, and others) is idiosyncratic, limited, and best understood as a modestly valuable remnant of folk psychology that awaits either elimination or modification by an improved psychology.² I wish to evaluate and ultimately challenge precisely this contention by Stich – that our intuitive notion of truth (as expressed in T-sentences³ such as “‘the grass is green’ is true if and<br>

  Abstract: Writing in the wake of the furor over her account of the Eichmann trial, Hannah Arendt reflects on why truth and politics are, in her words, “on rather bad terms.”¹ Her analysis rests on dividing truth into two different types. The first type, rational truth, is the subject of mathematics and philosophy. It has a long history of tension with politics, going back at least to Plato, who worried about the displacement of rational truth by mere opinion. In the modern age, Arendt says, opinion has generally won the day, rendering rational truth politically irrelevant.² The second type, factual truth,<br>

  Author(s) SMITH ADAM<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, I describe pluralism as an approach to securing legitimacy for laws that govern democracies. While I assume that no other approach is acceptable, and that pluralism is a prerequisite for democracy, I argue first that pluralism has a problem. I also argue that the most promising attempt to resolve this problem – Habermas’s theory of discourse – fails to do so. To conclude, I suggest that another Habermasian term – truthfulness – might be developed in a way that addresses the problem of pluralism.<br>

  Author(s) RICHARDS AMY D.<br>
  Abstract: Bearing witness is an ethical act. Whether a person bears truthful witness or false witness, the act involves moral agency. Choosing to testify to an experience or event that others, or the established narrative of a culture, may contest may alter the rest of a person’s life. Witnessing is not without cost to both the agent bearing witness and also possibly to the audiences, the secondary witnesses hearing or observing the testimony. Therefore, deciding to bear or not bear witness has moral and cultural significance. Consider the example of two British journalists working in Soviet Russia and the moral and<br>

  Abstract: Of all literary genres, historical fiction is perhaps the most problematic and the most promising in relation to difficult questions of truth. Ostensibly rooted in some form of historical veracity in the traces of actual events or people, its fictional dimensions (from invented narrative to poetic qualities) nevertheless impress upon readers an imaginative truthfulness. In this way, historical fiction becomes a site of contention over truth; in its modern and postmodern manifestations, the genre becomes an exploration of the nature of truth itself.<br>

  Author(s) BLOMBERG DOUG<br>
  Abstract: The challenge of the Truth Matters conference call to “reclaim truthfulness for the academic enterprise” underscores that a commitment to truth is not an abstract principle but a concrete action. As Plato recognizes, philosopher-rulers need not only “the ability to grasp eternal and immutable truth” but also certain “qualities of character”; in describing these, he begins with “love of the knowledge that reveals eternal reality” and follows immediately with “truthfulness” – for how could “a love of wisdom and a love of falsehood” possibly coexist in one person?¹ Character thus connotes integrity, because virtuous traits are complementary and coherent.<br>

  Author(s) Copeland Rita<br>
  Abstract: It is well known that late medieval literary theory owes much to Aquinas’s reconciliation of human rhetoric with the divine revelation of truth in the text of Scripture. Aquinas and those theorists who followed his method accomplished this rapprochement by redrawing the boundaries between the literal and the spiritual senses of Scripture and assimilating rhetorical language to the literal sense. Aquinas’s critical move has been much studied for its impact on the exegetical theory and practice of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, especially for its new emphasis on the contributions of human authors to Scriptural discourse.

What is the point of striving for understanding, when everything is perspectival and historically conditioned? Often Gadamer has himself been viewed as the spokesman for historical relativism, since he had written that we do not understand better, but only differently. What would it mean to talk about the universality of understanding differently? Ultimately, does it not destroy the whole notion of truth?<br>

First and least important, the tendency of art writers such as Harold Rosenberg and Thomas Hess to regard Pollock as a kind of natural existentialist has served to obscure the simple truth that Pollock was, on the contrary, a painter whose work is always inhabited by a subtle, questing formal intelligence of the highest order, and whose concern in his art was not with any fashionable metaphysics of despair but with making the best paintings<br>

  Book Title: Pushkin's Historical Imagination-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Evdokimova Svetlana<br>
  Abstract: This book explores the historical insights of Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837), Russia's most celebrated poet and arguably its greatest thinker. Svetlana Evdokimova examines for the first time the full range of Pushkin's fictional and nonfictional writings on the subject of history-writings that have strongly influenced Russians' views of themselves and their past. Through new readings of his drama,
      Boris Godunov; such narrative poems asPoltava, The Bronze Horseman,andCount Nulin; prose fiction, includingThe Captain's DaughterandBlackamoor of Peter the Great; lyrical poems; and a variety of nonfictional texts, the author presents Pushkin not only as a progenitor of Russian national mythology but also as an original historical and political thinker.Evdokimova considers Pushkin within the context of Romantic historiography and addresses the tension between Pushkin the historian and Pushkin the fiction writer . She also discusses Pushkin's ideas on the complex relations between chance and necessity in historical processes, on the particular significance of great individuals in Russian history, and on historical truth.<br>

  Book Title: Interpreting Interpretation-The Limits of Hermeneutic Psychoanalysis<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Saks Elyn R.<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalytic interpretation, according to the hermeneutic view, is concerned with meaning rather than facts or causes. In this provocative book, Elyn R. Saks focuses closely on what hermeneutic psychoanalysis is and how the approaches of hermeneutic psychoanalysts differ. She finds that although these psychoanalysts use the same words, concepts, images, and analogies, they hold to at least five different positions on the truth of psychoanalytic interpretations. Saks locates within these five models the thought of such prominent analysts as Roy Schafer, Donald Spence, and George Klein. Then, approaching each model from the patient's point of view, the author reaches important conclusions about treatments that patients not only will-but should-reject.If patients understood the true nature of the various models of hermeneutic psychoanalysis, Saks argues, they would spurn the story model, which asks patients to believe interpretations that do not purport to be true; that is, the psychoanalyst simply tells stories that give meaning to patients' lives, the truth of which is not considered relevant. And patients would question the metaphor and the interpretations-as-literary-criticism models, which propose views of psychoanalysis that may be unsatisfying. In addition to discussing which hermeneutic models of treatment are plausible, Saks discusses the nature of metaphorical truth. She arrives at some penetrating insights into the theory of psychoanalysis itself.<br>

  Abstract: The eight hermeneutic thinkers I have presented often speak the same language—use the same words and concepts, images and analogies. And, indeed, some commentators take them to be holding essentially the same position.¹ Yet this is a mistake. There are at least five possible views that these hermeneutic thinkers may be holding.² I organize these five views around the hermeneuts’ position on the truth of psychoanalytic interpretations. Although a theory’s position on truth may be orthogonal to its status as a hermeneutic theory, there is value to this organization, which the reader will appreciate when I come to critique<br>

  Book Title: Rhetorical Invention and Religious Inquiry-New Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): OLMSTED WENDY<br>
  Abstract: This exceptional collection of writings offers for the first time a discussion among leading thinkers about the points at which rhetoric and religion illuminate and challenge each other. The contributors to the volume are eminent theorists and critics in rhetoric, theology, and religion, and they address a variety of problems and periods.Together these writings shed light on religion as a human quest and rhetoric as the origin and sustainer of that quest. They show that when pursued with intelligence and sensitivity, rhetorical approaches to religion are capable of revitalizing both language and experience. Rhetorical figures, for example, constitute forms of language that say what cannot be said in any other way, and that move individuals toward religious truths that cannot be known in any other way. When firmly placed within religious, social, and literary history, the convergence of rhetoric and religion brings into focus crucial issues in several fields-including philosophy, psychology, history, and art-and interprets relations among self, language, and world that are central to both past and present cultures.<br>

  Author(s) SHUGER DEBORA K.<br>
  Abstract: In a 1990 essay, Stanley Fish suggested that the history of Western thought from Plato through postmodernism could best be understood as a protracted debate between those who seek the truth and the sophists, or as what he terms the “quarrel between philosophy and rhetoric” (“Rhetoric,” 206, 209).¹ According to Fish, rhetoric is thus sophistic discourse, at once partisan and playful, and hence doubly “unconstrained by any sense of responsibility either to the Truth or to the Good”; it appeals to the emotions rather than the intellect and strives for victory rather than understanding.

  Abstract: The revitalization of rhetoric as an integral dimension of religious discourse has paralleled the rediscovery of the role of rhetoric in the social and natural sciences.¹ In Christian theology, discussions about rhetoric never quite ceased, owing to the practice of preaching and theories of homiletics. Current concerns in theology, however, focus on rhetoric in a different fashion. Attention to “what is communicated, how it is communicated, what happens when it is communicated, how to communicate it better,” how to understand the variables that create audiences, and how to assess the truth of communication have become crucial issues in the human<br>

  Book Title: Shattered Voices-Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth Commissions<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Phelps Teresa Godwin<br>
  Abstract: Following periods of mass atrocity and oppression, states are faced with a question of critical importance in the transition to democracy: how to offer redress to victims of the old regime without perpetuating cycles of revenge. Traditionally, balance has been restored through arrests, trials, and punishment, but in the last three decades, more than twenty countries have opted to have a truth commission investigate the crimes of the prior regime and publish a report about the investigation, often incorporating accounts from victims. Although many praise the work of truth commissions for empowering and healing through words rather than violence, some condemn the practice as a poor substitute for traditional justice, achieved through trials and punishment. There has been until now little analysis of the unarticulated claim that underlies the truth commissions' very existence: that language-in this case narrative stories-can substitute for violence. Acknowledging revenge as a real and deep human need,
      Shattered Voicesexplores the benefits and problems inherent when a fragile country seeks to heal its victims without risking its own future. In developing a theory about the role of language in retribution, Teresa Godwin Phelps takes an interdisciplinary approach, delving into sources from Greek tragedy toHamlet, from Kant to contemporary theories about retribution, from the Babylonian law codes to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Report. She argues that, given the historical and psychological evidence about revenge, starting afresh by drawing a bright line between past crimes and a new government is both unrealistic and unwise. When grievous harm happens, a rebalancing is bound to occur, whether it is orderly and lawful or disorderly and unlawful.Shattered Voicescontends that language is requisite to any adequate balancing, and that a solution is viable only if it provides an atmosphere in which storytelling and subsequent dialogue can flourish. In the developing culture of ubiquitous truth reports, Phelps argues that we must become attentive to the form these reports take-the narrative structure, the use of victims' stories, and the way a political message is conveyed to the citizens of the emerging democracy. By looking concretely at the work and responsibilities of truth commissions,Shattered Voicesoffers an important and thoughtful analysis of the efficacy of the ways human rights abuses are addressed.<br>

  Abstract: The rapid emergence of truth commissions and their collection and creation of narratives reflects, in part, the “return to narrative” that is prominent in diverse disciplines. Historians, philosophers, theologians, moralists, anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, psychoanalysts, artists, and even legal scholars¹ have newly and increasingly embraced narrative as a valid and powerful mode of explanation and representation of reality.² This change is characterized as a “return to narrative” because narrative, once the primary mode of discourse, has been long devalued.

  Book Title: Clan Cleansing in Somalia-The Ruinous Legacy of 1991<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Kapteijns Lidwien<br>
  Abstract: In 1991, certain political and military leaders in Somalia, wishing to gain exclusive control over the state, mobilized their followers to use terror-wounding, raping, and killing-to expel a vast number of Somalis from the capital city of Mogadishu and south-central and southern Somalia. Manipulating clan sentiment, they succeeded in turning ordinary civilians against neighbors, friends, and coworkers. Although this episode of organized communal violence is common knowledge among Somalis, its real nature has not been publicly acknowledged and has been ignored, concealed, or misrepresented in scholarly works and political memoirs-until now. Marshaling a vast amount of source material, including Somali poetry and survivor accounts,
      Clan Cleansing in Somaliaanalyzes this campaign of clan cleansing against the historical background of a violent and divisive military dictatorship, in the contemporary context of regime collapse, and in relationship to the rampant militia warfare that followed in its wake.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaalso reflects on the relationship between history, truth, and postconflict reconstruction in Somalia. Documenting the organization and intent behind the campaign of clan cleansing, Lidwien Kapteijns traces the emergence of the hate narratives and code words that came to serve as rationales and triggers for the violence. However, it was not clans that killed, she insists, but people who killed in the name of clan. Kapteijns argues that the mutual forgiveness for which politicians often so lightly call is not a feasible proposition as long as the violent acts for which Somalis should forgive each other remain suppressed and undiscussed.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaestablishes that public acknowledgment of the ruinous turn to communal violence is indispensable to social and moral repair, and can provide a gateway for the critical memory work required from Somalis on all sides of this multifaceted conflict.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjbhp">Thinking About Dementia</a><br>
  Author(s) McLEAN ATHENA HELEN<br>
  Abstract: The narrative turn in the study of aging has brought forth a variety of nonpositivist, nonrealist approaches to examining an elder’s life story within the terms of the story itself, independent of its truth content. Beginning with the early 1980s, anthropology witnessed a flood of studies concerning the life history approach (cf. Bertaux 1981; Crapananzo 1980; Shostak 1981). By 1988, however, the influence of illness in the construction of one’s life history received little attention (Kaufman 1988, 217). Since then, bolstered by interpretive approaches to narrative in anthropology (e.g., Rabinow and Sullivan 1987), as well as theory and methods from<br>

  Abstract: The aim of this paper is to explore a little of the theological framework that lies behind the effort of translation and also to show the way in which the act of translation itself became a key theological metaphor, a way of understanding and unpacking the truth that the translators believed was at the heart of the words with which they were working. In particular I want to look at what Lancelot Andrewes, whose name headed the list of translators, was thinking and saying about translation in the midst of his work on the KJV, and also at the way<br>

  Abstract: This letter from the landed Leicestershire gentleman Charles Jennens to his friend Edward Holdsworth is the earliest information we have about the genesis of George Frideric Handel’s masterpiece

There can be no doubt thatMessiahis responsible for much popular knowledge of the KJV, and also that it has to a significant extent established the commonly accepted messianic interpretation of the texts that it uses. ButMessiah’s appropriation of the KJV is far from the straightforward presentation of self-evident truth that it might appear to be, partly because the KJV’s presentation of that truth is itself questionable and partly<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjpmm">How Does Social Science Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: THIS BOOK is intended for the practicing social scientist or social science student. It is concerned with actual research, and focuses on three main questions: (1) What are the actual goals of the various current research methods? Call the goals “truth” or “knowledge”; then what characteristics does achieved truth have in the various methods? (2) What social, cognitive, and personality processes occur or should occur during research, and how do they contribute to the outcome? (3) What persistent weaknesses and dangers appear in research, and what can we do about them?<br>

  Abstract: PRAGMATISTS TREAT SCIENCE as a process of inquiry or search for truth. The emphasis is on process, method, correction, change, not definitive and permanent results. Inquiry begins with a question or a problem, and is directed to answering the question or solving the problem. Problems are initially practical ones: How can we resolve or tone down family quarrels? How can we reduce the inflation rate, or compensate for its more harmful effects without causing trouble elsewhere? However, the search for solutions brings up more abstract problems: What is a good measure of inflation? What is the relation between the quantity<br>

  Abstract: IT IS TIME once again to give chaos its due, and as always bring some order to it. The Mertonian scientific community was unified by shared norms and countemorms which enabled scientists to work together and achieve a shared truth. But Merton’s critics such as Michael Mulkay and Randall Collins have maintained that these norms are fictions that scientists have invented as part of their struggle for professional prestige and foundation grants. Scientists are not disinterested, not self-skeptical, and certainly not humble, the critics assert; they push their own ideas dogmatically and persistently. They do not judge others’ ideas on<br>

  Abstract: In previous chapters, I discussed the challenges to expression posed by experiences of risk, pain, suffering, and even sympathy, and examined how personal narratives about illness present problems for dominant literary critical practices that are based in hermeneutics of suspicion. In her final book,
                  Touching Feeling, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick labels interpretive approaches that seek to expose secrets, errors, and manipulation “paranoid practices.” She points out a truth that is hard to see from within the world of criticism: “paranoia knows some things well and others poorly” (130). Among the things that paranoia does not know well are personal accounts of<br>

  Aestheticism in Translation: from:

  Abstract: Schiller’s celebrated defence of the redemptive social value of art as autonomous aesthetic illusion (
                  Täuschung, translated as ‘fiction’ by Carlyle)¹ offers a suggestive proleptic commentary on the close relationship between late nineteenth-century aestheticism and a certain logic of translatability. Whilst this defence alludes to a familiar mimetic conception of the relationship between art and life—between the ‘copy’ and its ‘original’—it also enacts a striking defamiliarization of this paradigm by claiming for aesthetic illusion a truth which is lacking from its ostensibly reflected source. Art, Schiller would seem to say, offers a truth which is lacking from truth; only<br>

  Author(s) Berlinerblau Jacques<br>
  Abstract: Biblical scholars who study the way the Scriptures are used in American politics are confronted with a unique dilemma—one that the great scholar from across the pond in whose honor this essay is presented would certainly find droll. For the truth of the matter is that our vast erudition, specialized training, and broad linguistic competencies often fail to illuminate the subject matter that we explore. In a strange way, knowing as much as we do about the Bible is often a distinct intellectual handicap. To put it in colloquial terms,

  Author(s) Deutsch Eliot<br>
  Abstract: It is not uncommon among Western philosophers who show some interest in non-Western thought to engage that thought as if it were put forward as a series of arguments that require little or no understanding beyond what the resources of their own tradition afford. Arguments are lifted out of the forms in which they are assumed only to be presented, not embedded, and then are dealt with in straightforward Western truth-value terms. The unstated assumption is that philosophers everywhere have addressed the same basic problems and adhere (or at least ought to adhere) to the same standards of what constitutes<br>

  Author(s) Marchiori Dario<br>
  Abstract: Aesthetics as a philosophical discipline arose in the middle of the 18th century, when art came to be defined as an autonomous field of rules, social practices, and institutions (like museums). For that historical reason, aesthetics is not just “art theory,” as it articulates both more general and more particular issues, for instance: perception through the senses, the definition of beauty, judgment of taste, the truth content of an artwork and its relationship to (physical, psychological, economic etc.) reality, the questions of originality and newness; eventually, the definition and the very possibility of “art” itself, which becomes a serious matter<br>

  Abstract: Here is surely a truth now universally acknowledged: that the whole of our cultural inheritance has to be recurated and reedited in digital forms and institutional structures. But as the technology of cultural memory shifts from bibliographical to digital machines, a difficult question arises: what do we do with the books? This is a problem for society at large and many people are working at it, none more assiduously than certain expert persons, often technicians.

  8  Philological Investigations I: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wpnfx">A New Republic of Letters</a><br>
  Abstract: An acute sense of what Marjorie Perloff called “the poetics of indeterminacy” has marked criticism and scholarship for at least thirty years.¹ Synthetic narratives—historicist, dialectical, psychoanalytic—have seen their truth values turn imaginary, becoming what William Blake in
                  The Marriage of Heaven and Hellcalled “poetic tales”: arbitrary constructions, “fictions of lineage,” and order.² With the space of knowledge grown so radically volatile and complex, even “contested,” the teacher’s watchword became “teach the conflicts,” the scholar’s, “explore the contradictions.” So David Reynolds dives “beneath the American Renaissance” to expose the fault lines of F.

  Abstract: Multiplicityis a narrative structure characterized by the presentation of conflicting views within a given community about an event, an object, or a person. Corresponding to a “both/and” rhetoric that precludes an objective truth, multiplicity presents several acts of interpretation, but no one view is privileged as correct. Literary multiplicity is widespread and, according to the Russian narrative theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, it derives from the multiplicity endemic to all language, which describes a world that is “overlain with qualifications, open to dispute, charged with value, already enveloped in an obscuring mist—or, on the contrary, by the ‘light’ of alien<br>

  Abstract: Gustav Shpet is well known for his strong opinions. He relentlessly searches for objective truth—and truth is only acceptable to him if it represents life (Shpet,

For all his inclination towards rigorous scientific categorization Shpet always ties theory to practice.

  Abstract: Generally, we use the term
                  hermeneuticsto refer to both the art of interpretation and the general theory of understanding and interpretation. In this second meaning, hermeneutics embraces various epistemological, ontological, and, broadly speaking, philosophical problems that stretch well beyond questions of the unity of the scientific method, the contrast betweenunderstandingandexplanation,and the distinction betweenGeistenwissenschaften… andNaturwissenschaften. In Heidegger’s hands, hermeneutics became a general philosophical theory of Being, truth, and objectivity and Hans-Georg Gadamer states that the ontological-hermeneutical approach gives an answer to the question of foundation not only in human sciences but also in<br>

  Abstract: Though this sweeping opinion, expressed in a book on poverty in Britain published in 1930, has not proved correct in the longer run, there was nevertheless more than a grain of truth in it.¹ The reasons for the elevation of poverty to a central concern of state and society lie in social and economic developments that began almost a century before 1918. But they were reinforced and further precipitated by new theoretical and ideological insights, especially in the generation before the First World War.<br>

The great sophists who inhabit the dialogues fully understand that in an organized society rhetorical technique can be the most powerful device for the assertion of pure will, utterly indifferent to the common good, indifferent to the truth, indifferent to what we would call moral judgment.

Freud believed he followed strong empiricist methods in his analysis of signs and symptoms, and within the clinical tradition in which he trained and worked, he sought to achieve the same clinical status for psychoanalysis afforded other schools of psychiatry (Jones 1953–57; Decker 1977; Clark 1980; Gay 1988; Breger 2000; Makari 2008).

  Book Title: The Undivine Comedy-Detheologizing Dante<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): BAROLINI TEODOLINDA<br>
  Abstract: Accepting Dante's prophetic truth claims on their own terms, Teodolinda Barolini proposes a "detheologized" reading as a global new approach to the
      Divine Comedy. Not aimed at excising theological concerns from Dante, this approach instead attempts to break out of the hermeneutic guidelines that Dante structured into his poem and that have resulted in theologized readings whose outcomes have been overdetermined by the poet. By detheologizing, the reader can emerge from this poet's hall of mirrors and discover the narrative techniques that enabled Dante to forge a true fiction. Foregrounding the formal exigencies that Dante masked as ideology, Barolini moves from the problems of beginning to those of closure, focusing always on the narrative journey. Her investigation--which treats such topics as the visionary and the poet, the One and the many, narrative and time--reveals some of the transgressive paths trodden by a master of mimesis, some of the ways in which Dante's poetic adventuring is indeed, according to his own lights, Ulyssean.<br>

  Abstract: Though he discusses Christian nonviolence with scholarly care, Ted Koontz remains a passionately committed Christian. By insisting that the questions nonviolent Christians ask about the ethics of war and peace are different from the questions asked by those who approach the topic from other directions, he reminds us of the importance of religious convictions, or the absence of such convictions, in shaping how we understand war/peace ethics.¹ Moreover, his forthrightness in articulating the conceptions of truth and power that arise from the tradition of Christian pacifism, and especially from the practices of Christian worship, opens the way for a fuller<br>

  Abstract: When Henri Lefebvre looks at the everyday and finds there a truth “waiting for us, besieging us on all sides”; when Sigmund Freud imagines the frail organism “suspended in the middle of an external world” that attacks it with “stimuli,” they demonstrate the figurative power of the siege well into the twentieth century.¹ The siege concentrates warfare, bringing it home in the most immediate and violent way. The siege marks therefore the end of war at a distance. It is thus appropriate to conclude with a meditation on sieges, or at least on the representational work sieges may perform. Even<br>

  Author(s) LA NAVE FEDERICA<br>
  Abstract: The story of a mathematical discovery is often presented as a linear succession of events corresponding to a series of logical steps leading up to the moment of discovery by proof. The discovery itself takes on the character of a “truth revelation.” Such an accounting is cathartic. It makes us feel good about ourselves; it gives us confidence in the power of our mind. But is a sequence of logical steps all there is behind proving something in mathematics? When telling a story, one naturally lapses into a linear mode.

  Book Title: Russian Experimental Fiction-Resisting Ideology after Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clowes Edith W.<br>
  Abstract: In the three decades following Stalin's death, major underground Russian writers have subverted Soviet ideology by using parody to draw attention to its basis in utopian thought. Referring to utopian writing as diverse as Defoe's
         Robinson Crusoe, Dostoevsky'sNotes from Underground, and Orwell'sAnimal Farm, they have tested notions of truth, reality, and representation. They have gone beyond their precursors by experimenting with the tensions between ludic and didactic art. Edith Clowes explores these "meta-utopian" narratives, which address a wide range of attitudes toward utopia, to expose the challenge that literary play poses to dogmatism and to elucidate the sense of renewal it can bring to social imagination. Using both structural analysis and reception theory, she introduces readers outside Russia to a fascinating body of literature that includes Aleksandr Zinoviev'sThe Yawning Heights, Abram Terts'sLiubimov, Vladimir Voinovich'sMoscow 2042, and Liudmila Petrushevskaia's "The New Robinsons.".<br>

  Abstract: It strikes me that there should be little need for this paper. Only positivists believe that scientific facts and theories are separate from human meanings and values, and even they, inconsistently, set out to extrapolate human and social conclusions from putatively decontextualized facts. Only religious fundamentalists believe that a belief in God cannot be reconciled with science, and that true religion is based on the literal truth of Scripture. This is a sort of religious positivism, as is the notion of creation science, which the ultra-right is currently deploying in opposition to a vulnerable, neo-Darwinian scientific orthodoxy, as part of<br>

  Book Title: Beauty and Holiness-The Dialogue Between Aesthetics and Religion<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Martin James Alfred<br>
  Abstract: In this broad historical and critical overview based on a lifetime of scholarship, James Alfred Martin, Jr., examines the development of the concepts of beauty and holiness as employed in theories of aesthetics and of religion. The injunction in the Book of Psalms to "worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness" addressed a tradition that has comprehended holiness primarily in terms of ethical righteousness--a conception that has strongly influenced Western understandings of religion. As the author points out, however, the Greek forbears of Western thought, as well as many Eastern traditions, were and are more broadly concerned with the pursuit of beauty, truth, and goodness as ideals of human excellence, that is, with the "holiness of beauty." In this work Martin describes a philosophical stance that should prove to be most productive for the dialogue between aesthetics and religion.<br>

  Abstract: It issometimes said that modern philosophy began with Descartes’ turn to subjectivity and to mathematical clarity as the model of truth. It is also said that modern philosophy began with Kant’s critique of traditional metaphysics and his critical amalgam of empirical and rationalistic factors in his epistemology as a “prolegomenon to any future metaphysics.” We have seen that, in any event, it was in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that conceptual specification of aesthetics and of religion emerged, as an aspect of the new critical philosophy and the enlarged senses of history and culture engendered by the Enlightenment<br>

  AFTERWORD from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv4x4">The Skeptic Disposition</a><br>
  Abstract: The Skeptic Dispositionwas written in the early eighties during the heyday of deconstruction and reader-centered criticism. The scene has changed, but the critical orientation represented by these “movements” has not disappeared. Rather it has been sublimated and to an extent transformed in the “ideology critique” that dominates literary studies at this moment. The most enduring effect of deconstruction has been the subversion of all universalist or foundationalist claims to truth. In the Marxist canon, ideology has as one of its principal meanings “false consciousness,” which is a kind of universalizing thought that conceals the particular, self-interested (class) motives that<br>

  Book Title: Scripture, Canon and Commentary-A Comparison of Confucian and Western Exegesis<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): HENDERSON JOHN B.<br>
  Abstract: In this major contribution to the study of the Chinese classics and comparative religion, John Henderson uses the history of exegesis to illuminate mental patterns that have universal and perennial significance for intellectual history. Henderson relates the Confucian commentarial tradition to other primary exegetical traditions, particularly the Homeric tradition, Vedanta, rabbinic Judaism, ancient and medieval Christian biblical exegesis, and Qur'anic exegesis. In making such comparisons, he discusses some basic assumptions common to all these traditions--such as that the classics or scriptures are comprehensive or that they contain all significant knowledge or truth and analyzes the strategies deployed to support these presuppositions. As shown here, primary differences among commentarial or exegetical traditions arose from variations in their emphasis on one or another of these assumptions and strategies. Henderson demonstrates that exegetical modes of thought were far from arcane: they dominated the post-classical/premodern intellectual world. Some have persisted or re-emerged in modern times, particularly in ideologies such as Marxism. Written in an engaging and accessible style, Scripture, Canon, and Commentary is not only a challenging interpretation of comparative scriptural traditions but also an excellent introduction to the study of the Confucian classics.<br>

  Chapter 4  COMMENTARIAL ASSUMPTIONS from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvb8n">Scripture, Canon and Commentary</a><br>
  Abstract: THE MOST UNIVERSAL and widely expressed commentarial assumption regarding the character of almost any canon is that it is comprehensive and all-encompassing, that it contains all significant learning and truth. As Jonathan Z. Smith has written, “Where there is a canon we can predict the necessary occurrence of a hermeneute, of an interpreter whose task it is to continually extend the domain of the closed canon over everything that is known or everything that is.”¹ This is true not only of classical or scriptural canons, such as Homer, the Christian Bible, the Torah, the Qur’ān, the Veda, and the Confucian<br>

  Abstract: LIKE THE SIX OR SEVEN basic commentarial assumptions outlined in the preceding chapter, the strategies and arguments used by exegetes to support those assumptions are common to several classical and scriptural traditions. It is, after all, reasonable that similar sets of presuppositions regarding the character of the classics or scriptures should have called forth similar arguments for establishing the truth of those conceptions. But although such common commentarial strategies as allegory, the idea of accommodation, and scholastic or modal distinctions appear
                  somewherein most major traditions, these traditions differ significantly among themselves in the extent to which they employ particular<br>

  TWO  The Truth of Symbols from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvh3g">Symbol and Truth in Blake's Myth</a><br>
  Abstract: Even when we have understood that Blake’s theory of perception is grounded in the Divine Body of Jesus, an unresolved antinomy remains. Are symbols arbitrary and inadequate images from the fallen world that will be superseded in Edenic perception, or are they the very basis of experience and the guarantee of truth? Blake’s answer, ultimately, is that symbols become true by being organized into myth, where they take on conceptual form and are available to imaginative interpretation. But before we consider how his myth works, we need to examine closely the basis of its symbols in a theory of perception.<br>

  Book Title: Fictions in Autobiography-Studies in the Art of Self-Invention<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): EAKIN PAUL JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Investigating autobiographical writing of Mary McCarthy, Henry James, Jean-Paul Sartre, Saul Friedlander, and Maxine Hong Kingston, this book argues that autobiographical truth is not a fixed but an evolving content in a process of self-creation. Further, Paul John Eakin contends, the self at the center of all autobiography is necessarily fictive. Professor Eakin shows that the autobiographical impulse is simply a special form of reflexive consciousness: from a developmental viewpoint, the autobiographical act is a mode of self-invention always practiced first in living and only eventually, and occasionally, in writing.<br>

  CHAPTER TWO  Henry James and the Autobiographical Act from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvs6h">Fictions in Autobiography</a><br>
  Abstract: Roy Pascal has observed that autobiography involves an interplay or collusion between the past and the present, that indeed its significance is more truly understood as the revelation of the present situation of the autobiographer than as the uncovering of his past.¹ As readers of autobiography we ordinarily do need to be reminded of this obvious truth, even though Freud and his followers have shaken our faith in the ability of memory to provide reliable access to the contents of the past. When we settle into the theater of autobiography, what we are ready to believe—and what most autobiographers<br>

  Abstract: Truth Other Enigmasis a collection of some of Michael Dummett's writings on truth and other enigmas. The other enigmas include: meaning and understanding, time and causation, the past, realism, logic, proof, vagueness and philosophy itself. The writings span a considerable portion of Dummett's career - the years 1953 to 1975 - and reflect his diverse concerns in that period.

  Abstract: Kripke first became known for technical work on modal logic, the logic of necessity and possibility, much of it done in the late 1950s as a high-school student, and summarized in Kripke (1963). (Among other things this work popularized a revival of the picturesque Leibnizian language according to which necessity is truth in all possible worlds.) Under the influence of Kripke's later work philosophers have come to distinguish several conceptions of necessity and possibility, in a manner to be described below; but Kripke’s early technical work was not tied to any special conception.

  Abstract: “And of course the only real truth is the whole truth” (KE, 163). This sentence is one of the most telling that Eliot ever wrote. Not only does it epitomize his ideas about the nature of tenable criteria for truth, but it reveals how self-evident he considered those criteria to be; the “of course” is particularly telling. Furthermore, this sentence, and Eliot’s general dependence upon the idea of wholeness and the “systematic” nature of truth, reveal his strong reliance upon nineteenth-century traditions in both philosophy and poetry.<br>

  Abstract: From their earliest days comparative literature studies have lived in a paradox: they presuppose universals at work within human literatures and cultures, and seek to bring them to light through the examination of the diversity of these literatures and cultures. In recent decades the entire field of literary studies has undergone a vast movement of self-examination and self-legitimation as part of a wider movement among the human sciences to demonstrate both their scientific worth and their relevance to the situation and psyche of mankind.

What links home, story, and truth? Can we assume that truth is singular, or that it can be reduced to mere information only, as Jason Cowley’s comments seem to imply? Surely postcolonial literature tells us otherwise.

The dominance of the perspectives of formal logic and linguistic analysis in the schools of philosophy in the academic scene has largely relegated traditional metaphysics and its interest in ontology to a purely historical account of the past.

  Book Title: Gender and Narrativity-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): RUTLAND BARRY<br>
  Abstract: It is impossible to imagine a community that is not divided into at least two gender groups. It is equally impossible to imagine a community that does not tell or enact stories. The relationship between these universal aspects of human culture is the mainspring of Gender and Narrativity. From Genesis to Freud, the Western narrative tradition tells the same old story of masculine dominance/feminine subservience as a matter of divine will or natural truth. Here, nine Canadian scholars challenge and interpret this tradition, in effect "re-telling" the story of gender, and themselves intervening in the narrative process. Critical readings from a wide range of literary texts - medieval and modern, European and Canadian - replace abstract theory in these studies, while sociology, anthropology, psychoanalysis, deconstruction and new history are the axes of discussion. This book exemplifies the current range and diversity of Canadian critical writing.<br>

  Abstract: These statements by Paul Ricoeur, a French philosopher, and Joy Kogawa, a Canadian writer of fiction, might profoundly discomfit a postmodern academic audience familiar with the problems of humanism. Both thinkers express faith in the possibility of forgiveness at a time in history when such faith might seem naïvely optimistic and at worst dangerously self-deceptive. After all, the conceptual apparatus of forgiveness, to the extent that it involves recollection of and reflection on the past, is patently imbricated with notions of truth and memory; yet a virtual axiom of contemporary thought is that the latter are partial, fragmentary, and intensely<br>

This complex relationship is germane to my project – and has in fact formed its central ideas – but not in ways that I was able to fully articulate or acknowledge at the time of its beginning.

  Abstract: I have been arguing that Munro’s fiction, with its emphasis on loss and on the importance of story-telling as a method of gaining knowledge of the past, reveals and enacts a poetics of elegy. Munro, like Gallant, insists that the past must be evaluated and re-evaluated and that memory — though not equivalent to truth — is the most important source of knowledge, of a necessarily fictional truth. Gallant’s characters often learn very little of the lessons she urges her readers to learn; we acquire insights about memory, history, truth, and writing by interpreting the ironic narrative stance employed in her fiction.<br>

  Abstract: By means of his method of doubt, Descartes arrived at a basis for certainty of knowledge in the
                  cogito(“I think, therefore I am”); the very possibility of achieving certain knowledge depended on starting from one's own conscious thoughts, which were both transparent (immediately self-revealing) and private (accessible only to the individual whose thoughts they were). There is an element of truth, Merleau-Ponty thinks, in this Cartesian return to the self. It is clearly true, for instance, that we can only have experience of objects if we are ourselves conscious subjects of experience, and if we distinguish between ourselves as<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt81dhr">Philosophy of Merleau-Ponty</a><br>
  Abstract: Phenomenological philosophy, in Merleau-Ponty's conception, consists as we have seen in “re-learning to look at the world”, attempting to get behind the theoretical constructions that we erect on the basis of our immediate experience of the world in order to describe that experience itself. In so doing, he says, we do not simply reflect a pre-existing truth: philosophy is, “like art, the act of bringing truth into being”.¹ The analogy between phenomenology and art, especially the visual arts, runs through Merleau-Ponty's writings, sometimes as asides to a general philosophical discussion, and sometimes in the form of extended essays on particular<br>

Correspondingly, it was argued that theology and cosmology are intertwined in the sense that each of them functions in the conditions of the implicit influence of the other. Indeed, for theology to be possible at all one needs theologians, that is, embodied human persons. Hence<br>

  4  The Pluralist Alternative from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/9781442695344">Herder's Political Thought</a><br>
  Abstract: Herder’s sustained attention to linguistic and cultural specificity means he rejects the rationalist and absolutist belief in a single and harmonious body of knowledge. Yet he never abandons many of the universal values associated with ‘the Enlightenment’ by adopting a relativist conception of ‘truth.’ Owing to the recent pluralist turn in Anglo-American political thought,¹ the dichotomy between relativism and absolutism that held such a dominant place in Western thought has undergone considerable re-evaluation. Richard Bernstein locates its intellectual force as having emerged from Descartes’s search for an absolute foundation, that is, some fixed point from which all metaphysical and epistemological<br>

  Abstract: In

Inevitably, this is a categorisation that is difficult to define precisely, either historically or conceptually. Nevertheless, we can see many of the diverse movements and figures of the modernist breakthrough as sharing a concern to achieve a decisively unambiguous life, piercing through the superficial compromises of bourgeois society, looking reality in the face, and affirming the truth of iving personality.

  Abstract: The plebiscite of 5 October 1988, in which 55.99 per cent of Chileans said ‘no’ to Pinochet, marked the end of military dictatorship, but did not restore a proper democracy. It opened a new period that political analysts named the ‘transition’, to designate an alliance between politics (re-democratisation) and economics (neoliberalism). During those years, the post-dictatorship presidents – until 2010, all from the Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia¹ – were determined to reconcile Chileans, whom the dictatorship seemed to have irreparably divided.

  Abstract: Between the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a transition occurred in modern fiction as writers became increasingly reliant on the visual. In his study
                  Fiction and the Camera Eye, Alan Spiegel argues that this new visual consciousness in the novel was symptomatic of the shift from a theological to a scientific understanding of the world, meaning that, in modern fiction, ‘truth’ can only be revealed through sensory experience rather than authorial intervention.¹ In an uncertain modern world, Spiegel suggests, an author is no longer an authority; the common practice of pausing action in the novel to allow for exposition was<br>

  Abstract: Pragmatism as a philosophical doctrine traces back to the Academic skeptics in classical antiquity. Denying the possibility of achieving authentic knowledge (
                  epistēmē) regarding the real truth, they taught that we must make do withplausible information(to pithanon) adequate to the needs of practice. However, pragmatism as a determinate philosophical doctrine descends from the work of Charles Sanders Peirce. For him, pragmatism was primarily a theory of meaning, with the meaning of any concept that has application in the real world inhering in the relations that link experiential conditions of application with observable results.

  Abstract: The philosophy of mathematics plays an important role in analytic philosophy, both as a subject of inquiry in its own right, and as an important landmark in the broader philosophical landscape. Mathematical knowledge has long been regarded as a paradigm of human knowledge with truths that are both necessary and certain, so giving an account of mathematical knowledge is an important part of
                  epistemology. Mathematical objects like numbers and sets are archetypical examples of abstracta, since we treat such objects in our discourse as though they are independent of time and space; finding a place for such objects in a<br>

  Abstract: Continental philosophies of science tend to exemplify holistic themes connecting order and contingency, questions and answers, writers and readers, speakers and hearers. Such philosophies of science also tend to feature a fundamental emphasis on the historical and cultural situatedness of discourse as significant; relevance of mutual attunement of speaker and hearer; necessity of pre-linguistic cognition based in human engagement with a common socio-cultural historical world; role of narrative and metaphor as explanatory; sustained emphasis on understanding questioning; truth seen as horizonal, aletheic, or perspectival; and a tolerance for paradoxical and complex forms of expression.<br>

  Abstract: In his classic

Of what does the audience need to be persuaded? – the truthfulness, authenticity and plausibility of what is presented. This association of sound with a rhetorical function (persuasion) underscores sound’s relation to the image in documentary film as one of support. Working in a subordinate role, sound, it is thought, enhances and consolidates the tasks set by the image; the soundtrack is simply part of<br>

  Author(s) Ieven Bram<br>
  Abstract: One of the recurring tropes within modernist theories of images, and filmic images in particular, is their tendency to play out the tensions between the seeming immediacy of the visual, its epiphany-like and revelatory force that suggests a truth beyond arguing on the one hand, and a focus on the technological conditions of the image on the other. Within modernist theory these two aspects of the image can be arranged in different ways. Some modernist critics, such as André Bazin, have argued that the technological underpinnings of photographic and filmic images ascertain their historical accuracy, or at the very least<br>

Poems make the language in which they are made appear contingent, and necessary, at once: they make their writers and readers feel a justness or truth in the poem’s language, at the same time as making those writers and readers question just how that part of the poem’s language (a rhyme, an image, the weight on a syllable, and so on) could produce the reactions it produces.

  Author(s) Stockwell Stephen<br>
  Abstract: The Greeks made major contributions to the development of democracy not only as an idea, but even more significantly as a set of practical laws and pragmatic institutions that evolved over centuries to translate the sovereignty of the people into a relatively stable and effective system of government. However, while the Greek invention of democracy is often treated as an indisputable truth, recent work suggests that democracy may have antecedents. Martin Bernal stirred a major controversy with his book,

To apprehend the singularity of contemporary fiction, and to think of this fiction in its own right, instead of claiming to relate it to an absolute truth, the French philosopher invokes the old argument of Epimenides about a liar.

  Book Title: Scandalous Knowledge-Science, Truth and the Human<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Herrnstein Smith Barbara<br>
  Abstract: This book explores the radical reconceptions of knowledge and science emerging from constructivist epistemology, social studies of science, and contemporary cognitive science. Smith reviews the key issues involved in the twentieth-century critiques of traditional views of human knowledge and scientific truth and gives an extensively informed explanation of the alternative accounts developed by Fleck, Kuhn, Foucault, Latour, and others. She also addresses the various anxieties (e.g., over ‘relativism’) and ‘wars’ occasioned by these developments, placing them in their historical contexts and arguing that they are largely misplaced or spurious. Smith then examines the currently perplexed relations between the natural and human sciences, the grandiose claims and dubious methods of evolutionary psychology, and the complex play of naturalist, humanist, and posthumanist ideologies in contemporary views of the relation between humans and animals.<br>

It is good, certainly, when friends are loyal, lovers faithful, their tears authentic, vows earnest, stories trustworthy. It is generally in our interest to know what’s up and what really happened. Not always, of course, or only: fiction and flattery, artifice and illusion, duplicity and pipe-dreams are also important, sometimes necessary, perhaps even, in their various ways, truthful, indeed sometimes supremely so – or so the poets have told us, though it’s not clear they’re to be trusted<br>

For Badiou, true philosophy is always systematic, yet it is not systematic in the sense of being centered around a keystone: ‘if by “system” you mean, first, that philosophy is conceived as an argumentative discipline with a requirement of coherence, and second, that philosophy never takes the form of a singular body of knowledge but, to use my own vocabulary, exists conditionally with respect to a complex set of truths,<br>

  Abstract: Philosophy, a discipline concerned with truth, being, and the foundations of knowledge, was predestined to abhor the theater, which is premised on lying, appearance, and the construction of false worlds. Philosophical attacks on the theater, as they accompany the history of philosophy from Plato onward, are thus not only frequent but also unsurprising. At the same time, self-declared defenders of the theater, including many playwrights, have fought back by creating mock philosophers who are exposed as fools and charlatans on the stage, a tradition that begins with Aristophanes’ unflattering portrayal of Socrates in

That “noble dream,” as Peter Novick described this quest in an important volume some fifteen years ago, reflects for many historians a quaint legacy of romantic positivism, the failure to recognize how facts and historical truths are accessible only through creative acts of imagination.¹ The issues here are complicated. They range from whether the kinds of presuppositions historians bring to their research necessarily affect their determination of what is “factual,”<br>

To treat post–World War II Marxist fiction solely as a declension narrative, due to the ultimate disaster of the Communist movement in 1956, is to miss one of U.S. culture’s most significant streams. Customary accounts of the “Long Retreat” of literary radicalism obviously contain some truth, and there are sound reasons why the political parable of the clean sweep of Cold War liberalism in fiction has had its remarkable run.¹ But scores of novelists once affiliated with or newly drawn to the pro-Communist Left would be a forceful<br>

  Abstract: The novel and the theater are two forms of fiction: in both cases, it is a matter of creating an imaginary world, and making characters, whose story constitutes what is called the plot, enter into this world. In order for the impact of the work to surpass that of simple entertainment, the story must also have a signification. Through carefully constructed lies, the book, like the play, strives to communicate a general human truth, but they do not rely on the same devices, and they do not seek the same type of truth.<br>

  Abstract: Identity has become the encompassing term for cultural, social, and spiritual wholeness. It also emerges in discussions of territorial integrity, often as a rhetorical ploy in struggles for establishing and maintaining domain. As such, it references many of the most central fictions of our time. Such fictions invite questions, not of their truth value but of their usefulness.

  Abstract: Strathausen familiarizes readers with the basics of bioaesthetics, grounding them in its philosophical underpinnings while articulating its key components. Importantly, he delves into the longstanding problem of the "two cultures" that separate the arts and the sciences. Seeking to make bioaesthetics a more robust way of thinking, Strathausen then critiques it for failing to account for science's historical and cultural assumptions. At its worst, he says, biologism reduces artworks to mere automatons that rubber-stamp pre-established scientific truths.<br>

  Abstract: Every conception of culture, identity, ethics, or thinking contains an image of nature. And the relation goes the other way too. Even the most adamant realist in, say, engineering presupposes a cultural conception of how scientific cognition proceeds. To adopt the correspondence model of truth, for instance, is to act as if human capacities for cognition can be brought into close correspondence with the way of the world separate from those capacities. Nietzsche would say that such a realism preserves the remains of an old theology.¹ Its operational assumption, first, that the world

Though not involving a logical contradiction, asking what memory is (in singular) may seem at odds with offering to study processes of memory construction, of memories in the plural, and of social disputes over memories, their social legitimacy, and claims to “truth.” This chapter attempts to advance some conceptual issues in order to offer some tools for further analytical and empirical steps. It does not pretend to be an exhaustive discussion of issues that, by their very complexity<br>

  Abstract: Marco Denevi is one of Argentina’s most influential and important prose writers. One of the most distinctive features of his writing is the creation of a situation in which a presumed truth has been concealed with a mask. Consequently, in Denevi’s work there always seems to be an uneasy tension, a nagging suspicion that something is definitely not what it appears to be. As the reader proceeds through the narration, the numerous false facades that hide the unexpected and sometimes shocking truth lying underneath are slowly chipped away. Denevi’s numerous

  Abstract: The preceding chapters examined the social constructions of India, Sri Lanka, and the two Tamil nationalist movements as contested narratives. Throughout, the focus was trained on the interaction between ethnicity/nation, self/other, minority/majority, inside/outside, and various other antinomies in the production and reproduction of these selfsame identities. Rather than proceeding from a standpoint of epistemic realism (the notion that “the world comprises objects the existence of which is independent of ideas or beliefs about them” [Campbell 1992, 4]) oriented toward discovering

The term “logocentrism” clearly bears a great burden inOf Grammatology. Derrida gives three dimensions of this burden: (1) The phonetization of writing, which has often enough been hailed as a great advance of civilization, “must dissimulate its own history as it is produced” (OG, 11/3), thus bearing the dark side of dissimulation as the condition of its own apparent worth.

  Abstract: We have seen in the Introduction that Derrida’s deconstructive approach to philosophical texts presents the critical reader with what appears to be a dilemma: a critical reading might seem to be committed to the very ideals of truth, rigor, and epistemic accountability deconstructed by the texts that are to be subjected to a critical reading. But this dilemma is simply a reflection of the task that deconstruction sets for itself, namely, that of subjecting itself to what Derrida calls the “classical norms” (
                  OG, 8/lxxxix) even as it deconstructs the metaphysical underpinning of those very norms. Derrida thus insists “that within<br>

  Author(s) FRANK MANFRED<br>
  Abstract: When, in the mid-1950s, new interest for Schelling’s philosophy arose—especially its middle and late phases—Jürgen Habermas stood at the forefront; he was the youngest (and the first) scholar to base his interpretation on “contradictoriness” (
                  Zwiespältigkeit). A year later, Karl Jaspers followed his lead and publishedGrösse und Verhängnis(Greatness and disaster); this book held that Schelling had anticipated the central ambivalence of Heideggerian philosophy—more specifically, “the transition from greatness to [empty] gesture, from truth to absurdity, from clear communication to magic” (Jaspers 1955, 7; cf.Profiles, 45–52).

  Abstract: In 1975, eleven years after Derrida published “Violence and Metaphysics,” Levinas declared poststructuralism the “ruin of the world.” This new “philosophical literature,” Levinas wrote “prefers to play with verbal signs rather than to take seriously the system registered in their said” (
                  EN76, 61). However, along with communicating a disgruntled impression that disorder had become the name of the game in politics as well as philosophy, Levinas saw an opportunity in this disorder for a truth perhaps older than the world. “In this rupture, and in this awakening, and in this expiation, and in this exaltation, the divine comedy of<br>

  Abstract: In 1968 Jacques Derrida accepted an invitation from Johns Hopkins University to teach a seminar on the topic “Literature and Truth.” The project of the seminar was to consider how literature has been conceived, constructed, and maintained from Plato on as imitation and thus construed as secondary in order to protect the status of philosophy and, more broadly, science as the province of truth. Derrida developed the argument to show that the representative arts had been subsequently burdened with the task of effacing their position as copy by cultivating the value of originality, thus reproducing the very logic that established<br>

  Author(s): JACKSON MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: Evoking the hot, dust-filled Harmattan winds that blow from the Sahara to the Gulf of Guinea, this book creatively explores what it means to be buffeted by the unforeseen and the unknown. Celebrating the life-giving potential of people, places, and powers that lie beyond our established worlds,
      Harmattanconnects existential vitality to the act of resisting prescribed customs and questioning received notions of truth. At the book's heart is the fictional story of Tom Lannon, a graduate student from Cambridge University, who remains ambivalent about pursuing a conventional life. After traveling to Sierra Leone in the aftermath of its devastating civil war, Tom meets a writer who helps him explore the possibilities of renewal. Illustrating the fact that certain aspects of human existence are common to all people regardless of culture and history,Harmattanremakes the distinction between home and world and the relationship between knowledge and life.<br>

                  Ecce Homo that betrays the marks of both prophecy and irony, Nietzsche proclaims: “I am a destiny.” “My truth is dreadful,” he writes. “I am by far the most terrible human being there has ever been.” As the herald of this dreadful truth, Nietzsche positions himself as the thinker of both ascent and decline, the one who prepares “a decision evoked against everything that until now has been believed in, demanded, sanctified.” “Have I been understood?” Nietzsche asks. “The unmasking of Christian morality is an event [Ereignis] without equal, a real catastrophe.

  Book Title: Narrating Evil-A Postmetaphysical Theory of Reflective Judgment<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Allen Amy<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on Immanuel Kant's and Hannah Arendt's ideas about reflective judgment, Lara argues that narrative plays a key role in helping societies acknowledge their pasts. Particular stories haunt our consciousness and lead to a kind of examination and dialogue that shape notions of morality. A powerful description of a crime can act as a filter, helping us to draw conclusions about what constitutes a moral wrong, and public debates over these narratives allow us to construct a more accurate picture of historical truth, leading to a better understanding of why such actions are possible.<br>

  Book Title: The Awakened Ones-Phenomenology of Visionary Experience<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Obeyesekere Gananath<br>
  Abstract: Throughout his career, Obeyesekere has combined psychoanalysis and anthropology to illuminate the relationship between personal symbolism and religious experience. In this book, he begins with Buddha's visionary trances wherein, over the course of four hours, he witnesses hundreds of thousands of his past births and eons of world evolution, renewal, and disappearance. He then connects this fracturing of empirical and visionary time to the realm of space, considering the experience of a female Christian penitent, who stares devotedly at a tiny crucifix only to see the space around it expand to mirror Christ's suffering. Obeyesekere follows the unconscious motivations underlying rapture, the fantastical consumption of Christ's body and blood, and body mutilation and levitation, bridging medieval Catholicism and the movements of early modern thought as reflected in William Blake's artistic visions and poetic dreams. He develops the term "dream-ego" through a discussion of visionary journeys, Carl Jung's and Sigmund Freud's scientific dreaming, and the cosmic and erotic dream-visions of New Age virtuosos, and he defines the parameters of a visionary mode of knowledge that provides a more elastic understanding of truth. A career-culminating work, this volume translates the epistemology of Hindu and Buddhist thinkers for western audiences while revitalizing western philosophical and scientific inquiry.<br>

  Abstract: Onfray attacks Platonic idealism and its manifestation in Judaic, Christian, and Islamic belief. He warns of the lure of attachment to the purportedly eternal, immutable truths of idealism, which detracts from the immediacy of the world and our bodily existence. Insisting that philosophy is a practice that operates in a real, material space, Onfray enlists Epicurus and Democritus to undermine idealist and theological metaphysics; Nietzsche, Bentham, and Mill to dismantle idealist ethics; and Palante and Bourdieu to collapse crypto-fascist neoliberalism. In their place, he constructs a positive, hedonistic ethics that enlarges on the work of the New Atheists to promote a joyful approach to our lives in this, our only, world.<br>

  Abstract: Some clever people, camping out in their aesthetic marketplaces and doing their philosophical commerce, actually think that a history of art is possible … As long as you keep it concise! They dissertate about concepts divorced from any context; they gloss, like Plato’s contemporaries, ideas about Beauty-in-itself, the essence of Beauty, ineffable and unspeakable Beauty, or Beauty as a vector of transcendence; that is, they insist on the truth of its existence. From it, they can derive God, who they carefully guard from danger. They get a great deal out of a schema that is so philosophically easy.<br>

The first is probably the most important in that it determines the mode of reasoning that advances philosophy to the rank of a knowledge that aspires to truth by taking self-referentiality as a law, model, and guide<br>

  Book Title: After Christianity-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): D’Isanto Luca<br>
  Abstract: When Vattimo was asked by a former teacher if he still believed in God, his reply was, "Well, I believe that I believe." This paradoxical declaration of faith serves as the foundation for a brilliant exposition on Christianity in the new millennium -- an age characterized by a deep uncertainty of opinion -- and a personal account of how Vattimo himself recovered his faith through Nietzsche and Heidegger. He first argues that secularization is in fact the fulfillment of the central Christian message, and prepares us for a new mode of Christianity. He then explains that Nietzsche's thesis concerns only the "moral god" and leaves room for the emergence of "new gods." Third, Vattimo claims that the postmodern condition of fragmentation, anti-Eurocentrism, and postcolonialism can be usefully understood in light of Joachim of Fiore's thesis concerning the "Spiritual Age" of history. Finally, Vattimo argues for the idea of "weak thought." Because philosophy in the postmetaphysical age can only acknowledge that "all is interpretation," that the "real" is always relative and not the hard and fast "truth" we once thought it to be, contemporary thought must recognize itself and its claims as "weak" as opposed to "strong" foundationalist claims of the metaphysical past. Vattimo concludes that these factors make it possible for religion and God to become a serious topic for philosophy again, and that philosophy should now formally engage religion.<br>

  Abstract: Heidegger thinks that Being is not structure but occurrence, that which eventuates in history in different cultures, in different epochs. He puts a lot of emphasis on the notion of epoch. Epoch is historical epoch, but also—from the Greek—suspension. A historical epoch is a freezing of the constellations, an interval in the movement of the heavens. In the epochs, different horizons open up, with different truth criteria. Sometimes it’s believed that there are vampires, other times that there are atoms.<br>

  Abstract: Heidegger reformulated as an ontological question Hegel’s judgments on the end of art by asking: “Is art still an essential and necessary way in which that truth happens which is decisive for our historical existence, or is this something that art no longer is?”¹ In doing so, he was trying to overcome the emergency of aesthetics. This emergency does not lie in the “end of art” proclaimed by Hegel but rather in the reduction of art to representable objects to be felt, contemplated, and reproduced as we please.

  Abstract: In

McIvor offers a framework for analyzing the politics of mourning, drawing from psychoanalysis, Greek tragedy, and scholarly discourses on truth and reconciliation.Mourning in Americaconnects these literatures to ongoing activism surrounding racial injustice, and it contextualizes Black Lives Matter in the broader politics of grief and recognition. McIvor also examines recent, grassroots-organized truth and reconciliation processes such as the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2004-2006), which provided a public examination of the Greensboro Massacre of 1979-a deadly incident involving local members of the Communist Workers Party and the Ku Klux Klan.<br>

For words themselves are always efforts at explanation, yet insofar as words, spoken or written or printed or processed electronically, never provide total explanation, they invite further interpretation, the completion of the business they have left unfinished.

Barthes clarifies this declaration by writing that “the taxonomic option implies an ideological one: there is always a stake in where things are placed,” and he later calls taxonomic variation the “place of place.”¹ I have been arguing that the “place” of vernacular rhetoric must be understood as England, and Barthes’ reflections on<br>

  Abstract: Anyone who set out to write a history of the concept of truth, in a strictly terminological sense aimed at definitional stringency, would have little to show for his efforts. The most popular definition, purportedly lifted by Scholasticism from Isaac ben Salomon Israeli’s book of definitions—
                  veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus [truth is the match of thing and intellect]¹—provides leeway for modification only in the shortest of its elements, in the neutrality of the ‘et’.

This divinely sanctioned nakedness is tarted up with rhetorical frippery in a manner that is characteristic precisely of the way in which lies manifest themselves: “But since God has willed this to be the nature of the case, that simple and undisguised truth should be more clear, because it has sufficient ornament of itself, and on this account it is corrupted when embellished with adornings<br>

  Book Title: Meaning, Truth, and Reference in Historical Representation-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Ankersmit Frank<br>
  Abstract: At the heart of Ankersmit's project is a sharp distinction between interpretation and representation. The historical text, he holds, is first and foremost a representation of some part of the past, not an interpretation. The book's central chapters address the concept of historical representation from the perspectives of reference, truth, and meaning. Ankersmit then goes on to discuss the possible role of experience in the history writing, which leads directly to a consideration of subjectivity and ethics in the historian's practice. Ankersmit concludes with a chapter on political history, which he maintains is the "basis and condition of all other variants of historical writing." Ankersmit's rehabilitation of historicism is a powerfully original and provocative contribution to the debate about the nature of historical writing.<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapters it was argued that representation leaves no room for propositional truth. This raises the question whether this should be our last word about historical truth. Since historians themselves do not hesitate to apply the notion of truth to historical writing and since the practice of historical writing amply supports their confidence in historical truth, we cannot leave this issue undiscussed. Perhaps we can think of an alternative to propositional truth that agrees with the relevant facts about historical representation.¹<br>

  Abstract: Truth, reference, and meaning have traditionally been the three central notions in philosophical semantics. In the preceding two chapters we dealt with the question of the role to be assigned to reference and truth in (historical) representation. We found that representations cannot be said to refer to the world in the way proper names and sentences do, though they can be characterized as self-referential. Similarly, the notion of truth can meaningfully be used in the context of representation, not in the sense of propositional truth but in the quasi-Heideggerian sense of truth as a revelation of a past reality.

But after the rise of historicism in the school of Ranke and Droysen, a retrospective redemption seemed possible.

Daya Kishan Thussu and Des Freedman identify the media in the context of the communication of conflict as a “battleground.”³ Regarding the contemporary world, saturated with the media’s reporting of conflict, Simon Cottle argues that the media-conflict interface needs to be understood through the perspective of “mediatized conflict.”<br>

  Book Title: Representing the "Good German" in Literature and Culture after 1945-Altruism and Moral Ambiguity<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Schönfeld Christiane<br>
  Abstract: In the aftermath of the Second World War, both the allied occupying powers and the nascent German authorities sought Germans whose record during the war and the Nazi period could serve as a counterpoint to the notion of Germans as evil. That search has never really stopped. In the past few years, we have witnessed a burgeoning of cultural representations of this "other" kind of Third Reich citizen - the "good German" - as opposed to the committed Nazi or genocidal maniac. Such representations have highlighted individuals' choices in favor of dissenting behavior, moral truth, or at the very least civil disobedience. The "good German's" counterhegemonic practice cannot negate or contradict the barbaric reality of Hitler's Germany, but reflects a value system based on humanity and an "other" ideal community. This volume of new essays explores postwar and recent representations of "good Germans" during the Third Reich, analyzing the logic of moral behavior, cultural and moral relativism, and social conformity found in them. It thus draws together discussions of the function and reception of "Good Germans" in Germany and abroad.

  Abstract: The focus of this chapter is on the cinematic representation of the “good German” in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, and the reorientation of defeated, isolated, and morally devastated Germans, not only by addressing the country’s all-too-recent genocidal past, but especially by highlighting the possibility of moral truth, autonomous agency, and ethical action, and thereby, the possibility of a better future. Representations of humanity, decency, and the courage to disobey or change were projected during this early postwar period onto often makeshift cinema screens as seeds lying dormant under thousands of cubic feet of rubble.

  Abstract: The phrase ‘archaeology is a political act’¹ is oft repeated, but as with any such definitive phrase when used in academia each word of it has multiple meanings. For instance ‘is’. Well, it is not always. Archaeology 
                     can be a political act and archaeology sometimes is a political act, but this is not a universal truth. Likewise, the word archaeology can be taken different ways itself. There is academic archaeology, private sector archaeology, public archaeology, uses of archaeology in the heritage industry and so on, all intrinsically connected, but each with nuances different enough to render universality meaningless.<br>

  Book Title: Dialogic Aspects in the Cuban Novel of the 1990s-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): DORADO-OTERO ÁNGELA<br>
  Abstract: This book examines six Cuban novels published between 1991 and 1999, all part of the new "boom" of the Cuban novel in the 1990s. It analyses how in undermining monolithic representations of reality these texts employ discursive techniques that question absolute truths, defy established boundaries of literary genres and challenge concepts of national, gender and individual identity. The authors studied in this book---Reinaldo Arenas, Leonardo Padura Fuentes, Abilio Estévez, Daína Chaviano, Yanitzia Canetti, and Zoé Valdés---are placed beyond the dichotomy of outside and inside Cuba in order to focus on the fluidity and heterogeneity of Cuban culture displayed in its literature. This study establishes similarities and differences in the way these authors create polyphonic texts that question whether notions of country and nation coincide in novels that respond to economic hardship, political and social changes, issues of cubanía, and exile.

  Book Title: Tragedy and the Tragic in German Literature, Art, and Thought-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Quinn Thomas P.<br>
  Abstract: The many catastrophes of German history have often been described as tragic. Consequently, German literature, music, philosophy, painting, and even architecture are rich in tragic connotations. Yet exactly what "tragedy" and "the tragic" may mean requires clarification. The poet creates a certain artful shape and trajectory for raw experience by "putting it into words"; but does putting such experience into words (or paintings or music or any other form) betray suffering by turning it into mere art? Or is it art that first turns mere suffering into tragic experience by revealing and clarifying its deepest dimension? What are we talking about, exactly, when we talk about tragic experience and tragic art, especially in an age in which, according to Hannah Arendt, evil has become banal? Does banality muffle or even annul the tragic? Does tragedy take suffering and transform it into beauty, as Schiller thought? Is it in the interest of truth for suffering to be "beautiful"? Is it possible that poetry, music, and art are important because they in fact create the meaning of suffering? Or is suffering only suffering and not accessible to meaning, tragic or otherwise? This book comprises essays that seek to clarify the meaning of tragedy and the tragic in its many German contexts, art forms, and disciplines, from literature and philosophy to music, painting, and history.

Although the etym language might suggest a rather confining way of reading and reflecting upon language and reality, the fact is that even Schmidt, as the self-proclaimed creator of such a mode of inquiry into oral and written language, remains inscribed in his own speaking and writing.

  Abstract: If, for twentieth-century writers, the question of authorship and its relationship to the authority of a ‘writing subject’ has posed considerable problems, then writing the life of the self – encapsulated perfectly, if in reverse order, in the very term auto-bio-graphy – makes these issues even more acute. The practice of autobiography necessarily confers on the autobiographical text an implied truth value upon which the weight of contemporary theory since existentialism and structuralism has cast considerable doubt. Unmoored from the Cartesian certainties of consciousness, contemporary autobiography stages an interplay between facts and imaginative creativity, replacing the original ‘confessional’ status of<br>

However, my purpose is not to blame the presumably “objective” historiography for “lack of objectivity” (especially since I do not believe in this ideal), but to see how things stand on particular issues of the “objectivity and truth” complex. Hence the account is somewhat fragmented. The question will also be posed: why were there, until recently, no relativizations of the<br>

  Book Title: Imperfection and Defeat-The Role of Aesthetic Imagination in Human Society<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nemoianu Virgil<br>
  Abstract: Literature is defined in a challenging way as the "science" of imperfection and defeat, or else as a type of discourse that deals with defeat, loss, uncertainty in social life, by contrast with virtually all disciplines (hard sciences or social sciences) that affirm certainties and wish to convince us of truths. If in real history most constructive attempts end up in failure, it follows that we ought to have also a field of research that examines this diversity of failures and disappointments, as well as the alternative options to historical evolution and progress. Thus literature serves an indispensable role: that of gleaning the abundance of past existence, the gratuitous and the rejected being placed here on an equal level with the useful and the successful. This provocative and unusual approach is illustrated in chapters that deal with the dialectics between literary writing and such fields as historical writing, or religious discourses, and is also illustrated by the socio-historical development of East-Central Europe.<br>

Journal Title: Ethics<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: et.2001.112.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 2001<br>
Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: Theories are always, in some way, about their theorists. While Luhmann’s variant of mutant functionalism is not palatable to American tastes, his theories are as reflective of late‐20th‐century European sensibilities as Parsons’s were of mid‐20th‐century America or Bellah and Geertz’s of the upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, some art critics have warmed to Luhmann’s book as an exemplar of one of the newer “cool” theories of art; that is, those that challenge more subject‐centered and humanist theories and aim to accommodate the growth of new mediums such as digital art and cyberspace. But in any conception of art that includes culture, the medium is only as good as the meaning it conveys. And it is the meaning of art that is sorely lacking in Luhmann’s appraisal. Paul Ricoeur once wrote that “materialism is the truth of a world without truth.” It might then be said of Luhmann’s conception of the art system that it is the truth of art without meaning.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”
            Theological Studies47 (1986): 44–45.<br>

Abstract: While sharing the aim of relating philosophy and theology, I do not think the project is best accomplished by thinking ontotheologically (at least, not in its Heideggerian sense). What is needed is to insist on a sharper distinction between ontotheological philosophy and religious theology so that we can better understand how they might relate. And here again, I agree with Robbins for different reasons: Ricoeur, Lévinas, and Marion are key sources in this project, for their work maintains the distinction that it calls into question.<br>

            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau. For reading the current essay, my particular thanks to Catherine Desbarats, Eric Jabbari, James Ron, and Michael Wasser, as well as to Tim Rowse, Desley Deacon, Ann Curthoys, and John Docker for helpful suggestions. I am of course solely responsible for the content. The research for this essay was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. 1 Jean Comaroff and John L. Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, Vol. 1: Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa (Chicago, 1991), and Vol. 2: The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier (Chicago, 1997). 435 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne the emergence of capitalism. Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 437 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne political, economic, and cultural colonialism-fields the authors argue are in any case impossible to disaggregate.9 The programmatic claims that lend Of Revelation and Revolution its force also, however, cause some interesting tensions in the book. The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success.

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86. Those influenced by the Comaroffs in this respect include David Chidester, Savage Systems: Colonialism and Comparative Religion in Southern Africa (Charlottesville, Va., 1996); Leon de Kock, Civilising Barbarians: Missionary Narrative and African Textual Response in Nineteenth-Century South Africa (Johannesburg, 1996); Doug Stuart, "'Of Savages and Heroes': Discourses of Race, Nation and Gender in the Evangelical Missions to Southern Africa in the Early Nineteenth Century" (PhD dissertation, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London, 1994).

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 443 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne does not fail to capture some aspects of social and political reality. This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76. On Tswana views of the firearms frontier, see Robert Moffat to Richard Miles, Lattakoo [Kuruman], December 5, 1827, in Isaac Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman: Being the Journals and Letters of Robert and Mary Moffat, 1820-1828 (London, 1951), 274. Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another. On Cape influence, see also Johannes du Bruyn, "James Read en die Thlaping, 1816-1820," Historia 35 (1990). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 445 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elboume eventually came to be known), some of whom acted as patrons of the early LMS mission to the Tswana. The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman.

Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 451 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne colonial worlds are apprehended and narrated?"43 I think this is a genuine point of tension for the Comaroffs, and quite rightly for many others. Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L. Comaroff, "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," Public Culture 12, no. 2 (2000): 334.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Her publications include Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (2002), as well as various articles, most recently "Domesticity and Disposession: British Ideologies of 'Home' and the Primitive at Work in the Early Nineteenth-Century Cape," in Wendy Woodward, Patricia Hayes, and Gary Minkley, eds., Deep Histories: Gender and Colonialism in Southern Africa (2002). She earned her D.Phil. in 1992 from the University of Oxford, under the supervision of Terence Ranger. Her major fields of interest include colonialism, gender, and religion, especially the early nineteenth- century British white settler empire and southern Africa. Her current work in progress explores the creation of networks around the idea of being "aborig- inal" in the early nineteenth-century British empire, and is focusing on links between New South Wales, the Cape Colony, New Zealand, and Canadian colonies as well as on activists in Great Britain.

Abstract: Ibid., p. 111. Even Riffaterre's approach to the structuring unsaid of textual writing can be seen to represent on its own terms a shift from the ontology of narrative toward its epistemology at the level of form rather than content. By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific
            truth:a story's immanent signifying patterns in their subtextual disclosure.<br>

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Author(s): Mrozik,  Susanne<br>
Abstract: This second, more normative dimension of Mrozik’s project opens up some challenging questions. If it is the case, as she suggests, that a sympathetic reading of the
   Compendium of Trainingcan provide valuable intellectual resources for contemporary ethical reflection, it remains unclear to me how our engagement with this text should proceed, given the significant disparities in cosmological assumptions (e.g., karmic causation and rebirth) and forms of practice that separate Mrozik’s contemporary readers from the text’s original audience. The text, moreover, appears less concerned with advancing particular truth claims than with creating a distinctive kind of religious subjectivity through ascetic and ritualized practice. Can we assess the value of the text’s ethical ideals apart from the forms of discipline and practice with which they were linked in medieval India? IfVirtuous Bodiesleaves such questions open to further exploration and analysis, its nuanced reading of theCompendium of Trainingbrings into sharper focus the centrality of human embodiment in South Asian Buddhist religious discourses and encourages us to reflect deeply on its implications for our own ethical inquiry.<br>

Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Abstract: The cultural and social sciences are welcome to examine and critique theology and Christian practice, and theology can profitably learn from these studies, but the studies themselves are not theology. To be theology, even in an interdisciplinary sense, the work must become constructive and speak to the
   religiousthought and practice of specific communities or faith traditions. In any given community, theology can become a displaced language in need of renewal, but theology can also uncover the displaced or implicit religion within the seemingly secular. To do this well, theology must remain in critical tension with the cultural sciences, including literature. The result may well be deconstructive, but such radical critique is necessary for any living tradition.<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

The relocation and opening of the files of the former Dirección Federal de Seguridad [Federal Security Bureau] in the former prison comes along with the return of victims and victimizers, only now they come back as ghosts of things past. The novel works with the binomial jail/archive, featuring Lecumberri as a live space from which to begin a search for justice and truth, without sinking into melancholy or victimhood.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues that Emily Dickinson’s poetry intervenes in the broad cultural assessment of epistemology provoked by the evolutionary debates of the 1860s. While scholars have begun to explore the thematic correspondences between Dickinson’s poetry and some aspects of this cultural conversation, this essay examines the ways in which her intervention occurs at the level of poetic form and is in fact profoundly dependent upon form. Specifically, it analyzes a set of her poems from the early 1860s through the early 1870s in which she uses the dual structure of metaphor to elicit a way of thinking about truth that is aligned with the empirical methods of research that were widely embraced in the mid nineteenth century; however, in the face of an increasingly contingent notion of truth, Dickinson’s way of thinking significantly revises cultural assumptions about what those methods might yield. The metaphors examined here amplify the distinctions between two material entities—lightning and fork, or sunset and lilac, for example—rather than merging them or leaping beyond them to stable, transcendent meaning. What Dickinson plays with is the possibility of a revised version of revelation or truth, one that is not only derived from the observation of material difference through the two parts of a metaphor, but that is more radically contingent on the perpetuity of such dual perception. Altogether, Dickinson’s metaphors are both critical and recuperative, as they contribute to the dismantling of fixed truth while embracing the limited revelations made possible by—
         onlymade possible by—sustained process.<br>

Abstract: In the text-based disciplines, psychoanalysis and Marxism have had a major influence on how we read, and this has been expressed most consistently in the practice of symptomatic reading, a mode of interpretation that assumes that a text's truest meaning lies in what it does not say, describes textual surfaces as superfluous, and seeks to unmask hidden meanings. For symptomatic readers, texts possess meanings that are veiled, latent, all but absent if it were not for their irrepressible and recurring symptoms. Noting the recent trend away from ideological demystification, this essay proposes various modes of "surface reading" that together strive to accurately depict the truth to which a text bears witness. Surface reading broadens the scope of critique to include the kinds of interpretive activity that seek to understand the complexity of literary surfaces---surfaces that have been rendered invisible by symptomatic reading.<br>

Abstract: Every text aims to seduce its reader. If the text at the same time lays claim to having scientific value, we readers must ask whether seduction stands in the way of truth. As a concept, seduction lies halfway between an assault and conversation. As opposed to assault, seduction conveys a dimension of voluntarily being swept off one's feet. As opposed to conversation, seduction implies that one loses one's senses for a moment. Who, then, is really subject and who is object in seduction? The thesis I will argue here is that the readership's or audience's only chance of taking on the role of subjects, in a textual seduction, is to lose their senses first. Rather than being an assault against scientific ethics, seduction is a necessary premise for a sensible conversation to take place.<br>

Abstract: The question raised in the title has been much debated by past and present interpreters of Zoroastrianism. In the first two parts of this paper we present some dualistic and monotheistic interpretations of the religion. The interpretations can be labeled as follows: 1. DUALISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks Omnipotence And Omniscience (Dhalla, Henning) 2. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks A Physical Nature (Shaked, Boyce) II. MONOTHEISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The Created Spirits View (Zaehner, Fox, Gershevitch) 2. The Transformationist (Maskhiyya) View 3. The Zurvānite View 4. The View That Good And Evil Are Coeternal Only In A Logical Sense (Moulton, Bode and Nanavutty, Duchesne-Guillemin) We present each of these views and discuss it critically in light of the following criteria: (1) textual evidence; (2) the continuity of the religion throughout its history, including the present time; (3) philosophical cogency; and (4) religious satisfaction. Our conclusion is that each of the above positions, despite its elements of strength, falls seriously short of one or more of these criteria, and hence that there is need for a more adequate interpretation of Zoroastrianism than any of them can offer. Accordingly, we present another interpretation in order to provoke further discussion and, hopefully, to advance the cause of trying to gain a more precise grasp of the teachings of this remarkable religion. In brief, the interpretation we favor is that Zoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique to itself among the major religions of the world. This combination results in a religious outlook which cannot be categorized as either straightforward dualism or straightforward monotheism, meaning that the question in the title of this paper poses a false dichotomy. The dichotomy arises, we contend, from a failure to take seriously enough the central role played by time in Zoroastrian theology. Zoroastrianism proclaims a movement through time from dualism toward monotheism, i.e., a dualism which is being made false by the dynamics of time, and a monotheism which is being made true by those same dynamics of time. The meaning of the eschaton in Zoroastrianism is thus the triumph of monotheism, the good God Ahura Mazdā having at last won his way through to complete and final ascendancy. But in the meantime there is vital truth to dualism, the neglect of which can only lead to a distortion of the religion's essential teachings. We develop this interpretation in the last part of our paper and argue for its satisfaction of the four criteria.<br>

Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manyness are thoroughly corelative, joined in a dialectical relation of reciprocal implication. This pluralized unity and unified plurality is the ontological matrix of truth's relativity. Symbolic awareness is the interface of contextual meaning and relational being. The density of constitutive relations and the nascence of concrete actuality engender a dissonance between manifest and latent content in the reflection of being in consciousness. The polysemy of symbols captures the polymorphism of being in a way that establishes the need for a constant process of decipherment in which we reformulate our notions in order more fully to penetrate synchronic and diachronic relations that are ontologically definitive. By maintaining the tension between the revealed and the concealed, symbolic awareness insures that knowledge always evolves through ceaseless reinterpretation. For symbolic consciousness, truth, as being itself, forever becomes. The essay concludes with the suggestion that the wedding of a relativistic epistemology and a relational ontology in a symbolics of the religious imagination reopens the possibility of constructive theological reflection in a pluralistic age.<br>

Abstract: Perhaps the greatest challenge to an existential phenomenological account of perception is that posed by the argument from illusions. Recent developments in research on the behaviour of subjects suffering from illusions together with some seminal ideas found in Merleau-Ponty's writings enable us to develop and corroborate an account of the phenomenon of illusions, one, which unlike the empiricist account, does not undermine our conviction that in perception we "reach the things themselves". The traditional argument from illusions derives its force from an uncritical assumption that the process of experience takes place in time conceived as an infinite series of distinct moments. Once this assumption has been bracketed we are able to recognise the paradoxical truth that in the disillusion something can become that which it has always been and can cease to be that which it has never been. Furthermore, through a reflection on our experience of others overcoming their illusions, and on psychological evidence, we are able to show that there is nothing to suggest that this description of the disillusion is a description of a private or subjective event.<br>

Abstract: Caryl Phillips's narrative is painfully concerned with the relationship of Empire, Colony, and the In-between; Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean; slavery, rebellion, and freedom; Men, women and children; absent or useless fathers and damaged, aimless sons. It explores what hold in common while never losing sight of the painful quotidian, the specific. It is a narrative where the picaresque shakes hands with the epic and the linearity is broken, encircled, and put fast forward or in reverse by a mise-en-abîme of sorts: the tale-within-the-tale-within-the-tale even if interrupted by the tapestry of an emergent voice that finally proposes itself as both the identity and the difference of its verbal universe. "Enter your own self and discover the world," Phillips seems to be saying, "but also go out into the world and discover yourself." Once that call is answered, fiction itself becomes another way of questioning truth as we strive for it through the paradox of a lie. That lie can be called the imagination. It can also be seen as a parallel reality. For it may be observed as a critical mirror of what passes for the truth in the world of convention. It certainly sets up a second universe of being, where the narrator, say Cambridge in Cambridge, has a reality greater, though no less important, than the host of hastily met and then forgotten people we deal with on a daily basis. It is in this sense that Phillips brings into light another way of telling in that his narrative gives weight and presence to the virtues and vices—the fugitive personalities—of our daily acquaintance. This is the prerogative of his style, which I try to discuss in this essay. It has the power to render disenchantment and pleasure without resolving the contradiction between them. In fact, what holds them in tension, as equal forces straining in opposite directions, is the artist's mature subjectivity, stripped of hubris, unashamed either of its fallibility or of the modest assurance it has gained as a result of being out of place and not quite right.<br>

Abstract: Drawing attention to the complex reciprocal relationship between commercialized leisure and commercial literature in the so-called "Age of Wit," this essay reconceives of the witty and witless in two important ways. Taking for granted, first of all, that wit is usually analyzed in terms of the efficacy of verbal language, the essay examines how and why debates concerning true and false wit were played out in physical terms—in this case, through the motions, gestures, and attitudes of the dancing body. Second of all, the essay attempts to account for the enduring, if unwitting, attractions of "false wit" by likening it to the tricks and transformations of contemporary English pantomime. Satirists of the 1720s, 1730s, and 1740s frequently invoke the unmeaning motion of Harlequin as a visual way of proscribing the verbal excesses of extravagant language. At the same time, apologists for pantomime associate Harlequin's "dumb Wit" with truth, reason, and the pattern of nature, claiming that the genre's corporeality allowed it to transcend the limitations and equivocations of words. The essay concludes that the popularity of pantomime contextualizes the Augustan reaction against false wit, in that it identifies a source of aesthetic pleasure in the public's eagerness to be duped by apparent sameness in difference. Early eighteenth-century readers enjoy luxuriant, illogical, and mixed metaphors, forced similes, and trifling jibes and quibbles for the same reason that early eighteenth-century spectators delight in the unexpected turns of pantomimic entertainment: in a world under the sway of Harlequin's magical slapstick, audiences derive satisfaction from being deceived.<br>

Abstract: Building on 25 months of fieldwork in eastern Germany from 1991 to 2003, this article explores the interpenetration of aesthetics and politics, and questions them as theoretical categories. A multilayered description depicts aesthetic perception and action, guided by an imagery of façade, as constituted and reproduced by state policies, positioned experiences, and subversive responses. Moving beyond the Cold War legacy, aesthetics' potency and politicization is dated back to early nation building and Protestant and Romantic influences. Being essential to and controlled by shifting, largely authoritarian regimes, aesthetics simultaneously provided a 'shadow life' and a 'lingua franca', cross-cutting verbal and non-verbal mediums and everyday and high culture, as people juggled with, distrusted, and decoded surfaces, expressing and in search of deeper, hidden truths. I argue that historically generated aesthetic perceptions and praxis not only mark east German political culture but also emerge in Habermas's public sphere theory and, moreover, offer arguments to revise it.<br>

Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining resources for re-establishing communication when the hermeneutic circle breaks down in a moment of misunderstanding.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mankind: The discovery of the unreality of man's existence apart from God, is the discovery at the same time of the fact that God is the ultimate ground of the unity of mankind. According to Jaspers the fact of life are to conform to the principle of that wider order of reality disclosed to us in the experience of communication in which the reality of each person's likeness to the image of God finds its practical application. The development of communication depends on the principle of correlation of Existenz and Transcendenz which is the property of no finite existential self, but manifests itself alike in all. Though we may be confronted with the question "Is it God or the devil who governs the world?", it remains equally true that even "failure is no argument against the truth that is rooted in transcendence". 3) Ultimate Dignity of Man: Jaspers' unequivocal emphasis on freedom, stating that "Freedom and God are inseparable" serves to assure this ideal its place in human society. Thus man's exercise of freedom knits him up into the transcendental design. The claim that certain facts and experiences yield a basis for the recognition of the ultimate dignity of man is justified precisely by this evidence that through God, as inseparable from freedom, we discern the ultimate significance of both man and humanity.<br>

Abstract: The contemporary philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, has characterized the dominant trend in modern interpretative thought as the 'school of suspicion', whose most significant 'masters' are Freud and Nietzsche. For them, to seek meaning—whether in a text, dream, discourse, or institution—is, first and foremost, to suspect 'truth as lying'. It is my contention that Ricoeur could well have named Dostoevsky as a third master of this modern school of interpretation, for he, too, was preoccupied with exploring the possibility of 'truth as lying', whether to others or to oneself. The general concern of my essay is to clarify Dostoevsky's relation to the modern 'hermeneutics of suspicion' in a manner which is mutually illuminating. The particular focus is on Dostoevsky's hermeneutics of suspicion as employed in The Brothers Karamazov, especially with the object of deciphering the avowed 'love of humanity' which motivates Ivan Karamazov's famous 'rebellion' against God. Ivan's humanism is highly ambiguous, as his words and actions (of omission and commission) throughout the novel demonstrate. I attempt to show that the ambiguity of Ivan Karamazov can be illumined as an exercise of suspicion on Dostoevsky's part which distinguishes between the manifest sources of Ivan's moral stance and what is in reality its hidden basis. And, in order to situate Dostoevsky in relation to the modern 'school of suspicion', his interpretation of the ambiguous text of modern humanism is compared with that of Nietzsche. The dialogue which the essay sets up between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky on the problem embodied by Ivan Karamazov reveals areas of convergence and divergence: the former apparent in a shared suspicion of a secular humanism which affirms the love of humanity apart from religious faith; and the latter apparent in their different understandings of love—whether of humanity or of God. The comparison between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, then, highlights the distinction between a hermeneutics of suspicion which is ultimately reductive in intent, and one which can be said to be ultimately 'recollective'.<br>

Abstract: The correlation of narrative and ethics has a long history in literature, and frequently ethics has been associated with a transcendental notion of truth. The recent attention to narrative and theology has offered more theoretical reflections of both poetic and hermeneutical practices that return us to the earliest literary, philosophical and theological productions. In this essay, I wish to present a different way of examining the correlation of narrative and ethics; one less orientated towards Scripture and less concerned with the Church. The narratives I consider are secular fictions from the modernist period. Through examining these works phenomenologically and the role the imagination plays in the production of beliefs, I argue that all narratives structure emotions, desires and hopes and this structuring continually opens up a transcendent horizon.<br>

Abstract: In this essay, I argue that Penelope Fitzgerald's The Gate of Angels attempts to work out the difficulties that any intelligent, religiously inclined person must come to terms with in the twentieth, now twentieth-first, century. Fitzgerald sought not to shelter her religious belief behind a cloister wall, thinking like her uncle the Reverend Wilfred Knox, "that no cloister walls can be high enough to exclude the cares of the world." Among these cares is the desire to give a faithful report of the world to each other, to know this world as it exists in truth, and not to misrepresent it. Early twentieth-century investigations into the makeup of the physical world as well as the theoretical and intellectual advances possible with quantum physics were very much part of this desire; and in The Gate of Angels, set in and around Cambridge University's pre-war physics laboratories, Fitzgerald offers a beautiful rendering of the excitement engendered by these investigations. At the same time, Fitzgerald offers a picture, true to her own experience, wherein things that in the popular mind are often conceived of as opposite and irreconcilable—for instance, chance and necessity—are found to stand in a relation of sympathy, casting over The Gate of Angels "that sympathetic glow which," Henry James wrote, "forms half the substance of our genial impressions."<br>

Author(s): Grethlein Jonas<br>
Abstract: This book examines Greek engagements with the past as articulations of memory formulated against the contingency of chance associated with temporality. Based on a phenomenological understanding of temporality, it identifies four memorializing strategies: continuity (tradition), regularity (exemplarity), development, and acceptance of chance. This framework serves in pursuing a twofold aim: to reconstruct the literary field of memory in fifth-century BCE Greece; and to interpret Greek historiography as a memorializing mode. The key contention advanced by this approach is that acts of memory entailed an "idea of history" that was articulated not only in historiography, but also in epinician poetry, elegy, tragedy, and oratory. The book offers a rich account of poetic conventions and contexts through which each of these genres counterbalanced contingency through the use of exemplary and traditional modes of memory. This fine analysis highlights the grip of the present on the past as a significant feature of both historiographical and nonhistoriographical genres. The essay argues that this work fills a disciplinary gap by extending the reflection on memory to a new period, Greek antiquity. The retrospective positioning of this period at the outset of Western historical thought brings Grethlein's investigation to the center of debates about memory, temporality, and the meaning history. In engaging with the book's argument, the essay suggests that historiographical memory emerged in Greece not as a first-order encounter with time, but as a second-order encounter with forgetting. This confrontation marked a certain separation of historiography from other memorializing genres. Whereas poetic and rhetorical memories were posited against contingency, historiography sought to retrieve those aspects of the past that may otherwise have been irretrievably lost and forgotten. In doing so, it formulated the historiographical imperative as a negation of forgetting that problematized the truth-value of memory and the very act of remembering the past.<br>

Author(s): Bruns Gerald L.<br>
Abstract: The basic unit of Joyce's fiction is, arguably, the encounter, a reminder of the Dubliners story of that name. This essay explores the many occasions of self-encounter, as when Joyce's characters see themselves in mirrors, in the eyes of others, or in the guise of someone other than they are or appear to be: when Gerty MacDowell projects her "Lady Bountiful" self onto Bloom's erotic gaze, for instance. The regulating idea here (as in Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception) is that we perceive ourselves through our bodies, but this perception is not an empirical mirror-image; it is an image mediated (and thus transformed) by an array of intentions, memories, desires, and ongoing experiences of ourselves and others, including our experiences of how others see us (something to which Stephen is particularly subject). Joyce's mirror-experiences range from ironic unmasking—"The Dead"—to phantasmagorias—the "Circe" episode of Ulysses, where no image is unreal, and every misnomer (like "Henry Flower") has its moment of truth.<br>

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-
versed version of the structural features of evil. Resolving the evil I do toward the other re-
quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutic and anti-hermeneutic sides in the debate about psychoanalysis are entangled in an epistemological and methodological antinomy, here exemplified by Grünbaum's and Spence's paradigmatic views. Both contain a partial element of truth, which they assert dialectically one against the other (§§ 1 and 2). This antinomy disappers only by reconciling an operationalist approach with man's ability to suspend the effectiveness of the 'laws' applied to him (§ 3). The hermeneutic way in which the technical-operational criterion of truth works in psychoanalysis demands that clinical and extra-clinical testing methods work synergically, through a fruitful self-correcting strategy, grounded on the very psychoanalytic object: the unconscious (§ 4).<br>

Abstract: The trial of Adolf Eichmann, in 1961, is generally considered a turning point in the history of Holocaust memory because it brought the Holocaust into the public sphere for the first time as a discrete event on an international scale. In the same year, Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin's film Chronicle of a Summer appeared in France. While absent from scholarship on memory of the Nazi genocide for over forty years, Chronicle of a Summer contains a scene of Holocaust testimony that suggests the need to look beyond the Eichmann trial for alternative articulations of public Holocaust remembrance. This essay considers the juxtaposition in Chronicle of a Summer of Holocaust memory and the history of decolonization in order to rethink the "unique" place that the Holocaust has come to hold in discourses on extreme violence. The essay argues that a discourse of truth and testimony arose in French resistance to the Algerian war that shaped and was shaped by memory of the Nazi genocide.<br>

Abstract: In the context of the family’s crisis, in addition to the marital failures that produce suffering and inconvenience, there are biases due to controversies, ideological interests and opinions, which originate general and simplistic solutions to complex problems with peculiar characteristics. The article, – according to the commitment of the Holy Father Francisco to mitigate the heavy burden of people in “irregular” unions (where situations of fragility or misery improve stigma of exclusion) – try demonstrate the continuity of the Magisterium Pontifical Council, in which
         Amoris Laetitiaand the reform of the canonical matrimonial process were inserted. Through the study of the answers and the search for solutions that are careful to the hierarchy of truths, the Holy Father pointed out: “to generate personal and personalized processes”; to follow paths of reflection and discreet understanding the conditions of each case; ultimately, to help progress guided by a logic of forgiveness and reconciliation, according to a merciful and encouraging pastoral care. Sacraments and consciences, both sacred, require to be served with truth.<br>

Abstract: La littérature académique de langue française fait un usage très abondant des notions d’ancrage et d’enracinement quand elle traite de l’habiter et des pratiques résidentielles. Si l’origine métaphorique de ces notions est parfois rappelée, sinon exploitée, par les auteurs qui y ont recours, elle est souvent passée sous silence. Cet article propose de raviver la dimension métaphorique de ces notions, en les complétant de deux autres – mouillage et amarrage – dans une double intention: d’une part, en montrant qu’en les prenant au sérieux, il est possible de leur faire désigner différents types de rapport aux lieux qui exploitent directement les images sous-jacentes; d’autre part, en rappelant que ces images participent d’une poétique du savoir qui distille des effets de vérité dont les motivations sont à rechercher dans les options épistémologiques majeures adoptées.<br>

Abstract: Francophone academic literature makes abundant use of the notions of anchoring and rootedness when dealing with dwelling and residential practices. Though the metaphoric origin of these notions can be evoked, and even exploited by the authors, it is generally glossed over. This article seeks to revive the metaphorical dimension of these terms by adding two others – mooring and docking. Our goal is twofold. First, we demonstrate that by taking the terms seriously, it is possible to have them designate different types of of relationships to place, which directly use underlying images. Second, we discuss how these images participate in the poetics of knowledge that distills the effects of truth, whose motivations must be sought out in the major epistemological options that have been adopted.<br>

Abstract: The rhetoric of social work often seeks its legitimacy and authority on the idea that knowledge can be translated into skills. Knowledge is made in universities in the form of timeless, objective, context-free truths about people and social institutions. Such knowledge rationalizes and justifies the professional practices of social work. It is not clear, however, that the knowledge-into-skills story fully explains social work practices. Practice is often ineffective and tends to throw social workers into moral quandaries, leaving them to practice in a context of faith and doubt. In addition to skills, social workers share values, purposes, the wielding of and submission to power, and mythic stories. Timely, value-expressive, contextual knowledge helps social work to create and maintain social solidarity and to shift its dispositions of skills, purposes, power, and myth to keep up with the pace of social change.<br>

Abstract: Narratives of the Tibetan resistance army are not a part of national history in the Tibetan exile community. Drawing on stories by veterans of the resistance to the Chinese invasion and the explanations they give of its absence in Tibetan national history, I argue that this history has been "arrested" because of the challenges it poses to normative versions of history and community and, in turn, to internal and external representations of Tibet. This practice signifies the postponing of narrating certain histories until a time in the future when the dangers they pose to sustaining a unified Tibetan community in exile has receded. This practice of historical (un)production offers insight into temporality and subjectivity, plural identities in the face of national hegemony, and why history might be considered a combination of truth, fear, and lies.<br>

Abstract: It is here proposed the elimination of the concept of truth in analytical construction by substituting for it the concept of terminal evidence of an assertion. Terminal evidence is in turn explained in terms of anschauliche non-deterministic sequences and portions of finitist logic generated by these sequences are sketched both for statements without quantifiers and statements with first order quantifiers. Emphasis is given to the nature of negation and existence in the proposed elimination. /// Es wird vorgeschlagen, die Eliminierung des Wahrheitsbegriffes in der analytischen Konstruktion durch die Einsetzung des Begriffes der endgultigen Evidenz einer Aussage durchzufuhren. Bei der Einfuhrung von anschaulichen akausalen Folgen lasst sich der Begriff der endgultigen Evidenz erklaren und Teile der finiten Logik, die solche Folgen erzeugen, werden skizziert sowohl fur Aussagen ohne Quantoren als auch fur solche, bei denen nur Quantoren der ersten Stufe vorkommen. Die Natur der Negation und des Existenz-Begriffes ist insbesondere hervorgehoben. /// É proposto efectuar-se a eliminação do conceito de verdade na construção analitica pela introdução do conceito da evidência terminal de uma asserção. Com a introdução de sucessões não-deterministas é elucidado o conceito de evidência terminal e os fragmentos de lógica finitista que estas sucessões originam são esboçados quer para o caso de asserçães sem quantores quer para aquelas asserções em que só ocorrem quantores de 1.a ordem. A natureza da negação e do conceito da existência são especialmente destacados.<br>

Abstract: L'article examine les conceptions de Foucault concernant l'histoire de la vérité, ainsi que les rapports entre la volonté de savoir, la volonté de vérité et les formes du pouvoir. Il rappelle comment les notions nietzschéennes de volonté de vérité et de volonté de puissance font place dans son oeuvre à la volonté de savoir comme instrument des rapports de domination. On examine ensuite comment la notion d'autorité, entendue à la fois au sens institutionnel et au sens discursif, peut permettre une sociologisation des approches traditionnelles de la vérité, élaborées par les philosophes. Comment la visée de vérité du discours s'est-elle combinée historiquement avec la volonté de savoir des institutions ? Y a-t-il différents régimes de vérité, liés à des modalités de discours différentes, mais aussi à des formes d'autorité institutionnelle ? Est-il possible de construire une généalogie des figures de l'autorité discursive ? The paper examines Foucaultian views about the history of truth, as well as the relationships between the will to truth and the different forms of power. It reminds how Nietzsche's conceptions about the will to truth and the will to power are replaced in Foucault's work by the will to truth as a means of power relationships. The paper looks furthermore at the possibility of using the notion of authority, understood both in the institutional and in the discursive sense, as a tool for a sociologization of traditional approaches to truth, constructed by philosophers. How did the pursuit of truth historically combine with the will to knowledge belonging to the institutions ? Are there different regimes of truth, tied to different discursive modalities, as well as to institutional forms of authority ? Is it possible to construct a genealogy of figures of discursive authority ?<br>

Abstract: Cette note de synthèse souligne la spécificité de la discipline enseignée. L'histoire scolaire occupe une position originale dans le champ des didactiques par la complexité de ses références (production savante, auto-référence scolaire et usages publics de l'histoire). Tendus entre une transmission de connaissances consensuelles et la recherche d'une posture critique, les objets d'histoire enseignés demeurent soumis à des questionnements renouvelés au gré de la demande sociale comme le montrent les récents débats autour des questions mémorielles vives et concurrentes. L'histoire enseignée apparaît ainsi comme un mixte articulant représentations sociales, savoirs privés et connaissances validées. Depuis une quinzaine d'années, des travaux ont permis de mieux cerner le « penser en histoire » et les processus cognitifs spécifiques en jeu dans la classe (temps historique, conceptualisation, problématisation, construction de schemes explicatifs). Des recherches contextualisées ont permis d'explorer les pratiques professionnelles effectives et d'en modéliser le fonctionnement « normal » : une discipline qui privilégie la transmission de savoirs disant la réalité du passé et attachée à la neutralité du texte enseigné ; une discipline qui peine à mettre en cohérence des finalités intellectuelles ambitieuses (outiller le citoyen actif dans la cité de demain) et des activités dans la classe souvent cantonnées à la mémorisation, au repérage et à la catégorisation. Aussi voit-on se dessiner dans les travaux actuels, une problématique centrée sur les écarts entre les intentions et les pratiques. En articulant la notion de soumission aux règles du « contrat didactique » avec les autres modèles théoriques des sciences humaines et sociales mobilisés au sein des équipes de recherche, les travaux menés de manière encore trop dispersée, laissent apparaître des acquis importants qui pourraient être pris en compte dans la formation des enseignants This paper underlines the specificity of the subject taught. School history holds a special position in didactics due to the complexity of its references (scholarly production, self referencing and public use of history). Set in between passing consensual knowledge on and seeking a critical position, school history objects are still under new questioning that changes with social demands as recent debates on actual competing questions related to memory show it. Therefore school history seems to be a blend of social representations, private knowledge and proven knowledge. For fifteen years, works have enabled us to better define "historical thinking" and the specific cognitive processes that are involved in class (historical time, conceptualization, problematization, construction of explanatory schemes). Conceptualized research have allowed to explore real professional practices and model their "normal" functioning: a subject that favours passing on knowledge telling the truth about the past and being attached to using neutral documents; a subject that has difficulty to coherently link ambitious intellectual purposes (preparing active citizens for tomorrow's world) to class activities often limited to memorizing, recognizing and sorting. That is why we can see a problematic develop which is centered on the difference between intentions and practices. Connecting the notion of adherence to the rules of the "didactical contract" to the other theoretical models of human sciences developed within the research team., the work -done in a still too unfocused way -reveals some important acquired knowledge which could be taken into account in teacher training programmes. Esta nota subraya la especificidad de la disciplina enseñada. La historia escolar ocupa una posición original en el campo de las didácticas por la complejidad de sus referencias (producción sabia, autorreferencia escolar y usos públicos de la historia). Divididos entre una transmisión de conocimientos consensúales y la búsqueda de una postura crítica, los objetos de historia enseñados permanecen sometidos a interrogaciones repetidas a merced de la petición social como lo muestran los debates recientes en torno a las cuestiones relativas a las memorias vivas y competidoras. La historia enseñada aparece así como una mezcla que articula representaciones sociales, saberes privados y conocimientos validados. Desde hace unos quince años, ciertos trabajos permitieron delimitar mejor el "pensar en historia" y los procesos cognoscitivos específicos en juego en la clase (tiempo histórico, conceptualización, problematización, construcción de esquemas explicativos). Investigaciones contextualizadas han permitido explorar las prácticas profesionales efectivas y modelizar su funcionamiento "normal": una disciplina que privilegia la transmisión de saberes que dicen la realidad del pasado y apegada a la neutralidad del texto enseñado; una disciplina a la que le cuesta poner en coherencia finalidades intelectuales ambiciosas (preparar al ciudadano activo en la ciudad de mañana) y actividades en la clase a menudo limitadas a la memorización, la localización y la categorización. Por eso se ve dibujarse en los trabajos actuales, una problemática centrada en las diferencias entre las intenciones y las prácticas. Articulando la noción de sumisión a las reglas del "contrato didáctico" con los otros modelos teóricos de las SHS movilizadas en el seno de los equipos de investigación, los trabajos llevados de manera todavía demasiado dispersada dejan aparecer experiencias ¡mportantes que podrían tomarse en consideración en la formación de los docentes. Dieser Bericht unterstreicht die Besonderheit des Schulfachs Geschichte. Geschichte in der Schule hat eine originale Stellung im Feld der Didaktik wegen der Komplexität ihrer Referenzen (wissenschaftliche Schriften, Referenz für sich selbst in der Schule und öffentliche Benutzung der Geschichte). Zwischen der Verbreitung konsesueller Kenntnisse und der Suche nach einer kritischen Haltung hin-und hergerissen, sind die Lehrinhalte in Geschichte nach wie vor je nach sozialer Anfrage einer ständigen Fragestellung ausgesetzt, wie neulich die Debatten um lebhafte und entgegengesetzte Gedächtnisfragen. Die Geschichte als Schulfach erscheint also als eine Mischung zwischen sozialen Vorstellungen, privatem Wissen und bewährten Kenntnissen. Seit etwa 15 Jahren haben einige Arbeiten es ermöglicht, das „Denken in Geschichte” und die kognitiven Prozesse besser einzuschätzen, die in der Schule auf dem Spiel stehen (historische Zeit, Konzeptualisierung, Problematisierung, Bildung erklärender Schemata). Kontextualisierte Forschungsarbeiten haben es erlaubt, die tatsächlichen Berufspraktiken zu erforschen und „normalen” Betrieb zu modellieren: ein Schulfach, das die Übertragung von Kenntnissen, die die Realität der Vergangenheit beschreibt und großen Wert auf die Neutralität des unterrichteten Textes legt; ein Fach, das sich Mühe gibt, ehrgeizige intellektuelle Zwecke (den aktiven Bürger in der Stadt von morgen mit Werkzeugen bewaffnen) mit Aktivitäten in der Klasse in Kohärenz zu bringen, die sich oft auf Memorisierung, Markierung und Kategorisierung begrenzen. Auf diese Weise kann man in den heutigen Arbeiten beobachten, wie eine Problematik auftaucht, im Mittelpunkt derer die Diskrepanz zwischen Absichten und Praktiken steht. In dem man den Begriff der Unterwerfung zu den Regeln des „didaktischen Vertrags” mit den anderen theoretischen Modellen (in den Sozial-und Geschichtswissenschaften) kombiniert, die in den Forschungsteams benutzt werden, lassen die bisher auf noch zu verstreute Weise geführten Arbeiten wichtige Erwerbungen erkennen, die in der Lehrerausbildung berücksichtigt werden könnten.<br>

Abstract: Throughoput its history, "ideology" (the concept and theory) served as social science's foil, an opposing standard against which it defined its own knowledge-as-truth. As social science since mid-century has undergone changes in its idea of itself and its methods of inquiry, the theory of ideology has served as register, visably recording these changes. Works by the structuralists and poststructuralists, especially Althusser and Foucault, forced upon social theorists a profound rethinking of power and its operations and moved "ideology" away from the theory of false consciousness towards a view of ideology as cultural practice. For some, ideology theory is obsolete (due to its classical roots as "false consciousness") or redundant (due to its links to "culture"). Despite the merits of these arguments, a provisional argument on behalf of ideology theory is offered.<br>

Abstract: Richard Rorty uses Nietzsche to show that people need to create themselves because there is no foundationalist language which they can establish as an anchor. Although this perspective is Nietzschean, it is not Jamesian, and so Rorty misappropriates James when he conflates James and Nietzsche as like-minded progenitors of the mythologizing of a privileged vocabulary. This essay evaluates Rorty's reading of James by considering whether truth in Rorty's textualist sense can abide by the stream of thought. Although James does mythologize privileged vocabularies, he believes that words need to reflect the world more accurately (something Rorty would never say) by abiding by the flux of experience. As such, James recognizes the value that old words have as tools. Whereas Rorty shows disdain for old words, James shows us the cash value those words have in helping us to do anything from paying our bills to constructing more practical and effective theories.<br>

Abstract: The article asserts that a search for truth ought to be carrying out in such a way as to preserve or enhance solidarity. It demonstrates the necessity and the difficulties of making atrocious and traumatic historical events legally accountable. The necessity and difficulties have been recently fuelled by the trends towards the openness of modern identity and the growing importance of human rights, both of them demanding settling conflicts in the context of the multiplication of particularistic memories, yet without undermining social solidarity constructed on liberal foundations. The article argue that because of the hybrid nature of the task, unresolved tensions between memory and history, the erosion of the state's ability to impose unitary and unifying framework of memory, there is no simple and quick solution to tensions between memory, solidarity, and therefore to manage these strains we need to rely a plurality of contending narratives and civility of rules.<br>

Abstract: This article seeks to address how Lebanese youth are dealing with the legacy of civil war (1975-90), given the national backdrop of official silence, persisting injustice, and competing memory discourses. Drawing on Marianne Hirsch's concept of postmemory, it explores the memory of a generation of Lebanese who have grown up dominated not by traumatic events but by narrative accounts of events that preceded their birth. This residual form of memory carries and connects with the pain of others, suffusing temporal frames and liminal positions. The article examines how postmemory is mediated and transformed through the mnemonic lenses of visual landscapes and oral narratives. Consideration is given to the dynamic production of "memoryscapes"—memories of violence localized in particular sites—and to narrative constructions of the past implicated in the ongoing search for meaning, historical truth, and identity. This article seeks to challenge pervasive notions of Lebanese postwar amnesia and of a generational detachment from the residual effects and future implications of war recollections.<br>

Abstract: A community, in the same way as an individual, can follow as a normal way of behaviour — or as a wanted criteria for behaviour — for all future circumstances to decide discretionally, «case by case», or to define in a moment in time the rule (or a set of rules) that must be valid for the future. To define rules in a community has been indicated by some authors (Geoffrey Brennan and James M. Buchanan particularly) as a way to exit from a situation of a war of every man against every other man, as in the Hobbesian jungle, on one side, and from a situation dominated by a Leviathan on the other. This in a perspective where rules of a common living have been set through a social contract. The rules established through this contract would also form the criteria for a just conduct, in the end therefore for criteria of justice. The essay analyzes the situations and the conditions in which constraining oneself can be rational, even as it is not definible that in all circumstances constraining is more rational than not constraining oneself, that it is more desirable to have rules rather than discretionary decisions, the definition of ways of behaviour rather than the pre-definition of outcomes. As for what concerns the problem of justice, it is indicated how through a contractarian and constitutional procedure rules can be put by unanimous consent, but the problem of the foundation of the same rules remains unresolved. Rules do not seek truth, but only express values accepted by the counterparts in a certain moment in time, and have individuals as sources of these values.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we attempt to show the fruitfulness of the theory of communicative action for memory studies. Specifically, we intend to demonstrate that concepts characteristic of the discipline, such as "history," "memory," and "dialogue," reflect three types of universal validity claims: "memory" formulates claims to authenticity, "history" formulates claims to truth, and "dialogue" formulates claims to Tightness. Thus, it is possible to introduce a seminal Habermasian notion of rationality that rests on validity claims. This notion can serve to integrate, enrich, and identify blind spots in memory studies. Our purpose is to demonstrate the relevance of collective memory to social cohesion (cultural reproduction, social integration, and socialization) and the public sphere (its development and atrophy, rationalization, and colonization).<br>

Abstract: This article explores the thesis that educators are called to define and describe truth morefoundationally than we have ever done before if tve are to facilitate existence that is right, just, correct on both a personal and communal level. This thesis is sourced in ever-deepening attentiveness to, appreciation for, and affirmation of this statement of Adrian van Kaam: "The work of reformation starts in the heart by means of the human spirit; it is the reclamation of the soul, via the spirit, of its innermost form direction. " Suggesting that education which would be truly correctional must, therefore, reach into the very heart of being, the author describes the current paradigm shift from the Newtonian model of what it means to be human with its positivistic approaches to learning to a more Einsteinian or fullfield understanding of human being and its requirement of more formative learning processes. In consonance with the truth of being as full-field, formative correctional education is reflective and experiential, dialogical, narrative in form, and globally inclusive. In her discussion of each of these methodologies, the author illustrates how each one draws us deeper into the truth of who we are and inspires us to be the unique presence that we are in the world. Through such methods and processes, individuals are formed, reformed, and transformed not only in self-appreciation and openness to their own possibilities, but in appreciation for the meaning and value of their existence with others in the world.<br>

Abstract: The manner in which the LDS Church administers its temple rite constitutes a strategic use of the conventions of an oral tradition in a modern, literate society. Three effects of this strategy are considered. First, refusing to make a text of the rite available and insisting that its specific content not be revealed or otherwise subjected to discursive thought sustains the rite's canonical authority as immutable truth, notwithstanding its periodic mutation. Secondly, the conventions of oral tradition structure the relationships created by the ritual and constitute a principal means by which the Church's historic separatism is maintained. Finally, these conventions when applied to the temple rite maximize ritual's capacity to adapt the canon to the needs of successive generations of the faithful while minimizing skepticism and schism.<br>

Abstract: Les mathématiques, auxquelles on peut joindre la logique, et depuis 1960 une large part de l'informatique théorique, fournissent un témoignage sur une part essentielle du fonctionnement de l'esprit humain. Loin de fournir seulement des outils extérieurs, elles se sont faites mode de pensée nécessaire pour appréhender la réalité physique. Elles nous ont appris que ce que nous nommons raison, démarche rationnelle, est en réalité laborieusement construit. Un bref survol de l'histoire des mathématiques, anciennes, puis surtout depuis le XIXe s., montre en quel sens le concept ancien de « vérité scientifique » s'en trouve désormais modifié. Mathematics, to which one may add logic and, since 1960, a large section of theoretical computer technique, all furnish evidence concerning an essential part of the working of the human mind. Far from providing only external tools, they have evolved as a necessary mode of thought for the understanding of physical reality. They have taught us that what we call reason, or rational deduction, is in fact something we have ourselves laboriously constructed. A brief survey of the history of mathematics, ancient and modern but especially from and after the 19th century, shows ways in which the old concept of a 'scientific truth' must henceforth be modified.<br>

Abstract: The Hebrew Bible depicts interpretation as a continual process of losing and finding, of forgetting and remembering. Texts are lost and found, and in the Joseph story (Gen. 37-50), Joseph himself is abandoned and recovered, with all memory of him repressed until it is dramatically recalled. His story demonstrates that repression is the condition of interpretation, and that interpretation-not resurrection-holds forth the promise of a future life. Nonetheless, the repeated losses that punctuate the Joseph narrative have inspired the opposite conclusion: that Joseph is a type of Jesus, that his descents and ascents prefigure the final one. Typology, a mode of biblical interpretation that prevailed during the early church, has enjoyed a recent revival in the context of literary studies; but I argue that the typological language of "fulfillment," of shadows and truth, is alien to Hebraic-and postmodern-understandings of textuality.<br>

Abstract: Reason as the medium of truth and freedom-though suppressed, the idea returns; it is presumed by our very participation in discourse. Its opponents say that only practices are real. But, as Milton and Habermas know, reason is itself a practice. Milton's "free and lawful debate at all times... of what opinion soever" recognizes interestedness, perspectivity, and struggle; Habermas's unconstrained communication is a neverachieved goal (an "ideal") regulating discursive practices here and now. Both writers recognize that meanings are cultural, social, and existential, that knowledge cannot be separated from interests; but they do not therefore stand outside praxis rhapsodizing about struggle and contingency. Instead, they seek to move toward social freedom and individual autonomy through reason-able communication-that ongoing search for unforced agreement which is our usual and best alternative to violence, our usual and best way to find meaning in the world, in our selves, and in one another.<br>

Abstract: Historiography in Francoist Spain (1939-75) sought to affirm the morally and historically correct role of the regime within the flow of Spanish history. As an important vehicle of dissidence, the novel of memory stands in sharp contrast to Francoist history: it explores the past largely eschewed or appropriated by the regime and contests the so-called truths that Franco shaped through the discourse of myth. This essay examines the role of subjective memory as a challenge to historiography and discloses the narrative strategies novelists used to counter the government's myths. Unlike Francoist historiography, the novel of memory lays out history as a series of disruptions and undermines the referential illusion of truth and wholeness in our understanding of the past.<br>

Abstract: The Mexican state's use of revolutionary history to invoke nationalistic sentiments nurtures a lively tradition of storytelling. Ironically, Buena Vista's storytellers criticize the inauthenticity of official representations of the past even as they draw on the images and ideals of "official" history to weave their own tales. This article argues that discourses of authenticity reinscribe historic distinctions between the community and the state in a language which evokes modern notions of purity and truth. The article highlights the political role of discourses of authenticity within the hegemonic structures of modern state power in Mexico.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: The point here is that whoever I am in terms of my personal identity and my capacity or incapacity to identify myself through sortal terms as a being in the world with others, I will have no doubt who is in pain or who will have the pain. Here, again, is a sense of “I” in which I can be aware of myself and refer to myself without it being necessary to employ any nonindexical or third-personal referents.<br>

Abstract: No doubt the rise of religion has not only posed a particular dilemma for critical theory but also provided a curious place to end this reflection. Having started my career doing philosophy of religion it is somewhat surprising to meet religion again as I turn to what surely must be at least a later phase of my career. I am reminded of Antonio's line from the Italian film
            C'eravamo Tanto Amati, translated asWe All Loved Each Other So Much: “We thought we could change the world, but the world changed us.” “Philosophers only interpret the world, the point is to change it,” so said Marx. But in a curious way those who would change the world are changed by it.<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169
