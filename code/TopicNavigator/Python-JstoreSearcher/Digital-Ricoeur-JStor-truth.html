  Author(s) Alison James<br>
  Abstract: Mimetic theory’s encounter with world religions may be pictured as a tension between two powerful vectors or currents. The mainstream is the openness to the truth to be found in non-Christian religions, which we find articulated by the Second Vatican Council in 1965 (within a few years of the publication of
                  Deceit, Desire, and the Novel), and taken forward in a series of official Roman Catholic pronouncements. I trace these developments not with a sectarian intent, but because these declarations comprise a legitimate heuristic: René Girard himself is a committed Catholic Christian, and among mimetic theorists exploring the implications of<br>

  Author(s) Ell Theodore<br>
  Abstract: In the last fifteen years, Girard has engaged in a dialogue with the Italian philosopher Gianni Vattimo. Vattimo is famous for a philosophical approach named
                  pensiero debole(weak thought). “Weak thought” is basically concerned with arguing for philosophical antifoundationalism: drawing on the philosophy of Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Gadamer, Vattimo advocates the rejection of metaphysics and a reinterpretation of truth as the opening of horizons. Vattimo has explained that he came to recognize a “completion” of Heidegger in Girard by reading “the weakening of Being as its sole form of manifesting itself beyond metaphysical oblivion” as “an analogon of the dissolution<br>

  Abstract: The dramatic ending of the Second World War—the obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the revelation of the holocaust, the establishment of the United Nations, and the transformation of the Soviet Union from wartime ally to global competitor—challenged prevailing precepts and practices of international relations. Abjuring the traditional language of diplomacy, elite and public policy discourses of the 1940s were spoken within the horizons of global necessities and apocalyptic fears. A Soviet atomic test in 1949 yet again disrupted the contexts of international relations. “In truth, the first atomic explosion on Russian soil has shattered American foreign policy as<br>

  Abstract: In his classic sociology textbook published in 1909, Charles Horton Cooley assessed the relationship between democracy and religion. ʺThe democratic movement,ʺ he wrote, ʺinsomuch as it feels a common spirit in all men, is of the same nature as Christianity; and it is said with truth that while the world was never so careless as now of the mechanism of religion, it was never so Christian in feeling.ʺ Comparing the ʺhigher spirit of democracyʺ to the ʺteaching of Jesus Christ,ʺ Cooley claimed that Jesus ʺcalls the mind out of the narrow and transient self of sensual appetites and visible appurtenances,<br>

  Book Title: For René Girard-Essays in Friendship and in Truth<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Williams James G.<br>
  Abstract: In his explorations of the relations between the sacred and violence, René Girard has hit upon the origin of culture-the way culture began, the way it continues to organize itself. The way communities of human beings structure themselves in a manner that is different from that of other species on the planet.Like Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Émile Durkheim, Martin Buber, or others who have changed the way we think in the humanities or in the human sciences, Girard has put forth a set of ideas that have altered our perceptions of the world in which we function. We will never be able to think the same way again about mimetic desire, about the scapegoat mechanism, and about the role of Jewish and Christian scripture in explaining sacrifice, violence, and the crises from which our culture has been born.The contributions fall into roughly four areas of interpretive work: religion and religious study; literary study; the philosophy of social science; and psychological studies.The essays presented here are offered as "essays" in the older French sense of attempts (essayer) or trials of ideas, as indeed Girard has tried out ideas with us. With a conscious echo of Montaigne, then, this hommage volume is titled

  Abstract: What, exactly, is knowledge of music? And what does it tell us about humanistic knowledge in general?
      The Thought of Musicgrapples directly with these fundamental questions-questions especially compelling at a time when humanistic knowledge is enmeshed in debates about its character and future. In this third volume in a trilogy on musical understanding that includesInterpreting MusicandExpression and Truth, Lawrence Kramer seeks answers in both thoughtaboutmusic and thoughtinmusic-thinking in tones. He skillfully assesses musical scholarship in the aftermath of critical musicology and musical hermeneutics and in view of more recent concerns with embodiment, affect, and performance. This authoritative and timely work challenges the prevailing conceptions of every topic it addresses: language, context, and culture; pleasure and performance; and, through music, the foundations of understanding in the humanities.<br>

  Book Title: Alef, Mem, Tau-Kabbalistic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfson Elliot R.<br>
  Abstract: This highly original, provocative, and poetic work explores the nexus of time, truth, and death in the symbolic world of medieval kabbalah. Demonstrating that the historical and theoretical relationship between kabbalah and western philosophy is far more intimate and extensive than any previous scholar has ever suggested, Elliot R. Wolfson draws an extraordinary range of thinkers such as Frederic Jameson, Martin Heidegger, Franz Rosenzweig, William Blake, Julia Kristeva, Friedrich Schelling, and a host of kabbalistic figures into deep conversation with one another.
      Alef, Mem, Taualso discusses Islamic mysticism and Buddhist thought in relation to the Jewish esoteric tradition as it opens the possibility of a temporal triumph of temporality and the conquering of time through time. The framework for Wolfson's examination is the rabbinic teaching that the wordemet,"truth," comprises the first, middle, and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet,alef, mem,andtau,which serve, in turn, as semiotic signposts for the three tenses of time-past, present, and future. By heeding the letters ofemetwe discern the truth of time manifestly concealed in the time of truth, the beginning that cannot begin if it is to be the beginning, the middle that re/marks the place of origin and destiny, and the end that is the figuration of the impossible disclosing the impossibility of figuration, the finitude of death that facilitates the possibility of rebirth. The time of death does not mark the death of time, but time immortal, the moment of truth that bestows on the truth of the moment an endless beginning of a beginningless end, the truth of death encountered incessantly in retracing steps of time yet to be taken-between, before, beyond.<br>

  Abstract: If the passing of the so-called master narratives that have shaped modern ways of knowing the world—accounts based on belief in the progress of scientific reason, for example, or human emancipation—is partly a result of discontent with their apparent claims to a monopoly on truth or their rigid laws of developmentalism, there is no little irony in the fact that they are being replaced, in some instances, by what might be called cultural naturalism as the explanatory model of change in the history of culture and power.

  Abstract: Where does Plato come into our scheme of things? With him we are dealing with a thinker who carefully worked out a cosmology and eschatology of rebirth. I doubt that he would have done so had he not personally believed in its truth, and, for me, it is senseless to convert figures like the Buddha and Plato into figures of the European Enlightenment or, as some do, into modern and postmodern thinkers. Plato was not interested in conversion, but he addressed his message to those willing to listen, which for the most part meant the members of his academy. Nevertheless,<br>

  Abstract: Scholars have spilled a lot of ink criticizing Bultmann’s program of demythologizing on the grounds that it ignores the truths that myths, particularly those associated with Christian faith, are uniquely able to communicate. The truth of myth is played off against demythologizing as if the latter rejects myth

One often hears that demythologizing is merely the extrication of the kerygma from the shackles of myth on the assumption that Bultmann views everything associated with the label of myth as primitive falsehood.

Even the placing of the camera for a film consisting of a single “take” (uninterrupted shot) is a manipulation. The camera reflects the filmmaker’s view.¹ Most filmmakers believe, however, that their manipulation creates a “greater truth,” what Flaherty’s wife, Frances, called “that high moment of seeing, that flash of penetration into the heart of the matter” (Jacobs 1979:8).

Consequently, to presume, as the narrator frequently does, that he manifests supreme goodness seems a mockery of truth. Offended, moderns may retort that, far from being supremely good and deserving worship, the Father deserves to be repudiated as evil.

  Book Title: Gazing Through a Prism Darkly: Reflections on Merold Westphal's Hermeneutical Epistemology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): PUTT B. KEITH<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal has been in the foremost ranks of philosophers who proclaim a new postsecular philosophy. By articulating an epistemology sensitive to the realities of cognitive finitude and moral weakness, he defends a wisdom that begins in both humility and commitment, one that always confesses that human beings can encounter meaning and truth only as human beings, never as gods.The present volume focuses on this wisdom of humility that characterizes Westphal's thought and explores how that wisdom, expressed through the redemptive dynamic of doubt, can contribute to developing a postsecular apologetic for faith.This book can function both as an accessible introduction to Westphal for those who have not read him extensively and also as an informed critical appreciation and extension of his work for those who are more experienced readers.<br>

  Book Title: Sounding/Silence: Martin Heidegger at the Limits of Poetics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SMITH DAVID NOWELL<br>
  Abstract: Sounding/Silence charts Heidegger's deep engagement with poetry, situating it within the internal dynamics of his thought and within the domains of poetics and literary criticism. Heidegger viewed poetics and literary criticism with notorious disdain: he claimed that his Erlauterungen ("soundings") of Holderlin's poetry were not "contributions to aesthetics and literary history" but rather stemmed "from a necessity for thought." And yet, the questions he poses--the value of significance of prosody and trope, the concept of "poetic language", the relation between language and body, the "truth" of poetry--reach to the very heart of poetics as a discipline, and indeed situate Heidegger within a wider history of thinking on poetry and poetics. opening up points of contact between Heidegger's discussions of poetry and technical and critical analyses of these poems, Nowell Smith addresses a lacuna within Heidegger scholarship and sets off from Heidegger's thought to sketch a philosophical "poetics of limit".<br>

  Book Title: Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): MACKENDRICK KARMEN<br>
  Abstract: Theology usually appears to us to be dogmatic, judgmental, condescending, maybe therapeutic, or perhaps downright fantastical-but seldom enticing. Divine Enticement takes as its starting point that the meanings of theological concepts are not so much logical, truth-valued propositions-affirmative or negative-as they are provocations and evocations. Thus it argues for the seductiveness of both theology and its subject-for, in fact, infinite seduction and enticement as the very sense of theological query. The divine name is one by which we are drawn toward the limits of thought, language, and flesh. The use of language in such conceptualization calls more than it designates. This is not a flaw or a result of vagueness or imprecision in theological language but rather marks the correspondence of such language to its subject: that which, outside of or at the limit of our thought, draws us as an enticement to desire, not least to intellectual desire. Central to the text is the strange semiotics of divine naming, as a call on that for which there cannot be a standard referent. The entanglement of sign and body, not least in interpretations of the Christian incarnation, both grounds and complicates the theological abstractions. A number of traditional notions in Christian theology are reconceived here as enticements, modes of drawing the desires of both body and mind: faith as "thinking with assent"; sacraments as "visible words" read in community; ethics as responsiveness to beauty; prayer as the language of address; scripture as the story of meaning-making. All of these culminate in a sense of a call to and from the purely possible, the open space into which we can be enticed, within which we can be divinely enticing.<br>

  Abstract: “Philosophy and Civilization” is one of Dewey’s most important—and most neglected—essays. It is unsettling to anyone who wants to think of Dewey primarily as a “pragmatist,” since Dewey says the aim of philosophy should be to deal with the meaning of culture and not “inquiry” or “truth.” He says, “Meaning is wider in scope as well as more precious in value than is truthm and philosophy is occupied with meaning rather than with truth” (LW, 3:4).

  Abstract: The question whether the Greek epic tradition is a matter of truth or of fiction remains a central issue in Homeric scholarship, and any answer to it betrays one’s stance with regard to a host of other issues, such as text, tradition, and authorship. Opinions are divided as to whether the Homeric rendition of the heroic past is wholly traditional and so “objective,” or allows of fictional, “original” admixture by an individual poet. What is less often asked is whether the notion of truth itself, in the sense of an acknowledged correspondence between a statement and a state of affairs<br>

  Abstract: Human narrators come in many forms. Some are completely reliable: most epic narrators speak with detachment, and thus with authority. They elicit trust. But human narrators may also be revealed as immoral by giving tongue to lies, by speaking themselves buffoons, unreliable, or dubious. Then their stories will
                  ring false, for while we may notknowthat the story is a lie, something about its presentation betrays its teller.

  Book Title: Intention Interpretation-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): ISEMINGER GARY<br>
  Abstract: "...an excellent and comprehensive discussion of a debate that was initiated in this century in William Wimsatt's and Monroe C. Beardsley's influential article 'The Intentional Fallacy.'...this is a splendidly conceived and very useful collection of essays. Readers will want to take issue with the arguments of individual authors, but this is to be expected in a volume at the cutting edge of a fertile philosophical controversy." --David Novitz, The Philosophical Quarterly "What is the connection, if any, between the author's intentions in (while) writing a work of literature and the truth (acceptability, validity) of interpretive statements about it?" With this question, Gary Isminger introduces a literary debate that has been waged for the past four decades and is addressed by philosophers and literary theorists in Intention and Interpretation. Thirteen essays discuss the role of appeals to the author's intention in interpreting works of literature. A well-known argument by E.D. Hirsch serves as the basic text, in which he defends the appeal to the author's intention against Wimsatt and Beardsley's claim that such an appeal involved "the intentional fallacy." The essays, mostly commissioned by the editor, explore the presuppositions and consequences of arguing for the importance of the author's intentions in the way Hirsch does. Connections emerge between this issue and many fundamental issues in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind as well as in aesthetics. The (old) "New Criticism" and current Post-Structuralism tend to agree in disenfranchising the author, and many people now are disinclined even to consider the alternative. Hirsch demurs, and arguments like his deserve the careful attention, both from critics and sympathizers, that they receive here. Literary scholars and philosophers who are sympathetic to Continental as well as to Anglo-American styles of philosophy are among the contributors.

  Book Title: Foundational Theology-A New Approach to Catholic Fundamental Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Jacobs-Vandegeer Christiaan<br>
  Abstract: Fundamental theology is traditionally viewed as the starting point for the various disciplines within Catholic theology; it is the place where solid foundations are established for the further research and engagement with the vast terrain of historical, systematic, philosophical, and sacramental/liturgical theology. In Foundational Theology, a landmark new study, Neil Ormerod and Christiaan Jacobs-Vandegeer seek to ground foundational theology in the normative drive toward meaning, truth, goodness, and beauty, appropriated by the theologian through religious, moral, intellectual, and psychic conversions. In doing so, the work maps out the implications of those fundamental orientations to the specific questions and topics of the Catholic theological tradition: God, Trinity, revelation, and an array of doctrinal points of investigation. The authors in this work provide a comprehensive approach to theological foundations for theologians while employing a new, groundbreaking approach to the discipline through the application of the insights of Bernard Lonergan, one of the foremost Catholic theologians of the modern era.<br>

  Author(s): Wake Paul<br>
  Abstract: Variously described as ‘the average pilgrim’, a ‘wanderer’, and ‘a Buddha preaching in European clothes’, Charlie Marlow is the voice behind Joseph Conrad’s ‘Youth’ (1898), Heart of Darkness (1899), Lord Jim (1900) and Chance (1912). Conrad’s Marlow offers a comprehensive account and critical analysis of one of Conrad’s most celebrated creations, asking both who and what is Marlow: a character or a narrator, a biographer or an autobiographical screen, a messenger or an interpreter, a bearer of truth or a misguided liar? Reading Conrad’s fiction alongside the work of Walter Benjamin, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida and Martin Heidegger, and offering an investigation into the connection between narrative and death, this book argues that Marlow’s essence is located in his liminality – in his constantly shifting position – and that the emergence of meaning in his stories is at all points bound up with the process of his storytelling.<br>

  Book Title: Restoring the Right Relationship-  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Brien Mark A<br>
  Abstract: A leading biblical scholar, Hans Heinrich Schmid, believes that righteousness, or the right order of the world, is 'the fundamental problem of our human existence'. It is a key theme in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament's theology of creation and salvation, along with associated themes such as justice, steadfast love/loyalty, truth/ fidelity, compassion/mercy, sin and disorder/chaos. A number of studies of righteousness have been undertaken but most have tended to focus on Israel's call to be righteous, as voiced in particular in the Prophetic Books and the Psalter. In contrast, this book focuses on divine righteousness as the basis for all other notions of righteousness, as this is outlined in the foundational teaching or revelation of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament— namely, the Torah or Pentateuch. It then undertakes a study of how righteousness in the Prophetic Books, the Psalter and the Book of Job relates to this foundational teaching.<br>

It speaks of the revelatory character of the Scriptures, and of the Tradition as being living and dynamic as it opens the Church to the revelation of God. However, within the broader Christian Church, the relationship between Scripture and Tradition has been a source of contention and, despite the strides that<br>

  Book Title: Child Sexual Abuse, Society, and the Future of the Church-  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Regan Hilary D<br>
  Abstract: In November 2012 the Australian federal government announced the establishment of a ‘Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse’. This Royal Commission was set up after many years of reports of sexual abuse in Australia within religious institutions of various Christian churches, some state government inquiries and in the context of inquiries in other countries, most notably Ireland. The Royal Commission began its first hearing in April 2013. It has been forecast that the Commission will be hearing submissions for a number of years from witnesses, both from those who ask to speak to the Royal Commissioners and from those who will be asked to appear before the Commission. At the same time as the establishment of the Royal Commission, the Catholic Church in Australia established a Truth, Justice and healing Council to oversee the Catholic Church’s engagement with the Royal Commission. This collection brings together essays from biblical scholars, a church historian, theologians, ministers of religion from a number of churches, lawyers and a psychologist. They each address the issues of sexual abuse, society and the church in the context of the Australian inquiries. The volume ends with an overview of the processes engaged with by the Catholic Church and the State in the Republic of Ireland and reactions to these inquiries. The volume of essays considers sexual abuse from the perspective of the victims. What is to be done about the mess we are in over clerical sexual abuse? That question is puzzling concerned people today. This diverse collection offers them profitable reading, wherever they are coming from. It has enough useful suggestions and ideas to stimulate the calm, intelligent discussion now demanded by our communities.’ Edmund Campion, Australian Catholic University.<br>

  Abstract: It is clear that, for whoever lives within the Judeo-Christian tradition, the first responsibility that issues from the commandment “You shall not kill” consists of deciding to remain within the covenant-pact and thence too of advocating that all men follow the dictates of rational, universal moral law. This responsibility is never obvious; it ever renews itself, and indeed its perennial renewal is an inexhaustible source of wonder and joy. The covenant-pact and the rational recognition of the splendor of the truth of fundamental moral experience, which shines in every man, is not a thing of the past. It is the<br>

  Abstract: Jean Godefroy Bidima's La Palabre examines the traditional African institution of palaver as a way to create dialogue and open exchange in an effort to resolve conflict and promote democracy. In the wake of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commissions and the gacaca courts in Rwanda, Bidima offers a compelling model of how to develop an African public space where dialogue can combat misunderstanding. This volume, which includes other essays on legal processes, cultural diversity, memory, and the internet in Africa, offers English-speaking readers the opportunity to become acquainted with a highly original and important postcolonial thinker.<br>

  Abstract: Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900-2002), one of the towering figures of contemporary Continental philosophy, is best known for Truth and Method, where he elaborated the concept of "philosophical hermeneutics," a programmatic way to get to what we do when we engage in interpretation. Donatella Di Cesare highlights the central place of Greek philosophy, particularly Plato, in Gadamer's work, brings out differences between his thought and that of Heidegger, and connects him with discussions and debates in pragmatism. This is a sensitive and thoroughly readable philosophical portrait of one of the 20th century's most powerful thinkers.<br>

  Abstract: This book explores how South Africa is negotiating its past in and through various modes of performance in contemporary theatre, public events and memorial spaces. It analyses the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a live event, as an archive, and in various theatrical engagements with it, asking throughout how the TRC has affected the definition of identity and memory in contemporary South Africa, including disavowed memories. Hutchison then considers how the SA-Mali Timbuktu Manuscript Project and the 2010 South African World Cup opening ceremony attempted to restage the nation in their own ways. She investigates how the Voortrekker Monument and Freedom Park embody issues related to memory in contemporary South Africa. She also analyses current renegotiations of popular repertoires, particularly songs and dances related to the Struggle, revivals of classic European and South African protest plays, new history plays and specific racial and ethnic histories and identities.<br>

  Abstract: Bakiner demonstrates how truth commissions have recovered basic facts about human rights violations, forced societies to rethink the violence and exclusion of nation building, and produced a new dynamic whereby the state seeks to legitimize its central position between history and politics by accepting a high degree of societal penetration into the production and diffusion of official national history. By doing so, truth commissions have challenged and transformed public discourses on memory, truth, justice, reconciliation, recognition, nationalism, and political legitimacy in the contemporary world.<br>

They have outlived the transitional justice paradigm, as consolidated democracies and nontransitioning regimes began to opt for truth commissions, too.

  Abstract: At the heart of modernity lies a diremption between the rational and the historical, the universal and the particular. Reason confidently calls into doubt the historical enterprise, and so the possibility of a historical ground for truth. The unavailability of the historical, near or far, to the rational subject calls into radical doubt narrative forms that give shape to human life. So it is that G. E. Lessing can axiomatically declare that, “

  Book Title: Theology in the Flesh-How Embodiment and Culture Shape the Way We Think about Truth, Morality, and God<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Sanders John<br>
  Abstract: Metaphors and other mental tools are used to reason (not just speak) about God, salvation, truth, and morality. Figurative language structures our theological and moral reasoning in powerful ways. This book uses an approach known as cognitive linguistics to explore the incredibly rich ways our conceptual tools, derived from embodied life and culture, shape the way we understand Christian teachings and practices. The cognitive revolution has generated amazing insights into how human minds make sense of the world. This book applies these insights to the ways Christians think about topics such as God, justice, sin, and salvation. It shows that Christians often share a set of very general ideas but disagree on what the Bible means or the moral stances we should take. It explains why Christians often develop a number of appropriate but sometimes incompatible ways to understand the Bible and various doctrines. It assists Christians in understanding those with whom they disagree. Hopefully, simply better understanding how and why people think the way they do will foster better dialogue and greater humility.<br>

The particular kind of body humans have helps produce ways of thinking about the world that are specific to the human species.

We use these mental structures to reason about and understand all of our experiences, including religious ones.

  Book Title: Moments of Silence-Authenticity in the Cultural Expressions of the Iran-Iraq War, 1980-1988<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatanabadi Shouleh<br>
  Abstract: The Iran-Iraq War was the longest conventional war of the 20th century. The memory of it may have faded in the wake of more recent wars in the region, but the harrowing facts remain: over one million soldiers and civilians dead, millions more permanently displaced and disabled, and an entire generation marked by prosthetic implants and teenage martyrdom. These same facts have been instrumentalized by agendas both foreign and domestic, but also aestheticized, defamiliarized, readdressed and reconciled by artists, writers, and filmmakers across an array of identities: linguistic (Arabic, Persian, Kurdish), religious (Shiite, Sunni, atheist), and political (Iranian, Iraqi, internationalist). Official discourses have unsurprisingly tried to dominate the process of production and distribution of war narratives. In doing so, they have ignored and silenced other voices.Centering on novels, films, memoirs, and poster art that gave aesthetic expression to the Iran-Iraq War, the essays gathered in this volume present multiple perspectives on the war's most complex and underrepresented narratives. These scholars do not naively claim to represent an authenticity lacking in official discourses of the war, but rather, they call into question the notion of authenticity itself. Finding, deciding upon, and creating a language that can convey any sort of truth at all-collective, national, or private-is the major preoccupation of the texts and critiques in this diverse collection.<br>

Instead, it proposes that discovering the factual truth about historical events is extremely problematic because knowledge production is relative to the values and agenda of the inquirer. The question of the validity of historical knowledge has informed the general topic “Making Sense of History,” the theme of the book series of which the present volume is a part. The postmodern critique of the modernist epistemology of the humanities and social sciences has produced considerable consternation and disturbance in most of these disciplines.<br>

  Author(s) Feldman Allen<br>
  Abstract: At no other time more than in the present day has individual, social and institutional memory come under such concerted pressure, critique and exposure as a fragile foundation for truth and facticity. This current reluctance to authenticate social memory is intimately tied to well-known postmodernist depredations, which profoundly disenchanted the authority of tradition and authenticity, and emptied core institutionalised myths of their temporal and semantic continuity. As institutionalised memory fails to provide overarching master narratives that can win cultural consent, it has also become increasingly disjunctive with previously unnarratable history and experience.

  Abstract: Transformative work against segregation and racial oppression must directly confront racism and the social construction of race. Whiteness and blackness are not merely mirror images of each other. “White” does not only mean “opposite of Other” but also stands for the dominant, transparent norm that defines what attributes of race should be counted, how to count them, and who (as in white employers or mortgage bankers) gets to do the counting. Therefore, destabilizing “Other” -ness doesn’t entirely destabilize the dominance of whiteness. Even though race has no natural reality or truth, it has great social force. More work is required,<br>

                     Key Writings.¹ In the Christian tradition, God too often is perceived as a fixed entity that is absolutely transcendent. Instead, we need a God who would be an inspiration to develop ourselves fully and to live fully our relation to the other, to others, and to the world around us. Even though Irigaray is critical of the Western religious tradition,² in her recent work she more and more understands religion as an indispensable and valuable dimension of human life.<br>

  Book Title: Re-treating Religion: Deconstructing Christianity with Jean-Luc Nancy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nancy Jean-Luc<br>
  Abstract: One of the most complicated and ambiguous tendencies in contemporary western societies is the phenomenon referred to as the turn to religion.In philosophy, one of the most original thinkers critically questioning this turnis Jean-Luc Nancy. Re-treating Religion is the first volume to analyze his long-term project The Deconstruction of Christianity,especially his major statement of it in Dis-Enclosure.Nancy conceives monotheistic religion and secularization not as opposite worldviews that succeed each other in time but rather as springing from the same history. This history consists in a paradoxical tendency to contest one's own foundations-whether God, truth, origin, humanity, or rationality-as well as to found itself on the void of this contestation. Nancy calls this unique combination of self-contestation and self-foundation the self-deconstructionof the Western world.The book includes discussion with Nancy himself, who contributes a substantial Preambleand a concluding dialogue with the volume editors. The contributions follow Nancy in tracing the complexities of Western culture back to the persistent legacy of monotheism, in order to illuminate the tensions and uncertainties we face in the twenty-first century.<br>

  Book Title: Returning to Reality-Christian Platonism for our Times<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Tyson Paul<br>
  Abstract: Could it be that we have lost touch with some basic human realities in our day of high-tech efficiency, frenetic competition, and ceaseless consumption? Have we turned from the moral, the spiritual, and even the physical realities that make our lives meaningful? These are metaphysical questions -questions about the nature of reality- but they are not abstract questions. These are very down to earth questions that concern power and the collective frameworks of belief and action governing our daily lives. This book is an introduction to the history, theory, and application of Christian metaphysics. Yet this book is not just an introduction, it is also a passionately argued call for a profound change in the contemporary Christian mind. Paul Tyson argues that as Western culture’s Christian Platonist understanding of reality was replaced by modern pragmatic realism, we turned not just from one outlook on reality to another, but away from reality itself. This book seeks to show that if we can recover this ancient Christian outlook on reality, reframed for our day, then we will be able to recover a way of life that is in harmony with human and divine truth.<br>

  Book Title: Grasping Truth and Reality-Lesslie Newbigin's Theology of Mission to the Western World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Le Roy Stults Donald<br>
  Abstract: When Lesslie Newbigin returned to Britain in 1974 after years of missionary service, he observed that his homeland was as much a mission field as India, where he had spent the majority of his missionary career. He concluded that the Western world needed a missionary confrontation. Instead of the traditional approach to missions, however, Newbigin realized that the Western world needed to be confronted theologically. From his earliest days at Cambridge University, Newbigin developed the theological convictions that shaped his understanding of the Christian faith, and he used these theological convictions as criteria to evaluate the belief system of Western culture and to provide an answer to its dilemma. The Enlightenment reintroduced humanism and dualism into Western culture, which resulted on the loss of purpose and the rise of skepticism. This book discusses Newbigin's theological convictions and how they factored into both his critique of and his solution to Western culture's spiritual and worldview problems. Donald Le Roy cleverly explains Newbigin's solution to reintroduce the Christian belief system into Western culture in order to restore purpose and truth to Westerners and put them back in contact with true reality through Jesus Christ.<br>

  Abstract: The present study seeks to respond theologically to current discussions about ideas of self from the perspective of God’s action in and towards the world. Its aim is to trace a view of rationality that follows the drama of God’s engagement with the world, thus involving dying and resurrection, ascesis and abundance, suffering witness and Eucharistic communion. Since, as Calvin notes, knowledge of God and knowledge of self are intimately bound together, this exercise of discerning the shape of a theological rationality in the present arena of competing promises of meaning and truth is carried out on two levels: the theological and the anthropological.<br>

It is indeed “more than clothes.” However, this book resists the temptation to merely propose a carnivalesque or reductionist postmodern account of the human person in which goodness and truth are tied to the pleasures of the body. Rather, the approaches of two notable twentieth-century thinkers are teased<br>

  Abstract: Historical and social realities provide textual meaning with its temporal and cultural limits and possibilities. We experience our world because we are part of a world. For our faith to have meaning it must be meaningful in a particular historical, cultural, and social context. The question of whether and how the meaning of the beliefs and practices of Christian faith can be translated into those that share the same truth in other cultures becomes acute. For the claims of Christian conviction to be true they must be commensurable. All this leads to an assertion: once the faith has been shared,<br>

Without a coherent moral ontology there is no coherent understanding of moral realism; we cannot have a coherent view of the good because we cannot account for the moral structure<br>

  Abstract: The majority of Christian soteriologies written in context of religious diversity have focused on the possibility of salvation for those who are not Christian. Traditionally, these theologies of religious diversity have been divided into three major paradigms: exclusivism, inclusivism, and pluralism.
                  Exclusivismmaintains that salvation is given only through Christ to those that explicitly embrace faith, the Church, and/or Christianity. The assertion that there is no salvation apart from the church serves as a classical articulation of this position.

Building on the letter as the intrinsic symbol of the spirit, it understands divine revelation as a system of continuous symbols that join together Christ, his words and works, the apostolic tradition of the church, and the written scriptures and their interpretation. Whenever a synthesis is grounded in symbolism, its aesthetic dimension cannot help but be invoked. Heidegger reminds us, for instance, that symbolism constitutes the essence of art.¹ In the creative fashioning of an artifact, truth itself is preserved as beauty.

  Book Title: Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging meditation on the nature and purpose of hermeneutics, Gerald L. Bruns argues that hermeneutics is not merely a contemporary theory but an extended family of questions about understanding and interpretation that have multiple and conflicting histories going back to before the beginning of writing.What does it mean to understand a riddle, an action, a concept, a law, an alien culture, or oneself? Bruns expands our sense of the horizons of hermeneutics by situating its basic questions against a background of different cultural traditions and philosophical topics. He discusses, for example, the interpretation of oracles, the silencing of the muses and the writing of history, the quarrel between philosophy and poetry, the canonization of sacred texts, the nature of allegorical exegesis, rabbinical midrash, the mystical exegesis of the Qur'an, the rise of literalism and the individual interpreter, and the nature of Romantic hermeneutics. Dealing with thinkers ranging from Socrates to Luther to Wordsworth to Ricoeur, Bruns also ponders several basic dilemmas about the nature of hermeneutical experience, the meaning of tradition, the hermeneutical function of narrative, and the conflict between truth and freedom in philosophy and literature. His eloquent book demonstrates the continuing power of hermeneutical thinking to open up questions about the world and our place in it.<br>

The complement to enigma in the work of art is its truth content. Key to engaging the work of art’s enigma and truth content is the mimetic relation between experience and the work of art.

  Book Title: Supper at Emmaus-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): OLSEN GLENN W.<br>
  Abstract: Supper at Emmaus traces various important intellectual topics from the ancient world to the modern period. Generally, as in its treatment of the question of whether the long-standing contrast between cyclical and linear views of history is helpful, it introduces important thinkers who have considered the question. A preoccupation of the book is the appearance and reappearance across the centuries of patterns used to organize temporal and cultural experience. After an opening essay on transcendental truth and cultural relativism, the second chapter traces a distinction, common in historical writings during the past two centuries, between an alleged ancient classical "cyclic" view of time and history, used to describe the claimed repetitiveness of and similarities between historical events ("nothing is new under the sun"), and a contrasting Jewish-Christian linear view, sometimes described as providential in that it moves through a series of unique events to some end intended by God. In the latter, history is "about something," the education of the human race or the redemption of humankind. As in each of the remaining essays, the book then attempts to draw out the limitations of what the current consensus on this topic has become. It does this for such things as our current understanding of religious toleration, humanism, natural law, and teleology. Some of the essays, such as those on debate about Augustine's understanding of marriage or the concluding illustrated essay on the baroque city of Lecce, are published for the first time. Others are based on previously published contributions to the scholarly literature, though generally each of these chapters concludes with a postscript that engages with current scholarly debate on the subject.<br>

Yet, more important, he also moves beyond the battle between metaphysics and deconstructive skepticism. The real story ofWriting and DifferenceandOf Grammatology, especially the former, is Derrida’s desire for a new, even revolutionary, truth. This truth cannot be found through the mere act of debunking metaphysical assertions. Derrida seeks something more, an empirically present reality: the encounter with the face<br>

  Abstract: Artistically the Enlightenment may not compare favorably with the Renaissance or Baroque periods, but the aesthetic criticism of the eighteenth century surpassed that of the two earlier periods and provided most of the categories used in the two centuries that followed. One of its major achievements was to raise the idea of beauty to the level of truth. It accomplished this in three stages: at the beginning the imitation theory prevailed, next the expressive theory, and at the end the symbolic theory made a tentative entrance. Each of these movements made a definitive contribution to the modern conception of art<br>

Admittedly, artists and intellectuals occasionally celebrate uncertainty as if it were a liberating cause, but in the end uncertainty holds no thrill for me.

This means to be without artifice, unpretentious, aware of the unconscious and so awake to the illusory nature of the world—and so able to speak truth to power. The foundation for this is a dependence on God framed within the concept of mercy exemplified in God’s relationship with his creation<br>

  Book Title: The Vision of the Soul-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson James Matthew<br>
  Abstract: Ours is an age full of desires but impoverished in its understanding of where those desires lead-an age that claims mastery over the world but also claims to find the world as a whole absurd or unintelligible. In
      The Vision of the Soul, James Matthew Wilson seeks to conserve the great insights of the western tradition by giving us a new account of them responsive to modern discontents. The western- or Christian Platonist-tradition, he argues, tells us that man is an intellectual animal, born to pursue the good, to know the true, and to contemplate all things in beauty. Wilson begins by reconceiving the intellectual conservatism born of Edmund Burke's jeremiad against the French Revolution as an eff­ort to preserve the West's vision of man and the cosmos as ordered by and to beauty. After defining the achievement of that vision and its tradition, Wilson off­ers an extended study of the nature of beauty and the role of the fine arts in shaping a culture but above all in opening the human intellect to the perception of the form of reality. Through close studies of Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Maritain, he recovers the classical vision of beauty as a revelation of truth and being. Finally, he revisits the ancient distinction between reason and story-telling, between mythos and logos, in order to rejoin the two.Story-telling is foundational to the forms of the fine arts, but it is no less foundational to human reason. Human life in turn constitutes a specific kind of form-a story form. The ancient conception of human life as a pilgrimage to beauty itself is one that we can fully embrace only if we see the essential correlation between reason and story and the essential convertibility of truth, goodness and beauty in beauty. By turns a study in fundamental ontology, aesthetics, and political philosophy, Wilson's book invites its readers to a renewal of the West's intellectual tradition.<br>

As we have seen in discussing both Burke and Dante, venerable claims have been made in our tradition for the power of the poetic and literary imagination; but Burke’s counter-revolutionary importance should also remind us that many of those claims have been compensatory for losses experienced elsewhere.

  Abstract: Critics of the U.S. War on Terror have long called for an alternative optic to the relentlessly myopic perspective of American news media. The presumption behind this call to look elsewhere is that doing so will reveal images that are authentic or compelling enough to disabuse American spectators of their ambivalence about the casualties of militarized violence. This logic imagines the grisly “truth” of war to happen somewhere beyond or outside the frame of mainstream representations of combat.

  Abstract: The real question for homiletics in our increasingly postmodern, post-Christian contexts is not how are we going to prevent preaching from dying, but how are we going to help it die a good death. Preaching was not made to live. At most, preaching is a witness, a sign, a crimson X marking a demolition site. The church has developed sophisticated technologies in modernity to give preaching the semblance of life, belying the truth: preaching was born under a death sentence. It was born to die. Only when preaching embraces its own death is it able to truly live.<br>

  Author(s): Loddo Olimpia G.<br>
  Abstract: Siamo ormai lontani dalla stagione in cui la forza propulsiva della “svolta linguistica" si impose come tendenza dominante nel dibattito filosofico. Da varie angolazioni si è potuto parlare negli ultimi anni di pictorial turn come antidoto all’egemonia del paradigma linguistico in filosofia. Il volume Verità, Immagine, Normatività. Truth, Image, and Normativity non si inserisce direttamente in questa nuova tendenza, ma ruota comunque intorno a questioni che derivano dal medesimo sfondo. I 24 saggi qui raccolti tengono conto dei diversi ruoli che le immagini possono svolgere, a seconda che si focalizzi la loro dimensione descrittiva o normativa, e indagano alcuni aspetti del rapporto tra immagine e linguaggio. Questi problemi di filosofia dell’immagine, intesa sia come immagine cognitiva sia come immagine grafica, costituiscono il fil rouge di questo volume. Una tale riflessione sui linguaggi figurati e sulla comunicazione visiva non-linguistica costringe a riformulare in termini nuovi le grandi domande concernenti le tradizionali nozioni di verità, oggettività, normatività, consenso e persuasione.<br>

  Abstract: At first glance, our era appears to have discovered its truth. Liberated from its inhibitions, it can now bare itself, naked. It can let its masks fall and shed its costumes. The era of repression (supposing there ever really was one) has given way to an era of disinhibition—but at what price, for whom, and how long will it last? Indeed, in the salty marshes of this nascent century, there is nothing left to hide. All taboos have been lifted; all interdictions banished. Every thing is today transparent, and thus also fully accomplished. The water tank is almost full<br>

  Abstract: Hannah Arendt remarked that one of the paradoxes inherent in totalitarian states is that, on the one hand, their professed veneration of transformations induces in them a deep-seated fear of stability and permanence, but on the other hand, for these regimes to function, their institutions require a certain degree of predictability and continuity.¹ The Soviet experience, reproduced in different versions multiple times beyond the borders of the country, is a testimony to the truth of this statement. At the same time, it also points to yet another aporia at the heart of the great political and cultural experiment. As the<br>

  Abstract: Hegel’s discussion of the genius of the “feeling soul” (
                     Die fühlende Seele) is found in his Anthropology (under “Mind Subjective” in Hegel’s Encyclopedia Philosophy of Mind).¹ The feeling soul is a singular inwardness of feeling. It embraces the corporeal in itself as its substance. It does not experience the multiple parts of the external body as divisions of the soul. Rather (like Aristotle’s sensus communis), it gathers them up into one experience. “[T]he ‘real’ outness of parts in the body has no truth for the sentient soul.”² The feeling soul in the body is “one simple, omnipresent unity.”³<br>

  Abstract: The process most often invoked in describing the hallmark of the Axial Age—or, to circumvent tricky problems of timing and synchronicity, of the Axial cultures—is the “discovery of transcendence.” “Transcendence,” however, covers a wide range of meanings. When applied to the distinction between our cognitive grasp of the world and its internal structure, for example, it denotes an epistemological conviction that is entirely neutral with regard to religious truth claims.

  Book Title: Truth Matters-Knowledge, Politics, Ethics, Religion<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Shuker Ronnie<br>
  Abstract: Why should we seek and tell the truth? Does anyone know what truth is? Many are skeptical about the relevance of truth. Truth Matters endeavours to show why truth is important in a world where the very idea of truth is contested. Putting philosophers in conversation with educators, literary scholars, physicists, political theorists, and theologians, Truth Matters ranges across both analytic and continental philosophy and draws on the ideas of thinkers such as Aquinas, Balthasar, Brandom, Davidson, Dooyeweerd, Gadamer, Habermas, Kierkegaard, Plantinga, Ricoeur, and Wolterstorff. Some essays attempt to provide a systematic account of truth, while others wrestle with the question of how truth is told and what it means to live truthfully. Contributors address debates between realists and anti-realists, explore issues surrounding relativism and constructivism in education and the social sciences, examine the politics of truth telling and the ethics of authenticity, and consider various religious perspectives on truth. Most scholars agree that truth is propositional, being expressed in statements that are subject to proof or disproof. This book goes a step farther: yes, propositional truth is important, but truth is more than propositional. To recognize how it is more than propositional is crucial for understanding why truth truly matters.

  Abstract: It is well known that late medieval literary theory owes much to Aquinas’s reconciliation of human rhetoric with the divine revelation of truth in the text of Scripture. Aquinas and those theorists who followed his method accomplished this rapprochement by redrawing the boundaries between the literal and the spiritual senses of Scripture and assimilating rhetorical language to the literal sense. Aquinas’s critical move has been much studied for its impact on the exegetical theory and practice of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, especially for its new emphasis on the contributions of human authors to Scriptural discourse.

According to a few who claim to have befriended Truth, what makes its capture so difficult is that Truth can assume any number of aliases and disguises, all of which provide it with an uncanny ability to elude those seeking its whereabouts.

  Book Title: Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): WEINSHEIMER JOEL<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging historical introduction to philosophical hermeneutics, Jean Grondin discusses the major figures from Philo to Habermas, analyzes conflicts between various interpretive schools, and provides a persuasive critique of Gadamer's view of hermeneutic history, though in other ways Gadamer's
      Truth and Methodserves as a model for Grondin's approach.Grondin begins with brief overviews of the pre-nineteenth-century thinkers Philo, Origen, Augustine, Luther, Flacius, Dannhauer, Chladenius, Meier, Rambach, Ast, and Schlegel. Next he provides more extensive treatments of such major nineteenth-century figures as Schleiermacher, Böckh, Droysen, and Dilthey. There are full chapters devoted to Heidegger and Gadamer as well as shorter discussions of Betti, Habermas, and Derrida. Because he is the first to pay close attention to pre-Romantic figures, Grondin is able to show that the history of hermeneutics cannot be viewed as a gradual, steady progression in the direction of complete universalization. His book makes it clear that even in the early period, hermeneutic thinkers acknowledged a universal aspect in interpretation-that long before Schleiermacher, hermeneutics was philosophical and not merely practical. In revising and correcting the standard account, Grondin's book is not merely introductory but revisionary, suitable for beginners as well as advanced students in the field.<br>

Often Gadamer has himself been viewed as the spokesman for historical relativism, since he had written that we do not understand better, but only differently.

  Abstract: This book explores the historical insights of Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837), Russia's most celebrated poet and arguably its greatest thinker. Svetlana Evdokimova examines for the first time the full range of Pushkin's fictional and nonfictional writings on the subject of history-writings that have strongly influenced Russians' views of themselves and their past. Through new readings of his drama,
      Boris Godunov; such narrative poems asPoltava, The Bronze Horseman,andCount Nulin; prose fiction, includingThe Captain's DaughterandBlackamoor of Peter the Great; lyrical poems; and a variety of nonfictional texts, the author presents Pushkin not only as a progenitor of Russian national mythology but also as an original historical and political thinker.Evdokimova considers Pushkin within the context of Romantic historiography and addresses the tension between Pushkin the historian and Pushkin the fiction writer . She also discusses Pushkin's ideas on the complex relations between chance and necessity in historical processes, on the particular significance of great individuals in Russian history, and on historical truth.<br>

  Book Title: Interpreting Interpretation-The Limits of Hermeneutic Psychoanalysis<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Saks Elyn R.<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalytic interpretation, according to the hermeneutic view, is concerned with meaning rather than facts or causes. In this provocative book, Elyn R. Saks focuses closely on what hermeneutic psychoanalysis is and how the approaches of hermeneutic psychoanalysts differ. She finds that although these psychoanalysts use the same words, concepts, images, and analogies, they hold to at least five different positions on the truth of psychoanalytic interpretations. Saks locates within these five models the thought of such prominent analysts as Roy Schafer, Donald Spence, and George Klein. Then, approaching each model from the patient's point of view, the author reaches important conclusions about treatments that patients not only will-but should-reject.If patients understood the true nature of the various models of hermeneutic psychoanalysis, Saks argues, they would spurn the story model, which asks patients to believe interpretations that do not purport to be true; that is, the psychoanalyst simply tells stories that give meaning to patients' lives, the truth of which is not considered relevant. And patients would question the metaphor and the interpretations-as-literary-criticism models, which propose views of psychoanalysis that may be unsatisfying. In addition to discussing which hermeneutic models of treatment are plausible, Saks discusses the nature of metaphorical truth. She arrives at some penetrating insights into the theory of psychoanalysis itself.<br>

Current concerns in theology, however, focus on rhetoric in a different fashion. Attention to “what is communicated, how it is communicated, what happens when it is communicated, how to communicate it better,” how to understand the variables that create audiences, and how to assess the truth of communication have become crucial issues in the human<br>

  Author(s) Bahloul Joëlle<br>
  Abstract: Texts by Islam’s greatest mystics dealing with Jews, directly or through allusion, generally dismay—at least at first glance. Contrary to usual perceptions of medieval Sufism as somehow more “tolerant,” Jewish figures in actual Classical Sufi texts appear no less devilishly caricatural as any in medieval Christian literature or art. In fact, prevailing views of Jews in either dominant medieval culture—Christian or Islamic—appear luridly similar, with Jews depicted as spiritually blind creatures who rejected Divine Truth’s light as revealed through Jesus or Muhammad. Scorn and sarcasm characterize allegorical depictions of Jews by medieval Muslim poets and also manuscript<br>

  Abstract: The question of metrical translation—its history, theory, and practice—is not often posed in current translation studies, except perhaps by translators who confront “a choice between rhyme and reason,” as Nabokov asked himself in translating Pushkin: “Can a translation while rendering with absolute fidelity the whole text, and nothing but the text, keep the form of the original, its rhythm and its rhyme?”¹ Like swearing an oath to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth before going on trial, the translator who vows to be true to “the whole text, and nothing but the text” must be<br>

  Book Title: Shattered Voices-Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth Commissions<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Phelps Teresa Godwin<br>
  Abstract: Following periods of mass atrocity and oppression, states are faced with a question of critical importance in the transition to democracy: how to offer redress to victims of the old regime without perpetuating cycles of revenge. Traditionally, balance has been restored through arrests, trials, and punishment, but in the last three decades, more than twenty countries have opted to have a truth commission investigate the crimes of the prior regime and publish a report about the investigation, often incorporating accounts from victims. Although many praise the work of truth commissions for empowering and healing through words rather than violence, some condemn the practice as a poor substitute for traditional justice, achieved through trials and punishment. There has been until now little analysis of the unarticulated claim that underlies the truth commissions' very existence: that language-in this case narrative stories-can substitute for violence. Acknowledging revenge as a real and deep human need,
      Shattered Voicesexplores the benefits and problems inherent when a fragile country seeks to heal its victims without risking its own future. In developing a theory about the role of language in retribution, Teresa Godwin Phelps takes an interdisciplinary approach, delving into sources from Greek tragedy toHamlet, from Kant to contemporary theories about retribution, from the Babylonian law codes to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Report. She argues that, given the historical and psychological evidence about revenge, starting afresh by drawing a bright line between past crimes and a new government is both unrealistic and unwise. When grievous harm happens, a rebalancing is bound to occur, whether it is orderly and lawful or disorderly and unlawful.Shattered Voicescontends that language is requisite to any adequate balancing, and that a solution is viable only if it provides an atmosphere in which storytelling and subsequent dialogue can flourish. In the de~<br>

  Abstract: My ongoing project is to explore the question as to whether there is any reason to think, indeed hope, that the collecting and publishing of victims’ stories—the activities that surround writing a truth report—can bring an end to the cycle of revenge that threatens the stability of an emerging democracy. Is it sensible to suppose that language can carry such a burden? By examining some of the history of revenge and our troubled and ambivalent relationship to it, the early chapters have provided, I hope, a clearer understanding of what a victim such as Paulina might mean when<br>

They owed their strength to political concerns and pragmatic effects, and served as tropes in the lives of staff and residents alike. Paul Rabinow notes that sociologies of scientific practices “have sought (with some success) to lower-case the abstractions of Science, Reason, Truth and Society.”¹ Reflections on a commonplace but perhaps less well understood kind of reasoning—reasoning that takes form in everyday life—might enable us to similarly lower-case reason, intimate its cultural and political features, and<br>

  Book Title: Clan Cleansing in Somalia-The Ruinous Legacy of 1991<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Kapteijns Lidwien<br>
  Abstract: In 1991, certain political and military leaders in Somalia, wishing to gain exclusive control over the state, mobilized their followers to use terror-wounding, raping, and killing-to expel a vast number of Somalis from the capital city of Mogadishu and south-central and southern Somalia. Manipulating clan sentiment, they succeeded in turning ordinary civilians against neighbors, friends, and coworkers. Although this episode of organized communal violence is common knowledge among Somalis, its real nature has not been publicly acknowledged and has been ignored, concealed, or misrepresented in scholarly works and political memoirs-until now. Marshaling a vast amount of source material, including Somali poetry and survivor accounts,
      Clan Cleansing in Somaliaanalyzes this campaign of clan cleansing against the historical background of a violent and divisive military dictatorship, in the contemporary context of regime collapse, and in relationship to the rampant militia warfare that followed in its wake.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaalso reflects on the relationship between history, truth, and postconflict reconstruction in Somalia. Documenting the organization and intent behind the campaign of clan cleansing, Lidwien Kapteijns traces the emergence of the hate narratives and code words that came to serve as rationales and triggers for the violence. However, it was not clans that killed, she insists, but people who killed in the name of clan. Kapteijns argues that the mutual forgiveness for which politicians often so lightly call is not a feasible proposition as long as the violent acts for which Somalis should forgive each other remain suppressed and undiscussed.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaestablishes that public acknowledgment of the ruinous turn to communal violence is indispensable to social and moral repair, and can provide a gateway for the critical memory work required from Somalis on all sides of this multifaceted conflict.<br>

Metaphysical detection calls into question structures taken for granted after Edgar Allan Poe’s “Murders in the Rue Morgue” (1841): the hermeneutic strategies of rendering meaningful those signs which are unintelligible to others, and of divining the mind of an opponent; the epistemological method of discovering truth by questioning sources of knowledge; and the adept detective’s triumph over<br>

Beginning with the early 1980s, anthropology witnessed a flood of studies concerning the life history approach (cf. Bertaux 1981; Crapananzo 1980; Shostak 1981). By 1988, however, the influence of illness in the construction of one’s life history received little attention (Kaufman 1988, 217).

Whilst this defence alludes to a familiar mimetic conception of the relationship between art and life—between the ‘copy’ and its ‘original’—it also enacts a striking defamiliarization of this paradigm by claiming for aesthetic illusion a truth which is lacking from its ostensibly reflected source.

Literary multiplicity is widespread and, according to the Russian narrative theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, it derives from the multiplicity endemic to all language, which describes a world that is “overlain with qualifications, open to dispute, charged with value, already enveloped in an obscuring mist—or, on the contrary, by the ‘light’ of alien<br>

  Abstract: Though this sweeping opinion, expressed in a book on poverty in Britain published in 1930, has not proved correct in the longer run, there was nevertheless more than a grain of truth in it.¹ The reasons for the elevation of poverty to a central concern of state and society lie in social and economic developments that began almost a century before 1918. But they were reinforced and further precipitated by new theoretical and ideological insights, especially in the generation before the First World War.<br>

  Book Title: The Undivine Comedy-Detheologizing Dante<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): BAROLINI TEODOLINDA<br>
  Abstract: Accepting Dante's prophetic truth claims on their own terms, Teodolinda Barolini proposes a "detheologized" reading as a global new approach to the
      Divine Comedy. Not aimed at excising theological concerns from Dante, this approach instead attempts to break out of the hermeneutic guidelines that Dante structured into his poem and that have resulted in theologized readings whose outcomes have been overdetermined by the poet. By detheologizing, the reader can emerge from this poet's hall of mirrors and discover the narrative techniques that enabled Dante to forge a true fiction. Foregrounding the formal exigencies that Dante masked as ideology, Barolini moves from the problems of beginning to those of closure, focusing always on the narrative journey. Her investigation--which treats such topics as the visionary and the poet, the One and the many, narrative and time--reveals some of the transgressive paths trodden by a master of mimesis, some of the ways in which Dante's poetic adventuring is indeed, according to his own lights, Ulyssean.<br>

  Book Title: Russian Experimental Fiction-Resisting Ideology after Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clowes Edith W.<br>
  Abstract: In the three decades following Stalin's death, major underground Russian writers have subverted Soviet ideology by using parody to draw attention to its basis in utopian thought. Referring to utopian writing as diverse as Defoe's
         Robinson Crusoe, Dostoevsky'sNotes from Underground, and Orwell'sAnimal Farm, they have tested notions of truth, reality, and representation. They have gone beyond their precursors by experimenting with the tensions between ludic and didactic art. Edith Clowes explores these "meta-utopian" narratives, which address a wide range of attitudes toward utopia, to expose the challenge that literary play poses to dogmatism and to elucidate the sense of renewal it can bring to social imagination. Using both structural analysis and reception theory, she introduces readers outside Russia to a fascinating body of literature that includes Aleksandr Zinoviev'sThe Yawning Heights, Abram Terts'sLiubimov, Vladimir Voinovich'sMoscow 2042, and Liudmila Petrushevskaia's "The New Robinsons.".<br>

  Author(s): Martin James Alfred<br>
  Abstract: In this broad historical and critical overview based on a lifetime of scholarship, James Alfred Martin, Jr., examines the development of the concepts of beauty and holiness as employed in theories of aesthetics and of religion. The injunction in the Book of Psalms to "worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness" addressed a tradition that has comprehended holiness primarily in terms of ethical righteousness--a conception that has strongly influenced Western understandings of religion. As the author points out, however, the Greek forbears of Western thought, as well as many Eastern traditions, were and are more broadly concerned with the pursuit of beauty, truth, and goodness as ideals of human excellence, that is, with the "holiness of beauty." In this work Martin describes a philosophical stance that should prove to be most productive for the dialogue between aesthetics and religion.<br>

The scene has changed, but the critical orientation represented by these “movements” has not disappeared. Rather it has been sublimated and to an extent transformed in the “ideology critique” that dominates literary studies at this moment. The most enduring effect of deconstruction has been the subversion of all universalist or foundationalist claims to truth. In the Marxist canon, ideology has as one of its principal meanings “false consciousness,” which is a kind of universalizing thought that conceals the particular, self-interested (class) motives that<br>

  Book Title: Scripture, Canon and Commentary-A Comparison of Confucian and Western Exegesis<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): HENDERSON JOHN B.<br>
  Abstract: In this major contribution to the study of the Chinese classics and comparative religion, John Henderson uses the history of exegesis to illuminate mental patterns that have universal and perennial significance for intellectual history. Henderson relates the Confucian commentarial tradition to other primary exegetical traditions, particularly the Homeric tradition, Vedanta, rabbinic Judaism, ancient and medieval Christian biblical exegesis, and Qur'anic exegesis. In making such comparisons, he discusses some basic assumptions common to all these traditions--such as that the classics or scriptures are comprehensive or that they contain all significant knowledge or truth and analyzes the strategies deployed to support these presuppositions. As shown here, primary differences among commentarial or exegetical traditions arose from variations in their emphasis on one or another of these assumptions and strategies. Henderson demonstrates that exegetical modes of thought were far from arcane: they dominated the post-classical/premodern intellectual world. Some have persisted or re-emerged in modern times, particularly in ideologies such as Marxism. Written in an engaging and accessible style, Scripture, Canon, and Commentary is not only a challenging interpretation of comparative scriptural traditions but also an excellent introduction to the study of the Confucian classics.<br>

Are symbols arbitrary and inadequate images from the fallen world that will be superseded in Edenic perception, or are they the very basis of experience and the guarantee of truth? Blake’s answer, ultimately, is that symbols become true by being organized into myth, where they take on conceptual form and are available to imaginative interpretation.

  Abstract: Investigating autobiographical writing of Mary McCarthy, Henry James, Jean-Paul Sartre, Saul Friedlander, and Maxine Hong Kingston, this book argues that autobiographical truth is not a fixed but an evolving content in a process of self-creation. Further, Paul John Eakin contends, the self at the center of all autobiography is necessarily fictive. Professor Eakin shows that the autobiographical impulse is simply a special form of reflexive consciousness: from a developmental viewpoint, the autobiographical act is a mode of self-invention always practiced first in living and only eventually, and occasionally, in writing.<br>

  Abstract: It is impossible to imagine a community that is not divided into at least two gender groups. It is equally impossible to imagine a community that does not tell or enact stories. The relationship between these universal aspects of human culture is the mainspring of Gender and Narrativity. From Genesis to Freud, the Western narrative tradition tells the same old story of masculine dominance/feminine subservience as a matter of divine will or natural truth. Here, nine Canadian scholars challenge and interpret this tradition, in effect "re-telling" the story of gender, and themselves intervening in the narrative process. Critical readings from a wide range of literary texts - medieval and modern, European and Canadian - replace abstract theory in these studies, while sociology, anthropology, psychoanalysis, deconstruction and new history are the axes of discussion. This book exemplifies the current range and diversity of Canadian critical writing.<br>

Gallant’s characters often learn very little of the lessons she urges her readers to learn; we acquire insights about memory, history, truth, and writing by interpreting the ironic narrative stance employed in her fiction.<br>

In truth, however, the notion that the Friends represent a single viewpoint or argumentative strategy is not exactly borne out by a close reading of the text.¹ Rather, the Friends offer a storm of conflicting viewpoints. Here are two of them: First, there is the “Deuteronomistic,”² or “Proverbial” strategy—life is a type of cosmic math equation (framed as a covenant) in which excellent moral choice<br>

While the historical Baroque relies on proliferation of décor and a conscious embrace of artifice, it also reveals an organizing logic that goes beyond that specific age (the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries). This organizing logic is a theatrical one, where the space of representation is severed into a “screen of appearances,” and the truth is presumed to reside behind it.

Nevertheless, we can see many of the diverse movements and figures of the modernist breakthrough as sharing a concern to achieve a decisively unambiguous life, piercing through the superficial compromises of bourgeois society, looking reality in the face, and affirming the truth of iving personality.

  Abstract: The plebiscite of 5 October 1988, in which 55.99 per cent of Chileans said ‘no’ to Pinochet, marked the end of military dictatorship, but did not restore a proper democracy. It opened a new period that political analysts named the ‘transition’, to designate an alliance between politics (re-democratisation) and economics (neoliberalism). During those years, the post-dictatorship presidents – until 2010, all from the Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia¹ – were determined to reconcile Chileans, whom the dictatorship seemed to have irreparably divided.

Such philosophies of science also tend to feature a fundamental emphasis on the historical and cultural situatedness of discourse as significant; relevance of mutual attunement of speaker and hearer; necessity of pre-linguistic cognition based in human engagement with a common socio-cultural historical world; role of narrative and metaphor as explanatory; sustained emphasis on understanding questioning; truth seen as horizonal, aletheic, or perspectival; and a tolerance for paradoxical and complex forms of expression.<br>

  Abstract: One of the recurring tropes within modernist theories of images, and filmic images in particular, is their tendency to play out the tensions between the seeming immediacy of the visual, its epiphany-like and revelatory force that suggests a truth beyond arguing on the one hand, and a focus on the technological conditions of the image on the other. Within modernist theory these two aspects of the image can be arranged in different ways. Some modernist critics, such as André Bazin, have argued that the technological underpinnings of photographic and filmic images ascertain their historical accuracy, or at the very least<br>

  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>

  Abstract: This book explores the radical reconceptions of knowledge and science emerging from constructivist epistemology, social studies of science, and contemporary cognitive science. Smith reviews the key issues involved in the twentieth-century critiques of traditional views of human knowledge and scientific truth and gives an extensively informed explanation of the alternative accounts developed by Fleck, Kuhn, Foucault, Latour, and others. She also addresses the various anxieties (e.g., over ‘relativism’) and ‘wars’ occasioned by these developments, placing them in their historical contexts and arguing that they are largely misplaced or spurious. Smith then examines the currently perplexed relations between the natural and human sciences, the grandiose claims and dubious methods of evolutionary psychology, and the complex play of naturalist, humanist, and posthumanist ideologies in contemporary views of the relation between humans and animals.<br>

At the same time, self-declared defenders of the theater, including many playwrights, have fought back by creating mock philosophers who are exposed as fools and charlatans on the stage, a tradition that begins with Aristophanes’ unflattering portrayal of Socrates in

  Abstract: In the last ten years, the Swiss Federal Archives (SFA) has been involved in three politico-historical events. First, as might be known in the United States, for the past four years Switzerland has found itself at the center of a struggle for justice and truth for the victims of the Holocaust. Second, Switzerland is scrutinizing the history of its relations to the Republic of South Africa after 1945. Third is the discovery of the secret card indices of the Office of the Federal Public Prosecutor (Bundesanwaltschschaft), containing private data about hundreds of thousands of Swiss citizens and foreigners, that caused<br>

  Abstract: The world the novel makes proposes its own causality and contingency. To treat post–World War II Marxist fiction solely as a declension narrative, due to the ultimate disaster of the Communist movement in 1956, is to miss one of U.S. culture’s most significant streams. Customary accounts of the “Long Retreat” of literary radicalism obviously contain some truth, and there are sound reasons why the political parable of the clean sweep of Cold War liberalism in fiction has had its remarkable run.¹ But scores of novelists once affiliated with or newly drawn to the pro-Communist Left would be a forceful<br>

  Abstract: The novel and the theater are two forms of fiction: in both cases, it is a matter of creating an imaginary world, and making characters, whose story constitutes what is called the plot, enter into this world. In order for the impact of the work to surpass that of simple entertainment, the story must also have a signification. Through carefully constructed lies, the book, like the play, strives to communicate a general human truth, but they do not rely on the same devices, and they do not seek the same type of truth.<br>

  Abstract: Identity has become the encompassing term for cultural, social, and spiritual wholeness.

As such, it references many of the most central fictions of our time. Such fictions invite questions, not of their truth value but of their usefulness.

Even the most adamant realist in, say, engineering presupposes a cultural conception of how scientific cognition proceeds.

But this dilemma is simply a reflection of the task that deconstruction sets for itself, namely, that of subjecting itself to what Derrida calls the “classical norms” (

In the technical sense, “communicative action” refers only to those linguistically mediated interactions in which the “use of language oriented to reaching understanding” assumes a “coordinating role” (Truth, 110).

After traveling to Sierra Leone in the aftermath of its devastating civil war, Tom meets a writer who helps him explore the possibilities of renewal.

  Abstract: Drawing on Immanuel Kant's and Hannah Arendt's ideas about reflective judgment, Lara argues that narrative plays a key role in helping societies acknowledge their pasts. Particular stories haunt our consciousness and lead to a kind of examination and dialogue that shape notions of morality. A powerful description of a crime can act as a filter, helping us to draw conclusions about what constitutes a moral wrong, and public debates over these narratives allow us to construct a more accurate picture of historical truth, leading to a better understanding of why such actions are possible.<br>

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Obeyesekere Gananath<br>
  Abstract: Throughout his career, Obeyesekere has combined psychoanalysis and anthropology to illuminate the relationship between personal symbolism and religious experience. In this book, he begins with Buddha's visionary trances wherein, over the course of four hours, he witnesses hundreds of thousands of his past births and eons of world evolution, renewal, and disappearance. He then connects this fracturing of empirical and visionary time to the realm of space, considering the experience of a female Christian penitent, who stares devotedly at a tiny crucifix only to see the space around it expand to mirror Christ's suffering. Obeyesekere follows the unconscious motivations underlying rapture, the fantastical consumption of Christ's body and blood, and body mutilation and levitation, bridging medieval Catholicism and the movements of early modern thought as reflected in William Blake's artistic visions and poetic dreams. He develops the term "dream-ego" through a discussion of visionary journeys, Carl Jung's and Sigmund Freud's scientific dreaming, and the cosmic and erotic dream-visions of New Age virtuosos, and he defines the parameters of a visionary mode of knowledge that provides a more elastic understanding of truth. A career-culminating work, this volume translates the epistemology of Hindu and Buddhist thinkers for western audiences while revitalizing western philosophical and scientific inquiry.<br>

  Book Title: After Christianity-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): D’Isanto Luca<br>
  Abstract: When Vattimo was asked by a former teacher if he still believed in God, his reply was, "Well, I believe that I believe." This paradoxical declaration of faith serves as the foundation for a brilliant exposition on Christianity in the new millennium -- an age characterized by a deep uncertainty of opinion -- and a personal account of how Vattimo himself recovered his faith through Nietzsche and Heidegger. He first argues that secularization is in fact the fulfillment of the central Christian message, and prepares us for a new mode of Christianity. He then explains that Nietzsche's thesis concerns only the "moral god" and leaves room for the emergence of "new gods." Third, Vattimo claims that the postmodern condition of fragmentation, anti-Eurocentrism, and postcolonialism can be usefully understood in light of Joachim of Fiore's thesis concerning the "Spiritual Age" of history. Finally, Vattimo argues for the idea of "weak thought." Because philosophy in the postmetaphysical age can only acknowledge that "all is interpretation," that the "real" is always relative and not the hard and fast "truth" we once thought it to be, contemporary thought must recognize itself and its claims as "weak" as opposed to "strong" foundationalist claims of the metaphysical past. Vattimo concludes that these factors make it possible for religion and God to become a serious topic for philosophy again, and that philosophy should now formally engage religion.<br>

  Abstract: In
      Mourning in America, McIvor addresses significant and urgent questions about how citizens can mourn traumatic events and enduring injustices in their communities. McIvor offers a framework for analyzing the politics of mourning, drawing from psychoanalysis, Greek tragedy, and scholarly discourses on truth and reconciliation.Mourning in Americaconnects these literatures to ongoing activism surrounding racial injustice, and it contextualizes Black Lives Matter in the broader politics of grief and recognition. McIvor also examines recent, grassroots-organized truth and reconciliation processes such as the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2004-2006), which provided a public examination of the Greensboro Massacre of 1979-a deadly incident involving local members of the Communist Workers Party and the Ku Klux Klan.<br>

  Book Title: Meaning, Truth, and Reference in Historical Representation-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Ankersmit Frank<br>
  Abstract: At the heart of Ankersmit's project is a sharp distinction between interpretation and representation. The historical text, he holds, is first and foremost a representation of some part of the past, not an interpretation. The book's central chapters address the concept of historical representation from the perspectives of reference, truth, and meaning. Ankersmit then goes on to discuss the possible role of experience in the history writing, which leads directly to a consideration of subjectivity and ethics in the historian's practice. Ankersmit concludes with a chapter on political history, which he maintains is the "basis and condition of all other variants of historical writing." Ankersmit's rehabilitation of historicism is a powerfully original and provocative contribution to the debate about the nature of historical writing.<br>

  Abstract: Truth, reference, and meaning have traditionally been the three central notions in philosophical semantics. In the preceding two chapters we dealt with the question of the role to be assigned to reference and truth in (historical) representation. We found that representations cannot be said to refer to the world in the way proper names and sentences do, though they can be characterized as self-referential. Similarly, the notion of truth can meaningfully be used in the context of representation, not in the sense of propositional truth but in the quasi-Heideggerian sense of truth as a revelation of a past reality.

  Abstract: Narratives of conflict between antagonistic or competing communities compel the construction of simplistic binaries: good versus evil, truth versus falsehood, progress versus regression, and freedom versus oppression.¹ In reporting ethnic conflicts, the media, particularly those representing interested parties, rarely present “a coherent political analysis.”² Yet media narratives can precipitate and exacerbate conflict. Daya Kishan Thussu and Des Freedman identify the media in the context of the communication of conflict as a “battleground.”³ Regarding the contemporary world, saturated with the media’s reporting of conflict, Simon Cottle argues that the media-conflict interface needs to be understood through the perspective of “mediatized conflict.”<br>

  Book Title: Representing the "Good German" in Literature and Culture after 1945-Altruism and Moral Ambiguity<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Schönfeld Christiane<br>
  Abstract: In the aftermath of the Second World War, both the allied occupying powers and the nascent German authorities sought Germans whose record during the war and the Nazi period could serve as a counterpoint to the notion of Germans as evil. That search has never really stopped. In the past few years, we have witnessed a burgeoning of cultural representations of this "other" kind of Third Reich citizen - the "good German" - as opposed to the committed Nazi or genocidal maniac. Such representations have highlighted individuals' choices in favor of dissenting behavior, moral truth, or at the very least civil disobedience. The "good German's" counterhegemonic practice cannot negate or contradict the barbaric reality of Hitler's Germany, but reflects a value system based on humanity and an "other" ideal community. This volume of new essays explores postwar and recent representations of "good Germans" during the Third Reich, analyzing the logic of moral behavior, cultural and moral relativism, and social conformity found in them. It thus draws together discussions of the function and reception of "Good Germans" in Germany and abroad.

  Abstract: The phrase ‘archaeology is a political act’¹ is oft repeated, but as with any such definitive phrase when used in academia each word of it has multiple meanings. For instance ‘is’. Well, it is not always. Archaeology

There is academic archaeology, private sector archaeology, public archaeology, uses of archaeology in the heritage industry and so on, all intrinsically connected, but each with nuances different enough to render universality meaningless.<br>

  Book Title: Tragedy and the Tragic in German Literature, Art, and Thought-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Quinn Thomas P.<br>
  Abstract: The many catastrophes of German history have often been described as tragic. Consequently, German literature, music, philosophy, painting, and even architecture are rich in tragic connotations. Yet exactly what "tragedy" and "the tragic" may mean requires clarification. The poet creates a certain artful shape and trajectory for raw experience by "putting it into words"; but does putting such experience into words (or paintings or music or any other form) betray suffering by turning it into mere art? Or is it art that first turns mere suffering into tragic experience by revealing and clarifying its deepest dimension? What are we talking about, exactly, when we talk about tragic experience and tragic art, especially in an age in which, according to Hannah Arendt, evil has become banal? Does banality muffle or even annul the tragic? Does tragedy take suffering and transform it into beauty, as Schiller thought? Is it in the interest of truth for suffering to be "beautiful"? Is it possible that poetry, music, and art are important because they in fact create the meaning of suffering? Or is suffering only suffering and not accessible to meaning, tragic or otherwise? This book comprises essays that seek to clarify the meaning of tragedy and the tragic in its many German contexts, art forms, and disciplines, from literature and philosophy to music, painting, and history.

The practice of autobiography necessarily confers on the autobiographical text an implied truth value upon which the weight of contemporary theory since existentialism and structuralism has cast considerable doubt.

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Feyerabend’s epistemology is “harmless and benign” (p. 148), it merely expresses neurobiological facts about ordinary cognition (Paul Churchland). Far from harmless, his epistemological relativism undermines liberal democracy and personal autonomy (J. N. Hattiangadi). Not so, since Feyerabend followed Mill and adopted a relativist stance only to heighten the appreciation of truth (Elisabeth Lloyd). He went further than Mill, however, when questioning the place of truth in human flourishing (Sheldon Reaven). And rather than reveal truth, Feyerabend’s
         reductioarguments demonstrate the possibility of overthrowing the empirical basis of received views (Gonzalo Munévar). This shows that Feyerabend did not adequately appreciate Newton’s rule, according to which alternative hypotheses should only be proposed when new evidence warrants it (Peter Achinstein). But Feyerabend provided a profoundly nuanced critique of Newton’s unfollowable rule that one should listen to experience only (Bas van Fraassen). He was confused and confusing, however, when in his opposition to Popper he claimed that science violates the laws of logic (John Watkins). And he retracted much of his criticism of Kuhn when he finally understood him (Paul Hoyningen‐Huene). Rather than settle old debates, one might engage Feyerabend’s “New Metaphysic” of the 1990s and advance his effort to move beyond the deceptive realism/relativism dichotomy (John Preston).<br>

Abstract: Michelle Rosaldo’s (
            1982,1973) studies of public speech in the Philippines, at the advent of Western influence, provide one splendid example of such work. Rosaldo argues that the native Ilongots’ traditional, flowery, indirect public speech style implicitly acknowledged their idea that no one person had a singular claim to the truth and that no one could do very much to enforce one version of the truth in a dispute between differing truth claims. When Western imperial powers overshadowed local rulers’ power, the speech style became more direct and forceful. The West brought the idea that there was one universal, single truth, and that there were powerful institutions that could enforce that single truth, even if not everyone accepted it as truth. These new collective representations—new notions of truth, power, and personhood—were inseparable from the change to a more direct, brusque, conflictive, Western style of public discourse.<br>

Abstract: Theories are always, in some way, about their theorists. While Luhmann’s variant of mutant functionalism is not palatable to American tastes, his theories are as reflective of late‐20th‐century European sensibilities as Parsons’s were of mid‐20th‐century America or Bellah and Geertz’s of the upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, some art critics have warmed to Luhmann’s book as an exemplar of one of the newer “cool” theories of art; that is, those that challenge more subject‐centered and humanist theories and aim to accommodate the growth of new mediums such as digital art and cyberspace. But in any conception of art that includes culture, the medium is only as good as the meaning it conveys. And it is the meaning of art that is sorely lacking in Luhmann’s appraisal. Paul Ricoeur once wrote that “materialism is the truth of a world without truth.” It might then be said of Luhmann’s conception of the art system that it is the truth of art without meaning.<br>

Abstract: Nature likewise teaches me by these sensations of pain, hunger, thirst, etc., that I am not only lodged in my body as a pilot in a vessel, but that I am besides so intimately conjoined, and as it were intermixed with it, that my mind and body compose a certain unity. For if this were not the case, I should not feel pain when my body is hurt, seeing I am merely a thinking thing, but should perceive the wound by the understanding alone, just as a pilot perceives by sight when any part of his vessel is damaged; and when my body has need of food or drink, I should have a clear knowledge of this, and not be made aware of it by the confused sensations of hunger and thirst: for, in truth, all these sensations of hunger, thirst, pain, etc., are nothing more than certain confused modes of thinking, arising from the union and apparent fusion of mind and body.

Abstract: These historical texts about the origins of Dissent were merely the most visible forms of the ways in which memories of the Dissenting past were reproduced in the eighteenth century. Much was no doubt transmitted orally in family conversation. Memories were also held in material objects—in buildings, in gravestones and memorial plaques, in the family Bible and other books. Week after week of attendance at a chapel that traced its history back to the same historical moment, and that honored its ancestors and founders, reinforced a congregational identity rooted in narratives of persecution, of resistance to popery and arbitrary power, of unflinching commitment to religious and civil liberty. The weekly sermons of the minister were similarly important in the transmission of memory and of a self‐consciously historical identity. Funeral sermons in particular were opportunities for conjuring up the past, reconnecting to the heroic sufferings of a previous generation. Here the strong family roots of Dissent give history a powerful emotional charge. Genealogy and family lore intersected with the political history of the nation. Fathers and grandfathers and great‐grandfathers had suffered for the cause of truth and might even be there, honored, among the 2,000 victims listed by name in the two editions of the
      Abridgementor in theContinuation. Under the name Edmund Calamy on the title page was addedfils et nepos, son and grandson. And when Laurence Echard, in hisHistory of England, made some derogatory remarks on the Puritan preacher Edmund Calamy, his grandson—some eighty years after—declared that he counted it an honor to be descended from him.60Much of the biographical material in his histories had been sent to him by the family relations of ejected ministers so that these texts were, in some degree, a collective work of memory by the Dissenting community of the early eighteenth century. In numberless forms, the memory of the Restoration betrayal, of “the Great Ejec~<br>

Abstract: But are there not objections to be made? For example, following Heidegger, one could assimilate the biblical definition according to image and likeness to the Greek definition according to the possession of λόγος in order to understand both as imposing upon man the mode of Being “im Sinne des Vorhandensein” (“in the sense of subsistence [occurring and Being‐present‐at‐hand]”).
         40But what proof does Heidegger give of the equivalence between these two definitions? If necessary, the definition by λόγος could fall under reproach; but does the definition according to the image of God not exclude, precisely, anything having to do, in God and thus in man, with Being as subsistence (vorhanden)? Unless, that is, Heidegger includes neither definition in the division of finite being from infinite being.41But there too, does he not take up, as if it goes without saying, the metaphysical distinction par excellence of theensintofinitumandinfinitum, introduced by Duns Scotus through to Suarez, without seeing that this distinction doubtless contradicts the incomprehensibility of the image and likeness? Does he simply want, in the end, to deny theology the right to tackle the question of man’s status, just as he denies it that of responding to the question, “Why is there something rather than nothing?” by holding that “anyone for whom the Bible is divine revelation and truth already has the answer to the question … before it is asked: beings, with the exception of God Himself, are created by Him. God Himself ‘is’ as the uncreated Creator.” This remains, Heidegger believes, unacceptable, because “one who holds on to such faith as a basis can, perhaps, emulate and participate in the asking of our question in a certain way, but he cannot authentically question. … He can act only ‘as if’ [nun so tun `as ob'] … in the beginning God created heaven and earth, etc.’”42This argument presupposes in its turn that, by invoking creation, the believer confidently knows and thus comprehen~<br>

Abstract: Camus outlined his idea of his art and the role of the writer that is resonant with the title of his short story collection,
            Exile and the Kingdom,in his 1957 Nobel Prize acceptance speech, available online (http://www.nobel.se/literature/laureates/1957/camus‐acceptance.html): “[My art] is a means of stirring the greatest number of people by offering them a privileged picture of common joys and sufferings. It obliges the artist not to keep himself apart; it subjects him to the most humble and the most universal truth.… By definition he cannot put himself today in the service of those who make history; he is at the service of those who suffer it. Otherwise, he will be alone and deprived of his art. Not all the armies of tyranny with their millions of men will free him from his isolation, even and particularly if he falls into step with them. But the silence of an unknown prisoner, abandoned to humiliations at the other end of the world, is enough to draw the writer out of his exile, at least whenever, in the midst of the privileges of freedom, he manages not to forget that silence, and to transmit it in order to make it resound by means of his art.”<br>

Abstract: Again, I do not mean that communication was never thought before, but that the emergence of the communication concept in modernity entails disentangling the scene of communication from the question of truth. Whether what I am thinking is true or not is irrelevant, in Smith’s account, to the question of whether my communication is successful. This is why Smith’s new rhetoric makes no great distinction between the communication of affects (putting across how I feel) and the communication of ideas or propositions.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”

Author(s): Robbins,  Jeffrey W.<br>
Abstract: Robbins specifies these failures by showing how two great attempts at philosophical theology fell short. On the one hand, Dietrich Bonhoeffer pushed theology toward a philosophical theology that would repair the Barthian disjunction of theology and philosophy and avoid posing the alternative of deciding categorically between either God or world. Bonhoeffer’s attempt falls short, however, when he bases his ethics on a wisdom that sees the world through the truth of Jesus Christ. On the other hand, the path of phenomenology has gone in the opposite direction: from a transcendental idealism (the early Edmund Husserl, for whom philosophy should be pure of ontology or theology) to engagement with history and the world (Heidegger and the later Husserl, whose attention to the life‐world brings philosophy into the world of history and actuality that animates it, even if the promise of this engagement is not often seized).<br>

Abstract: See Hans‐Georg Gadamer,
            Truth and Method, trans. Joel Weinsheimer and Donald G. Marshall, 2nd ed. and 2nd rev. ed. (New York: Crossroad, 1989; Continuum, 1998); Emmanuel Levinas,Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority, trans. Alphonso Lingis (Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1969), 33–52. Levinas argues that dialogue is founded upon the asymmetrical relationship between the self and the infinite Other (“Dialogue … is a thinking of theunequal, a thought thinkingbeyondthe given” [Emmanuel Levinas,God Who Comes to Mind, trans. Bettina Bergo (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998), 151]) and in that sense not a method of uncovering truth but a call to (self‐) transcendence, i.e., to ethics (ibid., 143–51). Levinas’s purely asymmetrical ethical understanding of the self‐other relation, in which the practice of dialogue is reduced to the infinite Other’s “breaking in” and rupturing of the totalizing horizon of my world, is meant as a critique of Hegel’s more symmetrical, interdependent, and holistic understanding of the self‐other relation in terms of mutual recognition. But this criticism is predicated on what in my view is an unconvincing identification of holism, which is an internally differentiated harmony, with totality, which is devoid of internal differentiation whatsoever. I follow Paul Ricoeur’s more Hegelian, dialectical understanding of the self‐other relation (that is at the same time informed by the Levinasian critique), in which the horizon of my world is driven by its own logic to a universalizability test via the sieve of the other’s scrutiny and is transformed in the process.

Abstract: David Tracy examines the tension between literal and metaphorical meaning in Christian religious language in “Metaphor and Religion: The Test Case of Christian Texts,” in
            On Metaphor, ed. Sheldon Sacks (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1979), 89–104. Tracy focuses on two basic expressions: “The Kingdom of God is like” and “God is Love.” “The statement ‘God is Love,’” Tracy writes, “does not say literally what God is butproducesa metaphorical meaning for what God is like” (103). Tracy refers to Paul Ricoeur’s insistence on the concept of tension inThe Rule of Metaphor(trans. Robert Czerny [Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2000], 247–56). Ricoeur speaks of “theecstaticmoment of language,” which is “the moment ofbelief,of ontological commitment” (249). Ricoeur summarizes the idea of “tension” within metaphorical truth as follows: “There is no other way to do justice to the notion of metaphorical truth than to include the critical incision of the (literal) ‘is not’ within the ontological vehemence of the metaphorical ‘is’” (255).<br>

Abstract: Despite their anti‐ or non‐philosophical bearing, in fact many of them [New Critics] espouse a theory of a purely aesthetic kind of truth in literature. … It is similarly artificial to claim a purely external relation of text and reading, which in effect sets aside the mutual implication of interpretation and textual meaning (as hermeneutical theorists would have it) or of reading and the textuality of the text (in terms of the Deconstructionists). If a narrative or a poem should “not mean but be,”
            avoiding paraphrase as the proper means to the realization of this ideal comes close to enthroning verbal repetition as the highest form of understanding.”36<br>

Abstract: Critical Inquiryis a journal dedicated to debate, dialogue, and controversy. We may hope for the elevated, disinterested discourse of angels, but we have to settle for the passionate engaged voices of men and women in real historical situations.… Once a question of general urgency has been raised, we would not presume to dictate inflexible limits of propriety or to rely unquestioningly on appeals to the authority of experts. In this policy of critical tolerance of polemic, we find ourselves aligned with William Hazlitt: “passion … is the essence, the chief ingredient in moral truth.”2<br>

Abstract: That said, one can make a strong argument that the way that fundamentalist narratives operate is different than the ways their religious but not fundamentalist, or nationalistic and not religious, counterparts do. When I shared with Mr. Zee the results from my study in his classroom, he immediately recognized the ideological rut he had strayed into, and he took steps to shift the patterns of his pedagogy the following year. In other words, Mr. Zee acknowledged that the governing narrative of “progress and freedom” cannot fully account for all of history, much less all of American history, and that there are episodes and events—like the Holocaust and 9/11, like slavery and genocide—that demand plot lines that are neither triumphalist nor endowed with happy endings (Schweber
         2004).19Moreover, and more importantly perhaps, at least for Mr. Zee, the context of public schooling allowed for the possibility of debates over which narrative the community’s collective memories should be constructed to support. By contrast, at Eternal Grace there is no event that could escape the overarching narrative that asserts God’s ultimate control and promises true Christians’ salvation, and certainly no need to debate the legitimacy of that framework. No event could challenge or disrupt Mrs. Barrett’s beliefs.20And that, in short, epitomizes the nature of fundamentalism. Mr. Zee believes that history, integrally, contains multiple narrative possibilities; Mrs. Barrett’s historical sensibility trumpeted a single, unitary truth.<br>

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Such distinctions have had an enormous influence through the ages over Christianity. Augustine’s
         Confessions, for example, continually signifies wayward human existence through the trope of his early life as a teacher of “rhetoric,” since here, “through clouds of smoke,” he and his companions used the art of poetics to become “deceivers and deceived in all our different aims and ambitions.”6Poetic cleverness is contrasted with his later life after conversion when he is finally and eternally anchored by God’s unchanging moral righteousness, a place beyond mere worldly appearances that brings him to an invisible peace and rest. Augustine exhibits a deep, and to us today rather surprising, antipathy toward the theater, which he accuses of teaching audiences to find pleasure in imaginary pain instead of painfully confessing the awful truth of their sinfulness; only in this way is one opened up to the true enjoyment of God.7He likewise undertakes virulent criticisms inThe City of Godof the made “images” worshipped in Roman idolatry, which he opposes to the Christian worship of the one true invisible Maker beyond any possible human imitation.8<br>

Abstract: The practical and normative ethics of our profession will undoubtedly be accompanied by emotive and affective reactions. After all, human action is motivated by emotion, cognition, reason, and other things. The profession’s desire to identify core values is a product of these multiple motivations. Just as identification of a core value requires an explication of what qualities are attached to a thing that is valued and for whom the thing is valuable and why, so too does discourse ethics in general require such full argumentation. More than just formal argument, though, discourse ethics entails participation broadly; it invites those concerned to have a voice within the communicative endeavor. The voicing, however, follows some norms that are aimed at the outcome of the deliberation—workable and agreed‐upon practices. Habermas says that “discourse ethics, then, stands or falls with two assumptions: (
         a) that normative claims to validity have cognitive meaning and can be treated like claims to truth and (b) that the justification of norms and commands requires that a real discourse be carried out and thus cannot occur in a strictly monological form” [35, p. 68]. Habermas presents an ideal that can suggest a beginning for the furtherance of a practical and normative ethics for librarianship.<br>

Abstract: Making room for a more poetic function at work between this reading‐and‐writing prophet and his confirming God allows that “truth,” as Ricoeur has said, “no longer means verification, but manifestation. … What shows itself is in each instance a proposed world, a world I may inhabit and wherein I can project my own most possibilities.”
         98This is the power to which Bloom credited Mormonism’s survival: not Smith’s history making but his “myth‐making imagination at work to sustain so astonishing an innovation.”99It is the power to shape reality, not merely describe it. To the extent that self‐consciousness can be ascribed to him, it is probably why Smith abjured theology for mythmaking. Regardless, scholars who would understand the relative longevity and appeal of his project, especially as it has transcended its American milieu, can ill afford to ignore the capacity of Smith’s narratives to make sense of time.<br>

            Theology after Vedānta, 33: “Though Brahman is neither a fiction (as might be a character in a novel) nor a textual production (as might be a ritual vis‐à‐vis the texts which accompany it), Advaita’s truth about Brahman does not exist outside of texts, but only after them.” See also “Principle of Upasaṃhāra,” 284, 294 n. 12, where Clooney draws an intriguing parallel between the Vedānta concept of brahman and the Mīmāṃsā principle ofartha.<br>

Abstract: How, then, are we to get out of the impasse and return a sense of vision to re‐vision? If rewriting is indeed change (see Moraru
         2001, 144), is change a positive value in itself? In his discussion of what he terms “radical typology,” Laurence Coupe emphasizes what he sees as myth’s “permanent possibility,” its “dynamic tension between the already and the not yet” (Coupe1997, 106). As Coupe argues, “all myths presuppose a previous narrative, and in turn form the model for future narratives” (108). In consequence, it is not toward demythologization (which is, after all, oriented toward the past and works, as Coupe points out, “in terms of closure” [108]) but toward remythologization that rewriting as re‐vision ought to aspire: to work toward disclosure, opening narratives to ever new re‐visions, and thus to “evade the stasis of doctrine” (110). “Permanent possibility,” “narrative dynamism”—Coupe’s terms echo distinctly with Bauman’s liquidity and should therefore be regarded with similar suspicion. More crucially, Coupe’s understanding of myth (derived from Paul Ricoeur) relies on a sense of utopia that is external to the rewriting it informs. As he explains, myth “is synonymous with a ‘social imagination’ which functions by virtue of a dialectic between ‘ideology’ and ‘utopia.’ … Without [ideology], we would have no sense of society or tradition; without [utopia], we would simply equate the given society and tradition with eternal truth” (1997, 96). The question remains: in the absence of utopia, what role for re‐vision?<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: Ibid., p. 111. Even Riffaterre's approach to the structuring unsaid of textual writing can be seen to represent on its own terms a shift from the ontology of narrative toward its epistemology at the level of form rather than content. By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific
            truth:a story's immanent signifying patterns in their subtextual disclosure.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 522216<br>
Date: 10 2008<br>
Author(s): Balsamo Gian<br>
Abstract: Now that the ramified circuitry of cultural influence has brought face‐to‐face Augustine’s and Proust’s respective mirrors of introspection, we may see more distinctly how Augustine’s and Marcel’s respective notions of soul share the presumption that self‐knowledge depends on self‐improvement. The more he strives to make his desire coincident with God’s love, the better Augustine knows himself; the better he knows himself, the more superfluous his introspection becomes, because his historical self converges better and better with his own destined‐for‐paradise self. As to Marcel, the more he rarefies his self‐centered self and adopts in its stead the altruistic self that coincides with his grandmother’s love, the less he feels estranged from himself. In Augustine’s scheme one finds the classical elements of metaphysical transcendence. The full convergence between actual and aimed‐at self, hence the full elimination of the mirror of introspection, will occur in the afterlife, in the metaphysical body that will be allotted to Augustine as a saint—a body that will embody all the scriptural figures of redemption and salvation, making any mediation of reflexivity redundant to truth. In Proust’s scheme one may detect instead the elements of a soft transcendence—grafted on the laws of the organism. When involuntary memory acts “the same way as love does,”
         65retrieving for Marcel his (forgotten or discarded) amorous self, he is encouraged to engage in an organismic sort of introspection; by dropping into a comatose sleep that paralyzes the self‐serving drives of his intellect and will, the two faculties that would otherwise work in concert toward the rejection of this altruistic self, Marcel is enabled to surrender unconditionally to the unconscious memory of it. Even in this case, any mediation of reflexivity becomes redundant; the self that past affections have deposited in Marcel’s unconscious memory is literally indistinguishable from his own organism—it just ne~<br>

Abstract: In modern democracies, the
         ars memoriaehave been placed in the hands of the people, dispersed across various roles, ceremonies, institutions, and commemorative practices.85Understood self‐reflexively, just‐war morality can work in such contexts to ensure that war is remembered for the right reasons or, put more accurately, that what is remembered about war is right. In that way citizens can assess war and public history with habits and norms that enable us to resist the twin perils of self‐aggrandizement and self‐deception. That is no small need given how memories of past wars shape how subsequent wars are conceived, authorized, and fought. Viewed as an exercise of ascesis, just‐war morality can discipline passions and actions that risk imposing on fellow citizens and others the ultimate sacrifice. In the process, it enables us to address Anscombe’s anxious premonition: “The death of men, the curtailment of liberty, the destruction of property, the diminution of culture, the obscuring of judgment by passion and interest, the neglect of truth and charity, the decrease in belief and in the practice of religion—all these are the normal accompaniments of a war.”86<br>

Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: These points lead to a third one that has emerged from this inquiry: the theme of value. If the accounts of knowledge and power rooted in conceptions of human or divine agents are no longer plausible—that is, if humanistic and also religious outlooks seem incapable of grasping the structures of current lived reality—what is to serve as the measure or norm for evaluating individual and social existence in relation to the realm of mortal life? Where, we might say, does the good reside, and can it orient responsible existence? The search for the norm or measure of life hounds our age no less than ancient Greek philosophy, the biblical witness, modern humanists, or current critics of humanism and religion. Worldwide, people are asking about the forces structuring reality and whether ideas about goodness and justice have relevance and truth at all. Are we at the mercy of nonhuman and nondivine powers, the fate of Being, and therefore must endure our fate devoid of appraisal? Is there no room, no ground, for confidence that convictions about what is good have some purchase on the world in which we dwell, a confidence that can well up from the human love of life? I have tried to suggest that siding with either humanism or religion in order to respond to this situation is a false option because these outlooks do not address the challenges posed to their basic assumptions: first, the assumption that reality is structured by agents; second, an account of knowledge from the perspective of the favored agent (human or divine); and, third, that the good is defined either in terms of human flourishing or conformity to sacred powers. It is not surprising, then, that the humanities, religious studies, theology, and ethics seem at a loss for how to orient their work within the compass of the university. Their operative assumptions about knowledge and acting agents are widely rejected by various social and natural scientists and also by dominant strands of philosophy and cultural anal~<br>

Abstract: This second, more normative dimension of Mrozik’s project opens up some challenging questions. If it is the case, as she suggests, that a sympathetic reading of the
   Compendium of Trainingcan provide valuable intellectual resources for contemporary ethical reflection, it remains unclear to me how our engagement with this text should proceed, given the significant disparities in cosmological assumptions (e.g., karmic causation and rebirth) and forms of practice that separate Mrozik’s contemporary readers from the text’s original audience. The text, moreover, appears less concerned with advancing particular truth claims than with creating a distinctive kind of religious subjectivity through ascetic and ritualized practice. Can we assess the value of the text’s ethical ideals apart from the forms of discipline and practice with which they were linked in medieval India? IfVirtuous Bodiesleaves such questions open to further exploration and analysis, its nuanced reading of theCompendium of Trainingbrings into sharper focus the centrality of human embodiment in South Asian Buddhist religious discourses and encourages us to reflect deeply on its implications for our own ethical inquiry.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: The interesting thing is that Coleridge accepts much of the Kantian analysis: these concepts, such as a personal God, grace, and the possibility of prayer, are indeed improper to reason, but they are returned as improper to the very heart of the human subject. Thus, Coleridge writes that “only a negative rationality can be demanded” (N5383) of prayer. Prayer involves “contradictions
         in terms, I grant you: never the less so it is! … Were it not a contradictionin terms, it would not be anIdea… but either a Fact of the Sense or the Conception of the Understanding! … Spiritual things can only be spiritually discerned. … It is impossible, you say—Yea, I reply: but nevertheless such is the truth” (N5554, fols. 12v–13). Both Kant and Coleridge recognize that parerga possess a certain phenomenological irreducibility: they do seem to force themselves to be thought, even if they are strictly unthinkable. Yet where the former privileges philosophy’s right to exclude unthinkable concepts, the latter bears witness to the necessity of these same concepts. In Coleridge’s work, the human subject must act, at its very center, on and across the limit of what it can justifiably think and know: “The more I read & reflect on the arguments of the truly philosophical Theists & Atheists, the more I feel convinced that the ultimate difference is a moral rather than intellectual one / that the result is an X Y Z—an acknowledged Insufficiency of the Known to account for itself, and therefore a something Unknown—but to which the Theist dedicates his noblest feelings of Love, & Awe, & by a moral syllogism connects & unites it with his Conscience & Actions—while the Atheist leaves it a blank in the Heart, because it is a Blank in his Understanding” (N4030).<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: The contradictory impulses in the nascent Enlightenment's relationship to Judaism were never clearer than in the case of Spinoza. His devastating engagement with biblical criticism in the
         Theologico-Political Treatise(1670), according to Sutcliffe, “primitivises and infantalises” the Jews of the Old Testament while continuing to regard Scripture as their authentic, if flawed, history. Paradoxically, Spinoza would later undergo a rather different transfiguration as the “Messiah of the Enlightenment.” Sutcliffe examines how, after the philosopher's death in 1677, his biographers made painstaking efforts to “de-judaise” his thought by emphasizing his tranquil “self-mastery” and blithe detachment from any confessional identity. Nevertheless, Spinoza's early affiliation with Judaism left this universalist image fraught with a productive tension: his first biographer, Jean Maximilien Lucas, likened his subject to Christ—another great philosopher who, having rejected the prejudices of his time, set forth to preach the love of God and neighbor. His life and death, furthermore, announced the appearance of a new source of truth for humanity, that of the Enlightenment. Sutcliff seizes on such ambiguities to show how the original paradox at the center of Enlightenment universalism could never fully transcend the particularities of its founder (Sutcliffe, 118–47, quotes on 123, 133). Sutcliffe's Spinoza, even more than Sepinwall's Grégoire, symbolizes an ideal that began to fail at the moment of its inception.<br>

Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: Because the promise extends and depends upon trust, it opens a space fertile for free exchange and responsibility purged of agonism. This free and noncompetitive reciprocity depends upon the doubling of the promise into its initial token and final gift. The first token might be symbolically related to the final gift, as the deed and keys are to the house, but they are simply not the final gift. This difference is decisive for addressing the character of competition and the threat of violent giving, the offer one cannot refuse, since the token is nothing, a trace, perhaps, a little something that requires trust in order for it to have any significance. Because the promise is doubled into a token, it does not have reality without trust. The promisor may indeed go on to deliver the final gift without anyone according him or her truth, but there is no debt created here since the significance of this token depends upon the trust of the one receiving it. It has no force without it and so does not replicate the way the appearance of one bearing gifts carries with it the threat of acceptance or rejection.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: The mode that is attributed to the Jew in Lévinas's essay is here called merely nomadic. It is nevertheless clear that the relationship between “man” and the “nomad” mirrors the relation of the anti-Semite to the Jew, as the “nomad” is presented as tied to technology and as such represents a threat to “man.” At the same time that it generalizes Lévinas's text, the opening of Blanchot's essay nonetheless manages to parallel the first paragraph of Lévinas's, even alluding obliquely to Heidegger's critique of flight in “Das Ding.” Within the body of the essay, Blanchot does take up specifically the category of the pagan, declaring that Gagarin's space flight is a threat to the pagan in all of us: he who is tied to enrootedness, to tradition, to his biological race, he who consoles himself among the trees over the evil of mankind. The Jew, however, is not mentioned. Even when Lévinas is paraphrased in the essay it is without specific citation, and he is referred to not as someone who speaks in the name of Judaism but as “the man with no fixed abode,” as a representative of the nomads (“C,” p. 13; “CS,” p. 269). In repeating Lévinas, Blanchot has insisted on resisting the move back to the proper, which Lévinas's essay performs in its emphasis on Judaism's message. Lévinas uses Gagarin's flight to lead back to the truth of Judaism, concluding his own essay with the claim that, like technology, Judaism “has demystified the universe” and, moreover, “has discovered man in the nudity of the face” (“H,” p. 259; “HGU,” p. 234). Blanchot uses Lévinas's essay to remind us that Gagarin tears us away from the proper in
         every sense. His omission of both Lévinas's name and of Judaism underscores the point that deracination as a moral concept would prohibit reappropriation of any kind. The message of Gagarin's speech from space is for no one to claim and for no one to own, that is, that “truth is nomadic” (“C,” p. 13; “CS,” p. 271). Blanchot has thus doubly displaced Lévinas'~<br>

Abstract: But the animals that actually appear in Dante's poem function as a type of allegorical equation rather than as analogy. For example, the eagle as poetic image does not reveal anything new or surprising about eagles, or, indeed, about the justice of God. Nor do the three beasts in
      Inferno1 reveal anything about the behavior of these creatures or about the specific sins they represent. Rather, they enact a pattern of allegory that Erich Auerbach links to the classical past in contrast to what he identifies as Dante's “figural” allegories. For Auerbach, “Virgil,” as an example, is “not an allegory of an attribute, virtue, capacity, power, or historical institution. He is neither reason nor poetry nor the Empire” to which the simplified nineteenth-century notion of allegory had reduced him. Auerbach's understanding of allegory makes Virgil “afiguraof the fulfilled truth that the poem reveals, and this fulfillment is more real, more significant than thefigura.”33In the static-type allegory of the three beasts ofInferno1 or the eagle ofParadiso, real creatures have become personifications. This pattern resembles what Fredric Jameson has defined as allegory in his discussion of a Balzac novel (La cousine Bette) where “realistic characters” little by little become possessed and devolve into personifications. In Dante, these animal beings are already personifications in the same way that his bi- natured creatures that lord over various sections of hell (Minos, Geryon, centaurs) are personifications. Jameson argues that characters that turn into personifications lack individual existence or personality as they become equated with some notion of the universal—in other words, they become abstractions.34Similarly, the animals that Dante turns into personifications lack particular features other than their stereotyped traits, and thus they lose their species individuality to their abstract or universal symbolic meaning.

Abstract: “If any such be sorry and begin to show any tokens of true repentance, which either have sought unto or practiced any sorcery…they must be wisely informed and comforted, for Jesus Christ can and will cast forth an unclean spirit, if in truth of heart with weeping and fasting, and mourning, he be sought unto by repentance” (ibid., 15, K4r).<br>

Abstract: Though Levinas took pains to separate his Talmudic writings from his philosophical writings (e.g., publishing each with different publishers), both endeavors are characterized by an antipathy toward totalization. With regard to scripture, Levinas unsurprisingly insists that the commentator’s task is not to solve, settle, or decipher the text. He speaks instead of “renewal.” “The life of the Talmudist,” Levinas writes, “is nothing but the permanent renewal of the letter through the intelligence.”
      
            No amount of erudition or historical contextualization or critical knowledge can substitute for the unceasing work of asking questions of the text, since anything other than this has the effect of turning the text into a dead letter, an academic artifact containing obscurities without interest. For Levinas, the truth of the Talmud is inextricable from the light each individual sheds upon it; consequently, Talmudic thought must needs foster a dynamic pluralism—not to delight in relativism but to honor the infinite density of the Word, which requires the multiplicity of persons to express itself and unfold in the course of time.61

Abstract: Webster’s play, more than any other surveyed here, links the very genre of tragedy to metaphorical thinking. His self-conscious engagement with the genre incorporates both tragic action and tragic reflection or interpretation. That is to say, Webster integrates his own Bradley-like critics into the play itself, making room for both the pessimistic figure of pain and the redemptivist response to it, offering multiple options for affective response to the audience. His universe is one of doubt and uncertainty, and the play seems to be suggesting that metaphor—with all the issues of imprecision and distortion that accompany associative thinking—is an apt cognitive process for facing the tragic world. In the imagery of poison as fire, plays like
      Women, Beware Womenuse association to convey both sensory information and thematic significance. InKing Lear, Shakespeare’s characters speak in metaphors that build on sensory experience to process spiritual truth. But inThe Duchess of Malfi, metaphor becomes, in essence, the only way of knowing because the play continually undermines the veracity of sense perception. Over the course of the play, the Duchess has three children. Numerous characters see her pregnant body, and yet Bosola, employed to spy on her, still must seek further proof that she is with child. At one point, he feeds her unripe apricots, which cause her to go into labor. To conceal her condition and confuse Bosola, a rumor is circulated that she was poisoned—a reinterpretation of her pain that is so effective that even Bosola fears that the apricots might have been poisoned without his knowledge (2.2.31–32).
            And in the final act, the Duchess’s brother the Cardinal is murdered as his guards stand just outside the door, listening to his cries for help. But they had been told by the Cardinal himself that he would “faigne [him]self in danger” (5.4.15), and so they refuse to be taken in by what they think is his counterfeiting.

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D.<br>
Abstract: In recent years autobiographies have become ever more highly esteemed as sources for historical research. At the same time, more and more historians have themselves published their life stories. Jeremy D. Popkin analyzes both tendencies in this study on history, historians, and autobiography. He has read more than 300 autobiographies, mainly by English and American historians but also including French, German, Dutch, and Italian works. Popkin makes clear that this is a very interesting body of texts, because historians who have turned into autobiographers unconsciously demolish the existing wall between historiography and autobiography. When in the nineteenth century truth and objectivity became the professional standard among historians, the genre of autobiography fell into disgrace and was left to literary critics. Historians writing their life stories are, on the one hand, bound to the rules of this narrative and literary form, but, on the other hand, they are dedicated to the professional standards of their discipline. In fact, they are aware that their autobiographies are likely to be read more critically than those written by members of other professions. Their own life story should reinforce their historical work by showing truth and credibility.<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines the novel
         Cementerio de Papel[Paper Cemetery] (2002), a detective thriller about a murder that took place under the dome of the Archivo General de la Nación [National General Archive] (Lecumberri). The relocation and opening of the files of the former Dirección Federal de Seguridad [Federal Security Bureau] in the former prison comes along with the return of victims and victimizers, only now they come back as ghosts of things past. The novel works with the binomial jail/archive, featuring Lecumberri as a live space from which to begin a search for justice and truth, without sinking into melancholy or victimhood.<br>

Article Title: The Apparatus of the Dark: Emily Dickinson and the Epistemology of Metaphor<br>
Publisher: The University of California Press<br>
Issue: ncl.2012.67.issue-1<br>
Date: 6 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: This essay argues that Emily Dickinson’s poetry intervenes in the broad cultural assessment of epistemology provoked by the evolutionary debates of the 1860s. While scholars have begun to explore the thematic correspondences between Dickinson’s poetry and some aspects of this cultural conversation, this essay examines the ways in which her intervention occurs at the level of poetic form and is in fact profoundly dependent upon form. Specifically, it analyzes a set of her poems from the early 1860s through the early 1870s in which she uses the dual structure of metaphor to elicit a way of thinking about truth that is aligned with the empirical methods of research that were widely embraced in the mid nineteenth century; however, in the face of an increasingly contingent notion of truth, Dickinson’s way of thinking significantly revises cultural assumptions about what those methods might yield. The metaphors examined here amplify the distinctions between two material entities—lightning and fork, or sunset and lilac, for example—rather than merging them or leaping beyond them to stable, transcendent meaning. What Dickinson plays with is the possibility of a revised version of revelation or truth, one that is not only derived from the observation of material difference through the two parts of a metaphor, but that is more radically contingent on the perpetuity of such dual perception. Altogether, Dickinson’s metaphors are both critical and recuperative, as they contribute to the dismantling of fixed truth while embracing the limited revelations made possible by—
         onlymade possible by—sustained process.<br>

Abstract: In the text-based disciplines, psychoanalysis and Marxism have had a major influence on how we read, and this has been expressed most consistently in the practice of symptomatic reading, a mode of interpretation that assumes that a text's truest meaning lies in what it does not say, describes textual surfaces as superfluous, and seeks to unmask hidden meanings. For symptomatic readers, texts possess meanings that are veiled, latent, all but absent if it were not for their irrepressible and recurring symptoms. Noting the recent trend away from ideological demystification, this essay proposes various modes of "surface reading" that together strive to accurately depict the truth to which a text bears witness. Surface reading broadens the scope of critique to include the kinds of interpretive activity that seek to understand the complexity of literary surfaces---surfaces that have been rendered invisible by symptomatic reading.<br>

Abstract: Every text aims to seduce its reader. If the text at the same time lays claim to having scientific value, we readers must ask whether seduction stands in the way of truth. As a concept, seduction lies halfway between an assault and conversation. As opposed to assault, seduction conveys a dimension of voluntarily being swept off one's feet. As opposed to conversation, seduction implies that one loses one's senses for a moment. Who, then, is really subject and who is object in seduction? The thesis I will argue here is that the readership's or audience's only chance of taking on the role of subjects, in a textual seduction, is to lose their senses first. Rather than being an assault against scientific ethics, seduction is a necessary premise for a sensible conversation to take place.<br>

Author(s): Wirth-Nesher Timothy L.<br>
Abstract: Kauvar points out that in The Facts, Roth "demonstrates that what passes for fact
does not arrive at truth," and thus autobiography no more so than fiction can claim to
have an unmediated relationship with either "the facts" or "the truth," whatever those
terms may be said to represent (415).

Abstract: Michael Sprinker alleges that Kierkegaard, the "most radical expounder of 'truth as
subjectivity[,]' is also among the most suspicious questioners of the authority of the
subject over his discourse. In this the Kierkegaardian discourse resembles nothing more
closely than the Nietzschean text of The Will to Power" (332)

Article Title: Is Zoroastrianism Dualistic or Monotheistic?<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263718<br>
Date: 12 1, 1961<br>
Author(s): Zaehner Donald A.<br>
Abstract: The question raised in the title has been much debated by past and present interpreters of Zoroastrianism. In the first two parts of this paper we present some dualistic and monotheistic interpretations of the religion. The interpretations can be labeled as follows: 1. DUALISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks Omnipotence And Omniscience (Dhalla, Henning) 2. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks A Physical Nature (Shaked, Boyce) II. MONOTHEISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The Created Spirits View (Zaehner, Fox, Gershevitch) 2. The Transformationist (Maskhiyya) View 3. The Zurvānite View 4. The View That Good And Evil Are Coeternal Only In A Logical Sense (Moulton, Bode and Nanavutty, Duchesne-Guillemin) We present each of these views and discuss it critically in light of the following criteria: (1) textual evidence; (2) the continuity of the religion throughout its history, including the present time; (3) philosophical cogency; and (4) religious satisfaction. Our conclusion is that each of the above positions, despite its elements of strength, falls seriously short of one or more of these criteria, and hence that there is need for a more adequate interpretation of Zoroastrianism than any of them can offer. Accordingly, we present another interpretation in order to provoke further discussion and, hopefully, to advance the cause of trying to gain a more precise grasp of the teachings of this remarkable religion. In brief, the interpretation we favor is that Zoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique to itself among the major religions of the world. This combination results in a religious outlook which cannot be categorized as either straightforward dualism or straightforward monotheism, meaning that the question in the title of this paper poses a false dichotomy. The dichotomy arises, we contend, from a failure to take seriously enough the central role played by time in Zoroast~<br>

Article Title: Toward an Ontology of Relativism<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263711<br>
Date: 3 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Wilson Mark C.<br>
Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manynes~<br>

Article Title: Metaphor and Political Knowledge<br>
Publisher: The American Political Science Association<br>
Issue: i333635<br>
Date: 3 1, 1962<br>
Author(s): Wheelwright Eugene F.<br>
Abstract: Since the language of political inquiry seems to be inescapably metaphorical, the question necessarily arises as to how metaphors of various types, including models, enter into the composition and expression of political knowledge. The solutions that have been most influential in contemporary political science can be called the verificationist and constitutivist views of political metaphor. While both views contain important elements of truth, there are fundamental difficulties in each that require the search for a more satisfactory view. An alternative view of metaphor and political knowledge is developed by reference to four main problems: Why is political speech metaphorical? How do metaphors make political things manifest? How are political metaphors tested? and Are metaphors indispensable to political expression and political knowledge?<br>

Author(s): Wait Eldon C.<br>
Abstract: Perhaps the greatest challenge to an existential phenomenological account of perception is that posed by the argument from illusions. Recent developments in research on the behaviour of subjects suffering from illusions together with some seminal ideas found in Merleau-Ponty's writings enable us to develop and corroborate an account of the phenomenon of illusions, one, which unlike the empiricist account, does not undermine our conviction that in perception we "reach the things themselves". The traditional argument from illusions derives its force from an uncritical assumption that the process of experience takes place in time conceived as an infinite series of distinct moments. Once this assumption has been bracketed we are able to recognise the paradoxical truth that in the disillusion something can become that which it has always been and can cease to be that which it has never been. Furthermore, through a reflection on our experience of others overcoming their illusions, and on psychological evidence, we are able to show that there is nothing to suggest that this description of the disillusion is a description of a private or subjective event.<br>

Abstract: Caryl Phillips's narrative is painfully concerned with the relationship of Empire, Colony, and the In-between; Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean; slavery, rebellion, and freedom; Men, women and children; absent or useless fathers and damaged, aimless sons. It explores what hold in common while never losing sight of the painful quotidian, the specific. It is a narrative where the picaresque shakes hands with the epic and the linearity is broken, encircled, and put fast forward or in reverse by a mise-en-abîme of sorts: the tale-within-the-tale-within-the-tale even if interrupted by the tapestry of an emergent voice that finally proposes itself as both the identity and the difference of its verbal universe. "Enter your own self and discover the world," Phillips seems to be saying, "but also go out into the world and discover yourself." Once that call is answered, fiction itself becomes another way of questioning truth as we strive for it through the paradox of a lie. That lie can be called the imagination. It can also be seen as a parallel reality. For it may be observed as a critical mirror of what passes for the truth in the world of convention. It certainly sets up a second universe of being, where the narrator, say Cambridge in Cambridge, has a reality greater, though no less important, than the host of hastily met and then forgotten people we deal with on a daily basis. It is in this sense that Phillips brings into light another way of telling in that his narrative gives weight and presence to the virtues and vices—the fugitive personalities—of our daily acquaintance. This is the prerogative of his style, which I try to discuss in this essay. It has the power to render disenchantment and pleasure without resolving the contradiction between them. In fact, what holds them in tension, as equal forces straining in opposite directions, is the artist's mature subjectivity, stripped of hubris, unashamed either of its fallibility or of the modest assurance it has gained ~<br>

Abstract: Drawing attention to the complex reciprocal relationship between commercialized leisure and commercial literature in the so-called "Age of Wit," this essay reconceives of the witty and witless in two important ways. Taking for granted, first of all, that wit is usually analyzed in terms of the efficacy of verbal language, the essay examines how and why debates concerning true and false wit were played out in physical terms—in this case, through the motions, gestures, and attitudes of the dancing body. Second of all, the essay attempts to account for the enduring, if unwitting, attractions of "false wit" by likening it to the tricks and transformations of contemporary English pantomime. Satirists of the 1720s, 1730s, and 1740s frequently invoke the unmeaning motion of Harlequin as a visual way of proscribing the verbal excesses of extravagant language. At the same time, apologists for pantomime associate Harlequin's "dumb Wit" with truth, reason, and the pattern of nature, claiming that the genre's corporeality allowed it to transcend the limitations and equivocations of words. The essay concludes that the popularity of pantomime contextualizes the Augustan reaction against false wit, in that it identifies a source of aesthetic pleasure in the public's eagerness to be duped by apparent sameness in difference. Early eighteenth-century readers enjoy luxuriant, illogical, and mixed metaphors, forced similes, and trifling jibes and quibbles for the same reason that early eighteenth-century spectators delight in the unexpected turns of pantomimic entertainment: in a world under the sway of Harlequin's magical slapstick, audiences derive satisfaction from being deceived.<br>

Abstract: En considérant la théâtralité moins comme l'essence du théâtre, lui-même haut lieu de la mimésis, que comme sa condition d'émergence, nous voulons mettre en évidence ce qui pourrait la révéler par-delà le texte et la scène: altérité, imprésentabilité, féminité. Bien que liée intimement au lieu et au jeu de la représentation, impliquant acteurs, spectateurs et décors, la théâtralité se présentera plus comme un lieu de créativité, un espace transitionnel où se joue (de) la vérité. On en en mesurera l'enjeu à travers une relecture intertextuelle de La naissance de la tragédie et de fragments posthumes de la même période, en interrogeant la légitimité d'un instinct théâtral qui serait l'une des formes essentielles du Kunsttrieb dont le destin est de procéder à une métaphorisation de « Dionysos agissant » et à une poétisation dévoilante de la vérité dont l'acteur deviendra finalement l'interprète en cela même qu'il en joue sur le mode de l'absence et qu'il ouvre un texte vers cet autre qui ne s'y présente jamais comme tel. Considering theatrality less as the essence of theatre, which is the high place for Mimesis, than the condition of its emergence, we would like to bring to force what could express it above text and performance: alterity, impresentability, feminity. Even if it seems closely related to place and acting of the representation, including the actors, the spectator and the setting, theatrality will prove to be a place for creativity, a transitional space in which truth can be performed. We will assess its stakes through a second intertextual reading of The Birth of Tragedy and of posthumous extracts from the same period; we can at the same time wonder over the legitimacy of a theatral instinct which would be one of the essential forms of the « Kunstriels »; its fate is to act as a metaphor of an « acting Dionysos » and to a revealing poetisation of truth for which the actor eventually turns out to be the interpret in so far as he plays on it on being absent ~<br>

the end of a sort of cultural monopoly, be it illusory or real, we are threatened with the
destruction of our own discovery. Suddenly it becomes possible that there are just
others, that we ourselves are an 'other' among others" (History and Truth [Evanston,

Publisher: Humboldt State University<br>

Author(s): Jacobs Anton K.<br>
Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining~<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

Article Title: Vérité scientifique et vérité phénoménologique: En lisant Jean Ladrière<br>

Author(s): Gilbert Paul<br>
Abstract: Jean Ladrière, professeur à l'Université Catholique de Louvain, a développé une réflexion consacrée à la distinction et aux relations de la science et de la philosophie au point de vue épistémologique et ontologique, c'est-à-dire de la vérité. L'article parcourt trois de ses textes, écrits au long d'un demi siècle. La phénoménologie anime de plus en plus la réflexion, lui permettant de recentrer la dynamique de la science en un projet fondamental. Les vérités scientifiques et leur relativité historique sont à comprendre intérieurement à la pratique de la science, dont le philosophe médite le sens en prenant la responsabilité d'en révéler la vérité. L'évolution de la pensée de Ladrière illustre l'évolution de l'université de Louvain qui, fleuron du thomisme restauré par Léon XIII, s'est orienté de plus en plus vers la phénoménologie à l'époque de l'enseignement de notre auteur. Jean Ladrière, professor at the Catholic University of Louvain, developed a reflection on the distinction and relations between science and philosophy from the point of view of epistemology and ontology, i. e. from the point of view of truth. The article considers three of his texts, which span a 50-year period. The increasing influence of phenomenology on his reflection allows Ladrière to re-locate the dynamic of science in a fundamental project. The truths of science, and their historic relativity, are to be understood as belonging within the practice of science, while it is the task of philosophy to reflect on its meaning, by revealing its truth. The evolution of Ladrière's thought illustrates the evolution of the university of Louvain, which, from being a centre of the Thomism which was reinstated under Leo XIII, adopted a progressively more phenomenological orientation during our author's time as a teacher there.<br>

Abstract: Può la psicologia contribuire in qualche modo ad avvicinarsi alle domande fondamentali della vita? La psicologia potrebbe essere e di fatto è spesso vista ed utilizzata come tecnica. In realtà ogni psicologia porta in se stessa dei semi più o meno sviluppati di una antropologia, così come ogni antropologia non può non avere una componente pedagogico/psicologica. Senza pretese di completezza l'articolo suscita alcune domande circa la inevitabile integrazione tra gli aspetti psicologici e le dimensioni fondamentali dell'essere quali la verità da conoscere, il bene per cui impegnarsi e l'unità o armonia che si trova alla base delle motivazioni umane. Il tutto non riesce a sottrarsi alla dimensione/missione pedagogica ricordando che la questione più che sul 'che' o il 'se', è piuttosto sul 'Quale' o sul 'come'. Can psychology contribute in some way to the approach to the fundamental questions of life? Psychology can be and indeed often is seen and used as a technique. In reality, every psychology carries in itself the seeds, more or less developed, of an anthropology, just as every anthropology cannot but have a pedagogical/psychological component. Without claiming to be comprehensive, the article raises some questions concerning the unavoidable integration of psychological aspects with the fundamental dimensions of being, such as the truth to be known, the good to be worked for, and the unity or harmony found at the basis of human motivations. All this cannot disregard the pedagogical dimension/mission, recalling that the question is not 'what' or 'if' but rather 'which one' and 'how'.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917895<br>
Date: 9 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Ward Bruce K.<br>
Abstract: The contemporary philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, has characterized the dominant trend in modern interpretative thought as the 'school of suspicion', whose most significant 'masters' are Freud and Nietzsche. For them, to seek meaning—whether in a text, dream, discourse, or institution—is, first and foremost, to suspect 'truth as lying'. It is my contention that Ricoeur could well have named Dostoevsky as a third master of this modern school of interpretation, for he, too, was preoccupied with exploring the possibility of 'truth as lying', whether to others or to oneself. The general concern of my essay is to clarify Dostoevsky's relation to the modern 'hermeneutics of suspicion' in a manner which is mutually illuminating. The particular focus is on Dostoevsky's hermeneutics of suspicion as employed in The Brothers Karamazov, especially with the object of deciphering the avowed 'love of humanity' which motivates Ivan Karamazov's famous 'rebellion' against God. Ivan's humanism is highly ambiguous, as his words and actions (of omission and commission) throughout the novel demonstrate. I attempt to show that the ambiguity of Ivan Karamazov can be illumined as an exercise of suspicion on Dostoevsky's part which distinguishes between the manifest sources of Ivan's moral stance and what is in reality its hidden basis. And, in order to situate Dostoevsky in relation to the modern 'school of suspicion', his interpretation of the ambiguous text of modern humanism is compared with that of Nietzsche. The dialogue which the essay sets up between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky on the problem embodied by Ivan Karamazov reveals areas of convergence and divergence: the former apparent in a shared suspicion of a secular humanism which affirms the love of humanity apart from religious faith; and the latter apparent in their different understandings of love—whether of humanity or of God. The comparison between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, then, highlights the distinction between a hermeneutics of sus~<br>

Author(s): Ward Graham<br>
Abstract: The correlation of narrative and ethics has a long history in literature, and frequently ethics has been associated with a transcendental notion of truth. The recent attention to narrative and theology has offered more theoretical reflections of both poetic and hermeneutical practices that return us to the earliest literary, philosophical and theological productions. In this essay, I wish to present a different way of examining the correlation of narrative and ethics; one less orientated towards Scripture and less concerned with the Church. The narratives I consider are secular fictions from the modernist period. Through examining these works phenomenologically and the role the imagination plays in the production of beliefs, I argue that all narratives structure emotions, desires and hopes and this structuring continually opens up a transcendent horizon.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i24021505<br>
Date: 10 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Ungureanu Camil<br>
Abstract: Bourdieu and Derrida share a focus on the ambiguity of the practice of gift relationships already pointed out by Mauss. From Bourdieu's perspective, the question of gratuity is epistemically futile, as it veils the objective truth of gift-giving, yet ethically and politically relevant, as it refers to a hypocrisy which can be instrumental to enhancing civic virtue and solidarity. Bourdieu's "scientific humanism," however, implausibly reduces this ambiguity to interest maximization, and aims to build a solidaristic democracy by means of the generalization of the hypocrisy of gratuity. In turn, by interpreting gratuity as "unconditionality," Derrida aims not at dissolving, but at dramatizing the ambiguity of gift relationships by turning it into "madness" and an "impossible possibility". Whereas I agree with Derrida's insistence on the salience of the requirement of gratuity, his approach can lead to counterintuitive and hubristic consequences. Instead, I suggest some elements of an alternative way of understanding gratuitous gifts as communicative acts irreducible to an economic calculation or circle. From this standpoint, a gratuitous gift can be constituted by certain forms of recognition, emotions, or convictions without for that becoming an "impossibility".<br>

Abstract: Faith is characterized by an unsolvable problem of justification. While St. Paul concludes the truth of the faith from the practice (cf. 1. Thess 2,13), the Evangelists quote Jesus Christ as important witness (cf. Mk 1,1–3), who bears witness to himself in a decisive moment (cf. Joh 8,12–20). Who legitimates the omniscient narrator of these christological confessions? By means of Genette's narrative theory and the hermeneutic theories of Bultmann and Fuchs, the specific demand which faith puts onto the human being, becomes apparent: the auctorial narrative form frees the fundamental narrations of faith from any kind of human justification, thus marking the special credibility which is inherent to listening to God's words.<br>

Abstract: L'apport de l'œuvre de Paul Ricœur est fondamental pour la pratique historienne d'aujourd'hui. Depuis la fin du XIXe siècle, les historiens s'étaient dotés, en se professionnalisant, d'une méthode. Grâce à Paul Ricœur, ils peuvent désormais accéder à une dimension épistémologqiue et mieux comprendre les catégories qui leur sont familières comme celle de temps, de vérité, de causalité ou de sujet. Cet article entend montrer en quoi notamment trois thématiques classiques de l'historien que sont l'événement, la mémoire et la biographie trouvent un éclairage particulièrement enrichissant chez Paul Ricœur et s'en trouvent très sensiblement renouvelées. Paul Ricœur's work has made a fundamental contribution to the contemporary practice of history. Since the end of the 19th century historians had become more professional and had defined an historical method. Thanks to Paul Ricœur, they are now able to achieve an epistemological dimension and to understand better familiar categories such as time, truth, causality or subject. This article seeks to show how three classic historical themes in particular, namely event, memory and biography, are illuminated in a singularly enriching fashion in the work of Paul Ricœur and are very perceptibly renewed by him. Auch für die heutige Geschichtswissenschaft erweist sich Paul Ricœurs philosophisches Œuvre als grundlegend. Im Zuge ihres Professionalisierungsprozesses hatte die historische Zunft gegen Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts nach einer einheitlichen Methode gestrebt. Über das Werk Paul Ricœurs findet sie nun Zugang zur wissenschaftstheoretischen Dimension. Ziel des Aufsatzes ist es, aufzuzeigen, wie drei für den Historiker entscheidende Fragen – nämlich die des Ereignisses, des Gedächtnisses und der Biographie – bei Ricœur einer neuen Behandlung unterzogen wurden.<br>

Author(s): Blum Paul Richard<br>
Abstract: The philosopher as the tormented individual trying to grasp the truth is the topic of Giordano Bruno's Eroici furori. This paper offers a reading that assumes that Ignatius of Loyola's Spiritual Exercises were part of its cultural background. Both texts have some features in common: the individual struggles for contemplation of the absolute; the strife is a circular movement within the human condition; Ignatius and Bruno suggest to employ the lower realms of reality and the lower faculties of the soul for the sake of their overcoming in truth. Consequently, dialogue, imagery, and emblematic contraptions of multiple senses are specifically apt to educate the individual. Bruno addresses systematically the epistemological and metaphysical problems that accompany the Exercises.<br>

Abstract: In this essay, I argue that Penelope Fitzgerald's The Gate of Angels attempts to work out the difficulties that any intelligent, religiously inclined person must come to terms with in the twentieth, now twentieth-first, century. Fitzgerald sought not to shelter her religious belief behind a cloister wall, thinking like her uncle the Reverend Wilfred Knox, "that no cloister walls can be high enough to exclude the cares of the world." Among these cares is the desire to give a faithful report of the world to each other, to know this world as it exists in truth, and not to misrepresent it. Early twentieth-century investigations into the makeup of the physical world as well as the theoretical and intellectual advances possible with quantum physics were very much part of this desire; and in The Gate of Angels, set in and around Cambridge University's pre-war physics laboratories, Fitzgerald offers a beautiful rendering of the excitement engendered by these investigations. At the same time, Fitzgerald offers a picture, true to her own experience, wherein things that in the popular mind are often conceived of as opposite and irreconcilable—for instance, chance and necessity—are found to stand in a relation of sympathy, casting over The Gate of Angels "that sympathetic glow which," Henry James wrote, "forms half the substance of our genial impressions."<br>

Abstract: Having a voice, either at the level of the individual or the community, has been one of the atavistic ways of defining or asserting humanity. This allows for the inscription of the twin-capped hegemony of successes or victories and frustrations at both the private locus and the public sphere. The disruptions of this possibility by rifts between natives in pre-colonial South Africa were aggravated in the heat of the colonial suppression it suffered, and was compounded by the operation of apartheid rule. By reason of this misrule, voices were suppressed, with a few cacophonies of dissention breaking forth. The culmination of these disenchantments into the demise of apartheid significantly presaged the need for reconstruction and redefinition of citizenship and cohabitation, and hence the necessity for establishing a public sphere, or put alternatively, a public domain in the form of the Archbishop Desmond Tutu's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This paper, therefore, seeks to interrogate the dramatic world(s) created using the material properties of the TRC in John Kani's Nothing but the Truth and Zakes Mda's The Bells of Amersfoort. The paper argues that the domination and manipulation of this public realm by the state at the expense of the individual is not only counterproductive, but constitutes a denial of the relevance of such spheres. The paper, going by indices in the plays, therefore, concludes that every individual should not only be: given a voice, and be heard, but be allowed equal unbiased participation. Otherwise, the public sphere would not just be impotent, but the idea of nation-building and desirable citizenship would be a mere ruse. Avoir une voix, que ce soit au niveau individuel ou communautaire, a été l'un des moyens ataviques de définition et d'affirmation de l'humanité. Cela tient compte de l'inscription de l'hégémonie à double face des succés ou victoires et des frustrations tant au niveau de l'espace privé que de la sphère publique. Les pa~<br>

Publisher: Wiley Periodicals, Inc.<br>
Issue: i24542986<br>
Date: 10 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Grethlein Jonas<br>
Abstract: This book examines Greek engagements with the past as articulations of memory formulated against the contingency of chance associated with temporality. Based on a phenomenological understanding of temporality, it identifies four memorializing strategies: continuity (tradition), regularity (exemplarity), development, and acceptance of chance. This framework serves in pursuing a twofold aim: to reconstruct the literary field of memory in fifth-century BCE Greece; and to interpret Greek historiography as a memorializing mode. The key contention advanced by this approach is that acts of memory entailed an "idea of history" that was articulated not only in historiography, but also in epinician poetry, elegy, tragedy, and oratory. The book offers a rich account of poetic conventions and contexts through which each of these genres counterbalanced contingency through the use of exemplary and traditional modes of memory. This fine analysis highlights the grip of the present on the past as a significant feature of both historiographical and nonhistoriographical genres. The essay argues that this work fills a disciplinary gap by extending the reflection on memory to a new period, Greek antiquity. The retrospective positioning of this period at the outset of Western historical thought brings Grethlein's investigation to the center of debates about memory, temporality, and the meaning history. In engaging with the book's argument, the essay suggests that historiographical memory emerged in Greece not as a first-order encounter with time, but as a second-order encounter with forgetting. This confrontation marked a certain separation of historiography from other memorializing genres. Whereas poetic and rhetorical memories were posited against contingency, historiography sought to retrieve those aspects of the past that may otherwise have been irretrievably lost and forgotten. In doing so, it formulated the historiographical imperative as a negation of forgetting that problematized~<br>

Publisher: University of Tulsa<br>
Issue: i24598607<br>
Date: 7 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Bruns Gerald L.<br>
Abstract: The basic unit of Joyce's fiction is, arguably, the encounter, a reminder of the Dubliners story of that name. This essay explores the many occasions of self-encounter, as when Joyce's characters see themselves in mirrors, in the eyes of others, or in the guise of someone other than they are or appear to be: when Gerty MacDowell projects her "Lady Bountiful" self onto Bloom's erotic gaze, for instance. The regulating idea here (as in Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception) is that we perceive ourselves through our bodies, but this perception is not an empirical mirror-image; it is an image mediated (and thus transformed) by an array of intentions, memories, desires, and ongoing experiences of ourselves and others, including our experiences of how others see us (something to which Stephen is particularly subject). Joyce's mirror-experiences range from ironic unmasking—"The Dead"—to phantasmagorias—the "Circe" episode of Ulysses, where no image is unreal, and every misnomer (like "Henry Flower") has its moment of truth.<br>

Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers, Inc.<br>
Issue: i24649492<br>
Date: 1 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): WATSON STEPHEN H.<br>
Abstract: Paul Klee's art found broad impact upon philosophers of varying commitments, including Hans-Georg Gadamer. Moreover, Klee himself was not only one of the most important artists of aesthetic modernism but one of its leading theoreticians, and much in his work, as in Gadamer's, originated in post-Kantian literary theory's explications of symbol and allegory. Indeed at one point in Truth and Method, Gadamer associates his project for a general "theory of hermeneutic experience" not only with Goethe's metaphysical account of the symbolic but equally with a "rehabilitation" of allegory. In this paper, I examine this position and Gadamer's own use of it in his analysis of Klee's work, contrasting it with that of Walter Benjamin's account of allegory, equally indebted to Goethe and this archive. Finally, I contrast the resulting interpretations of Klee, discussing the implications that evolve for understanding both Gadamer and Benjamin—but equally for understanding Klee's work and, provisionally, the work of art, thus construed, for philosophy.<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>

Date: 1 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Tengelyi László<br>
Abstract: Truth is attributed by hermeneutical phenomenology not only to science but also to art and literature. According to Ricoeur, its veritable bearer is the expression of experience that can take artistic and literary forms as well as scientific ones. However, truth in this sense cannot be defined as a correspondence with a ready-made reality, nor can it be reduced to any internal coherence in our knowledge of the world. What is, then, its precise meaning in this context? The two terms mentioned in the title—'redescription' and 'refiguration' of reality—indicate the two answers Ricoeur gives to this question. The similarities and the differences between these two answers are submitted to an inquiry in the following paper, which, relying upon Ricoeur, adumbrates the outlines of a phenomenological and hermeneutical approach to truth.<br>

Publisher: Presses de Sciences Po<br>
Issue: i24672910<br>

Author(s): Mazurel Hervé<br>
Abstract: L'histoire des sensibilités suscite encore une méfiance persistante, avant tout parce que son projet intellectuel demeure mal identifié, parce que l'historiographie a souvent laissé penser que ses origines s'ancraient uniquement dans la continuité du projet de Lucien Febvre et de l'histoire des mentalités à la française. Or, en vérité, celle-ci n'est autre que la traduction historiographique d'un mouvement philosophique beaucoup plus ample et ancien, né du basculement incarné par Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche et Sigmund Freud, ces penseurs du soupçon, qui nous ont appris à repérer derrière les idées, la raison et la conscience, le rôle des désirs et des appétits, le jeu des pulsions et des sentiments. Rendant ainsi l'homme moins transparent à luimême, l'historien du sensible vise, outre à restituer l'historicité de notre vie sensible, à réévaluer la part des affects dans la détermination des conduites humaines. Pour ce faire, il s'appuie également sur la riche nébuleuse des savoirs critiques élaborés ensuite, dans l'Allemagne de la première moitié du 20e siècle, sous les appellations de « psychologie sociale » ou « historique » ou, à la manière nietzschéenne, de « psychologie des profondeurs ». The history of sensibility still continues to elicit suspicion, first and foremost because this intellectual project remains poorly defined, historiography often having led us to believe that its roots stemmed solely from Lucien Febvre's endeavours and the French history of mentalities. And yet in truth, the history of sensibility is nothing less than the historiographical translation of a much broader and older philosophical movement, born of the tipping point provoked by Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. Those great sceptical thinkers taught us to unmask the role of desires, appetites and impulses behind our ideas, reason and consciousness. In addition to recreating the historicity of our lives of sensibility and thus rendering man less transparent to himse~<br>

Author(s): Seerveld Calvin<br>
Abstract: Scripture crédits its writing as well as the spoken word of Christ with life-bringing truth
requiring obedience; e.g., John 2:22. Romans 15:4, I Corinthians 10:11, Révélation 1:3).
The old Marcion heresy of pitting Spirit against Letter, appealing to II Corinthians 3:6,
mistakes the antithesis Paul wants to drive home in the episües. Because Christ is the
fulfillment of the Mosaic law rather than its abolishment (Matthew 5:17-20), our life is to be
a letter from Christ inscribed (επιστολή... εγγεγραμμένη) by the very spirit of the living
God (II Corinthians 3). The correct opposition Paul draws is that between an obedience
marked by Itteral circumcision or by circumclsion of the heart, a Spirit-humbled, holy
writings-directed life (cf. Romans 2:25-29, 10:5-13, II Timothy 3:14-17). Gottlob Schrenk's
exegesis is not wholly sound, I think, but the exposition is fine and complete on γράφω, in

Article Title: Hayden White: The Form of the Content<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Sternberg Nancy<br>
Abstract: Hayden White's perhaps richest and most profoundly argued book, The Content of the Form, touches many nerves in the American historical profession. The entirety of the book, from its premises through its most thoughtful exegeses of historical writing, insists that linguistic form is the primary carrier of content in historical writing, indeed, in historical knowledge. This insistence on a respectful and careful attention to the formal usages of nonfiction prose, truth-claiming language, goes well against the grain of American tastes. As de Tocqueville presciently and correctly predicted, when Americans take to literature in a serious way, they won't have much patience with precise matters of form. Hayden White's narrative theory has had uphill work to penetrate this pervasive indifference, especially among historians. He has been joined in recent decades by Paul Ricoeur, whose Time and Narrative, beginning from different premises and a slightly different question, arrives at a sympathetic and complementary analysis of historical narrative. In spite of White's published hesitations about the political/philosophical tendencies of Ricoeur's work, I am convinced that their books are mutually supporting and, in an important cultural sense, belong together. Altogether, however, I do feel that the main import and justification of this present essay must rest on my quite serious reading of Hayden White's best joke, a profound shaggy dog story about the historian monk of St. Gall.<br>

Article Title: Mixed Messages: The Heterogeneity of Historical Discourse<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Carr Steven G.<br>
Abstract: If, as many historians and theorists now believe, narrative is the form proper to historical explanation, this raises the problem of the terms in which such narratives are to be evaluated. Without a clear account of evaluation, the status of historical knowledge (both in itself and in all those social, political, and other contexts in which appeal to historical explanation is made) remains obscure. Beginning with the view, found in Hayden White and others, that historical narrative constitutes a meaning not reducible to the factual content it engages, this essay argues that such meaning can arise only through a synthesis of cognitive and normative discourses. Narrative combines "heterogeneous" language games in such a way that neither appeal to "truth content" nor to "justice" suffices to decide the question of which of two competing historical explanations is, as a whole, superior. Examining in critical detail the opposed positions on this issue articulated by two recent theorists-Frank Ankersmit ("narrative idealism") and David Carr ("narrative realism")-the paper concludes that the debate between those who hold that historical narratives should be judged in essentially cognitive terms and those who hold that they should be judged in essentially political terms cannot be resolved and that a philosophical view of historical narrative that is neither realist nor idealist needs to be developed.<br>

Abstract: Envisagée dans une perspective discursive et énonciative, l'opération historiographique se révèle être une mise en discours du passé et de son espace. En tant que configuration et représentation, elle se fonde sur différents types de mémoire individuelle et collective qu'elle configure par différents moyens discursifs et rhétoriques. Suffisamment compréhensive, elle contribue à l'institution de régimes et de logiques de spatio-temporalité qui, eux-mêmes marqués dans le temps et dans l'espace, correspondent à des régimes de vérité pratique, ayant une efficacité discursive dans le présent. Éloignées dans l'espace et dans le temps comme c'est le cas pour la Grèce antique ou plus proches de nous, ces opérations d'" historiopoiésis " reposent sur des approches anthropologiques. /// From the discursive perspective of speech acts, the writing of history turns out to be the working out of a discourse about the past and its space. As a configuration and representation, it has grounds in various types of individual and collective memories that it configures using diverse discursive and rhetorical means. Sufficiently comprehensive, it helps institute spatiotemporal systems and "logics" that, with markers of time and space, correspond to systems of practical truth with discursive effectiveness in the present. Whether remote in space and time (as in the case of Ancient Greece) or close to us, these "historiopoiesis" operations rely on anthropological approaches.<br>

Author(s): Buzzoni Marco<br>
Abstract: Hermeneutic and anti-hermeneutic sides in the debate about psychoanalysis are entangled in an epistemological and methodological antinomy, here exemplified by Grünbaum's and Spence's paradigmatic views. Both contain a partial element of truth, which they assert dialectically one against the other (§§ 1 and 2). This antinomy disappers only by reconciling an operationalist approach with man's ability to suspend the effectiveness of the 'laws' applied to him (§ 3). The hermeneutic way in which the technical-operational criterion of truth works in psychoanalysis demands that clinical and extra-clinical testing methods work synergically, through a fruitful self-correcting strategy, grounded on the very psychoanalytic object: the unconscious (§ 4).<br>

Abstract: The trial of Adolf Eichmann, in 1961, is generally considered a turning point in the history of Holocaust memory because it brought the Holocaust into the public sphere for the first time as a discrete event on an international scale. In the same year, Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin's film Chronicle of a Summer appeared in France. While absent from scholarship on memory of the Nazi genocide for over forty years, Chronicle of a Summer contains a scene of Holocaust testimony that suggests the need to look beyond the Eichmann trial for alternative articulations of public Holocaust remembrance. This essay considers the juxtaposition in Chronicle of a Summer of Holocaust memory and the history of decolonization in order to rethink the "unique" place that the Holocaust has come to hold in discourses on extreme violence. The essay argues that a discourse of truth and testimony arose in French resistance to the Algerian war that shaped and was shaped by memory of the Nazi genocide.<br>

Abstract: This article looks at the continuing social crisis of documentary image culture, in the light of both the political demise of a left-bloc of social forces, which historically has underwritten its critical ideals from the 1920s to the late 1980s, and the continued expansion of the 'non-symbolic' forces (Vilém Flusser) of mass culture — the de-politicization of the public sphere through the circulation of a range of narrow and circumscribed (generic) images. In this I take seriously the notion that documentary photography is subject to an increasing 'lateness' in its effects (that is, in terms of its effective representation of the social world and of access to distribution). However, this sense of documentary photography as existing after-the-event does not mean we should mourn the loss or photography's active relationship to the 'event'. This is because the documentary ideal of the 1920s and 1930s had no privileged access to 'photographic truth', just as it was in no greater position of autonomy within the political economy of photography than it is now. Rather, what distinguished documentary photography during its modernist heyday was a partisan political confidence in its ideals and aims. It is this that is missing today. Thus, once we look at the history of documentary practice as a set of subordinate practices culturally, we can than avoid all the historicist pitfalls of assuming this is the 'worst of all times' and begin to rethink the political and theoretical parameters of documentary practice. As such, this article addresses why, in this present period, we need an adequate politics of 'lateness'.<br>

Abstract: Los historiadores porfían en encontrar la verdad y defender la libertad de interpretarla. Las diversas «verdades» conllevan la construcción permanente de la historia, para lo cual nos vemos en la necesidad de insistir en la inagotable búsqueda de los rastros y restos del pasado. Tanto historiadores como historiados, se encuentran en la misma condición de recordar acompañados. Ello nos compele a saber escuchar para entender las formas de olvido y contribuir a que la memoria aflore y estimule el ejercicio mnemotécnico. Como advertía Frances Yates, la memoria es un arte, y por tanto, el historiador asume que frente al el proceso destructor del olvido, la historia logra reconstruirse, siempre y cuando exista una memoria que perviva. Historians insist on finding truth and defending the freedom to interpret it. The different «truths» entail the permanent building of history, to which end we need to keep endlessly on looking for traces and remains of the past. Historians, as well as their subjects, find themselves in the situation of remembering accompanied. This compels us to know how to listen to forms of oblivion and to contribute to bring memory to the surface and stimulate the mnemonic exercise. As Frances Yeats warned, memory is an art, and therefore the historian assumes that, before the destructive process of oblivion, history achieves its reconstruction as long as there is a memory surviving.<br>

Abstract: In the context of the family’s crisis, in addition to the marital failures that produce suffering and inconvenience, there are biases due to controversies, ideological interests and opinions, which originate general and simplistic solutions to complex problems with peculiar characteristics. The article, – according to the commitment of the Holy Father Francisco to mitigate the heavy burden of people in “irregular” unions (where situations of fragility or misery improve stigma of exclusion) – try demonstrate the continuity of the Magisterium Pontifical Council, in which
         Amoris Laetitiaand the reform of the canonical matrimonial process were inserted. Through the study of the answers and the search for solutions that are careful to the hierarchy of truths, the Holy Father pointed out: “to generate personal and personalized processes”; to follow paths of reflection and discreet understanding the conditions of each case; ultimately, to help progress guided by a logic of forgiveness and reconciliation, according to a merciful and encouraging pastoral care. Sacraments and consciences, both sacred, require to be served with truth.<br>

Publisher: BELIN<br>
Issue: e26213697<br>
Date: 3 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Debarbieux Bernard<br>
Abstract: French-speaking academic literature makes abundant use of the notions of anchoring and rootedness when dealing with dwelling and residential practices. Though the metaphoric origin of these notions can be evoked, and even exploited by the authors, it is generally glossed over. This article seeks to revive the metaphorical dimension of these terms by adding two others – mooring and docking. Our goal is twofold. First, we demonstrate that by taking the terms seriously, it is possible to have them designate different types of relationships to place, which directly use underlying images. Second, we discuss how these images participate in the poetics of knowledge that distills the effects of truth, whose motivations must be sought out in the major epistemological options that have been adopted.<br>

Abstract: By historicism I do not mean the belief in the inevitable laws of history or anything of
this crassly Popperian kind, merely the relativistic point that values and beliefs change
through time; i.e. that there is no independent conception of truth or value that is 'outside'
historically generated norms or assumptions.<br>

Abstract: We have mentionned above (p. 91)Murakami's emphasis on Suchness. The fact that he
considered the various expressions of the Buddhist “Absolute” as equivalent is demonstrated
in his article for the inaugural issue of the periodical Bukkyô maisM shinbun 仏教毎週新聞，
where he lists "Suchness (tathata), Dharma-nature, Nirvana, the ultimate truth (daiichigitai 第
一義諦)，the original face, Mahâvairocana, and Amida" as different names for the same inex-
pressible reality (Murakami 1901).<br>

Abstract: Este ensaio pretende estabelecer correlações entre Literatura, História e História da Literatura do ângulo da Estética Expectacional. Essa posição desloca o tradicional enfoque da literatura da perspectiva da produção para a da recepção, extraindo da obra literária uma abundância de sentimentos em harmonia com as expectativas de cada período, de cada grupo social, de cada nível cultural, tornando-a, assim, uma estrutura móvel, capaz de valer em diferentes contextos e de dar respostas diversas, conforme a demanda de verdade estética. Com isto, a História da Literatura tem condições de incorporar a marcha das ondas inovadoras no percurso da prática textual em dada sociedade, assim como reter, para cada época, as qualificações do horizonte de expectativa, que tornam instantâneas todas as épocas pregressas do fazer literário. /// This essay tries to establish correlations between Literature, History and History of Literature as viewed by Expectational aesthetics. Such a view shifts the traditional approach of literature from production to reception, extracting from the literary work a profusion of feelings in harmony with the prospect of each period, of each social group, of each cultural level. This makes it a movable structure capable of functioning in different contexts and of providing several answers, according to the demand of aesthetic truth. Thanks to this, the History of Literature is capable of incorporating the shifts of innovative waves in the trend to textual practice in a certain society, as well as retain, for each age, the qualifications of the horizon of expectation. This turns all the previous ages of literary making momentary.<br>

Author(s): Derrida Peter W.<br>
Abstract: Margaret W. Ferguson observes: "Augustine is haunted by the parallel between the nature
of language and the nature of man 'lost in our present sad dispersal.' His analysis of language as a
sequence of parts is in many ways a forerunner of Derrida's discussions of language as a 'play of
differences' that necessarily ruptures any concept of truth as a totality. Unlike modern theorists, how-
ever, when faced with the contradictions between a philosophy of essence and a linguistics of difference,
Augustine chooses to relinquish language rather than God" (p. 845).<br>

Article Title: Advocacy and Scholarship<br>
Publisher: School of Law, University of California, Berkeley<br>
Issue: i276945<br>
Date: 7 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Yeats Paul F.<br>
Abstract: The apex of American legal thought is embodied in two types of writings: the federal appellate opinion and the law review article. In this Article, the author criticizes the whole enterprise of doctrinal constitutional law scholarship, using a recent U.S. Supreme Court case and a Harvard Law Review article as quintessential examples of the dominant genre. In a rhetorical tour de force, the author argues that most of modern constitutional scholarship is really advocacy in the guise of scholarship. Such an approach to legal scholarship may have some merit as a strategic move towards a political end; however, it has little value as scholarship, the goal of which is to seek truth. As a formerly monolithic legal system becomes more culturally heterogeneous, judges and academics no longer share as many assumptions about social truth. Hence, they have an increasing need to mask political judgments in order to avoid the contentious political battles that this increased diversity produces. Legal academia's present obsession with defending constitutional law as something more than an ad hoc rationalization of what are essentially political choices suggests that the present genre of constitutional scholarship may well have outlived its usefulness as a discursive form.<br>

Author(s): Young Carole<br>
Abstract: Narratives of the Tibetan resistance army are not a part of national history in the Tibetan exile community. Drawing on stories by veterans of the resistance to the Chinese invasion and the explanations they give of its absence in Tibetan national history, I argue that this history has been "arrested" because of the challenges it poses to normative versions of history and community and, in turn, to internal and external representations of Tibet. This practice signifies the postponing of narrating certain histories until a time in the future when the dangers they pose to sustaining a unified Tibetan community in exile has receded. This practice of historical (un)production offers insight into temporality and subjectivity, plural identities in the face of national hegemony, and why history might be considered a combination of truth, fear, and lies.<br>

Publisher: Presses de la Fondation nationale des sciences politiques<br>
Issue: i290825<br>

Author(s): Levi Jean-Pierre<br>
Abstract: Le "devoir de mémoire" a déjà une histoire sociale et le débat entre mémoire et histoire a pris une telle force médiatique et scientifique que l'un et l'autre ne peuvent pas être ignorés à l'école, et d'abord au collège et au lycée. Leur exposé est certes, aujourd'hui, de précieux secours pédagogique et civique. Mais il s'agit aussi de ne pas instrumentaliser l'histoire; de ne pas faire des jeunes de nouveaux "témoins"; de ne sacraliser aucun "devoir de mémoire". Dire la mémoire en classe devrait aider, au contraire, à produire du sens, à privilégier l'intelligence sur le souvenir, à affirmer des vérités encore plus probantes: à mieux connaître et apprendre de l'histoire, par conséquent, pour armer au passage tous les nouveaux citoyens. En France comme dans bien d'autres pays, le débat entre histoire et mémoire traverse aussi l'école, et surtout le collège et le lycée. Il ne s'agit pas de refuser à la mémoire, portée par les témoins, son statut déjà acquis de bon auxiliaire pédagogique. Mais l'enseignement de l'histoire doit produire du sens et rester au service d'une vérité toujours mieux élaborée. C'est à ce prix qu'il conservera sa force de conviction civique. /// In France as in many other countries, the debate between history and memory occurs in school also, especially in high school. There is no question of not giving memory, brought by witnesses, its already acquired status of good pedagogical aid. But teaching history must produce meaning and remain in the service of the truth, which has constantly to be better made. That is the price for its force of civic conviction.<br>

Article Title:  Le moment ricœur <br>
Publisher: Presses de la Fondation nationale des sciences politiques<br>
Issue: i290821<br>
Date: 3 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Ricœur François<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricœur l'affirmait presque clandestinement depuis un demi-siècle. Voilà qu'il le répète, hautement et avec de bien meilleures chances d'être entendu, dans un livre très important pour l'avenir. Oui, en histoire on peut tenter d'atteindre le vrai par l'écriture. Oui, raconter c'est déjà expliquer et maîtriser le temps. Oui, l'événement engendre lui-même du sens, la mémoire peut être heureuse, le passé palpite dans le temps présent. Ricœur donne (redonne?) ainsi espoir à l'historien, dont le travail "rend nos attentes plus déterminées et notre expérience plus indéterminée". François Dosse dit l'opportunité de ce "moment Ricœur". L'occasion est enfin offerte à la communauté historienne d'un vrai dialogue avec la philosophie grâce à la publication de l'ouvrage majeur de Paul Ricœur, La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli. Ce n'est pas la premiére fois que Ricœur tente ce dialogue avec les historiens puisque sa première intervention dans ce domaine remonte à un demi-siècle. Elle fut peu entendue en un temps, les années 1950, peu propice aux épistémologies métisses. Sa trilogie sur le temps parue entre 1983 et 1985, "Temps et récit" eut un peu plus d'échos, mais elle fut pour l'essentiel tenue en lisière, considérée comme œuvre pour philosophes. Cette fois, en ce "temps des doutes" et d'interrogation des historiens sur les notions qu'ils utilisent au quotidien dans leur pratique: la vérité, la causalité, la mémoire, le récit, le temps, le moment semble venu de prendre la dimension de l'apport de Ricœur à la discipline historique, d'autant qu'il a fait, avec la rigueur qu'on lui connaît, le détour par les travaux des historiens d'aujourd'hui, dont il est le lecteur attentif. /// Now is the moment for a real dialogue with philosophy with the historian community thanks to the publication of the major work of Paul Ricœur, La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli. This is not the first time that Ricœur has attempted this dialogue with historians since his first intervention in this area ~<br>

Abstract: The intent of this article is to explore the extent to which we can apply to Buddhist ethics Martha Nussbaum's statement that "[l]iterary form is not separable from philosophical content, but is itself, a part of content - an integral part, then, of the search for and the statement of truth" (Nussbaum 1990, 3). We explore the transformative impact that narratives can have on moral life, using examples from the story literature of Theravāda Buddhist traditions in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. Focusing on what Geoffrey Harpham has called "sub-ethics," the conditions that center moral life, we trace the ways in which narratives prefigure, configure, and refigure these conditions for human flourishing.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>

Author(s): Rees Geoffrey<br>
Abstract: Widely regarded as the most influential proponent of the truth of original sin in the twentieth century, Reinhold Niebuhr worked hard to excise any "literalistic" element from his interpretation of the doctrine. In his attempt to "correct" the Augustinian tradition on original sin by purging it of all "literalistic errors," however, Niebuhr assumed as his starting point the most characteristically modern objection to the doctrine: that birth is a thoroughly natural, animal, and morally meaningless event. As a result, Niebuhr unnecessarily constrained his vision of the dimensions of human freedom, and hence his description of the dynamic of anxiety and freedom that energizes sin. Through a careful reading of Reinhold Niebuhr's writings on original sin, in light of the truth that the end of human life is inseparable from its origins, a reappraisal and recovery of the meaningfulness of the assertion of original sin as a literal inheritance is possible. The result of such a reappraisal and recovery is an amplified insight into the existential anxiety that Niebuhr otherwise described so convincingly.<br>

Author(s): Epple Angelika<br>
Abstract: Reinhart Koselleck outlined a model of historical time in various essays most of them collected in the anthologies "Zeitschichten" and "Vergangene Zukunft". The article tries to reconstruct Koselleck's transcendental principals of history. It questions Koselleck's understanding of natural time and anthropological categories. According to Hans Georg Gadamer's criticism of Koselleck, the article argues that even Koselleck's anthropological categories are always already determined by culture and history. Historical time and historical truth are constructed by historical narrations. This conviction does not imply, however, the denial of historical reality. The author suggests combining Koselleck's categories "Erfahrungsraum" and "Erwartungshorizont" with a narratological point of view.<br>

Article Title: The Politics of Leo XIII's Opening of the Vatican Archives: The Ownership of the Past<br>
Publisher: Society of American Archivists<br>
Issue: i40011862<br>
Date: 12 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Tussing Nicholas J.<br>
Abstract: In 1881, Pope Leo XIII (1878-1903) opened to scholarly research the Vatican Archives, a repository of documents recording papal history from the Middle Ages. Two years later, his letter Saepenumero considerantes, confirmed the opening and his motu proprio of May 1884 gave further instructions. The opening was entwined with both the broader world of Italian politics and the smaller political sphere of the archives itself. The "macropolitical" context was the ecclesiastical controversy about the papacy's role in Italian history, which informed Leo XIII's decision to expand access to the archives. The micropolitical context concerns the management of the archives and the politics of access inside the Vatican. In his memoirs published posthumously in 1947, Protestant scholar Theodor Sickel² shows how bureaucratic power struggles and disagreements on extending access affected a scholar interested in historical research for its own sake. Despite Leo XIII's appreciation for Sickel's work, some of the pope's subordinates tried to hinder access to the documents, a disjunction between papal policy and its implementation. In part, these obstructions reflected the difficulty of translating a general policy into concrete terms; but they also revealed a clash within the Curia. This conflict informs both Leo XIII's letter and Sickel's memoirs. Leo XIII's letter equates truth with apologetics, or the defense of the Catholic Church:³ for Leo XIII, the archives embodied the Church's memory and therefore its identity. Sickel's memoirs, on the other hand, illustrate the politics of archives management.<br>

Publisher: Faculdade de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40014423<br>
Date: 3 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Renaud Michel<br>
Abstract: Este estudo dedica-se à teoria da verdade tal como se apresenta nas obras de Ricoeur entre 1947 e 1960. Procura-se sublinhar o vaivém entre uma compreensão ontológica da verdade, marcada antes de mais pelo pensamento de Karl Jaspers (1947), e uma compreensão fenomenológica da verdade centrada na teoria do juízo (1960). Contudo a análise da tensão entre a unidade do verdadeiro e a multiplicidade das filosofias permite elaborar o conceito de verdade como comunicação e de verdade como objecto de esperança. Procura-se então mostrar o fundamento desta esperança bem como a dimensão pela qual ela ultrapassa o universo da filsosofia. A conclusão sublinha que os desenvolvimentos ulteriores de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sobre a hermenêutica do símbolo, da metáfora e da narrativa ganham em serem relidos no horizonte das tensões do problema da verdade. /// Cette étude est consacrée à la théorie de la vérité telle qu'elle se présente dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur entre 1947 et 1960. On cherche à souligner le va-et-vient entre une compréhension ontologique de la vérité initielement influencée par la pensée de Karl Jaspers 1947, et une compréhension phénoménologique de la vérité centrée sur la théorie du jugement (1960). L'analyse de la tension entre l'unité du vrai et la multiplicité des philosophies débouche cependant sur le concept de vérité comme communication et comme object d'espérence. On cherche alors à montrer le fondement de cette espérance ainsi que la dimension par laquelle elle dépasse l'univers de la philosophie. La conclusion souligne que les développements ultérieurs de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sur l'herméneutique du symbole, de la métaphore et du récit ont tout à gagner à être replacés et relus à l'horizon des tensions du problème de la vérité. /// This study pays special attention to the theory of truth elaborated in Ricoeur's work from 1947 to 1960.

Date: 3 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Lourenço Menuel<br>
Abstract: It is here proposed the elimination of the concept of truth in analytical construction by substituting for it the concept of terminal evidence of an assertion. Terminal evidence is in turn explained in terms of anschauliche non-deterministic sequences and portions of finitist logic generated by these sequences are sketched both for statements without quantifiers and statements with first order quantifiers. Emphasis is given to the nature of negation and existence in the proposed elimination. /// Es wird vorgeschlagen, die Eliminierung des Wahrheitsbegriffes in der analytischen Konstruktion durch die Einsetzung des Begriffes der endgultigen Evidenz einer Aussage durchzufuhren. Bei der Einfuhrung von anschaulichen akausalen Folgen lasst sich der Begriff der endgultigen Evidenz erklaren und Teile der finiten Logik, die solche Folgen erzeugen, werden skizziert sowohl fur Aussagen ohne Quantoren als auch fur solche, bei denen nur Quantoren der ersten Stufe vorkommen. Die Natur der Negation und des Existenz-Begriffes ist insbesondere hervorgehoben. /// É proposto efectuar-se a eliminação do conceito de verdade na construção analitica pela introdução do conceito da evidência terminal de uma asserção. Com a introdução de sucessões não-deterministas é elucidado o conceito de evidência terminal e os fragmentos de lógica finitista que estas sucessões originam são esboçados quer para o caso de asserçães sem quantores quer para aquelas asserções em que só ocorrem quantores de 1.a ordem. A natureza da negação e do conceito da existência são especialmente destacados.<br>

Article Title: Classical Otherness: Critical Reflections on the Place of Philology in Gadamer's Hermeneutics<br>
Publisher: Faculdade de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40014488<br>
Date: 12 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Renaud François<br>
Abstract: Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics rests largely on the concept of the classical. According to Gadamer, the classical stands for the continuity and the truth claim of the tradition, as transmitted by the written word. The normative character of the classical is directed against the neutrality and relativism of historicism: understanding does not occur primarily through distancing or methodological reconstruction but through belongingness to, and participation in, the past. The article shows how, given the central importance of dialogue and otherness in Gadamer's theory, the philosopher does not seem to fully do justice to the critical intention of its own dialogical and philological dimensions. On the other hand, it shows also how Gadamer's hermeneutical practice, notably in his rehabilitation of Plato, stresses the learning from otherness more explicitly than does his own theory, thus correcting, as it were, the latter. The article aims, finally, at demonstrating how, by unduly emphasizing the continuity (and sameness) in the encounter between past and present, Gadamer's theory undermines the importance of reconstructing the otherness and specificity of the classical text. /// A hermenêutica filosófica de Gadamer, entendida como uma defesa das humanidades, assenta essencialmente sobre o conceito de clássico. Segundo Gadamer, o clássico representa a continuidade e a pretensão à verdade da tradição tal como nos é transmitida pela palavra escrita. O carácter normativo do clássico em Gadamer constitui assim uma resposta crítica à neutralidade e ao relativismo do historicismo: a compreensão não acontece primariamente graças a um processo de distanciação ou reconstrução metódica, mas sim pelo facto de, desde logo, reconhecermos que temos pertença activa no passado. O presente artigo demonstra como, dada a importância central do diálogo e da alteridade na teoria de Gadamer, ofilósofo acaba por não fazer inteiramente justiça à intenção crítica inerente à dimensão dialógi~<br>

Abstract: Las reflexiones filosófico-políticas de este ensayo discuten la idea de que la política se fundamenta en la mentira. En contra de esta creencia generalizada, el autor afirma que, si fuera el caso, ni la política ni la democracia serían posibles. Aún más: se postula que la política y la mentira son incompatibles. En el texto se abogan, entonces, por la verdad como fundamento de una cultura de transparencia en la democracia, que ciudadanos, políticos y funcionarios públicos —es decir, todos aquellos preocupados por el interés público— deben compartir y fomentar si es que no quieren poner en riesgo la salud de la república. La mentira como práctica diaria en la polis pone en peligro la transición a la democracia al socavar las bases de la solidaridad civil y de la constitución de un Estado de derecho. /// The philosophical-political considerations of this essay discuss the idea that politics is founded upon lying. Against this widespread belief, the author argues that, if this is true, neither politics nor democracy would be possible. Again, he states that politics and lying are incompatible. The text defends the idea that in a democracy truth is the foundation of a culture of transparency, which citizens, politicians, and officials, i.e., all those concerned with the public interest, must share and foster if they want to safeguard public well being. Lying as a daily practice in public life (polis) endangers democratic transitions by undermining the basis of civil solidarity and the rule of law.<br>

Abstract: L'article passe en revue certains emplois assumés du terme fiction et écarte la conception ultra-relativiste selon laquelle tout serait fiction puisque la vérité des faits est impossible à établir et que le langage, a fortiori tout récit, sont par nature fictionnels. Envisager par ailleurs l'acception large de la notion de fiction comme quelque chose de construit se révèle peu productif car tout texte, toute oeuvre, même celle qui vise à la neutralité documentaire, peut dès lors être qualifiée de fiction. La recherche de vérité(s) doit demeurer à l'horizon des efforts des scientifiques. À cet égard, il convient de considérer la fiction artistique comme la véritable fiction. Son cadre pragmatique est celui que l'on désigne par les expressions de « feintise ludique » ou de « feintise partagée ». Sur ce plan, la fiction se distingue du faux (du mensonge), de l'erreur (de l'illusion) et de l'hypothèse (de la théorie). Si elle se distingue des discours liés aux intentions scientifiques, la fiction artistique intéresse néanmoins, en tant qu'objet, les anthropologues : imagination artistique et imaginaire collectif entretiennent en effet des relations d'influences réciproques. The ultra-relativististic conception whereby everything is fiction is shunned. It claims that the truth of facts cannot be established and that language and even more so narratives are fictional by nature. A broader acceptation of fiction as something « constructed » turns out to be of little use since any text or writing – even one with the intention of documentary neutrality – falls under the label of fiction. The quest for truth(s) must remain a scientific pursuit. In this respect, « artistic fiction » should be considered to be genuine fiction. Phrases such as « shared » or « playful pretense » refer to its pragmatic framework. Fiction thus stands apart from falsehood (lies), error (illusions) and hypothesis (theories). Though distinct from scientific intentionality, artistic fiction is of intere~<br>

Abstract: L'article examine les conceptions de Foucault concernant l'histoire de la vérité, ainsi que les rapports entre la volonté de savoir, la volonté de vérité et les formes du pouvoir. Il rappelle comment les notions nietzschéennes de volonté de vérité et de volonté de puissance font place dans son oeuvre à la volonté de savoir comme instrument des rapports de domination. On examine ensuite comment la notion d'autorité, entendue à la fois au sens institutionnel et au sens discursif, peut permettre une sociologisation des approches traditionnelles de la vérité, élaborées par les philosophes. Comment la visée de vérité du discours s'est-elle combinée historiquement avec la volonté de savoir des institutions ? Y a-t-il différents régimes de vérité, liés à des modalités de discours différentes, mais aussi à des formes d'autorité institutionnelle ? Est-il possible de construire une généalogie des figures de l'autorité discursive ? The paper examines Foucaultian views about the history of truth, as well as the relationships between the will to truth and the different forms of power. It reminds how Nietzsche's conceptions about the will to truth and the will to power are replaced in Foucault's work by the will to truth as a means of power relationships. The paper looks furthermore at the possibility of using the notion of authority, understood both in the institutional and in the discursive sense, as a tool for a sociologization of traditional approaches to truth, constructed by philosophers. How did the pursuit of truth historically combine with the will to knowledge belonging to the institutions ? Are there different regimes of truth, tied to different discursive modalities, as well as to institutional forms of authority ? Is it possible to construct a genealogy of figures of discursive authority ?<br>

Abstract: Pre-colonial histories in Southeast Asia are generally dependent on a very limited number of written sources. Most information originates from the elites among dominant ethnic groups or Westerners. These centralized histories are frequently uncritically treated as the 'truth.' This is especially true in countries like Laos, where historical documents are rare. But different versions of widely accepted histories also exist, and these often-contested histories remain prominent in the minds of people from different ethnic groups. This paper demonstrates the contested nature of history in Laos and the importance of ethnicity in social memory, using a well-known historical event that occurred in southern Laos— the Ay Sa Rebellion of the early nineteenth century. Lao, Siamese, and Western versions of the history of this rebellion are reviewed, followed by oral histories obtained from ethnic Brao people who maintain memories of the events that transpired. I hope to demonstrate the importance of considering ethnicity in relation to histories, and to encourage others to investigate alternative versions of histories in Laos.<br>

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: To see, to speak, to think : these are the three main topics of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, tragically interrupted in 1961. He intended to write two works on The Origin of Truth. To understand the relationship between Merleau-Ponty I and Merleau-Ponty II it is a good lead to pay attention to the relationship between seeing, speaking and thinking. In a central passage of Phenomenology of Perception (p. 451) this relationship is called Fundierung. Merleau-Ponty conceives it as a two way relationship, which excludes every possibility of reducing one term (thinking, reason) to another (perception, language). Yet, at that time he is not able to point out clearly the originality of thinking. L'Oeil et l'Esprit and Le Visible et l'Invisible provide a first outline of l'Origine de la Vérité. The 'second' Merleau-Ponty wants to 'reassume' his whole philosophy in what he calls : fundamental thinking. Painting opens the way to the mystery of seeing : something visible begins to see. Subject and object are no longer opposed to one another ; not even related by intentionality. The new key-word is Ineinander (interrelatedness, to be in one another, chiasm). 'La chair' (the flesh) is a new notion, broader and more fundamental than the body. The sensible reflects upon itself. This 're-flection' (reflexivity or reversibility) is a work of Being. The visible can be seen in principle. Philosophy should accompany the coming-to-see of the visible. In this perspective the transition to thinking (or ideality) must be seen as a new case of 'reversibilité'. The generality of the visible opens up to the 'invisible', that which in principle cannot be seen, but is 'the other side' of the visible. The basic phenomenon of expression is central here. Language is not an absolute starting point. Language is rather a new and more subtile form of coporeity, a new instance of the same basic reversibility, which already contains the seeds of ideality (logos endiathetor). The idea is of the word (logos ~<br>

Abstract: What do historians do when they interpretate the past ? Narrativists hold that they organize factual statements into a meaningful whole, the story, which itself has nothing to do with past reality. Others, like David Carr and Paul Ricoeur, defend a relation between the narrative whole and the experience of time. An altogether different approach to the question of the unity of history is that of Johan Huizinga. Huizinga does not place the meaningful unity of history in the text, but in the aesthetic conception of the past. The past is not like a reservoir of signs, which acquire meaning by being put in a self-invented order, nor is it a story-like structure which can be interpretated and translated like a text. History is a cultural reality which we experience as full of symbolic meaning. Interpretation is the search ofthat meaning. The centre of historical conciousness is not in the story, but in the mental imageswe create when we see historical objects, search through documents or read a historians interpretation. In this article I try to clarify Huizinga's concept of the „historische sensatie“ by relating Huizinga's ideas to those of the Dutch writer Lodewijk van Deyssel. Secondly I try to show how the imagination of the (past) world can be regarded as a fundamental form of truth by confronting Huizinga's ideas with those of the philosopher Martin Heidegger and artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Vincent van Gogh.<br>

Abstract: What emerges as the overarching theme in the extensive work of the Dutch philosopher Cornelis Verhoeven (1928-2001) is our relationship to reality. Being appealed to by thousands of things in our existence makes us realize that we cannot avoid reality. The most meaningful forms of reality are symbols, which lead us, through radical astonishment and contemplation to the metaphysical insight that something exists rather than nothing. This renders Verhoeven sceptical as the weakness of our ability to know and understand hampers our vision of hard reality, and also ironical because so many forms of speaking and writing display a reality which is being taken for granted. Thinking symbolically, metaphysical reflection and scepsis towards thoughdess assumptions are the instruments of a contemplation which, in Verhoeven's work, leave room for the lyrical prevalence of reality. In his later writings he gradually and more insistently draws attention to the theme of truth, while at the same time not denying our epistemological incapacity towards understanding and explaining reality.<br>

Abstract: Ever since Plato the identity of philosophy has been at issue in the quarrel between philosophy and poetry. Can changing times alter the identity of philosophy, and simultaneously the identity of poetry? In the Republic poetry is a third rate illusion compared with contemplation of "the things that truly are". We can trace the background of this disqualification when we distinguish three levels in the relation of language to reality. 1. We can distinguish assertion, melody and rhythm. The first is the same in poetry and prose, the last is superfluous. 2. Speech is superior to writing in virtue of the speaker's inner mastery over himself. 3. The interiorizing move culminates in the soundless conversation of the soul with itself, contemplating the eternal identical "without the stain of speech or sign" (Boutens). For Plato, then, we move from poetry to prose, from prose to speech, from speech to silence. Is there room for aesthetics in this view? In the second part of my lecture I reconstruct Symbolism, a current in literature that in every respect is the opposite of Platonism. Although the goal is the same — the search for true reality — the difference is that the route is now reversed. I restrict myself to the French branch. 4. Baudelaire formulated the basic principle of Symbolism: the ineffable does not exist. "The ultimate goal of the universe is to be expressed" (Valéry). The same worldview is expressed later by Gadamer: an ontology "guided by language". 5. The second principle is that the primary language is script, "Book" (Mallarmé). 6. Poetry proves to be the true language. The music (rhyme, rhytm, tune) reveals the things "exactly as they are" (Wallace Stevens). In poetry the linguistic sign becomes a symbol because the sound, the physical aspect of the linguistic sign, plays a role in the production of meaning. A poem is a "sustained hesitation between sense and sound" (Valéry). Is sound not however a disturbing factor in revealing the things 'as they are'?~<br>

Abstract: When Nietzsche is called a radical philosopher, it is (among other reasons) because he questions (or at least claims to call into question) what other thinkers take for granted. In the article I concentrate on the way in which Nietzsche asks his questions, and how his questions (and the vocabulary which he uses to express his questions) develop through his writings. This development can be summarized with the help of a comparison between the orginal preface to the Birth of Tragedy (1872) and the new preface for the edition of 1886: it is a development from only a few and mainly rhetorical questions to a great number of intricate questions that often are selfreferential and call the questioner himself into question. The article points out how Nietzsche gradually discovers his proper question and how this search reaches it climax around 1886. This proper question turns out to be a practical or existential one: "To what extent can truth endure incorporation?" (Gay Science p. 110)<br>

Abstract: Depuis un demi-siècle d'importantes mutations sont intervenues dans l'exercice du métier d'historien, dues notamment à la pression d'une demande sociale forte, à une médiatisation galopante dans la communication du savoir, à la nécessité de procéder à l'historisation d'une mémoire déferlante. Mais deux pièges épistémologiques guettent : d'un côté, le retour d'une forme de positivisme appauvrissant et simplificateur ; de l'autre, l'abolition, sous l'influence des thèses postmodernistes, de la ligne de partage entre histoire et fiction. Si l'on veut fonder solidement et rationnellement la responsabilité, scientifique, sociale et morale, de l'historien, sans retomber dans une approche moralisante ni verser dans une neutralité abstraite et sans vie, il convient, d'abord, de rappeler en permanence que la première mission de l'historien est une mission de vérité, en second lieu de marquer avec force qu'il existe un lien congénital entre histoire et valeurs. The transformations in the practice of the historian's craft, which are a definite feature of our times, proceed, among other causes, from the pressure of social demand, from the new role taken by the medias in the communications of knowledge, from the need of historicizing critically memory. Today two pitfalls are threatening : on the one hand, a return to a positivist brand, devoid of understanding and meaning ; on the other hand, under the impact of postmodernist theories, the deletion of the dividing line between history and fiction. In order to provide a sound and rationally established basis to the idea of a scientific, social and moral responsibility of the historian, without falling back either into a moralizing approach or an abstract and lifeless neutrality, two conditions are required : first, to recall ceaselessly that in history truth is and remains the first goal ; secondly to stress that a congenital connection unites history with values.<br>

Abstract: Partindo de urna analogía, sugerida por Arthur Danto, com o que se passa no mundo artístico pós-moderno, o artigo começa por reconsiderar o estatuto da história narrativa no actual contexto da disciplina, caracterizado pela explosão dos géneros historiográfícos, para se debruçar seguidamente sobre o problema de saber que tipo ou tipos de verdade histórica a narrativa veicula. À partir d'une analogie avec l'évolution du monde artistique post-moderne, suggérée par Arthur Danto, l'article commence par reconsidérer le statut de l'histoire narrative dans l'actuel contexte de la discipline, caractérisé par l'explosion des genres historiographiques. Puis, il se penche sur la question de savoir quel(s) type(s) de vérité historique est véhiculée par la narration. With an analogy of the post-modern artistic world proposed by Arthur Danto as its starting point, the article reconsiders the role of narrative history in the current context of the subject. This has been characterised by many historiographie genres. The article then addresses the problem of knowing which kind or kinds of historic truth the narrative conveys.<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40048296<br>
Date: 3 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Soual Philippe<br>
Abstract: Hegel, refusant le déisme et son Dieu d'entendement et repensant la theologia crucis luthérienne, considère l'événement de la mort de Jésus-Christ sur la croix comme la manifestation dans l'histoire mondiale de l'amour divin trinitaire. La vie éternelle de Dieu est celle de l'amour des trois personnes divines, comme don, dessaisissement de soi et commune extase. Or la Croix révèle cet amour par la kénose du Fils, comprise comme don et mort de la mort. Par là Hegel s'efforce de penser non pas la seule mort de Dieu, mais bien la vie infinie de Dieu qui est conquête de sa vérité dans l'épreuve de l'absolu déchirement, de l'abîme de la croix. Cette vie est, par la croix, gloire de l'amour trinitaire dans le règne de l'Esprit. Hegel, refusing deism and its God of understanding, and pondering anew over the Lutheran theologia crucis, believes that Jésus Christ's death on the Cross is the manifestation of the Trinity's divine love within the history ofthe world. God's eternal life is that ofthe three divine persons embodying gift, the unravelling of one's self and common ecstasy. Now the Cross reveals such a love through the kenosis ofthe Son understood both as gift and death of death. Hence, Hegel strives at thinking not only God's death but, rather, the infinité life of God which is a conquest of its own truth through the trial of the absolute wrench of the abyss of the Cross. Such a life becomes, through the expérience of the Cross, the glory of the love of the Trinity within the realm ofthe Spirit.<br>

Abstract: Cette note de synthèse souligne la spécificité de la discipline enseignée. L'histoire scolaire occupe une position originale dans le champ des didactiques par la complexité de ses références (production savante, auto-référence scolaire et usages publics de l'histoire). Tendus entre une transmission de connaissances consensuelles et la recherche d'une posture critique, les objets d'histoire enseignés demeurent soumis à des questionnements renouvelés au gré de la demande sociale comme le montrent les récents débats autour des questions mémorielles vives et concurrentes. L'histoire enseignée apparaît ainsi comme un mixte articulant représentations sociales, savoirs privés et connaissances validées. Depuis une quinzaine d'années, des travaux ont permis de mieux cerner le « penser en histoire » et les processus cognitifs spécifiques en jeu dans la classe (temps historique, conceptualisation, problématisation, construction de schemes explicatifs). Des recherches contextualisées ont permis d'explorer les pratiques professionnelles effectives et d'en modéliser le fonctionnement « normal » : une discipline qui privilégie la transmission de savoirs disant la réalité du passé et attachée à la neutralité du texte enseigné ; une discipline qui peine à mettre en cohérence des finalités intellectuelles ambitieuses (outiller le citoyen actif dans la cité de demain) et des activités dans la classe souvent cantonnées à la mémorisation, au repérage et à la catégorisation. Aussi voit-on se dessiner dans les travaux actuels, une problématique centrée sur les écarts entre les intentions et les pratiques. En articulant la notion de soumission aux règles du « contrat didactique » avec les autres modèles théoriques des sciences humaines et sociales mobilisés au sein des équipes de recherche, les travaux menés de manière encore trop dispersée, laissent apparaître des acquis importants qui pourraient être pris en compte dans la formation des enseignants This paper underlines the specificity o~<br>

Abstract: Throughoput its history, "ideology" (the concept and theory) served as social science's foil, an opposing standard against which it defined its own knowledge-as-truth. As social science since mid-century has undergone changes in its idea of itself and its methods of inquiry, the theory of ideology has served as register, visably recording these changes. Works by the structuralists and poststructuralists, especially Althusser and Foucault, forced upon social theorists a profound rethinking of power and its operations and moved "ideology" away from the theory of false consciousness towards a view of ideology as cultural practice. For some, ideology theory is obsolete (due to its classical roots as "false consciousness") or redundant (due to its links to "culture"). Despite the merits of these arguments, a provisional argument on behalf of ideology theory is offered.<br>

Abstract: Richard Rorty uses Nietzsche to show that people need to create themselves because there is no foundationalist language which they can establish as an anchor. Although this perspective is Nietzschean, it is not Jamesian, and so Rorty misappropriates James when he conflates James and Nietzsche as like-minded progenitors of the mythologizing of a privileged vocabulary. This essay evaluates Rorty's reading of James by considering whether truth in Rorty's textualist sense can abide by the stream of thought. Although James does mythologize privileged vocabularies, he believes that words need to reflect the world more accurately (something Rorty would never say) by abiding by the flux of experience. As such, James recognizes the value that old words have as tools. Whereas Rorty shows disdain for old words, James shows us the cash value those words have in helping us to do anything from paying our bills to constructing more practical and effective theories.<br>

Abstract: The article asserts that a search for truth ought to be carrying out in such a way as to preserve or enhance solidarity. It demonstrates the necessity and the difficulties of making atrocious and traumatic historical events legally accountable. The necessity and difficulties have been recently fuelled by the trends towards the openness of modern identity and the growing importance of human rights, both of them demanding settling conflicts in the context of the multiplication of particularistic memories, yet without undermining social solidarity constructed on liberal foundations. The article argue that because of the hybrid nature of the task, unresolved tensions between memory and history, the erosion of the state's ability to impose unitary and unifying framework of memory, there is no simple and quick solution to tensions between memory, solidarity, and therefore to manage these strains we need to rely a plurality of contending narratives and civility of rules.<br>

Abstract: This article seeks to address how Lebanese youth are dealing with the legacy of civil war (1975-90), given the national backdrop of official silence, persisting injustice, and competing memory discourses. Drawing on Marianne Hirsch's concept of postmemory, it explores the memory of a generation of Lebanese who have grown up dominated not by traumatic events but by narrative accounts of events that preceded their birth. This residual form of memory carries and connects with the pain of others, suffusing temporal frames and liminal positions. The article examines how postmemory is mediated and transformed through the mnemonic lenses of visual landscapes and oral narratives. Consideration is given to the dynamic production of "memoryscapes"—memories of violence localized in particular sites—and to narrative constructions of the past implicated in the ongoing search for meaning, historical truth, and identity. This article seeks to challenge pervasive notions of Lebanese postwar amnesia and of a generational detachment from the residual effects and future implications of war recollections.<br>

Abstract: A community, in the same way as an individual, can follow as a normal way of behaviour — or as a wanted criteria for behaviour — for all future circumstances to decide discretionally, «case by case», or to define in a moment in time the rule (or a set of rules) that must be valid for the future. To define rules in a community has been indicated by some authors (Geoffrey Brennan and James M. Buchanan particularly) as a way to exit from a situation of a war of every man against every other man, as in the Hobbesian jungle, on one side, and from a situation dominated by a Leviathan on the other. This in a perspective where rules of a common living have been set through a social contract. The rules established through this contract would also form the criteria for a just conduct, in the end therefore for criteria of justice. The essay analyzes the situations and the conditions in which constraining oneself can be rational, even as it is not definible that in all circumstances constraining is more rational than not constraining oneself, that it is more desirable to have rules rather than discretionary decisions, the definition of ways of behaviour rather than the pre-definition of outcomes. As for what concerns the problem of justice, it is indicated how through a contractarian and constitutional procedure rules can be put by unanimous consent, but the problem of the foundation of the same rules remains unresolved. Rules do not seek truth, but only express values accepted by the counterparts in a certain moment in time, and have individuals as sources of these values.<br>

Abstract: C'est dans la Poétique d'Aristote que se trouve une méthode pour reconnaître le mal en politique. Ce que livre la « reconnaissance » issue de la réflexion poétique tient déjà à trois choses : le temps que prend le travail d'un aveu de soi à soi; la posture rhétorique double de délégation-consolation et de dévoilement plénier ; le joint du mal personnel et du mal public. Cette poétique est au cœur du phénomène de réconciliation en Afrique du Sud après la fin de l'apartheid, dans les travaux de la Commission Vérité et Réconciliation : une poétique de la réconciliation. It is in the Poetics of Aristotle that can be found a method for recognizing evil in politics. The "recognition" that is furnished by poetic reflection stems from three things: the time taken by the process of confession from self to self; the double rhetorical posture of delegation-consolation and complete exposure; the conjunction of personal evil and public evil. That poetic is at the heart of the phenomenon of reconciliation in South Africa after the end of apartheid, in the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission: a poetic of reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: Carlo Ginzburg, in 1988, considered present historiography as beholden to a regimen of truth by quotation that had distanced itself from the task of making the past present to make it believable, a position he was to nuance; but the distinction between the two modes is a valid one for analyzing the writing of history -if analysis reveals their intertwining in ways that ultimately open out onto the relationship between history and fiction, whose history is still not told. En 1988 Carlo Ginzburg considérait que l'historiographie moderne se soumettait à un régime de la preuve par la citation documentaire qui l'éloignait de la tâche de rendre l'histoire présente pour la rendre crédible ; s'il devait plus tard nuancer cela, la distinction constitue une entrée valide pour analyser l'écriture de l'histoire - si l'analyse révèle plutôt leur imbrication selon des modes qui ouvrent sur le rapport entre fiction et histoire, dont l'histoire reste à faire.<br>

Abstract: History is a passage from an « I-truth » to a « He-truth » through an « Ustruth » where the nature of who resides in the us, and the capacity for it to an assumed « We-truth », determines the transformation into a « He-truth » - with the pitfall that an « I-truth » can disguise as a « He-truth » by restricting its « Us » aspects, and anyway be read as such. Reading Learning Each Other's Historical Narrative through the prism of Greek history and political thought enables it to be seen as a step in the direction of the constitution of a « we » encompassing what are as yet two « us »'s... L'histoire est un passage d'un « Je-vrai » à un « Il-vrai » au travers d'un « On-vrai » , où la question de qui se tient derrière ce « on » et de sa capacité à assumer un « nous » détermine le passage au « Il-vrai » -avec le risque qu'un « Je-vrai » peut se déguiser en « Il-vrai » en restreignant l'accès au « On », et en tout cas peut toujours être lu ainsi. La lecture d'Histoire de l'autre au moyen du filtre de l'histoire et de la pensée politique grecques permet de le voir comme une étape dans la construction d'un « nous » rassemblant ce qui ne sont pour le moment que deux « on »...<br>

Abstract: En explicitant le concept linguistique de prédicat et en étendant sa portée, l'auteur introduit et définit celui de « prédicat somatique », responsable de l'expression du sensible dans le langage. Il en illustre la pertinence et en spécifie le contenu analytique à travers trois exemples. La reprise critique de l'analyse du « sein nu » dans Palomar d'I. Calvino par A. J. Greimas (dans De l'imperfection) permet de dégager les propriétés du « corps percevant ». L'analyse d'un énoncé de la mère de Jamel Debbouze dans Télérama fait ressortir l'expression corporelle d'une vérité « refoulée, proscrite, par le langage », un « ça » vrai, expression d'un non-sujet immanent. Enfin, la relation fondamentale entre « l'acte politique » et « le corps parlant » est dégagée à partir de positions exprimées par Jean-Claude Milner et ici analysées dans la perspective du « prédicat somatique », dont trois variétés se trouvent ainsi dégagées au terme de l'article. Developing and extending the validity of the linguistic concept of predicate, the author introduces and defines the notion of "somatic predicate", responsible for expressing in language the experience of the senses. Three examples both show the notion's pertinence and specify its content. A critical reappraisal of A. J. Greimas' analysis of the « naked breast » in Italo Calvino's Palomar (in De l'imperfection) leads to defining me characteristics of the « perceiving body ». The analysis of an utterance of Jamel Debbouze's mother in Télérama stresses the physical, bodily expression of a truth "repressed, prohibited, by language", a true "id", the expression of an immanent non-subject. Finally, the fundamental relation between the "political act" and the "speaking body" is shown through opinions expressed by Jean-Claude Milner which are here analysed from the perspective of a "somatic predicate", three varieties of which have thus been described and defined by the end of the article.<br>

Abstract: Enquadrar de um modo filosófico, educacional e político a questão do "Testamento Vital" (ou "Diretivas Antecipadas de Tratamento") pressupõe não haver dúvidas sobre o seu conteúdo. Por isso, este artigo pretende, numa primeira parte, e atendendo às dúvidas existentes em Portugal, explicitar de que falamos quando falamos de "Testamento Vital". Só então seräo abordadas temáticas mais complexas que nos alertam para o facto de o "Testamento Vital" não ser um mero instrumento de regulação de vontades em relação ao fim de vida, mas remeter para economías específicas de verdade, valor e poder que pressupõem respostas distintas a perguntas fundamentais que o ser humano faz sobre si próprio: a sua suposta "natureza", a liberdade ou não de determinar o seu destino, o significado da tolerãncia ou o que é fazer e respeitar o "bem" dos outros. Finalmente, um último ponto tratará de uma problemática muito específica dentro do questionamento geral em torno do "Testamento Vital", que é a da autonomia prospetiva, pois esse "Testamento" visa determinar agora o que pretendemos que nos façam no futuro em termos de cuidados de saúde, caso estejamos na altura incapazes de decidir. Este último ponto será elaborado com base em reflexōes de Ronald Dworkin. In order to frame in a philosophical, educational and political way the issue of the living wilb (or Advance Directives of Treatment) we should assume that there are no doubts about their meaning. As this is not the case in Portugal, the first part of this article will address this question. Only then will we be confronted with more complex subjects, in order to develop the idea that living wilh are not just a mere instrument that regulate end-of-life issues, but involve specific economies of truth, value and power that imply different answers to fundamental questions that human beings put to themselves: their supposed "nature", their freedom to determine or not their destiny, the meaning of tolerance or what it means to do and to respect~<br>

Abstract: This article explores the influences of developments in philosophy on psychotherapy beginning with philosophers of the ancient Greek world. Psychotherapy owes much to ways of thinking employed by Greek philosophers attempting to understand the nature of the world and the relationships between humans, each other, and the world. The questions these philosophers asked, the answers they provided, and the methods they devised to address their questions remain pertinent to psychotherapists today. Greek philosophers engaged in dialectics and used reason to overcome the unreliability of the senses. Reason was deemed able to determine truth until philosophers, Nietzsche prominent among them, unseated reason from its throne. The article concludes with a discussion of themes and observations important to Nietzsche and postmodern philosophy, toward which Nietzsche's work pointed, and discusses their relevance to group psychotherapy.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we attempt to show the fruitfulness of the theory of communicative action for memory studies. Specifically, we intend to demonstrate that concepts characteristic of the discipline, such as "history," "memory," and "dialogue," reflect three types of universal validity claims: "memory" formulates claims to authenticity, "history" formulates claims to truth, and "dialogue" formulates claims to Tightness. Thus, it is possible to introduce a seminal Habermasian notion of rationality that rests on validity claims. This notion can serve to integrate, enrich, and identify blind spots in memory studies. Our purpose is to demonstrate the relevance of collective memory to social cohesion (cultural reproduction, social integration, and socialization) and the public sphere (its development and atrophy, rationalization, and colonization).<br>

Author(s): Zollmann Mary Ann<br>
Abstract: This article explores the thesis that educators are called to define and describe truth morefoundationally than we have ever done before if tve are to facilitate existence that is right, just, correct on both a personal and communal level. This thesis is sourced in ever-deepening attentiveness to, appreciation for, and affirmation of this statement of Adrian van Kaam: "The work of reformation starts in the heart by means of the human spirit; it is the reclamation of the soul, via the spirit, of its innermost form direction. " Suggesting that education which would be truly correctional must, therefore, reach into the very heart of being, the author describes the current paradigm shift from the Newtonian model of what it means to be human with its positivistic approaches to learning to a more Einsteinian or fullfield understanding of human being and its requirement of more formative learning processes. In consonance with the truth of being as full-field, formative correctional education is reflective and experiential, dialogical, narrative in form, and globally inclusive. In her discussion of each of these methodologies, the author illustrates how each one draws us deeper into the truth of who we are and inspires us to be the unique presence that we are in the world. Through such methods and processes, individuals are formed, reformed, and transformed not only in self-appreciation and openness to their own possibilities, but in appreciation for the meaning and value of their existence with others in the world.<br>

Abstract: The article traces distinet approaches to the concepts of 'meaning', 'reference' and 'sense' in twentieth-century literary theory and general semioties. It offers an account of different concepts of 'mimesis', 'reference', and 'representation' from the point of view of fictional world making as well as from the point of reading a narrative. The article focuses on the tension between mimesis and diegesis, as coined by Plato and Aristotle, and it interprets concepts developed in recent times by scholars such as Jakobson, Quine, Ricoeur, Eco and de Man. Distinet sections of the article focus on the following: the referential function of proper names and the two contrasting approaches of Kripke and Linsky; the contrast between mimesis and diegesis as a functional reference to the world of experience in Ricoeur; the correspondence and truth conditions in Strawson and Davidson; the emphasis on coherence as a way of eliminating mimesis and reference in Eco’s semiotics; the radical elimination of both the reference and the signified in deconstruction; the issue of textual re-presentation. The article attempts to illustrate the thesis that by accepting intentional, inside-of-the-text produced concepts of meaning the reader and the critic would eventually loos not only ali the ties to the actual world but also the impulses for reading and interpreting.<br>

Abstract: From the Balfour declaration of 1917 to the birth of Israel in 1948 a great catastrophe (Nakba) crashed down on Palestine which afterwards got worse with the exodus of the major part of Palestinian population and reached an highest point with the arab defeat of 1967 (Naksa,). During the following period (Nahda) the Palestinians pursued an increasing visibility through military resistance, Intifadah, political initiative and cultural mobilization. The Author stigmatizes the mistakes of Palestinian leaders as well as the colonial policy carried on by Israel. Recollecting the experience of the South-African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, he thinks that a true reconciliation between Palestinians and Israelis will be impossible if they don't enter in a different mood, forgiving about Nakba and Shoah respectively and trying to convert their common pain and sorrow into hope and confidence in a shared future. Depuis la déclaration Balfour de 1917 jusqu'á la résolution du partage-découpage de la Palestine en 1947 et á la création d'Israël en 1948 la Palestine fit l'expérience d'une grande catastrophe (Nakba), qui devint tragique dans les années suivantes lorsqu'on assista á un véritable éclatement du corps social palestinien et culmina dans la défaite de 1967 (Naksaj. L'aprés-guerre de 1967 marqua un tournant majeur dans la mesure où les Palestiniens accédérent á la visibilité par la resistance militaire, par le soulévement dans les territoires occupés (Intifadah), par l'inititaive politique et par la mobilisation culturelle (Nahda). L'Auteur stigmatise soit les erreurs commis par les directions palestiniennes soit la politique coloniale pratiquée par Israël. Il voit dans l'obsession du Nakba pour les uns et de la Shoah pour les autres des obstacles qu'ilfaut dépasser pour ouvrir la voie d'une réconciliation véritable entre Palestiniens et Israéliens.<br>

Abstract: Le revival, qui se développa parmi les premiers disciples de Husserl, est un fait saisissant. Des documents, dont quelques uns sont encore inédits, servent à l'illustrer. Ce qui le fonde, c'est une étrange correspondance entre le projet de la première phénoménologie et les démarches subjectives de la conscience religieuse. La vraie philosophie, sainteté de la raison, n'est-elle pas aussi rectitude de la conscience jusqu'aux racines d'une expérience du sacré ou du divin ? The revival, which appeared among the first disciples of Ed. Husserl, is a well known fact. New documents are dedicated to illustrate such an event. They make clearer the existence of some mysterious bond linking the first phenomenological method and the basic disposition of natural religion. Genuine philosophy is indeed rightness of thought but also practical truth down to the very sources of a renovating feeling of the holy or the divine.<br>

Article Title: L'ÉVOLUTION DE MAX HORKHEIMER VERS LE PESSIMISME ?<br>
Publisher: Beauchesne<br>
Issue: i40117551<br>
Date: 6 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): RAULET Gérard<br>
Abstract: L'interprétation des derniers écrits de Horkheimer a suscité des controverses parfois violentes ; ils semblent en effet traduire la résignation, voire le désespoir, et marquer un retour à la théologie. Leur signification peut cependant être reconsidérée si l'on conçoit l'évolution de Horkheimer à la lumière du statut de la vérité dans la Théorie critique. La résignation, le pessimisme et la théologie provoquent-ils un changement de statut de la vérité qui autoriserait à distinguer deux Théories critiques ou ne peut-on voir dans la permanence de thèmes comme celui d'une vérité utopique et non représentable, de la nostalgie, de la dette envers l'humanité et dans l'usage du pessimisme les signes d'une continuité ? Il se pourrait alors que l'économie interne de la Théorie critique ait changé, mais sans rupture, et que ces thèmes aient constitué dès le départ un ressort essentiel du caractère critique de la Théorie critique. The interpretation of the last essays of Horkheimer has raised controversies and even polemics in so far as hopelesness, resignation and the turn back to religion seem to predominate in them. In order to reconsider this problem, Horkheimer's evolution will be interpreted here in the light of the definition of truth in Critical Theory. Do resignation, pessimism and theology involve a new definition of truth — so that one could speak of a second Critical Theory, or can themes like the utopical, nonrepresentable nature of truth, the nostalgy, the debt to humanity and the use of pessimism be understood as signs of a continuity in which the economy of Critical Theory may have changed but without any rupture between its early phase and the late works of Horkheimer and Adorno ? If this is the case one has then to show how Critical Theory could preserve its critical properties in a changed political and social situation.<br>

Author(s): LEBRUN Jocelyne<br>
Abstract: Afin de justifier l'élaboration et l'usage d'une phénoménologie de l'imagination poétique, on montrera comment le langage poétique permet selon le mot de P. Ricoeur « d'articuler une expérience fictive » en dégageant l'« illusion » qui s'attache à la lecture de l'objet poétique. Avec Bachelard on verra comment l'image poétique apparaît comme une aurore de parole et un être nouveau. On verra comment le phénoménologue n'oublie jamais que l'expérience poétique situe le poème dans « le pays de la vérité » et s'efforce de le saisir comme essence, Wesenschau. Mais comme d'autre part une illusion fondamentale s'attache à la lecture de l'œuvre poétique, on évoquera la pensée de Nietzsche qui se déploie dans le jeu de l'illusion et de la vérité. L'artiste est cet illusionniste sublime qui nous fait sentir comme réel le monde des phénomènes. On terminera par une définition du poète comme celui qui nomme et par sa nomination fait être, fait l'Être apparaissant et transparent. To justify a phenomenology of poetic imagination we show how through poetical language a fictitious experience can be articulated, as says P. Ricoeur, by sifting out the « illusion » which pertains to the reading of the poetical object. According to Bachelard poetical image appears as a dawn of words and a new being. The phenomenologist never forgets that according to poetical experience a poem dwells in the « land of truth » and should be grasped as an essence, « Wesenschau ». But, as a fundamental illusion clings to the reading of a poetical work, we shall remember Nietzsche whose thought dwells in the play of illusion and truth. Thanks to the artist as a sublime conjurer we feel real the world of phenomena. To end, a poet is someone who names and, by doing so, makes being appearing and transparent.<br>

Author(s): GRONDIN Jean<br>
Abstract: La pensée de Hans-Georg Gadamer veut jeter un pont entre les deux périodes de la philosophie heideggérienne en développant les conséquences herméneutiques de l'expérience du destin de l'être. Ce destin en vient à se réfléchir dans une « conscience du travail de l'histoire ». Par cette expression il est possible de donner une traduction adéquate du « wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewußtsein ». Le problème herméneutique de la vérité peut donc être posé sur le fondement de la finitude et de l'histoiricité de la compréhension. L'expérience de la vérité est maintenant comprise comme un πάθος qui s'inscrit dans la ποίησις, la créativité poétisante du travail de l'histoire. L'aspect créateur d'une vérité qui affirme sa finitude permet d'établir un lien entre les philosophies herméneutiques de Gadamer et de Paul Ricœur. Hans-Georg Gadamer's thinking aims at bridging the gap between the two stages of Heidegger's philosophy by developing the hermeneutical consequences entailed in the experience of the destiny of being. This destiny comes to a reflection of itself in a « consciousness of the work of history ». By this expression it is possible to give an adequate translation of the « wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewusstsein ». The hermeneutical problem of truth can thus be posed on the basis of the finitude and historicity of undersstanding. The experience of truth is now understood as a πάθος inscribed in the ποίησις, the « poetizing » creativity of the « work of history ». The creative aspect of a truth that affirms its own finitude enables one to establish a link between the hermeneutical philosophies of Gadamer and Paul Ricœur.<br>

Publisher: Beauchesne<br>

Author(s): PINSON Jean-Claude<br>
Abstract: Le discours philosophique, même lorsqu'il se propose comme chez Hegel de « sauver » intégralement les phénomènes, ne parvient pas vraiment à saisir (et en même temps dédaigne) le ceci en son individualité la plus contingente. La parole poétique est plus apte à le recueillir, comme on tente de le montrer à partir de l'exemple de l'incipit d'un roman de Claude Simon. Elle fait ainsi affleurer la vérité d'une obscure dimension de l'être que Heidegger désigne sous le nom de Terre. Seule une ontologie de la différence est susceptible de fournir une structure d'accueil adéquate à cette valorisation poétique de l'infra-conceptuel. Au niveau de l'herméneutique littéraire, il en résulte l'exigence d'une démarche particulièrement attentive aux détails les plus factuels à travers lesquels se configure cette dimension voilée de l'être. Even when it proposes, as in the works of Hegel, to « save » the phenomena in full, the philosophical discourse does not really succeed in seizing (and at once disdains) the this in its most contingent individuality. The poetic speech is more capable of catching it, as this article will attempt to show it from an incipit of a novel by Claude Simon. The poetic speech makes thus the truth of an unknown dimension of the being which Heidegger calls Earth emerge. Alone an ontology of the difference is liable to provide this poetic valorisation of the infra-conceptual with an adequate « home ». Asfar as literary hermeneutics are concerned, it results in the necessity of a method which must be particularly heedful of the most factual details through which this veiled dimension of the being forms itself.<br>

Abstract: After demonstrating that scripture's truth has always to be negotiated in terms of changing contexts, and after demonstrating that this is precisely what the church has already done with regard to remarriage, this essay argues that the church's teaching on marriage as an event is an increasingly irrelevant Victorian construct, not the originary will of God; and is maintained only by disregard – disregard of the hermeneutical nature of scripture's teachings on marriage, disregard of the process–understanding of marriage which has always dominated Africa and which is increasingly dominating global culture as a whole, and disregard of the church's teachings, even by active and committed members of the church. The essay argues that the hermeneutical nature of the Bible's teaching on this subject, as well as the church's own approach to remarriage, gives the church the responsibility to frame a Christian process-understanding of marriage which will better enable people to build stable, lifelong unions.<br>

Abstract: At Malmö School of Education a project team has tried to find out to what extent people are capable of constructing and presenting historical stories. The practical approach has dominated the project. Participants have been a lot of teacher students and a dozen experienced history teachers at schools in the south of Sweden. The main purpose has been to create teacher-stories for classroom use. To a minor extent we also have examined what narrative competence teenagers can develop. We tried to answer these questions: Is it easy or difficult to create and tell stories that are 1) chronological, 2) true, and 3) meaningful? Our results — more empirically than scientifically based — are: 1) Not only teachers but also pupils can create chronologic presentations. 2) We found some problems when we tried to follow the truth criterion. Story-tellers found it difficult to construct good stories if being limited to use only true elements of the past (found for example in historical dissertations). 3) The biggest problems we met were when we tried to make meaningful stories out of our true stories. Narrative history probably is worth a renaissance. However, much work remains before we know the best ways to develop narrative competence. An der „School of Education“ von Malmö hat ein Forscherteam den Versuch unternommen herauszufinden, bis zu welchem Grad Menschen fähig sind, historische Geschichten zu entwickeln und zu erzählen. Ein praktischer Zugang bestimmte das Projekt. Eine Anzahl Lehramtsstudenten und ein Dutzend erfahrener Geschichtslehrer an Schulen Südschwedens nahmen an diesem Projekt teil. Das Hauptziel war, Geschichten für Lehrer zur Verwendung im Geschichtsunterricht auszuarbeiten. In zweiter Linie ging es darum zu untersuchen, welche narrative Kompetenz Jugendliche entwickeln können. Wir haben versucht, folgende Fragen zu beantworten: Ist es leicht oder schwierig, Geschichten zu schaffen und zu erzählen, die 1. chronologisch, 2. wahr und 3. sinnvoll sind? Unsere Erg~<br>

Abstract: The present methodological debate about the need for a particular theological perspective when researching on the subject of contemporary church history raises central issues about the question of the validity of theology as a subject for scientific investigations. On the one hand, we should seek to avoid any dualtrack approach which would question the whole notion claimed by theologians to be advancing the cause of truth in a scientific manner. On the other hand, theology is a "thorn in the flesh" for the world of scholarship, since it seeks to guarantee openness as a central maxim in scholarly research, and to oppose any reductionist tendency which would pervert the secular methods of scholarly work by advancing the monopolistic claim of a systematic, ideological atheism. The right of theologians to propose their own special approach to theological questions should not be based on abstract principle, but is better defended-drawing on the researches of Itopper, Ricoeur and Marrou-as being in accordance with man's sinful nature and pragmatically meaningful. Drawing a distinction between the discovery of knowledge and assessment of its meaning can lead to a positive evaluation of experiences and their various connections. Any examination of experience, from a theological or ecclesiastical point of view, should not therefore be dismissed as illegitimate. Rather, it can add a valuable dimension in producing new horizons and perspectives. Of course, any such theological endeavour will still be subject to the rigorous disciplines of interdisciplinary discourse. Church history, as well as contemporary church history, is therefore in some ways competing with other historical disciplines. They are all attempting to make sense out of the welter of events by means of a theoretical ordering of experience. As such they provide a desirable, but by no means an exclusive, method of guiding men and women in their on-going search for insights into the nature of the world, man and Go~<br>

Abstract: The text aims at considering from various points of view the presence of the value of truth in the work of art. The first step is a phenomenological analysis of epistemológical, ontological and aesthetic phenomena connected with perception of the work of art. Its conclusion is the statement that truth belongs to the characteristics of both creation (contents, structure) and reception (cognition of various aspects) of the work. The very fact that the aesthetic value of the object claiming to be beautiful can be discussed proves the presence of the object on the rational-veritable plane. The next aspect undertaken in the article is concerned with the epistemological and methodological criticism of the view (represented here by R. Ingarden) that there is a radical difference between the objective domains of science and art. An attempt is made to show that the view is rooted rather in ideologically understood scientism and neo-positivism than in a realistic conception of cognition through art. In a completely realistic attitude the borderline between 'what is rationally cognised' and 'what is beautiful' (the sphere of quasi in Ingarden's meaning) is not an absolute borderline. The domain of the work of art also contains cognitive elements, often existentially and morally essential for man's life. As it appears, a similar position can be found in G. B. Vico's texts that proclaim the unity of poetic and metaphysical perspective in ancient beginnings of anthropological thought about the human world. Nowadays a methodological tendency is observed on the philosophical plane that allows joining the veritable and aesthetic aspects, and hence exploring the objective domain of art in the cognitive aspect. This is expressed today, among others, in the increase of the significance of art in social, cultural and scientific life.<br>

Abstract: This article with various models of relation between science and belief. The first part of paper discusses all theories which affirm an opposition between science and religious belief: some of the speak about a real and durable contradiction (logical empirism, marxism), another speak only about linguistic opposition (fideism, cryptofideism, theory of double truth). All these theories are controversial because they call in question the noetic value of religion or of science. The second part of the paper considers the theories affirming concordance between science and belief. They are following: the distinction of man's existential attitude toward religion and science (so-colled II. Wittgenstein), the theory of concordance, complementary character of science and belief, the theory of methodologie difference and of object's diversity. The author came do the conclusion that the best explication of the relation between science and religion is given by the synthetic-complementary theory.<br>

Abstract: Depuis les années 1980, l'exhumation dmédico-légale des fosses communes est une pratique courante dans les contextes d'après-violence. Menées dans le but de soulager le « traumatisme » des familles de victimes, adossées à une exigence de « vérité » sur les crimes perpétrés, les exhumations font office de « meilleures pratiques » standardisées favorisant une sortie de conflit. Cette thérapeutique politique peut-elle être mise au service de la lutte et détournée des objectifs réconciliateurs définis ? Cet article analyse le processus d'invention d'un nouveau mode d'action protestataire. Il se centrera sur le travail militant de la Federación Estatal de Foros por la Memoria, collectif espagnol qui interprète l'exhumation comme un outil de lutte permettant de sortir de la réconciliation et de réveiller volontairement les antagonismes. The forensic exhumation of the mass graves has become common practice in post-violent contexts since the 1980s. Being carried out to relieve the psychological "trauma" of the victims' families who demand the "truth" on the past wrongdoings, forensic exhumations are now considered as a standardized "best practice" in the field of conflict resolution. Can this political therapy be put at the service of political strife and diverted from its reconciliation objectives? This article aims at analysing the invention process of a new form of political protest. It will focus on the activities of the Federación Estatal de Foros por la Memoria. According to this Spanish association, mass grave exhumations are a way out of reconciliation and a deliberate revival of antagonisms.<br>

Abstract: This article is concerned with identifying, comparing, and accounting for the principal rhetorical conventions within Pagan practitioners' narratives of conversion. Applying key insights from studies on narrative identity and drawing on 15 months offieldwork and 25 in-depth interviews with Pagan practitioners, I first outline formal similarities in the content of participants' narratives, arguing that these narrative conventions together constitute an ideal typical conversion narrative: what I call the rhetoric of continuity. This narrative form depicts the process of conversion as a rediscovery or uncovering of a temporally continuous and essentialized Pagan self I suggest that while all conversions involve both change and continuity, adherents of different faith traditions vary in the degree to which they stress self-transformation and/or self-continuity. I then argue that the rhetoric of continuity reflects and reinforces practitioners': (1) perspective on the locus and nature of the authentic self; (2) claims to legitimacy and social acceptance: and (3) understanding of the nature of religious truth.<br>

Abstract: Les Lumières européennes provoquent un double déplacement des coordonnées socio-culturelles dans lesquelles s'inscrit le christianisme : la critique rationnelle de la religion et la privatisation du croire induisent un processus de sécularisation auquel le christianisme doit réagir. Pour ce faire, le protestantisme développe une théorie du christianisme dont Kant, Schleiermacher et Hegel formulent les paradigmes. C'est au gré d'une reprise sélective de ces trois penseurs qu' au cours du XIXe et du XXe siècle le protestantisme allemand se positionnera au sein du monde moderne, s'efforçant d'identifier les sphères socio-culturelles lui permettant de faire valoir le thème où se jouent tant sa vérité théologique que sa pertinence socio-culturelle : la liberté. Ce cadre théorique permet d'expliciter ce qu'il en est de concepts souvent galvaudés : théologie libérale, Kulturprotestantismus, néo-protestantisme. The European enlightenment provoked a double displacement of the social and cultural components of Christianity : rationalist criticism of religion and the privatisation of belief led to a process of secularization to which Christianity had to react. To do so, Protestantism developed a theory of Christianity based on paradigms formulated by Kant, Schleiermacher and Hegel. It was through a selective return to these three thinkers that in the 19th and 20th centuries, German Protestantism took a position in the modern world, trying to identify those social and cultural spheres which would foster a theme essential to both its theological truth and its social-cultural pertinence : the theme of freedom. This theoretical framework allowed it to explain often tarnished concepts such as liberal theology, Kulturprotestantismus, neo-protestantism.<br>

Abstract: Jean-Paul II, dans son encyclique Ut unum sint, situe l'œcuménisme dans une double relation ascendante et descendante: d'une part relation de l'homme à Dieu et d'autre part relation de l'homme au monde. Ces deux mouvements doivent passer par la grille critique de la vérité et de l'amour pour être efficients, ce qui correspond à la Révélation comme mouvement premier de Dieu vers l'homme. Ainsi, le dialogue œcuménique ne pourra éviter une réflexion sur le statut de la vérité et de l'amour dans leur gestion ecclésiale, réflexion menée à la lumière de la polarité christologico-pneumatologique. Symptomatiquement, la question du ministère papal montre les impasses actuelles et les ouvertures possibles. John-Paul II, in his encyclical Ut unum sint, situates ecumenism in a twofold relationship, ascending and descending: the relationship of humankind to God and of humankind to the world. To be dynamic, these two movements must pass through the critical grid of truth and love, which corresponds to revelation as the first movement of God to humans. Thus ecumenical dialogue cannot avoid a reflection of the status of truth and love in ecclesiastic management, in the light of Christo-pneumatological polarity. Symptomatically, the question of papal ministry shows existing dead ends and possible apertures.<br>

Abstract: Où situer le danger ? Qui court un risque et qui le fait courir à qui ? Il s'agit de présenter deux analyses inverses de la notion de danger. Leur originalité tient au fait qu'il ne semble pas y avoir pour elles d'équité ou de réciprocité dans le danger: la menace vient exclusivement d'un côté de la relation. Pour Hegel, c'est le moi qui est l'objet de menaces. L'auteur de ces menaces est toujours l'autre, celui que je ne suis pas, et c'est précisément son altérité qui en fait une puissance dont je peux craindre la violence. C'est pourquoi la vérité – et la sécurité – se trouve toujours du côté de la réduction de la transcendance de l'autre. Pour cette raison, Levinas affirme qu'il n'y a pas d'autre dans la philosophie de Hegel, absence qu'il analyse justement comme un danger: c'est l'autre qui court un risque, et la menace vient de moi. La menace n'émane plus de l'étrangeté de l'autre, mais au contraire de la suppression de cette étrangeté. Ce qu'il est à craindre est, pour Hegel, que l'autre mette la main sur moi, et, pour Levinas, que je mette la main sur l'autre. Where is the danger? Who is at risk and who is a menace to whom? This article presents two opposite analyses of the notion of danger. Their originality lies in the fact that there seems to be no fairness or reciprocity in danger: the threat comes exclusively from one side of the relationship. For Hegel, oneself is always the object of threats. The source of these threats is always the other person, the one I am not, and it is precisely the other's alterity which is a force whose violence I should fear. That is why truth - and security – are always to be found in reducing the transcendence of the other. For this reason, Levinas claims that there is not an other in the philosophy of Hegel, an absence which he analyses as a danger; it's the other who is at risk, and the threat comes from me. The threat no longer emanates from the strangeness of the other, but, on the contrary, from the suppression of this ~<br>

Issue: i40184391<br>

Abstract: The manner in which the LDS Church administers its temple rite constitutes a strategic use of the conventions of an oral tradition in a modern, literate society. Three effects of this strategy are considered. First, refusing to make a text of the rite available and insisting that its specific content not be revealed or otherwise subjected to discursive thought sustains the rite's canonical authority as immutable truth, notwithstanding its periodic mutation. Secondly, the conventions of oral tradition structure the relationships created by the ritual and constitute a principal means by which the Church's historic separatism is maintained. Finally, these conventions when applied to the temple rite maximize ritual's capacity to adapt the canon to the needs of successive generations of the faithful while minimizing skepticism and schism.<br>

Abstract: Quelques questions philosophiques suggérées par la lecture du livre de J.-P. Jossua Lectures en écho. Journal théologique I, Paris 1976. Le recours à l'« expérience » devant la faillite des divers dogmatismes permet-il de donner un sens au témoignage de l'absolu? Le refus d'appuyer le christianisme à la culpabilité doit-il aboutir nécessairement à une revendication d'innocence sans intégrer l'apport des analyses de la flnitude et thématiser la condition de créature, inséparablement innocente et coupable? Penser que l'écriture est le lieu privilégié de manifestation du « je », n'est-ce pas recourir au postulat ontologique de la vérité comme fusion de la parole, du sens, du vécu, de la présence de l'homme et de sa vie? Some philosophical questions which arose from reading the book of J.-P. Jossua, Lectures en écho. Journal théologique I, Paris 1976. When faced with the failure of various dogmatisms, would not the recourse to "experience" by its very nature prevent "witness" from being an affirmation of the Absolute? By refusing to let Christianity lean on culpability, would one necessarily end up in a claim of innocence which would not integrate the contribution of analyses of limitedness and which would not come to grips with the condition of a creature which is inseparably innocent and culpable? By thinking that writing is the privileged place for the manifestation of the "ego", is one not resorting to the ontological postulate of truth as an amalgamation of word, sens, existence of man and life?<br>

Abstract: Appliquée au monothéisme trinitaire, cette étude de théologie spéculative se donne un double fondement Elle reçoit la relation de réciprocité entre Jésus-Christ et l'Esprii Saint, telle qu'elle est élaborée par diverses théologies contemporaines de la Révélation et du Salut Elle confirme une autre relation de réciprocité, entre une vérité de manifestation et une vérité de communication, telle qu'elle a pu être éprouvée à travers une réflexion conduite précédemment sur le langage. De cet entrecroisement suit la détermination de l'Esprii comme le Don incréé-indicible, et du Christ comme l'Icône-Parole incréée. Recueillant le Discours du Calvaire et la Parole de Pâques le dédoublement du nom christologique contribue à distinguer la médiation divine du milieu divin. Si la réciprocité du Christ et de l'Esprit rapporte ainsi le Mystère de Dieu à l'unité du Père et de la Révélation, il conviendra de revenir sur les anciens concepts de relation et d'origine, l'un et l'autre étant désormais respectivement accordés à la communication et à la manifestation. Applied to trinitarian monotheism, this study of speculative theology is based on a double foundation. It takes the relationship of reciprocity between Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit as elaborated by various contemporary theologies of revelation and salvation. It confirms another reciprocal relationship, that which exists between a truth of manifestation and a truth of communication as it has been previously established through a reflection on language. From this it follows that the Holy Spirit is the inexpressible, uncreated Gift while Christ is the uncreated Word-Image. Combining the discourse of Calvary and the Message of Easter, the double christological name helps to distinguish the divine mediation from the divine milieu. If the reciprocity of Christ and the Spirit thus relate the mystery of God to the unity of the Father and revelation, then it would be fitting to go back to the ancient concepts of relation and ori~<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de P. Ricœur laisse envisager une articulation spécifique entre la structure métaphysique de l'existence, caractérisée comme réflexion décentrée, et le mode propre selon lequel le religieux fait sens. En son principe, le religieux est coextensif au mouvement même de la réflexion, dont l'herméneutique constitue à la fois la vérité et la méthode: tension temporelle du soi entre son acte propre et les signes qu'il produit (Nabert), au sein du sens qui le précède. Sans jamais combler spéculativement la faille entre le soi et l'absolu, le religieux présente à l'imagination (au sens kantien) le scheme de l'accomplissement de l'existence. The work of P. Ricœur allows one to envisage the possibility of a specific link between the metaphysical nature of existence, depicted as eccentric reflection, and the standart view which gives religion its direction. In its principle, the 'religious' factor is co-extensive with the flow of reflection, whose hermeneutic constitutes not only the truth, but also the method: a temporal tension in the Self as between one's own actions and the effects they produce (J. Nabert), in the context of the intention which precedes them. While never spcculativcly overloading the fissure between the Self and the Absolute, religiosity affords to the imagination (in the sense used by Kant) a pattern for the fulfilment of existence.<br>

Abstract: Les mathématiques, auxquelles on peut joindre la logique, et depuis 1960 une large part de l'informatique théorique, fournissent un témoignage sur une part essentielle du fonctionnement de l'esprit humain. Loin de fournir seulement des outils extérieurs, elles se sont faites mode de pensée nécessaire pour appréhender la réalité physique. Elles nous ont appris que ce que nous nommons raison, démarche rationnelle, est en réalité laborieusement construit. Un bref survol de l'histoire des mathématiques, anciennes, puis surtout depuis le XIXe s., montre en quel sens le concept ancien de « vérité scientifique » s'en trouve désormais modifié. Mathematics, to which one may add logic and, since 1960, a large section of theoretical computer technique, all furnish evidence concerning an essential part of the working of the human mind. Far from providing only external tools, they have evolved as a necessary mode of thought for the understanding of physical reality. They have taught us that what we call reason, or rational deduction, is in fact something we have ourselves laboriously constructed. A brief survey of the history of mathematics, ancient and modern but especially from and after the 19th century, shows ways in which the old concept of a 'scientific truth' must henceforth be modified.<br>

Abstract: Le témoin n'est ni un spectateur, ni un propriétaire, ni un conservateur, ni un producteur, ni un juge, mais il est celui qui accueille ce qui se donne à lui et se reçoit de cette épreuve d'une altérité irréductible. La force des analyses de Kierkegaard est de montrer que l'élucidation de l'essence du témoignage, qui conduit à la substitution du témoin au je, ne peut être séparée d'une elucidation de l'essence de la vérité. La vérité n'étant pas ce que je produis, mais ce qui me touche et m'éclaire, le témoignage se donne comme une communication directe-indirecte qui consiste à dire la vérité tout en l'existant Exister c'est témoigner en faisant de sa vie une tâche dans la passion essentielle de la vérité. En cela seul le témoignage chrétien révèle véritablement l'essence du témoignage puisque seul il donne vraiment à voir le saut du témoignage, qui conduit à ne pas se contenter de persister dans l'être pour s'ouvrir à la possibilité de devenir tout autre en s'abandonnant à la vérité et en acceptant de souffrir pour elle dans le monde. Dans cette philosophie du témoignage, le témoin devient alors le vrai nom de la personne contre l'abstraction du sujet-substance. A witness is neither a spectator, a proprietor, a preservator, a producer nor a judge, he is the one that receives what is given to him and who, from this test of irreducible alterity, receives himself. The strength of Kierkegaard's analyses is in showing that the elucidation of the essence of witnessing, which leads to the witness being substituted to the "I-myself", is inseparable from the elucidation of the essence of truth. Truth being not what I make but what marks and enlightens me, witnessing is given to be a direct-indirect communication which consists of saying the truth while being it. To be is to give witness by making one's life a task in the essential passion of truth. For this, Christian witness alone truly reveals the essence of witnessing for it alone truly allows one to see the leap of witn~<br>

Author(s): NeutresAbstract: En adaptant Le Parrain, le best-seller de Mario Puzo, Francis Ford Coppola est confronté à plusieurs récits-I'histoire de la Mafia américaine, son imagerie mythique, I'interrogation identitaire italo-américaine-, auxquels il mêle des souvenirs personnels et l'héritage culturel légué par sa communauté. Dépassant la simple commande commerciale, il réussit à établir à l'écran, via la fiction, sa part de vérité. Le premier film sera complété par deux suites. Le temps de constitution de cette trilogie, près de vingt ans, renvoie à deux autres durées exceptionnellement longues: la durée du métrage final des trois films (près de neufheures) et celle de la période décrite (quatre-vingt ans de l'histoire des États-Unis). Brisant la linéarité classique, la trilogie du Parrain souligne la pertinence de l'outil cinématographique dans la construction d'un récit aux temporalités multiples. Ces temporalités concernent aussi bien le spectateur que le cinéaste lui-même, comme nous l'indique l'édition DVD, outil précieux pour une analyse historienne. Face à ses propres images, Coppola transforme la «revision» en travail de mémoire: manière supplémentaire de surmonter l'apparent paradoxe entre le film hollywoodien et le récit intime. /// Whilst adapting The Godfather, Mario Puzo's bestselling novel, Francis Ford Coppola was faced with several stories-the history of the American Mafia, the mythical image associated with it, the questioning of Italian-American identity-which he managed to combine with his own life experiences and the cultural legacy inherited from his own community. Going beyond a simple commissioned film, he succeeds in transposing onto screen, through fiction, his very own truth. This first installment was complemented by two sequels. The twenty-year time-frame within which this trilogy was made is echoed by two other remarkably long periods: the full running-time of the three films when viewed consecutively (close to nine hours) and the historical period within which~<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>

Author(s): Woollcombe Regina M.<br>
Abstract: The Hebrew Bible depicts interpretation as a continual process of losing and finding, of forgetting and remembering. Texts are lost and found, and in the Joseph story (Gen. 37-50), Joseph himself is abandoned and recovered, with all memory of him repressed until it is dramatically recalled. His story demonstrates that repression is the condition of interpretation, and that interpretation-not resurrection-holds forth the promise of a future life. Nonetheless, the repeated losses that punctuate the Joseph narrative have inspired the opposite conclusion: that Joseph is a type of Jesus, that his descents and ascents prefigure the final one. Typology, a mode of biblical interpretation that prevailed during the early church, has enjoyed a recent revival in the context of literary studies; but I argue that the typological language of "fulfillment," of shadows and truth, is alien to Hebraic-and postmodern-understandings of textuality.<br>

Author(s): Williams Donald L.<br>
Abstract: Reason as the medium of truth and freedom-though suppressed, the idea returns; it is presumed by our very participation in discourse. Its opponents say that only practices are real. But, as Milton and Habermas know, reason is itself a practice. Milton's "free and lawful debate at all times... of what opinion soever" recognizes interestedness, perspectivity, and struggle; Habermas's unconstrained communication is a neverachieved goal (an "ideal") regulating discursive practices here and now. Both writers recognize that meanings are cultural, social, and existential, that knowledge cannot be separated from interests; but they do not therefore stand outside praxis rhapsodizing about struggle and contingency. Instead, they seek to move toward social freedom and individual autonomy through reason-able communication-that ongoing search for unforced agreement which is our usual and best alternative to violence, our usual and best way to find meaning in the world, in our selves, and in one another.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219800<br>

Author(s): Williams David K.<br>
Abstract: Historiography in Francoist Spain (1939-75) sought to affirm the morally and historically correct role of the regime within the flow of Spanish history. As an important vehicle of dissidence, the novel of memory stands in sharp contrast to Francoist history: it explores the past largely eschewed or appropriated by the regime and contests the so-called truths that Franco shaped through the discourse of myth. This essay examines the role of subjective memory as a challenge to historiography and discloses the narrative strategies novelists used to counter the government's myths. Unlike Francoist historiography, the novel of memory lays out history as a series of disruptions and undermines the referential illusion of truth and wholeness in our understanding of the past.<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i220980<br>
Date: 7 1, 1968<br>
Author(s): Womack JoAnn<br>
Abstract: The Mexican state's use of revolutionary history to invoke nationalistic sentiments nurtures a lively tradition of storytelling. Ironically, Buena Vista's storytellers criticize the inauthenticity of official representations of the past even as they draw on the images and ideals of "official" history to weave their own tales. This article argues that discourses of authenticity reinscribe historic distinctions between the community and the state in a language which evokes modern notions of purity and truth. The article highlights the political role of discourses of authenticity within the hegemonic structures of modern state power in Mexico.<br>

Abstract: A conflict is a relational space in crisis in which the antagonists determine, in an interactive dynamic, what is at stake. As the negotiation goes by, ego states his truth line, while alter builds his offensive line based on a truth that becomes reality. Defending one’s truth means also fighting for one’s integrity; in other words, defining my truth is also giving a structure to my integrity, to my own self. If the literature of the I has frequently conflicts in its pages, it is probably because the reading pact is tied up to the truth. But making a narrative of the self out of the configuration system can also get the text in another kind of conflict where the frontiers of the diegetic levels become more and more permeable. Despite everything, the illocutary power in autobiographic literature, seems to change the way the « I » sees himself, and gives him a new ethos that suits him fine.<br>

Abstract: Violent appropriation of sovereignty and the articulation of the experience of oppression are also at issue in M. NourbeSe Philip's
         She Tries Her Tongue, Her Silence Softly Breaks. Philip, a Canadian poet born in Moriah, Trinidad and Tobago, addresses the silencing and sexual assault of women in conjunction with colonial history in the Americas. The Ovidian figure of Philomela, who was raped and had her tongue torn out so that she could not relate what had happened to her, is central toShe Tries Her Tongue. Persephone's search for Ceres is another major theme. Philip foregrounds the problem of “the mother tongue” as she reworks Ovidian myths with excerpts from invented didactic texts (such as language tests, which are akin to those of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha'sDicteeor Myung-Mi Kim'sCommons, both of which also problematize language acquisition as an engine of hegemony). Some invented texts offer recommendations for the treatment of slaves: “Edict II: Every slave caught speaking his native language shall be severely punished. Where necessary, removal of the tongue is recommended. The offending organ, when removed, should be hung on high in a central place, so that all may see and tremble” (“Discourse on the Logic of Language”).
               Philip destabilizes the notion of a linguistically unified Caribbean history by mixing genres and weaving the demotic with Latin citations, as McMorris notes: “It's difficult to tell at first glance whether or not the poet has invented her ‘quoted’ texts, and this keeps things unsettled, shadowy, and undecided. In the later poems of the book, where the imitation of other genres takes place, we hover between belief and doubt, unable without a quantity of research to separate the fabrication from the real.

Abstract: He also envies those people who died in the dark, who did not have to “see the faces of their murderers.” Perhaps the advantage of the dead's not glimpsing the faces of their murderers is that the deceased would never realize the horror of the depravity of their fellow humans. It is this truth of human existence that the speaker, the survivor of the whole horror, has had to live with: “It is a sad story when one survives.” The speaker is perhaps guilty of having survived the horrors that consumed others. One of the ways to assuage that guilt is to defy the silence that surrounds the horror. Through him the poet seems to put the survivors to shame and guilt.<br>

Abstract: the early Europeans were pilgrims,
            prudentia peregrandi. They were taught languages aslanguae pereginae, that is, not language of a given territory but language necessary for the activity of traveling…. This vast universe, known only to a few people, absent from the sacred texts and of which Antiquity knew nothing could have provided a field of endless invention and exaggeration. But the writer's obligation to truth was the result of a hierarchical network of competition and political confrontation. No doubt the voyage of discovery should be situated historically between the medieval crusades which it miniaturises and the organization of the laboratory.

Abstract: Thus, fourth, it is crucial to realize that, however dramatically and emphatically Husserl trumpeted “transcendental consciousness” and its “absolute subjectivity” in
            Ideas I, and despite the continued use of these very terms up to the very end of his life, twenty years later the thrust of his last manuscript probing of the Truly Ultimate in the constitution of meaningful appearing and conscious experience drastically modulated the character and status of what “consciousness” and “subjectivity” must mean. For missing inIdeas I, as Husserl unambiguously points out, was an actual analysis of the “ultimate true Absolute”in whichtheapparent“absolute”—the “absolute consciousness” that gets all the attention inIdeas I—“has its origin [Urquelle]” and henceis not“in truth the ultimate.” And the ultimate true “Absolute” will only come clear when the factor of temporalization is finally investigatedas far as it is possible to goin this effort.

Article Title: Critical Theory<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: That period (1980–81) symbolized the end of the “then” period. Critical theory, with its close ties to the interpretation of Marx, was no longer front and center. But the idea of critique was still alive, or at least we thought that it could be kept alive given the ominous truth of criticism that associated critique and ideology (Gadamer). At least we tried. Some four years after the publication of the first issue of
            Cultural Hermeneutics, Reidel, the publisher, suddenly and with little warning discontinued the journal. Whether it was Reidel's penchant for the good life or that we were the lowest journal in the hierarchy I never knew, but this much was clear, unless something unusual happened my life as a journal editor was over. As I was mulling over what to do, a process that took months, I received a late-night call from a former graduate student who was on his way to a distinguished career. His question was simple: “Dave, if you give up, where are we going to get published?” I took the question seriously; I bit the bullet, as it were—whoever said something could not be created out of nothing—and I started a publishing company to privately publish my journal. And by the most unusual stroke of luck I and the grad students associated with me at the time changed the nameCultural HermeneuticstoPhilosophy and Social Criticism. Unbelievably the phrase “social criticism” had not yet caught the public's imagination, and the choice of title was a stroke of pure luck. Significantly this change of title marked a transition in my view of critical theory, as reflected in the new editorial statement: “In modern industrial society reason cannot be separated from practical life. At their interface a critical attitude is forged.” The statement, which now sounds a bit passé, though I still keep it on the masthead, takes its distance from the earlier phase of critical theory. No revolution in the nineteenth-century historical sense is to be expected here. Social critici~<br>

Abstract: By 1975 Don Ihde and Richard Zaner, who edited the fifth volume of selected papers from recent SPEP conferences, could write: “Phenomenology in the United States is in a state of ferment and change.”
         
               They began their book with Derrida's “The Copula Supplement” and noted that another “style” of philosophy “pertaining to language, signitive, and symbolic activity, and the relations of these to thought” had “begun to open the doors to themes introduced by the phenomenological and existential traditions”: “Jacques Derrida's opening essay on the copula supplement clearly represents one of the more radical approaches to language in Continental thought. Following Nietzsche and Heidegger, he calls into question the whole role of logic and grammar as it has related to the question of truth in Western philosophy.”2

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: More than a simple and obvious trope, hyperbole is a perspective that allows one to view the world otherwise through the use of excess and exaggeration. It is a mode of thought, a practice of excess, and an act of becoming. It can operate discursively, polemically, prophetically, paradoxically, and philosophically. It is a generator of meaning and being and a lens through which to view the world and the limits of knowledge differently. It is a disruptive force within language that always attempts to move beyond the insufficiency of thought and language while at the same time revealing the errant multiplicity and exorbitance of discourse through the abundance of excess. Hyperbole is a different kind of speech; through it a lie that is not a deception can be employed on the side of truth(s), which is always lacking and unstable, necessitating the abundance of excess.<br>

Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: To sketch how prefiguration works in public memory, I return briefly to the example of contemporary juvenile biographies. Such texts are shaped by enduring commonplaces of U.S. public culture that “prefigure” the narratives in the texts and thus render them intelligible on a basic level to members of that broader culture. Individual life stories become recognizable historical narratives because they resonate with late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century American perceptions of historical action. The introduction to the popular Americans All series of biographies provides an example. This widely circulated series published in the 1960s and 1970s features dozens of juvenile biographies. These books focus on individuals that have “uniquely contributed to the American way of life,” including figures such as Henry Ford, Martin Luther King Jr., and Sojourner Truth. Elaborating on these generic contributions, a short introduction to each text explains that “often despite great odds, these famous people have attained success in their fields through the good use of ability, determination, and hard work” (Patterson 1970, inside cover). Readers of this series learn not only about individual people; they learn about the public culture in which these lives were lived and in which these stories were constructed. As Ricoeur explains, “To understand a story is to understand both the language of ‘doing something’ and the cultural tradition from which proceeds the typology of plots” (1984, 1:57). The “language of ‘doing something’” that shapes children's biographies often stems from cultural assumptions about what it means to be historically significant. Did the subject have a lasting impact on society? Was she or he associated with other prominent figures? In American public culture, other values affect the way in which individual lives will be narrated: liberal individualism; the myth of progress and its individualized variant, “personal growth”; and the ideal of freedom, amo~<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Wixson Christopher<br>
Abstract: The issue begins with Bernard Dukore's “Environmental Shaw,” a pioneering piece that examines Shaw's views on a range of “green” topics, from pollution to clean air to alternative energy. Analyzing the degree to which Shaw is a part of nascent bionomic thought and activism at the time and how much he is formulating a distinctive vision that sets him ahead of the curve, Dukore persuasively positions Shaw as an environmentalist of sorts and thus raises a new set of questions about the ecology of his thinking and writing and its dialogue with public environmental discourse, then and now. In that sense, the essay inaugurates a novel line of inquiry and looks forward to future scholarship that will articulate ecocritical readings of individual plays and provide closer scrutiny of the ways in which Shaw's environmentalism intersected with (among other things) his socialism and feminism. Immediately following this introduction is a reproduction from
      The Chicagoan(1926–35), the windy city's brief counter-weekly to theNew Yorker. Photographer A. George Miller and artist Ben Schafer collaborated three times for the magazine in the early 1930s, supplying uniquely rendered visual profiles of famous people. Page 28 of the 1 June 1934 issue features a series of four of their photographs, each a shadow caricature created from repurposed ordinary, even abject objects. The “personalities photographed in the hard light of truth” are Walter Winchell, Primo Carnera (world heavyweight boxing champion 1933–34), John Barrymore, and GBS. The latter's, composed from “spinach and other greenage,” is titled “George Bernard Shaw, Vegetarian.” The combination of a “green” artist working in recycled materials and a literally “green” GBS struck me as a very apt visual supplement to Dukore's essay.<br>

Abstract: For example, Shaw could agree with Schopenhauer that the world is fundamentally Will and simultaneously reject his metaphysics of unmitigated pessimism. He could concur with Nietzsche that the Judeo-Christian God is a deceased phantom and that institutionalized religion is a repressive force but still devoutly believe in a limited and liberating divine-like creative Life Force that suffuses the cosmos and drives evolution. He could also vehemently reject Darwin in favor of Lamarck on the grounds that the former banished not only mind but hope from the universe, leaving everything to fickle chance, whereas the latter accommodated will, purpose, and effort in mapping the descent of species. And he could agree with Marx that capitalism is a pestilence and deny both the determinism inherent in dialectical materialism as well as the implication that capitalists per se are wicked. In another register, he could denounce vaccines and vivisectionists and still lobby for something like a National Health Service, staffed by professionals dedicated to keeping the nation healthy through certified medical practices, in contradistinction to the unscrupulous charlatans of the day, who exploited human misery by peddling snake oil cures. Similarly, he could chide scientists for mistaking the relation of cause and effect but praise Einstein for his discovery of the curvilinear universe. He could likewise doubt the veracity of the Bible as literal truth but cherish the redemptive dimensions of its symbols, metaphors, and parables. In this connection, he could eschew the idea that Jesus died sacrificially on the cross to expiate our sins vicariously, only to rise from the dead three days later, and at the same affirm that the Nazarene embodied, in his teachings and actions, the best roadmap we have to earthly salvation. And perhaps most important of all, he could see the ubiquity of evil yet nevertheless maintain that it was a contingent rather than a necessary fact of life—more a produ~<br>

Moreover, particularly in America, preaching is an important formal ancestor of many types of political rhetoric, from the Puritans to Martin Luther King Jr. Campaign rhetoric especially can fall into this category.<br>

Abstract: Joyce reminds us that this explicit admission of the counterfeit nature of the Utopian project has lain at the heart of literary manifestations of “Utopia” since Thomas More coined that self-emptying term—or indeed since More dubbed his perfection of all parliaments (in his Latin original)
