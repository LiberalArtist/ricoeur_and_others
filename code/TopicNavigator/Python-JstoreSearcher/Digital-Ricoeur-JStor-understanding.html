  Abstract: In
                  The Public and Its Problems(1927), John Dewey defended the ideal of strong publics. Challenging Walter Lippmann’s pessimistic assessment that modern states were far too complex to be managed by their citizens, Dewey offered a fluid understanding of democracy and the state that highlighted the critical role of robust “public interests.”¹ Yet, as his title suggests, Dewey’s optimism was tempered by a sense that the modern public was in trouble. In the context of expanding technology, bureaucratization, and a dehumanizing standardization of action and association, the public, he argued, was fragmenting. The problem for Dewey, as Robert Asen argues,<br>

  Abstract: This article is intended as a call for reform, but I must begin by confessing some uncertainty about what it is that I am attempting to reform. The fact is that I do not have a secure understanding about the state of the art as it is now practiced in teaching public speech. I have not made a survey of the methods now used in classroom instruction, nor undertaken a systematic study of the textbooks, and I have not reviewed the current scholarly literature.

  Book Title: To Become an American-Immigrants and Americanization Campaigns of the Early Twentieth Century<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hahner Leslie A.<br>
  Abstract: Pledging allegiance, singing the "Star-Spangled Banner," wearing a flag pin-these are all markers of modern patriotism, emblems that announce the devotion of American citizens. Most of these nationalistic performances were formulized during the early twentieth century and driven to new heights by the panic surrounding national identity during World War I. In
      To Become an AmericanLeslie A. Hahner argues that, in part, the Americanization movement engendered the transformation of patriotism during this period. Americanization was a massive campaign designed to fashion immigrants into perfect Americans-those who were loyal in word, deed, and heart. The larger outcome of this widespread movement was a dramatic shift in the nation's understanding of Americanism. Employing a rhetorical lens to analyze the visual and aesthetic practices of Americanization, Hahner contends that Americanization not only tutored students in the practices of citizenship but also created a normative visual metric that modified how Americans would come to understand, interpret, and judge their own patriotism and that of others.<br>

  Book Title: Mimetic Theory and World Religions-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schenk Richard<br>
  Abstract: Those who anticipated the demise of religion and the advent of a peaceful, secularized global village have seen the last two decades confound their predictions. René Girard's mimetic theory is a key to understanding the new challenges posed by our world of resurgent violence and pluralistic cultures and traditions. Girard sought to explain how the Judeo-Christian narrative exposes a founding murder at the origin of human civilization and demystifies the bloody sacrifices of archaic religions. Meanwhile, his book
      Sacrifice, a reading of conflict and sacrificial resolution in the Vedic Brahmanas, suggests that mimetic theory's insights also resonate with several non-Western religious and spiritual traditions. This volume collects engagements with Girard by scholars of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism and situates them within contemporary theology, philosophy, and religious studies.<br>

  Abstract: The subject of this essay is the role of fire and its explicit and implicit understandings in the Hindu and Buddhist traditions. At first glance, this appears to be a useful way of narrowing the scope of an essay that began with the impossible task of producing a mimetic analysis of Indian religions. But the scope thus narrowed is still much too broad to be manageable. As in Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism, and Judaism, the understanding of fire in the Hindu and Buddhist traditions is in equal measure heterogeneous, historically contingent, and (in some senses) foundational, which makes for a wide<br>

  Book Title: Executing Democracy-Volume One: Capital Punishment & the Making of America, 1683-1807<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hartnett Stephen John<br>
  Abstract: Executing Democracy: Capital Punishment & the Making of America, 1683-1807is the first volume of a rhetorical history of public debates about crime, violence, and capital punishment in America. This examination begins in 1683, when William Penn first struggled to govern the rowdy indentured servants of Philadelphia, and continues up until 1807, when the Federalists sought to impose law-and-order upon the New Republic.This volume offers a lively historical overview of how crime, violence, and capital punishment influenced the settling of the New World, the American Revolution, and the frantic post-war political scrambling to establish norms that would govern the new republic.By presenting a macro-historical overview, and by filling the arguments with voices from different political camps and communicative genres, Hartnett provides readers with fresh perspectives for understanding the centrality of public debates about capital punishment to the history of American democracy.<br>

  Book Title: Nosotros-A Study of Everyday Meanings in Hispano New Mexico<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): KORTE ALVIN O.<br>
  Abstract: Much knowledge and understanding can be generated from the experiences of everyday life. In this engaging study, Alvin O. Korte examines how this concept applies to Spanish-speaking peoples adapted to a particular locale, specifically the Hispanos and Hispanas of northern New Mexico. Drawing on social philosopher Alfred Schutz's theory of typification, Korte looks at how meaning and identity are crafted by quotidian activities. Incorporating phenomenological and ethnomethodological strategies, the author investigates several aspects of local Hispano culture, including the oral tradition, leave-taking, death and remembrances of the dead, spirituality, and the circle of life. Although avoiding a social-problems approach, the book devotes necessary attention to

  Abstract: Joseph Campbell raises an interesting question about the differing views of death in planting cultures, on the one hand, and hunting and forest cultures, on the other. Planting cultures turn to the plant as a metaphor for understanding death. The self-regenerative powers of the plant mean that its nature can be characterized as “continuing inbeingness.” Pruning is helpful to a plant because it stimulates new growth. Out of the rot in a forest comes new life. Cut a branch from a tree, and new suckers appear in profusion. They are the “bright new little children who are part of the<br>

  Abstract: What, exactly, is knowledge of music? And what does it tell us about humanistic knowledge in general?
      The Thought of Musicgrapples directly with these fundamental questions-questions especially compelling at a time when humanistic knowledge is enmeshed in debates about its character and future. In this third volume in a trilogy on musical understanding that includesInterpreting MusicandExpression and Truth, Lawrence Kramer seeks answers in both thoughtaboutmusic and thoughtinmusic-thinking in tones. He skillfully assesses musical scholarship in the aftermath of critical musicology and musical hermeneutics and in view of more recent concerns with embodiment, affect, and performance. This authoritative and timely work challenges the prevailing conceptions of every topic it addresses: language, context, and culture; pleasure and performance; and, through music, the foundations of understanding in the humanities.<br>

  Abstract: Musicology is now well into its second revolution in as many decades. So it seems, at any rate, from a North American perspective. When the 1990s ushered in critical musicology, the so-called New Musicology, with its cultural and hermeneutic interests, the more introverted vocabularies that had long set the terms of musical understanding began to break down. Talk about music took on forms previously limited or prohibited; it made sense in terms that would formerly have been spurned as nonsense. The old vocabularies were sometimes put to new uses and sometimes put in the attic. Music thus entered the world,<br>

  Book Title: Interpreting Music-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Kramer Lawrence<br>
  Abstract: Interpreting Musicis a comprehensive essay on understanding musical meaning and performing music meaningfully-"interpreting music" in both senses of the term. Synthesizing and advancing two decades of highly influential work, Lawrence Kramer fundamentally rethinks the concepts of work, score, performance, performativity, interpretation, and meaning-even the very concept of music-while breaking down conventional wisdom and received ideas. Kramer argues that music, far from being closed to interpretation, is ideally open to it, and that musical interpretation is the paradigm of interpretation in general. The book illustrates the many dimensions of interpreting music through a series of case studies drawn from the classical repertoire, but its methods and principles carry over to other repertoires just as they carry beyond music by workingthroughmusic to wider philosophical and cultural questions.<br>

  Abstract: Not so long ago the question would never have come up. Musicology was self-validating. It was grounded in a fixed conception of Western identity that it also helped perpetuate. Like the music it studied, primarily Western art music, it served the values of the humanistic tradition embodied in both the modern university and the high culture of a great civilization. It accumulated knowledge for deposit in a stable cultural archive that could support continuities of practice and understanding across time.

  Abstract: The question of whether people can decide to believe not only affects our understanding of Evangelicalism and empowerment in Latin America; it runs through the center of contemporary sociological research on culture and religion. In the past twenty-five years approaches that portray people as strategic actors who consciously choose their meanings have reinvigorated the sociology of culture and religion after the decline of the modernization and secularization theories of the 1950s and 1960s. However, these approaches are increasingly being criticized as reductionist, incoherent, or incomplete by scholars who recommend a return to emphases on religion and culture as autonomous symbolic<br>

  Abstract: Subjective experiences of clinical scientists who produce and deliver high-technology medicine and of patients who receive treatment via this technology are fundamental to understanding the political economy and culture of hope that underlie bioscience and biomedicine. In this essay, I examine interpretive concepts linking bioscience and biotechnology and their societal institutions to subjective experience.

  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): OBEYESEKERE GANANATH<br>
  Abstract: With
      Imagining Karma,Gananath Obeyesekere embarks on the very first comparison of rebirth concepts across a wide range of cultures. Exploring in rich detail the beliefs of small-scale societies of West Africa, Melanesia, traditional Siberia, Canada, and the northwest coast of North America, Obeyesekere compares their ideas with those of the ancient and modern Indic civilizations and with the Greek rebirth theories of Pythagoras, Empedocles, Pindar, and Plato. His groundbreaking and authoritative discussion decenters the popular notion that India was the origin and locus of ideas of rebirth. As Obeyesekere compares responses to the most fundamental questions of human existence, he challenges readers to reexamine accepted ideas about death, cosmology, morality, and eschatology. Obeyesekere's comprehensive inquiry shows that diverse societies have come through independent invention or borrowing to believe in reincarnation as an integral part of their larger cosmological systems. The author brings together into a coherent methodological framework the thought of such diverse thinkers as Weber, Wittgenstein, and Nietzsche. In a contemporary intellectual context that celebrates difference and cultural relativism, this book makes a case for disciplined comparison, a humane view of human nature, and a theoretical understanding of "family resemblances" and differences across great cultural divides.<br>

  Abstract: The essays assembled here represent forty years of reflection about the European cultural past by an eminent historian. The volume concentrates on the Renaissance and Reformation, while providing a lens through which to view problems of perennial interest.
      A Usable Pastis a book of unusual scope, touching on such topics as political thought and historiography, metaphysical and practical conceptions of order, the relevance of Renaissance humanism to Protestant thought, the secularization of European culture, the contributions of particular professional groups to European civilization, and the teaching of history. The essays inA Usable Pastare unified by a set of common concerns. William Bouwsma has always resisted the pretensions to science that have shaped much recent historical scholarship and made the work of historians increasingly specialized and inaccessible to lay readers. Following Friedrich Nietzsche, he argues that since history is a kind of public utility, historical research should contribute to the self-understanding of society.<br>

  Book Title: Reconfiguring Modernity-Concepts of Nature in Japanese Political Ideology<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Thomas Julia Adeney<br>
  Abstract: Julia Adeney Thomas turns the concept of nature into a powerful analytical lens through which to view Japanese modernity, bringing the study of both Japanese history and political modernity to a new level of clarity. She shows that nature necessarily functions as a political concept and that changing ideas of nature's political authority were central during Japan's transformation from a semifeudal world to an industrializing colonial empire. In political documents from the nineteenth to the early twentieth century, nature was redefined, moving from the universal, spatial concept of the Tokugawa period, through temporal, social Darwinian ideas of inevitable progress and competitive struggle, to a celebration of Japan as a nation uniquely in harmony with nature. The so-called traditional "Japanese love of nature" masks modern state power. Thomas's theoretically sophisticated study rejects the supposition that modernity is the ideological antithesis of nature, overcoming the determinism of the physical environment through technology and liberating denatured subjects from the chains of biology and tradition. In making "nature" available as a critical term for political analysis, this book yields new insights into prewar Japan's failure to achieve liberal democracy, as well as an alternative means of understanding modernity and the position of non-Western nations within it.<br>

  Book Title: The Wherewithal of Life-Ethics, Migration, and the Question of Well-Being<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Ouédraogo Ibrahim<br>
  Abstract: The Wherewithal of Lifeengages with current developments in the anthropology of ethics and migration studies to explore in empirical depth and detail the life experiences of three young men - a Ugandan migrant in Copenhagen, a Burkina Faso migrant in Amsterdam, and a Mexican migrant in Boston - in ways that significantly broaden our understanding of the existential situations and ethical dilemmas of those migrating from the global south. Michael Jackson offers the first biographically based phenomenological account of migration and mobility, providing new insights into the various motives, tactics, dilemmas, dreams, and disappointments that characterize contemporary migration. It is argued that the quandaries of African or Mexican migrants are not unique to people moving between 'traditional' and 'modern' worlds. While more intensely felt by the young, seeking to find a way out of a world of limited opportunity and circumscribed values, the experiences of transition are familiar to us all, whatever our age, gender, ethnicity or social status - namely, the impossibility of calculating what one may lose in leaving a settled life or home place; what one may gain by risking oneself in an alien environment; the difficulty of striking a balance between personal fulfillment and the moral claims of kinship; and the struggle to know the difference between 'concrete' and 'abstract' utopias (the first reasonable and worth pursuing; the second hopelessly unattainable).<br>

Understanding their emergence in the nineteenth century requires a sociological examination of how the humanities managed to maintain academic autonomy while at the same time demonstrating social relevance.<br>

  Abstract: Doctrinal development may be an inevitable, even essential element of the theological task as it has been practiced for nearly two millennia, but explicit theoretical reflection on the nature of this phenomenon is a relatively recent feature in Christian thought. The history of evangelical attention to the problem of development is much shorter, because, as we shall see, Roman Catholic theologians began addressing the issue much earlier than their Protestant and evangelical counterparts.

  Book Title: The Mission of Demythologizing-Rudolf Bultmann's Dialectical Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Congdon David W.<br>
  Abstract: Since 1941, Rudolf Bultmann’s program of demythologizing has been the subject of constant debate, widely held to indicate Bultmann’s departure from the dialectical theology he once shared with Karl Barth. In the 1950s, Barth referred to their relationship as that of a whale and an elephant: incapable of meaningful communication. This study proposes a contrary reading of demythologizing as the hermeneutical fulfillment of dialectical theology on the basis of a reinterpretation of Barth’s theological project. As such, the volume argues that dialectical theology is fundamentally governed by a missionary logic. Bultmann’s hermeneutical theology extends this dialectical, missionary theology into the field of interpretation. Contrary to many critics, the message of God’s saving work in Christ, and not modern science, funds Bultmann’s hermeneutical program. Like Barth’s own revolution, Bultmann’s program addresses a false relation between gospel and culture. Negatively, demythologizing is a program of deconstantinizing, opposing the objectifying conflation of kerygma and culture that he calls “myth.” Positively, demythologizing is a form of intercultural hermeneutics, composed of preunderstanding and self-understanding. Demythologizing is therefore a missionary hermeneutic of intercultural translation.<br>

  Book Title: Writing Theologically-  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Barreto Eric D.<br>
  Abstract: Of course, by writing we refer to the kinds of reflections, essays, and exams students will have to complete in the seminary classroom. But writing also encompasses the many modes of communication and self-discovery that creative expression can unlock. Writing Theologically introduces writing not just as an academic exercise but as a way for students to communicate the good news in rapidly changing contexts, as well as to discover and craft their own sense of vocation and identity. Most important will be guiding students to how they might begin to claim and hone a distinctive theological voice that is particularly attuned to the contexts of writer and audience alike. In a collection of brief, readable essays, this volume, edited by Eric D. Barreto, emphasizes the vital skills, practices, and values involved in writing theologically. That is, how might students prepare themselves to communicate effectively and creatively, clearly and beautifully, the insights they gather during their time in seminary? Each contribution includes practical advice about best practices in writing theologically; however, the book also stresses why writing is vital in the self-understanding of the minister, as well as her or his public communication of the good news.<br>

  Book Title: Lyric Apocalypse: Milton, Marvell, and the Nature of Events-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Netzley Ryan<br>
  Abstract: What's new about the apocalypse? Revelation does not allow us to look back after the end and enumerate pivotal turning points. It happens in an immediate encounter with the transformatively new. John Milton's and Andrew Marvell's lyrics attempt to render the experience of such an apocalyptic change in the present. In this respect they take seriously the Reformation's insistence that eschatology is a historical phenomenon. Yet these poets are also reacting to the Regicide, and, as a result, their works explore very modern questions about the nature of events, what it means for a significant historical occasion to happen. Lyric Apocalypse argues that Milton's and Marvell's lyrics challenge any retrospective understanding of events, including one built on a theory of revolution. Instead, these poems show that there is no "after" to the apocalypse, that if we are going to talk about change, we should do so in the present, when there is still time to do something about it. For both of these poets, lyric becomes a way to imagine an apocalyptic event that would be both hopeful and new.<br>

  Book Title: Ostension-Word Learning and the Embodied Mind<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelland Chad<br>
  Abstract: Ostension is bodily movement that manifests our engagement with things, whether we wish it to or not. Gestures, glances, facial expressions: all betray our interest in something. Ostension enables our first word learning, providing infants with a prelinguistic way to grasp the meaning of words. Ostension is philosophically puzzling; it cuts across domains seemingly unbridgeable -- public--private, inner--outer, mind--body. In this book, Chad Engelland offers a philosophical investigation of ostension and its role in word learning by infants. Engelland discusses ostension (distinguishing it from ostensive definition) in contemporary philosophy, examining accounts by Quine, Davidson, and Gadamer, and he explores relevant empirical findings in psychology, evolutionary anthropology, and neuroscience. He offers original studies of four representative historical thinkers whose work enriches the understanding of ostension: Wittgenstein, Merleau-Ponty, Augustine, and Aristotle. And, building on these philosophical and empirical foundations, Engelland offers a meticulous analysis of the philosophical issues raised by ostension. He examines the phenomenological problem of whether embodied intentions are manifest or inferred; the problem of what concept of mind allows ostensive cues to be intersubjectively available; the epistemological problem of how ostensive cues, notoriously ambiguous, can be correctly understood; and the metaphysical problem of the ultimate status of the key terms in his argument: animate movement, language, and mind. Finally, he argues for the centrality of manifestation in philosophy. Taking ostension seriously, he proposes, has far-reaching implications for thinking about language and the practice of philosophy.<br>

  Abstract: Plato marked a turning point in the appreciation of language by philosophers. In the

Accordingly, philosophical knowledge comes from inquiring into the natures of things rather than from learning to speak. Despite discovering the conventionality of language, Plato still accords speech a crucial role. Insight into the nature of things occurs by means of a conversation carried out with conventional terms: “For this knowledge is not something that can be put into words like other sciences;<br>

  Book Title: Aspects of Alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the Contemporary Debate-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Every other is truly other, but no other is wholly other.This is the claim that Aspects of Alterity defends. Taking up the question of otherness that so fascinates contemporary continental philosophy, this book asks what it means for something or someone to be other than the self. Levinas and those influenced by him point out that the philosophical tradition of the West has generally favored the self at the expense of the other. Such a self-centered perspective never encounters the other qua other, however. In response, postmodern thought insists on the absolute otherness of the other, epitomized by the deconstructive claim every other is wholly other.But absolute otherness generates problems and aporias of its own. This has led some thinkers to reevaluate the notion of relative otherness in light of the postmodern critique, arguing for a chiastic account that does justice to both the alterity and the similitude of the other. These latter two positions-absolute otherness and a rehabilitated account of relative otherness-are the main contenders in the contemporary debate.The philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Gabriel Marcel provide the point of embarkation for coming to understand the two positions on this question. Levinas and Marcel were contemporaries whose philosophies exhibit remarkably similar concern for the other but nevertheless remain fundamentally incompatible. Thus, these two thinkers provide a striking illustration of both the proximity of and the unbridgeable gap between two accounts of otherness.Aspects of Alterity delves into this debate, first in order understand the issues at stake in these two positions and second to determine which description better accounts for the experience of encountering the other.After a thorough assessment and critique of otherness in Levinas's and Marcel's work, including a discussion of the relationship of ethical alterity to theological assumptions, Aspects of Alterity traces the transmission and development of these ~<br>

  Book Title: Veiled Desires: Intimate Portrayals of Nuns in Postwar Anglo-American Film-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SABINE MAUREEN<br>
  Abstract: A provocative, interdisciplinary study of nuns on the big screen, from The Bells of St. Mary's (1945) to Doubt (2008), that shines fresh light on the cinematic nun as a woman and a religious in the twentieth century. Ingrid Bergman's engaging screen performance as Sister Mary Benedict in The Bells of St. Mary's made the film nun a star and her character a shining standard of comparison. She represented the religious life as the happy and rewarding choice of a modern woman who had a "complete understanding" of both erotic and spiritual desire. How did this vibrant and mature nun figure come to be viewed as girlish and naive? Why have she and her cinematic sisters in postwar popular film so often been stereotyped or selectively analyzed, so seldom been seen as women and religious? In Veiled Desires--a unique full-length, in-depth study of nuns in film--Maureen Sabine explores these questions in a groundbreaking interdisciplinary study covering more than sixty years of cinema. She looks at an impressive breadth of films in which the nun features as an ardent lead character, including The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), Black Narcissus (1947), Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957), Sea Wife (1957), The Nun's Story (1959), The Sound of Music (1965), Change of Habit (1969), In This House of Brede (1975), Agnes of God (1985), Dead Man Walking (1995), and Doubt (2008). Veiled Desires considers how the beautiful and charismatic stars who play chaste nuns, from Ingrid Bergman and Audrey Hepburn to Susan Sarandon and Meryl Streep, call attention to desires that the veil concealed and the habit was thought to stifle. In a theologically and psychoanalytically informed argument, Sabine responds to the critics who have pigeonholed the film nun as the obedient daughter and religious handmaiden of a patriarchal church, and the respectful audience who revered her as an icon of spiritual perfection. She provides a framework for a more complex and holistic picture of nuns on screen by showing h~<br>

  Book Title: Regard for the Other: Autothanatography in Rousseau, De Quincey, Baudelaire, and Wilde-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt E. S.<br>
  Abstract: Although much has been written on autobiography, the same cannot be said of autothanatography, the writing of one's death. This study starts from the deconstructive premise that autobiography is aporetic, not or not only a matter of a subject strategizing with language to produce an exemplary identity but a matter also of its responding to an exorbitant call to write its death. The I-dominated representations of particular others and of the privileged other to whom a work is addressed, must therefore be set against an alterity plaguing the I from within or shadowing it from without. This alterity makes itself known in writing as the potential of the text to carry messages that remain secret to the confessing subject. Anticipation of the potential for the confessional text to say what Augustine calls the secret I do not know,the secret of death, engages the autothanatographical subject in a dynamic, inventive, and open-ended process of identification. The subject presented in these texts is not one that has already evolved an interior life that it seeks to reveal to others, but one that speaks to us as still in process. Through its exorbitant response, it gives intimations of an interiority and an ethical existence to come. Baudelaire emerges as a central figure for this understanding of autobiography as autothanatography through his critique of the narcissism of a certain Rousseau, his translation of De Quincey's confessions, with their vertiginously ungrounded subject-in-construction, his artistic practice of self-conscious, thorough-going doubleness, and his service to Wilde as model for an aporetic secrecy. The author discusses the interruption of narrative that must be central to the writing of one's death and addresses the I's dealings with the aporias of such structuring principles as secrecy, Levinasian hospitality, or interiorization as translation. The book makes a strong intervention in the debate over one of the most-read genres of our time.<br>

  Abstract: “Reading” is a term that, through overuse, can easily become confused with interpretation. In fact, there is a crucial difference: Reading involves the undoing of interpretative figures; because it is not an operation opposed to the understanding but rather a precondition for it, it allows us to question whether the synthetic moves of the understanding can close off a text. It leads away from meaning to such problems as the text’s constitution and meaning generation.

  Book Title: Human Rights, Inc.: The World Novel, Narrative Form, and International Law-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SLAUGHTER JOSEPH R.<br>
  Abstract: In this timely study of the historical, ideological, and formal interdependencies of the novel and human rights, Joseph Slaughter demonstrates that the twentieth-century rise of world literatureand international human rights law are related phenomena. Slaughter argues that international law shares with the modern novel a particular conception of the human individual. The Bildungsroman, the novel of coming of age, fills out this image, offering a conceptual vocabulary, a humanist social vision, and a narrative grammar for what the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and early literary theorists both call the free and full development of the human personality. Revising our received understanding of the relationship between law and literature, Slaughter suggests that this narrative form has acted as a cultural surrogate for the weak executive authority of international law, naturalizing the assumptions and conditions that make human rights appear commonsensical. As a kind of novelistic correlative to human rights law, the Bildungsroman has thus been doing some of the sociocultural work of enforcement that the law cannot do for itself. This analysis of the cultural work of law and of the social work of literature challenges traditional Eurocentric histories of both international law and the dissemination of the novel. Taking his point of departure in Goethe's Wilhelm Meister, Slaughter focuses on recent postcolonial versions of the coming-of-age story to show how the promise of human rights becomes legible in narrative and how the novel and the law are complicit in contemporary projects of globalization: in colonialism, neoimperalism, humanitarianism, and the spread of multinational consumer capitalism.Slaughter raises important practical and ethical questions that we must confront in advocating for human rights and reading world literature-imperatives that, today more than ever, are intertwined.<br>

  Abstract: Modern environmentalism has come to realize that many of its key concerns "wilderness" and "nature" among them are contested territory, viewed differently by different people. Understanding nature requires science and ecology, to be sure, but it also requires a sensitivity tom, history, culture, and narrative. Thus, understanding nature is a fundamentally hermeneutic task.<br>

  Book Title: The Architecture of Concepts: The Historical Formation of Human Rights-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): de Bolla Peter<br>
  Abstract: The Architecture of Concepts proposes a radically new way of understanding the history of ideas. Taking as its example human rights, it develops a distinctive kind of conceptual analysis that enables us to see with precision how the concept of human rights was formed in the eighteenth century. The first chapter outlines an innovative account of concepts as cultural entities. The second develops an original methodology for recovering the historical formation of the concept of human rights based on data extracted from digital archives. This enables us to track the construction of conceptual architectures over time. Having established the architecture of the concept of human rights, the book then examines two key moments in its historical formation: the First Continental Congress in 1775 and the publication of Tom Paine's Rights of Man in 1792. Arguing that we have yet to fully understand or appreciate the consequences of the eighteenth-century invention of the concept "rights of man," the final chapter addresses our problematic contemporary attempts to leverage human rights as the most efficacious way of achieving universal equality<br>

  Book Title: Written Voices, Spoken Signs-Tradition, Performance, and the Epic Text<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAHANE AHUVIA<br>
  Abstract: These innovative essays by leading scholars of Homer, oral poetics, and epic invite us to rethink some key concepts for an understanding of traditional epic poetry. Egbert Bakker examines the epic performer's use of time and tense in recounting a past that is alive. Tackling the question of full-length performance of the monumental
         Iliad, Andrew Ford considers the extent to which the work was perceived as a coherent whole in the archaic age. John Miles Foley addresses questions about spoken signs and the process of reference in epic discourse, and Ahuvia Kahane studies rhythm as a semantic factor in the Homeric performance. Richard Martin suggests a new range of performance functions for the Homeric simile. And Gregory Nagy establishes the importance of one feature of epic language, the ellipsis. These six essays centered on Homer engage with fundamental issues that are addressed by three essays primarily concerned with medieval epic: those by Franz BÃƒÂ¤uml on the concept of fact; by Wulf Oesterreicher on types of orality; and by Ursula Schaefer on written and spoken media. In their Introduction the editors highlight the underlying approach and viewpoints of this collaborative volume.Reviews of this book:"Despite its wide range of topics and approaches, the volume has a clear thematic focus. All contributors seek to leave behind the more formal concerns of past generations of scholars and aim instead at an understanding of orality as that which is (conceptually or actually) close, immediate, or performed. In their joint search for the new picture, classicists, linguists, and medievalists discover a range of different 'oralities'."<br>

But, surprisingly, though translations of his writings have appeared in over 160 editions in 16 countries, his strictly philosophical work has hitherto been largely inaccessible to American audiences. Even where adequate English translations exist, the difficulties imposed by Jaspers' involved reasoning, intricate style, and ingenious neologisms are such that few unfamiliar with Continental philosophy can hope to acquire an understanding of his ideas on their own.<br>

  Book Title: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan-Modernity, Loss, and the Doing of History<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Karlin Jason G.<br>
  Abstract: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan is a historical analysis of the discourses of nostalgia in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japan. Through an analysis of the experience of rapid social change in Japan’s modernization, it argues that fads (ryūkō) and the desires they express are central to understanding Japanese modernity, conceptions of gender, and discourses of nationalism. In doing so, the author uncovers the myth of eternal return that lurks below the surface of Japanese history as an expression of the desire to find meaning amid the chaos and alienation of modern times. The Meiji period (1868–1912) was one of rapid change that hastened the process of forgetting: The state’s aggressive program of modernization required the repression of history and memory. However, repression merely produced new forms of desire seeking a return to the past, with the result that competing or alternative conceptions of the nation haunted the history of modern Japan. Rooted in the belief that the nation was a natural and organic entity that predated the rational, modern state, such conceptions often were responses to modernity that envisioned the nation in opposition to the modern state. What these visions of the nation shared was the ironic desire to overcome the modern condition by seeking the timeless past. While the condition of their repression was often linked to the modernizing policies of the Meiji state, the means for imagining the nation in opposition to the state required the construction of new symbols that claimed the authority of history and appealed to a rearticulated tradition. Through the idiom of gender and nation, new reified representations of continuity, timelessness, and history were fashioned to compensate for the unmooring of inherited practices from the shared locales of everyday life. This book examines the intellectual, social, and cultural factors that contributed to the rapid spread of Western tastes and styles, along with the backlash again~<br>

  Author(s): Park Albert L.<br>
  Abstract: Why and how did Korean religious groups respond to growing rural poverty, social dislocation, and the corrosion of culture caused by forces of modernization under strict Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945)? Questions about religion's relationship and response to capitalism, industrialization, urbanization, and secularization lie at the heart of understanding the intersection between colonialism, religion, and modernity in Korea. Yet, getting answers to these questions has been a challenge because of narrow historical investigations that fail to study religious processes in relation to political, economic, social, and cultural developments. In
      Building a Heaven on Earth, Albert L. Park studies the progressive drives by religious groups to contest standard conceptions of modernity and forge a heavenly kingdom on the Korean peninsula to relieve people from fierce ruptures in their everyday lives. The results of his study will reconfigure the debates on colonial modernity, the origins of faith-based social activism in Korea, and the role of religion in a modern world.<br>

  Book Title: Italian Irish Filmmakers-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lourdeaux Lee<br>
  Abstract: "This penetrating study examines how these filmmakers confronted their cultural heritage and used it as a counterpoint to their depiction of mainstream America." --American Cinematographer In this unique film history, Lee Lourdeaux traces the impact of Irish and Italian cultures on four major American directors and their work. Defining the core values and tensions within each culture, and especially focusing on the influence of American Catholicism, he presents John Ford, Frank Capra, Francis Coppola, and Martin Scorsese as ethnic Americans and film artists. Lourdeaux shows each filmmaker on set with writers and actors, learning to bypass stereotypes in order to develop a shrewd reciprocal assimilation between his ethnic background and Anglo America. Beginning with D. W. Griffith's depiction of Irish and Italian immigrants, the author discusses Hollywood's stereotypical portrayals of ethnic priests, cops, politicians, and gangsters, as well as their surface acculturation in the movies of the 1920s. By the decade's end, John Ford was using all-American stories to embody the basic myths and tensions of Irish-American life. In his later westerns and foreign films, he tried to understand both Irish political strife and the key figures of Irish liturgy. Frank Capra pitted Italian family values against the Anglo success ethic, turning out social comedies about oppressed little people. Several decades later, Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola were highly critical of their religio-ethnic heritage, though they gradually discovered that to outline its weaknesses, like the blind pursuit of success, was to fashion a critical mirror of mainstream America. Lourdeaux discusses a number of recent films by Coppola and by Scorsese that have not yet been analyzed in any book. And, in the chapter on Scorsese, a personal interview with the director reveals how his ethnic childhood shaped his work in film. Examining the conflicts within American culture, Lourdeaux shows how the filmmake~<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14btb53">The Strange Music of Social Life</a><br>
  Author(s) BELL MICHAEL M.<br>
  Abstract: Michael Bell’s proposal for a “dialogic sociology” (this volume) is a response to what he perceives to be an obsession in the discipline with “total explanation,” which means that the sociological researcher attempts to develop a comprehensive understanding of a phenomenon using a conceptual apparatus that emphasizes causality, predictability, objectivity, and neutrality. He argues that sociologists are so preoccupied with discovering whether their preconceptions about social life are correct that they do not attempt to understand the social conditions in which people behave in ways that sociologists do not expect.<br>

  Book Title: Meaning and Context in the Thanksgiving Hymns-Linguistic and Rhetorical Perspectives on a Collection of Prayers from Qumran<br>

  Abstract: Hasselbalch asserts that current theories about the social background of Thanksgiving Hymns are unable to explain its heterogeneous character. Instead the author suggests a reading strategy that leaves presumptions about the underlying social contexts aside to instead consider the collection's hybridity as a clue to understanding the collection as a whole.<br>

  Abstract: This book is basically a study of how we can, or cannot, access the contexts of ancient texts—in this case 1QHodayot

More specifically, I have attempted to reach a meaningful explanation for the heterogeneous character of 1QHodayota. So far, explanations have been based on the notion that differences between the so-called Leader Hymns and the so-called Community Hymns mirror a social dichotomy, and that the one group of hymns was spoken by the community leadership, whereas the other was<br>

  Abstract: The metaphorical in language is now a starting place for any of us who wish to write.

When we think of the Pacific we can think in diagrammatic terms, for example, of circles, circles within circles, webs of open space; we can think of more pictorial metaphors, like far-reaching ropes, nets of enormous size, waves or nested ripples of ocean water; we can think<br>

  Abstract: The field of pastoral theology and care has been conceptualized as a form of religious response to human suffering. It is said that our research begins “at the point where human suffering evokes or calls for a religious response and sometimes at the point where a religious response is given and/or experienced.”¹ In light of this widely shared understanding, it is not surprising that, with a few important exceptions,² joy is as understudied in this field as it is in the other theological disciplines represented in this volume.

  Book Title: The Homebrewed Christianity Guide to Jesus-Lord, Liar, Lunatic…Or Awesome?<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): FULLER TRIPP<br>
  Abstract: Christology is crazy. It’s rather absurd to identify a first-century homeless Jew as God revealed, but a bunch of us do anyway. In this book, Tripp Fuller examines the historical Jesus, the development of the doctrine of Christ, the questions that drove christological innovations through church history, contemporary constructive proposals, and the predicament of belief for the church today. Recognizing that the battle over Jesus is no longer a public debate between the skeptic and believer but an internal struggle in the heart of many disciples, he argues that we continue to make christological claims about more than an “event" or simply the “Jesus of history." On the other hand, C. S. Lewis’s infamous “liar, lunatic, and Lord" scheme is no longer intellectually tenable. This may be a guide to Jesus, but for Christians, Fuller is guiding us toward a deeper understanding of God. He thinks it’s good news—good news about a God who is so invested in the world that God refuses to be God without us.<br>

  Book Title: Citizenship in Heaven and on Earth-Karl Barth's Ethics<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Massmann Alexander<br>
  Abstract: While Karl Barth is one of the most significant theologians of the twentieth century, his contribution to ethics is less well known and subject to controversy among interpreters. Barth combined his commitment to the church and its particular task in faith and theology with a concern for ethics and politics in wider society. By examining the historical development of Barth’s ethics, this study traces the vital influences and considerable shifts in Barth’s understanding of the ethical task, situating him within his political context. Alexander Massmann provides a comprehensive explication and assessment of the full scope of Barth’s ethics, from the first edition of the Romans commentary to the final volume of the Church Dogmatics. General questions of Barth’s methodology in ethics and case studies in applied ethics are both analyzed in their intricate connection to his dogmatic thought. The study highlights how an ethical approach emerged in which the freedom of the gospel allows for considerable openness to empirical insights from other disciplines. The author reevaluates Barth’s ethics in a constructive vision of the role of the church in the quest for a just society.<br>

  Book Title: Acceptable words-Essays on the poetry of Geoffrey Hill<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): WAINWRIGHT JEFFREY<br>
  Abstract: Geoffrey Hill has said that some great poetry 'recognises that words fail us'. These essays explore Hill's struggle over fifty years with the recalcitrance of language. This book seeks to show how all his work is marked by the quest for the right pitch of utterance whether it is sorrowing, angry, satiric or erotic. It shows how Hill's words are never lightly 'acceptable' but an ethical act, how he seeks out words he can stand by - words that are 'getting it right'. This book is the most comprehensive and up-to-date critical work on Geoffrey Hill so far, covering all his work up to ‘Scenes from Comus’ (2005), as well as some poems yet to appear in book form. It aims to contribute something to the understanding of his poetry among those who have followed it for many years and students and other readers encountering this major poet for the first time.<br>

  Abstract: The divergent interpretations of the relationship between music and language in modernity are inseparable from the main divergences between philosophical conceptions of language. The attempt to explain language in representational terms in the empiricist tradition that eventually leads to analytical philosophy, and the understanding of language as a form of social action and as constitutive of the world we inhabit in the hermeneutic tradition give rise to very different conceptions of music. One paradigmatic contrast has emerged in the preceding chapters, which can somewhat crudely be summarised as follows. On the one hand, music can be regarded as a deficient<br>

  Abstract: In

By engaging with the contemporary apocalyptic turn in Caribbean studies and lived reality, he not only provides important historical contextualization for a general understanding of apocalypse in the region but also offers an account of the state of Haitian society and culture in the decades before the 2010 earthquake. Inherently interdisciplinary, his work ranges widely through Caribbean and Haitian thought, historiography, political discourse, literature, film, religion, and ecocriticism in its exploration of whether culture in these various forms can shape the future of a country.<br>

  Abstract: The contributors uncover the narratives at the center of their essays through qualitative interviews, ethnographic fieldwork, and written archives, and they scrutinize narrative structure and meaning by analyzing genres, plots, metaphors, and other components of storytelling. In doing so, they reveal the cognitive, ideological, and institutional mechanisms by which narratives promote harmful action. Finally, they consider how offenders' narratives are linked to and emerge from those of conventional society or specific subcultures. Each chapter reveals important insights and elements for the development of a framework of narrative criminology as an important approach for understanding crime and criminal justice. An unprecedented and landmark collection,
      Narrative Criminologyopens the door for an exciting new field of study on the role of stories in motivating and legitimizing harm.<br>

  Book Title: The Secret Life of Stories-From Don Quixote to Harry Potter, How Understanding Intellectual Disability Transforms the Way We Read<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Bérubé Michael<br>
  Abstract: In
      The Secret Life of Stories, Michael Bérubé tells a dramatically different tale, in a compelling account of how an understanding of intellectual disability can transform our understanding of narrative. Instead of focusing on characters with disabilities, he shows how ideas about intellectual disability inform an astonishingly wide array of narrative strategies, providing a new and startling way of thinking through questions of time, self-reflexivity, and motive in the experience of reading. Interweaving his own stories with readings of such texts as Faulkner'sThe Sound and the Fury, Haddon'sThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, Kingston'sThe Woman Warrior, and Philip K. Dick'sMartian Time-Slip, Bérubé puts his theory into practice, stretching the purview of the study of literature and the role of disability studies within it. Armed only with the tools of close reading, Bérubé demonstrates the immensely generative possibilities in the ways disability is deployed within fiction, finding in them powerful meditations on what it means to be a social being, a sentient creature with an awareness of mortality and causality-and sentience itself. Persuasive and witty, Michael Bérubé engages Harry Potter fans and scholars of literature alike. For all readers,The Secret Life of Storieswill fundamentally change the way we think about the way we read.<br>

  Book Title: A Godly Humanism-Clarifying the Hope That Lies Within<br>
  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): George Francis Cardinal<br>
  Abstract: For Francis Cardinal George, the Catholic Church is not a movement, built around ideas, but a communion, built around relationships. In A Godly Humanism, he shares his understanding of the Church in lively, compelling prose, presenting a way to understand and appreciate the relationships of God to human beings and of human beings to one another. These loving relationships are continually made present to us in and through the Church, from the time of Jesus' first disciples down to our own day. We are introduced to how the spiritual and intellectual life of Christians, aided in every generation by the Holy Spirit working through the Apostles and their successors, resist the danger of splitting apart from one another. Though they take different outward forms at different times, both wisdom and holiness are made possible for every Christian of every station of life. Sign-posting his conversation by the milestones of his own spiritual and intellectual journey, Cardinal George invites us to view the Church and her history in ways that go beyond the categories of politics - through which we find merely human initiative, contrivance, and adjustment - and rather to see the initiative as God's first and foremost. God is the non-stop giver, we are non-stop recipients of his gifts, and the recent popes, no less than the Father of the Church, have made every effort to make us aware of the graces - that is, of the unearned benefits - that God confers on us as Catholics, as Christians, as believers, and simply as human persons. Pope Francis, he reminds us, contrasts human planning with God's providence, and this book is at once an exposition of that providence and a personal response of gratitude for the way it has operated in one man's life.<br>

  Abstract: This book aims to enable a user to become closely familiar with a limited number of Older Testament texts and so be in a position to form judgments about them and, resulting from that, to have an under- standing of the nature of biblical text itself. Beyond this, the reality that these are key texts for the understanding of the Bible means that they have fundamental impact for the basics of faith today our understanding of ourselves before God, essential to faith in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Israel's prophets reflect on the role of God in human life; faith in God's love, God's passion for justice, the essential place of fidelity in faith. Israel's foundational narratives explore the nature of human lives before God; they include issues such as creation, human freedom, and faith in God's unshakeable commitment to human life. Alongside these concerns, there is the importance of getting a feel for the nature of scripture.<br>

  Abstract: The article focuses on the understanding of vulnerability that is found in the thought of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Emmanuel Levinas. For Bonhoeffer, vulnerability is best understood as a form of ‘vulnerable discipleship’, that is, a choosing to be vulnerable for the other which aligns with his understanding of costly grace. For Levinas, vulnerability is primarily concerned with the vulnerability of the other person and, later in his thought, the vulnerability of the subject who is responsible for the other person. In exploring the grounds for possible conversation between these two thinkers, we argue that Levinas has potential to offer a<br>

While the title speaks of God’s communication and implies our listening, it leads to understanding the human response to God’s word as well as the realisation that it is a human mission to communicate that word. The first communication is speaking the word, speaking it out. Then comes the writing down of the word for people to ‘hear’ it by reading. But, we are in a different era in the twenty-first century with so many ways of communicating God’s word, so many ways of ‘hearing’ it.<br>

But where does Satan come from? This study will examine what the Bible actually tells us about the origin of Satan, namely about his origin, and his fall.<br>

  Book Title: Opening the Bible-Selected Writings of Antony Campbell SJ<br>
  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Antony<br>
  Abstract: "When Tony Campbell, aged 75, asked the Council of Jesuit Theological College for Emeritus status and retirement from JTC, both were granted most graciously, along with a testimonial document which said in part: ‘His teaching has combined evocation and provocation in the best sense of those terms. He has mentored research students with scholarly exactitude and personal care. He has published books of the highest scholarly quality, of engaging readability, and of passionate conviction.’ When we at ATF were considering asking him for a volume of Collected Works or Selected Writings, we were well aware that ‘published books of the highest scholarly quality’ were likely to be found on the shelves of libraries and of specialised academics, but not with students and others generally interested. There may be a dozen or more of Tony’s books on the list from Amazon.com booksellers, along with another two or three that are not listed there. But most are heavy-duty specialist works, not easily accessible even to the educated public. We were equally well aware that there was a surprising number of essays and articles scattered in journals and proceedings of conferences that were, because of the scattering, often just as inaccessible. We thought that a collection of these in a single volume would be of great value to those interested. In the Introduction to this volume, Father Campbell has gone into some detail about the contents. Suffice for us to say that Job and the issues associated with suffering concern us all, that the interplay of history and narrative is a constant in the understanding of much biblical text, and that the nature of the Bible and its role in our lives is a major concern for most thinking Christians. While Father Campbell’s focus is on the Older Testament, pondering what he looks at throws light on much of the Newer Testament as well. The writings Tony Campbell has pulled together in this single volume address significant issues within the readable length ~<br>

  Anthropologists among Moroccans from:

  Author(s) DWYER KEVIN<br>
  Abstract: This book introduces readers to Morocco by showing how anthropologists have come to understand it. Each essay takes us into a specific part of the country through the unique voice of the writer. Each delivers a very local story, a vignette of how a particular individual has done fieldwork in a specific context. And each stands as a personal meditation on cross-cultural understanding, the way that one person came to appreciate an alien social world. Together the chapters build a richly textured portrait of the Kingdom of Morocco-a key site in the development of the discipline of anthropology.<br>

The Soviet film director not only admired Walt Disney’s films but also made them part of the subject matter of his theoretical studies. With his characteristic ambition, these theoretical explorations of Disney’s animation were intended to serve as the bases for understanding animation and developing questions alluding to the nature of art itself.¹ Most of these writings are from the early 1940s, some years after his return from Hollywood where he had met Disney in 1937.² He was also reconsidering or at least reformulating his theoretical ideas, especially that of montage.

  Abstract: Whereas the previous chapter elaborated what might be thought of as a destiny to which we must be answerable, I now turn to another, more active face of skepticism or sin, namely violence. What is the connection between violence and my relation to the other? How can the motives behind violence be understood, and how is it entangled with religion? Levinas’s understanding of how violence is bound up with the face of the other provides a rich phenomenological account, one that I believe can be supplemented with Cavell’s subtle understanding of its motivation.<br>

  Abstract: To understand means to apply; understanding is always put into practice and thus becomes a form of action in itself, in the world, and with others. It should come as no surprise that hermeneutics, as it recuperates the theoretical as well as practical value it has had since antiquity, develops in proximity to

The exposure to this situation offers an opening for thinking from beyond the instrumental rationalism of contemporary modernity, from radical exteriority. Latin America is a concrete living and articulate reality that, as the underside of modernity, displaces the Western North American and European claims to a hegemonic, selfsufficient, and autonomous power and causes a fecund opening for understanding anew philosophical thought.

  Abstract: Over the course of his distinguished interdisciplinary career, Giles Gunn has sustained his focus on the continuing threats to our collective sense of the human that seem to result from the link between the collision of fundamental values and the increase of systemic violence. He asks whether such threats can be at least mitigated, even if not removed, by understanding as opposed to force and what resources a more pragmatic cosmopolitanism might provide for doing so. How, in other words, might our sense of the human be reconstructed, not around suspicion or antipathy toward others, but around an epistemological and moral need of them?<br>

  Abstract: Hegel is without a doubt one of the most misunderstood thinkers in Western intellectual history, a history he claimed to sum up and bring to its maturity. This misunderstanding has several roots. One is the intrinsic difficulty of grasping Hegel’s thought. It is dense, technical, dialectical, and arranged in such a way that, to understand anything in it, one has to understanding its linkage with the whole system of thought. This means that one could easily take any given statement out of context and find in it a meaning that on the surface sounds preposterous.<br>

  Book Title: The Renaissance of emotion-Understanding affect in Shakespeare and his contemporaries<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sullivan Erin<br>
  Abstract: This collection of essays offers a major reassessment of the meaning and significance of emotional experience in the work of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Recent scholarship on early modern emotion has relied on a medical-historical approach, resulting in a picture of emotional experience that stresses the dominance of the material, humoral body. The Renaissance of emotion seeks to redress this balance by examining the ways in which early modern texts explore emotional experience from perspectives other than humoral medicine. The chapters in the book seek to demonstrate how open, creative and agency-ridden the experience and interpretation of emotion could be. Taken individually, the chapters offer much-needed investigations into previously overlooked areas of emotional experience and signification; taken together, they offer a thorough re-evaluation of the cultural priorities and phenomenological principles that shaped the understanding of the emotive self in the early modern period. The Renaissance of emotion will be of particular interest to students and scholars of Shakespeare and Renaissance literature, the history of emotion, theatre and cultural history, and the history of ideas.<br>

  Book Title: Mind in Architecture-Neuroscience, Embodiment, and the Future of Design<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Pallasmaa Juhani<br>
  Abstract: Although we spend more than ninety percent of our lives inside buildings, we understand very little about how the built environment affects our behavior, thoughts, emotions, and well-being. We are biological beings whose senses and neural systems have developed over millions of years; it stands to reason that research in the life sciences, particularly neuroscience, can offer compelling insights into the ways our buildings shape our interactions with the world. This expanded understanding can help architects design buildings that support both mind and body. In
      Mind in Architecture, leading thinkers from architecture and other disciplines, including neuroscience, cognitive science, psychiatry, and philosophy, explore what architecture and neuroscience can learn from each other. They offer historical context, examine the implications for current architectural practice and education, and imagine a neuroscientifically informed architecture of the future. Architecture is late in discovering the richness of neuroscientific research. As scientists were finding evidence for the bodily basis of mind and meaning, architecture was caught up in convoluted cerebral games that denied emotional and bodily reality altogether. This volume maps the extraordinary opportunity that engagement with cutting-edge neuroscience offers present-day architects.ContributorsThomas D.

This assumption had far-reaching consequences, opening the door for a subsequent understanding of architecture as a “sign,” whose meaning was articulated as the<br>

  Author(s): Wertheimer Eric<br>
  Abstract: Trauma is a universal human experience. While each person responds differently to trauma, its presence in our lives nonetheless marks a continual thread through human history and prehistory. In
      Critical Trauma Studies, a diverse group of writers, activists, and scholars of sociology, anthropology, literature, and cultural studies reflects on the study of trauma and how multidisciplinary approaches lend richness and a sense of deeper understanding to this burgeoning field of inquiry. The original essays within this collection cover topics such as female suicide bombers from the Chechen Republic, singing prisoners in Iranian prison camps, sexual assault and survivor advocacy, and families facing the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. As it proceeds,Critical Trauma Studiesnever loses sight of the way those who study trauma as an academic field, and those who experience, narrate, and remediate trauma as a personal and embodied event, inform one another. Theoretically adventurous and deeply particular, this book aims to advance trauma studies as a discipline that transcends intellectual boundaries, to be mapped but also to be unmoored from conceptual and practical imperatives. Remaining embedded in lived experiences and material realities,Critical Trauma Studiesframes the field as both richly unbounded and yet clearly defined, historical, and evidence-based.<br>

  Book Title: Religion Without Redemption-Social Contradictions and Awakened Dreams in Latin America<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Löwy Michael<br>
  Abstract: The world’s eyes are on Latin America as a place of radical political inspiration and as an alternative to the neoliberal model. Each country in the region deals differently in its method of government, yet there are common cultural themes that tie the continent’s trajectory together. Religion without Redemption looks at the sociology of religion, political philosophy and the history of ideas of the continent, in an attempt to show how Western understanding fails to come close to a correct analysis of how and why political and economic characteristics work as they do. Luis Martínez Andrade focuses on how the centrality of religion for the people of Latin America has influenced how they interact with the changes in the modern economic system. Capitalism, for example, has taken on religious characteristics: it has sacred places of worship (the shopping mall) as well as its own prophets. Martínez Andrade discusses how this form of ‘cultural religion’ accompanies many aspects of life in a contradictory manner: not only does it fulfil the role of legitimating oppression, it also can be a powerful source of rebellion, unveiling thus a subversive side to the status quo. Religion Without Redemption advances the ideas of liberation theory into the 21st century, and challenges the provincialism to which many Latin American thinkers are usually consigned.<br>

  Book Title: Fredrik Barth-An Intellectual Biography<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Garsten Christina<br>
  Abstract: Fredrik Barth is one of the towering figures of twentieth-century anthropology. This intellectual history traces the development of Barth’s ideas and explores the substance of his contributions. In an accessible style, Thomas Eriksen’s biographical study reveals the magic of ethnography to professional anthropologists and non-practitioners alike. Exploring his six decade career, it follows Barth from early ecological studies in Pakistan, to political studies in Iran, to groundbreaking fieldwork in Norway, New Guinea, Bali and Bhutan. Eriksen argues that Barth's voracious appetite for fieldwork holds the key to understanding his remarkable intellectual development and the insights it produced. The book raises many of the same questions that emerge from Barth's own work - of unity and diversity, of culture and relativism, of art and science. Thomas Eriksen is himself a major contributor to the study of anthropology, as well as a distinguished educator, and is therefore ideally placed to introduce the life and work of Fredrik Barth. This will surely be the definitive book on its subject for many years to come.<br>

  Book Title: Mexico in Verse-A History of Music, Rhyme, and Power<br>
  Publisher: University of Arizona Press<br>
  Author(s): BEEZLEY WILLIAM H.<br>
  Abstract: The history of Mexico is spoken in the voice of ordinary people. In rhymed verse and mariachi song, in letters of romance and whispered words in the cantina, the heart and soul of a nation is revealed in all its intimacy and authenticity.
      Mexico in Verse, edited by Stephen Neufeld and Michael Matthews, examines Mexican history through its poetry and music, the spoken and the written word.Focusing on modern Mexico, from 1840 to the 1980s, this volume examines the cultural venues in which people articulated their understanding of the social, political, and economic change they witnessed taking place during times of tremendous upheaval, such as the Mexican-American War, the Porfiriato, and the Mexican Revolution. The words of diverse peoples-people of the street, of the field, of the cantinas-reveal the development of the modern nation. Neufeld and Matthews have chosen sources so far unexplored by Mexicanist scholars in order to investigate the ways that individuals interpreted-whether resisting or reinforcing-official narratives about formative historical moments.The contributors offer new research that reveals how different social groups interpreted and understood the Mexican experience. The collected essays cover a wide range of topics: military life, railroad accidents, religious upheaval, children's literature, alcohol consumption, and the 1985 earthquake. Each chapter provides a translated song or poem that encourages readers to participate in the interpretive practice of historical research and cultural scholarship. In this regard,Mexico in Verseserves both as a volume of collected essays and as a classroom-ready primary document reader.<br>

  Abstract: Texts give us access not only to their author’s message but also, with varying degrees of clarity, to historical evidence on a wide range of subjects: evidence of linguistic usage at the time of the text; evidence of cultural reference points and their significance; evidence of social structures, practices, and norms; and evidence of events and people. In the case of Philippians, we learn some significant points about the community of people to whom Paul is writing. Understanding these people is important in itself, as the present volume argues.

  Book Title: Practicing the City: Early Modern London on Stage-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Levine Nina<br>
  Abstract: In late-sixteenth-century London, the commercial theaters undertook a novel experiment, fueling a fashion for plays that trafficked in the contemporary urban scene. But beyond the stage's representing the everyday activities of the expanding metropolis, its unprecedented urban turn introduced a new dimension into theatrical experience, opening up a reflexive space within which an increasingly diverse population might begin to "practice" the city. In this, the London stage began to operate as a medium as well as a model for urban understanding. Practicing the City traces a range of local engagements, onstage and off, in which the city's population came to practice new forms of urban sociability and belonging. With this practice, Levine suggests, city residents became more self-conscious about their place within the expanding metropolis and, in the process, began to experiment in new forms of collective association. Reading an array of materials, from Shakespeare and Middleton to plague bills and French-language manuals, Levine explores urban practices that push against the exclusions of civic tradition and look instead to the more fluid relations playing out in the disruptive encounters of urban plurality.<br>

  Abstract: An innovative, interdisciplinary, incisive scholarly study remapping and redefining domains and dynamics of modernism, EccentriCities: Writing in the margins of modernism critically considers how geo-historically distant and disparate urban sites, concentrating Russian and Luso-Brazilian cultural dialogue and definition, give rise to peculiarly parallel anachronistic and alternative fictional forms. While comparatively reframing these literary traditions through an extensive survey of Russian and Brazilian literature, cartography, urban design and development, foregrounding innovative close readings of works by Gogol, Dostoevsky, Bely, Almeida, Machado de Assis, Lima Barreto, Mário de Andrade, the book also redefines new constellations (eccentric, concentric, ex-centric) for understanding geo-cultural and generic dimensions of modernist and post-modern literature and theory.<br>

  Book Title: Timing Canada-The Shifting Politics of Time in Canadian Literary Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Huebener Paul<br>
  Abstract: From punch clocks to prison sentences, from immigration waiting periods to controversial time-zone boundaries, from Indigenous grave markers that count time in centuries rather than years, to the fact that free time is shrinking faster for women than for men - time shapes the fabric of Canadian society every day, but in ways that are not always visible or logical. In Timing Canada, Paul Huebener draws from cultural history, time-use surveys, political statements, literature, and visual art to craft a detailed understanding of how time operates as a form of power in Canada. Time enables everything we do - as Margaret Atwood writes, "without it we can't live." However, time also disempowers us, divides us, and escapes our control. Huebener transforms our understanding of temporal power and possibility by using examples from Canadian and Indigenous authors - including Jeannette Armstrong, Joseph Boyden, Dionne Brand, Timothy Findley, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Gabrielle Roy, and many others - who witness, question, dismantle, and reconstruct the functioning of time in their works. As the first comprehensive study of the cultural politics of time in Canada, Timing Canada develops foundational principles of critical time studies and everyday temporal literacy, and demonstrates how time functions broadly as a tool of power, privilege, and imagination within a multicultural and multi-temporal nation.<br>

  Book Title: Exodus and Resurrection-The God of Israel in the Theology of Robert W. Jenson<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Nicol Andrew W.<br>
  Abstract: Exodus and Resurrection establishes the important place God’s identity as the “God of Israel" has in the systematic theology of Robert W. Jenson. The work demonstrates that the identification of the God of Israel as the agent of Jesus’ resurrection functions as a foundational premise in Jenson’s Trinitarian theology. Andrew W. Nicol argues that a central characteristic of Jenson’s work is not merely his recognition that the same God who rescued Israel from Egypt raised Jesus from the dead, or the related yet distinct step of renovating his theology in a nonsupersessionist fashion, but also his attempt to conceive of the full implications for doing so in Christian theology, in the church’s self-understanding, and in the church’s relation to Israel and continuing Judaism. In this, Exodus and Resurrection provides a clear and critically appreciative account of Robert W. Jenson’s work and offers a new vital architectonic map of Jenson’s systematic vision.<br>

In so doing, it also seeks to situate his work within the wider dogmatic tradition, insofar as this illuminates and scrutinizes his work and the importance of the abiding significance of God’s identity as the “God of Israel.” We have seen in earlier chapters that Jenson’s explication of the dogmatic centrality of the God of Israel touches on almost all loci of theology proper.<br>

  Book Title: Theology in the Flesh-How Embodiment and Culture Shape the Way We Think about Truth, Morality, and God<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Sanders John<br>
  Abstract: Metaphors and other mental tools are used to reason (not just speak) about God, salvation, truth, and morality. Figurative language structures our theological and moral reasoning in powerful ways. This book uses an approach known as cognitive linguistics to explore the incredibly rich ways our conceptual tools, derived from embodied life and culture, shape the way we understand Christian teachings and practices. The cognitive revolution has generated amazing insights into how human minds make sense of the world. This book applies these insights to the ways Christians think about topics such as God, justice, sin, and salvation. It shows that Christians often share a set of very general ideas but disagree on what the Bible means or the moral stances we should take. It explains why Christians often develop a number of appropriate but sometimes incompatible ways to understand the Bible and various doctrines. It assists Christians in understanding those with whom they disagree. Hopefully, simply better understanding how and why people think the way they do will foster better dialogue and greater humility.<br>

  Abstract: In 1888, Thomas Edison announced that he was experimenting on "an instrument which does for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear, which is the recording and reproduction of things in motion." Just as Edison's investigations were framed in terms of the known technologies of the phonograph and the microscope, the essays in this collection address the contexts of innovation and reception that have framed the development of moving images in the last 100 years. Three concerns are of particular interest: the contexts of innovation and reception for moving image technologies; the role of the observer, whose vision and cognitive processes define some of the limits of inquiry and epistemological insight; and the role of new media, which, engaging with the domestic sphere as cultural interface, are transforming our understanding of public and private spheres.<br>

  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Christofferson Michael Scott<br>
  Abstract: In the latter half of the 1970s, the French intellectual Left denounced communism, Marxism, and revolutionary politics through a critique of left-wing totalitarianism that paved the way for today's postmodern, liberal, and moderate republican political options. Contrary to the dominant understanding of the critique of totalitarianism as an abrupt rupture induced by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's
      The Gulag Archipelago, Christofferson argues that French anti-totalitarianism was the culmination of direct-democratic critiques of communism and revisions of the revolutionary project after 1956. The author's focus on the direct-democratic politics of French intellectuals offers an important alternative to recent histories that seek to explain the course of French intellectual politics by France's apparent lack of a liberal tradition.<br>

  Author(s) Feldman Allen<br>
  Abstract: Diversely echoing Gail Weiss (1999) and Paul Stoller and Cheryll Olkes (1987), I hold that maleficent fetishes that sustain lethal sorcery shape and enact, yet pervert, their proper contours of embodied interactions and transactions. These interactions are being absorbed and consumed, if not devoured, by the sensual order of the uncanny and by forces of abjection. From my immersion in the life of the Yaka people in Kinshasa and south-west Congo, I am aiming at some endogenous understanding of how interacting bodies – or more precisely, intercorporeal awareness – can conform to (attune to) and become subordinated to (and implicated<br>

  Abstract: Reflexive anthropology, anthropology ‘at home’ or ‘half-way home’, and the recognition of the researcher’s as well as her informants’ subjectivity have dominated much of anthropology since the 1970s. All are intimately bound with feminist critiques of ethnographic approaches and have been guiding principles in research conducted within the framework of Oxford’s Centre for Cross-Cultural Research on Women (E. Ardener 1975; S. Ardener 1975; Ardener and Burman 1995). To reach a closer understanding of women’s lives, it proved essential to focus on the contacts and active interactions of women in the societies we studied. Indeed, one of the questions we posed<br>

  Abstract: Fundamentally a relational category, whiteness

We need to look more closely at the content of the normative and attempt to analyze both its history and its consequences. One step in this direction is antiracist writers’ increasing use of the terms Euro-American or European American alongside African American, Asian American, Native American, Latino, and Chicano.

  Book Title: Irony on Occasion: From Schlegel and Kierkegaard to Derrida and de Man-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Newmark Kevin<br>
  Abstract: What is it about irony--as an object of serious philosophical reflection and a literary technique of considerable elasticity--that makes it an occasion for endless critical debate? This book responds to this question by focusing on several key moments in German Romanticism and its afterlife in twentieth-century French thought and writing. It includes chapters on Friedrich Schlegel, Soren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Thomas Mann, Jean Paulhan, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida, and Paul de Man. A coda traces the way unresolved tensions inherited from Romanticism resurface in a novelist like J. M. Coetzee. But this book is neither a historical nor a thematic study of irony. To the degree that irony initiates a deflection of meaning, it also entails a divergence from historical and thematic models of understanding. The book therefore aims to respect irony's digressive force by allowing it to emerge from questions that sometimes have little or nothing to do with the ostensible topic of irony. For if irony is the possibility that whatever is being said does not coincide fully with whatever is being meant, then there is no guarantee that the most legitimate approach to the problem would proceed directly to those places where "irony" is named, described, or presumed to reside. Rather than providing a history of irony, then, this book examines particular occasions of ironic disruption. It thus offers an alternative model for conceiving of historical occurrences and their potential for acquiring meaning.<br>

  Book Title: Carnal Hermeneutics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Building on a hermeneutic tradition in which accounts of carnal embodiment are overlooked, misunderstood, or underdeveloped, this work initiates a new field of study and concern. Carnal Hermeneutics provides a philosophical approach to the body as interpretation. Transcending the traditional dualism of rational understanding and embodied sensibility, the volume argues that our most carnal sensations are already interpretations. Because interpretation truly goes "all the way down," carnal hermeneutics rejects the opposition of language to sensibility, word to flesh, text to body. In this volume, an impressive array of today's preeminent philosophers seek to interpret the surplus of meaning that arises from our carnal embodiment, its role in our experience and understanding, and its engagement with the wider world.<br>

  Abstract: If we look at its history, hermeneutics never was anything but diacritical. In his seminal essay on the origins of hermeneutics (“Die Geburt der Hermeneutik,” 1900), Wilhelm Dilthey argued that hermeneutics was born in Alexandria, in the Hellenistic period. Although according to Dilthey the art of

  Book Title: Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Ethical Self-Christology, Ethics, and Formation<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Elliston Clark J.<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s work has persistently challenged Christian consciousness due to both his death at the hands of the Nazis and his provocative prison musings about Christian faithfulness in late modernity. Although understandable given the popularity of both narrative trajectories, such selective focus obscures the depth and fecundity of his overall corpus. Bonhoeffer’s early work, and particularly his Christocentric anthropology, grounds his later expressed commitments to responsibility and faithfulness in a “world come of age." While much debate accompanies claims regarding the continuity of Bonhoeffer’s thought, there are central motifs which pervade his work from his doctoral dissertation to the prison writings. This book suggests that a concern for otherness permeates all of Bonhoeffer’s work. Furthermore, Clark Elliston articulates, drawing on Bonhoeffer, a Christian self-defined by its orientation towards otherness. Taking Bonhoeffer as both the origin and point of return, the text engages Emmanuel Levinas and Simone Weil as dialogue partners who likewise stress the role of the other for self-understanding, albeit in diverse ways. By reading Bonhoeffer “through" their voices, one enhances Bonhoeffer’s already fertile understanding of responsibility.<br>

  Abstract: Biblical Performance Criticism is a way of understanding the Bible. It is the result of many streams of thought meeting over the last century, including form criticism, oral-tradition studies, rhetorical criticism, narrative criticism, memory studies, media studies, and performance studies. In some way, each of these streams analyzes four elements: (1) someone speaking, (2) someone hearing, (3) a text, and (4) a social situation. Each has contributed to the understanding that the Bible should be read in terms of the interaction of those four elements rather than any one of them in isolation.<br>

  Book Title: Writings on Medicine-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Todd<br>
  Abstract: At the time of his death in 1995, Georges Canguilhem was a highly respected historian of science and medicine, whose engagement with questions of normality, the ideologization of scientific thought, and the conceptual history of biology had marked the thought of philosophers such as Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Pierre Bourdieu, and Gilles Deleuze. This collection of short, incisive, and highly accessible essays on the major concepts of modern medicine shows Canguilhem at the peak of his use of historical practice for philosophical engagement. In order to elaborate a philosophy of medicine, Canguilhem examines paramount problems such as the definition and uses of health, the decline of the Hippocratic understanding of nature, the experience of disease, the limits of psychology in medicine, myths and realities of therapeutic practices, the difference between cure and healing, the organism's self-regulation, and medical metaphors linking the organism to society. Writings on Medicine is at once an excellent introduction to Canguilhem's work and a forceful, insightful, and accessible engagement with elemental concepts in medicine. The book is certain to leave its imprint on anthropology, history, philosophy, bioethics, and the social studies of medicine.<br>

  Book Title: In the Fellowship of His Suffering-A Theological Interpretation of Mental Illness — A Focus on "Schizophrenia"<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Swinton John<br>
  Abstract: Schizophrenia is often considered one of the most destructive forms of mental illness. Elahe Hessamfar’s personal experience with her daughter’s illness has led her to ask some pressing and significant questions about the cause and nature of schizophrenia and the Church’s role in its treatment. With a candid and revealing look at the history of mental illness, In the Fellowship of His Suffering describes schizophrenia as a variation of human expression. Hessamfar uses a deeply theological rather than pathological approach to interpret the schizophrenic experience and the effect it has on both the patients and their families. Effectively drawing on the Bible as a source of knowledge for understanding mental illness, she offers a reflective yet innovative view of whether the Church could or should intervene in such encounters and what such an intervention might look like. Hessamfar’s comprehensive work will provoke powerful responses from anyone interested in the prominent social issue of mental illness. Her portrayal of the raging debate between treating “insanity" either pastorally or medically will enthral readers, be they Christians, medical students or those in the field of psychiatry and social sciences.<br>

Historically, how the experiences are named determined the types of treatment that were deemed to be appropriate. The church has participated in this process, but laterally, the naming, framing and responding to those experiences have become the terrain of psychiatry. Psychiatry has a questionable history and has been the location for various political, economic, and professional power struggles as the discipline has developed and has sought to offer a rationale for its existence.<br>

  Abstract: This second edition of An introduction to the New Testament provides readers with pertinent material and a helpful framework that will guide them in their understanding of the New Testament texts. Many new and diverse cultural, historical, social-scientific, sociorhetorical, narrative, textual, and contextual studies have been examined since the publication of the first edition, which was in print for twenty years. The authors retain the original tripartite arrangement on 1) The world of the New Testament, 2) Interpreting the New Testament, and 3) Jesus and early Christianity. An appropriate book for anyone who seeks to better understand what is involved in the exegesis of New Testaments texts today.<br>

  Abstract: As we tried to imply in the last two chapters, the disclosure of literary genre is intended to be a momentous event in the introduction of a text, tantamount perhaps to the discovery of an edible species of plant by a starving explorer. Despite the promise of such an occasion, however, in actual practice it can sometimes be frustrating, offering less of a hermeneutical advantage than is sometimes anticipated. But take courage! It is a bit like the great dialogue of Plato,

On August 5, 1971, Brezhnev received a personal letter from Nixon in which the president asked Brezhnev to cooperate in answering the “large questions.” Brezhnev proposed a summit,¹ and this was the point at which American policy toward Eastern Europe turned decisively toward accepting the permanence of Soviet control. Nixon traveled to Warsaw, where he declared his understanding of the predicament of Poland’s geopolitical environment. He also told the new Hungarian ambassador that he attributed Hungary’s “relationship to its neighbors” to the country’s “historical and geographical” attributes.² Károly Szabó was thrilled by Nixon’s<br>

Instead, it is a dynamic history of the divine acts of God that can be seen throughout the canonizing process as successive generations interpreted the tradition and text for their situations.

  Book Title: Returning to Reality-Christian Platonism for our Times<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Tyson Paul<br>
  Abstract: Could it be that we have lost touch with some basic human realities in our day of high-tech efficiency, frenetic competition, and ceaseless consumption? Have we turned from the moral, the spiritual, and even the physical realities that make our lives meaningful? These are metaphysical questions -questions about the nature of reality- but they are not abstract questions. These are very down to earth questions that concern power and the collective frameworks of belief and action governing our daily lives. This book is an introduction to the history, theory, and application of Christian metaphysics. Yet this book is not just an introduction, it is also a passionately argued call for a profound change in the contemporary Christian mind. Paul Tyson argues that as Western culture’s Christian Platonist understanding of reality was replaced by modern pragmatic realism, we turned not just from one outlook on reality to another, but away from reality itself. This book seeks to show that if we can recover this ancient Christian outlook on reality, reframed for our day, then we will be able to recover a way of life that is in harmony with human and divine truth.<br>

  Book Title: Storied Revelations-Parables, Imagination and George MacDonald’s Christian Fiction<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Peterson Eugene H.<br>
  Abstract: George MacDonald, the Victorian poet and theologian, observed that his was a culture saturated with Christian jargon but often void of a profound understanding of the gospel for its own time and culture. The language of Scripture no longer penetrated people’s hearts, thoughts, and attitudes; it no longer transformed people’s lives. MacDonald, called to be a pastor, turned to story and more specifically the "parabolic" as a means of spiritual awakening. He created fictive worlds in which the language of Jesus would find a new home and regain its revelatory power for his particular Victorian audience. 'Storied Revelations' explores the interface between the Bible and George MacDonald’s fiction. The way Jesus uses language in the parables sheds light on our understanding of MacDonald’s careful use of language in his fiction. Further still, many of MacDonald’s stories are infused with the language of the Bible, often in rather surprising ways.<br>

  Book Title: Life in the Spirit-A Post-Constantinian and Trinitarian Account of the Christian Life<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): snavely Andréa D.<br>
  Abstract: Christians are united in saying that the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. But the unity breaks down when explaining how the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. Life in the Spirit is the first book to engage the post-Constantinian critique of the church with the field of Spirit Christology. Building upon the work of post-Constantinians John Howard Yoder and Stanley Hauerwas and upon the Trinitarian Spirit-Christology of Leopoldo Sánchez, this account provides a framework for seeing one’s Christian life as one transformed by the Spirit. Snavely rejects the characterisation of life in the Spirit as bringing sinners to faith, and instead proposes that as Jesus lived as the Son of the Father in the Spirit, the Spirit also makes other sons of the father in the image of Jesus. This Trinitarian interpretation shows the Christian life as being one of total trust in God with one’s own life, and after death living in Jesus’ resurrected life in the Spirit. Snavely’s account calls for a reimagining of the church and the Christian life in terms of ecclesial structure, Christian discipleship and the Christian view of marriage. Life in the Spirit will not only help Christians to have a better understanding of the place of vocation in the world as witnesses to the lordship of Jesus Christ, but it will also promote unity in the body of Christ based on the actual unity that all his adopted sons and daughters already have by belonging to Jesus Christ’s life in the Spirit.<br>

  Book Title: Christian Theology and Religious Pluralism-A Critical Evaluation of John Hick<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Nah David S.<br>
  Abstract: The question of religious pluralism is the most significant yet thorniest of issues in theology today, and John Hick (1922–2012) has long been recognized as its most important scholar. However, while much has been written analyzing the philosophical basis of Hick’s pluralism, very little attention has been devoted to the theological foundations of his argument. Filling this gap, this book examines Hick’s theological attempts to systematically deconstruct the church’s traditional incarnational Christology. Special attention is given to evaluating Hick’s foundational theses “that Jesus himself did not teach what was to become the orthodox Christian understanding of him" and “that the dogma of Jesus’ two natures . . . has proved to be incapable of being explicated in any satisfactory way." By elucidating the ways in which Hick’s arguments fail, David Nah demonstrates that Hick was unwarranted in breaking away from the church’s incarnational Christology that has been at the core of Christianity for almost two thousand years.<br>

  Book Title: Grasping Truth and Reality-Lesslie Newbigin's Theology of Mission to the Western World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Le Roy Stults Donald<br>
  Abstract: When Lesslie Newbigin returned to Britain in 1974 after years of missionary service, he observed that his homeland was as much a mission field as India, where he had spent the majority of his missionary career. He concluded that the Western world needed a missionary confrontation. Instead of the traditional approach to missions, however, Newbigin realized that the Western world needed to be confronted theologically. From his earliest days at Cambridge University, Newbigin developed the theological convictions that shaped his understanding of the Christian faith, and he used these theological convictions as criteria to evaluate the belief system of Western culture and to provide an answer to its dilemma. The Enlightenment reintroduced humanism and dualism into Western culture, which resulted on the loss of purpose and the rise of skepticism. This book discusses Newbigin's theological convictions and how they factored into both his critique of and his solution to Western culture's spiritual and worldview problems. Donald Le Roy cleverly explains Newbigin's solution to reintroduce the Christian belief system into Western culture in order to restore purpose and truth to Westerners and put them back in contact with true reality through Jesus Christ.<br>

  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Cook Christopher C.H.<br>
  Abstract: The Philokalia was published in Venice in 1782. It is an anthology of patristic writings from the Eastern Church, spanning the 4th to the 15th Centuries, which has been the subsequent focus of a significant revival in Orthodox spirituality. It presents an understanding of psychopathology and mental life which is significantly different to that usually encountered in western Christianity. It also presents accounts of both mental well-being and the pathologies of the mind or soul that are radically different to contemporary secular accounts and yet also find remarkable points of similarity with contemporary psychotherapeutic approaches, such as cognitive therapy. The book provides an introduction to the history of the Philokalia and the philosophical, anthropological and theological influences that contributed to its information. It presents a critical account of the pathologies of the soul, the remedies for these pathologies, and the therapeutic goals as portrayed by the authors of the Philokalia. It then offers a critical engagement of this material with a contemporary understanding of psychotherapy. Finally, it raises important questions about the relationship between thoughts and prayer.<br>

  Book Title: From Faith to Faith-John Wesley’s Covenant Theology and the Way of Salvation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Noble T. A.<br>
  Abstract: The very title of this volume makes a claim and extends an invitation. Simply put, the claim is this: John Wesley was an adherent of covenant theology. Consequently, a proper understanding of his theological thought - and of his soteriology in particular - is impossible apart from accounting for the influence of covenant theology on him. The invitation then, is to investigate Wesley's thought in light of this claim. Having started his research simply as an investigation into a rather curious distinction Wesley made among those to whom he gave spiritual counsel (some people, he said, have "the faith of a servant"; others have "the faith of a son"), Rodes soon realised that covenant theology was an immensely powerful influence on Wesley's thought, and that he was even able to significantly and creatively adapted it to the template of his evangelical Arminianism.<br>

The sufficiency of each dispensation rests on the promise of Genesis 3:15, a promise for which the warranty is “the lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” Wesley’s vision of the way of salvation is profoundly shaped by his understanding that this promise and warranty are extended to all of fallen humanity rather than to the elect only, and by his conceiving the salvific sufficiency of the covenant of grace to be concurrent and<br>

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of the Divine Suffering, Volume 2. Evil and Divine Suffering<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the second volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, vol. 2, Evil and Divine Suffering. The larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, then to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. This second volume of studies proceeds on the basis of the presuppositions of this symbol, those implicit attestations that provide the conditions of possibility for divine suffering-that which constitutes divine vulnerability with respect to creation-as identified and examined in the first volume of this project: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life-the imago Dei as love. The second volume then investigates the first two divine wounds or modes of divine suffering to which the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally attest: (1) divine grief, suffering because of betrayal by the beloved human or human sin; and (2) divine self-sacrifice, suffering for the beloved human in its bondage to sin or misery, to establish the possibility of redemption and reconciliation. Each divine wound, thus, constitutes a response to a creaturely occasion. The suffering in each divine wound also occurs in two stages: a passive stage and an active stage. In divine grief, God suffers because of human sin, betrayal of the divine lover by the beloved human: divine sorrow as the passive stage of divine grief; and divine angui~<br>

  Abstract: Luther’s theological aesthetics of God’s glory in Christ’s suffering love lays a basis for reshaping and redirecting motives of Asian post-confessional theology toward a different understanding and transformation of Luther. When Luther encounters a postmodern context, he can best be understood by challenging and transcending him. His doctrine of justification, theology of the cross, Trinity, law and gospel, eucharistic theology, and two kingdoms theory among others are seen at the point of the death, resurrection and reconciliation of the crucified Christ, the scope and reach of which is of inclusive, universal character allowing and tolerating other ways.

  Book Title: Contextual Theology-The Drama of Our Times<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Matheny Paul Duane<br>
  Abstract: For centuries, the global understanding of Church has been shaped by Western theological imperatives. Yet today, the decline of institutional religion in the West, and the extraordinary growth of the Church of the global South mean that a radical movement beyond such theologies is required. In this book, Paul Matheny argues that the Church would benefit by becoming more contextualized and less Western. Contextual Theology is an attempt to address that issue and to examine how a reassessment of the relationship of the Gospel to cultural context can advance this critical and necessary development. Through an accessible and critical approach, Matheny considers the historical background to contextual theology. In the same way, he aims to show how to use contextual methods to think theologically and act missiologically in different cultural contexts.<br>

This leads to a particular dialectical understanding of ethical judgment and action. That is, Christians give witness by both standing against the various powers that oppress humanity and standing with and for others, the church, and the world.

  Book Title: Religion and Violence-A Dialectical Engagement through the Insights of Bernard Lonergan<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Arcamone Dominic<br>
  Abstract: The aim of Religion and Violence is to engage dialectically key symbols of religiously motivated violence through the insights of Bernard Lonergan. Sociologists and psychologists argue the link between religion and violence. Religion is viewed more as part of the problem and not part of the solution to violence. Bernard Lonergan’s insights have helped the author arrive at a number of conclusions regarding the link between religion and violence. He argues that there is a difference between distorted religion and genuine religion, between authenticity and inauthenticity of the subject. Distorted religion has the capacity to shape traditions in ways that justify violence, while genuine religion heals persons, helps them make different moral decisions when confronted with situations of conflict, and aims to explore new ways of understanding themselves as shaping history toward progress. Further, Religion and Violence, while arguing from within the Catholic Christian tradition, nevertheless seeks to provide a number of categories that will speak to people from other cultural traditions. Since many of the examples of religious violence cited by commentators come out of the Islamic tradition, the author has evidenced and explored more authentic aspects of the Islamic tradition that would help provide a solution to violence.<br>

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Volume 1. Divine Vulnerability and Creation<br>

  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the first volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Divine Vulnerability and Creation. This study first develops an approach to interpreting the contested claims about the suffering of God. Thus, the larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. Through this approach, this volume of studies into the Christian symbol of divine suffering then investigates the two major presuppositions that the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally hold: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life - the imago Dei as love. When fully elaborated, these presuppositions reveal the conditions of possibility for divine suffering and divine vulnerability with respect to creation.<br>

  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Rampton David<br>
  Abstract: More than fifty years after the publication of
      Anatomy of Criticism, Northrop Frye remains one of Canada's most influential intellectuals. This reappraisal reasserts the relevance of his work to the study of literature and illuminates its fruitful intersection with a variety of other fields, including film, cultural studies, linguistics, and feminism. Many of the contributors draw upon the early essays, correspondence, and diaries recently published as part of theCollected Works of Northrop Fryeseries, in order to explore the development of his extraordinary intellectual range and the implications of his imaginative syntheses. They refute postmodernist arguments that Frye's literary criticism is obsolete and propose his wide-ranging and non-linear ways of thinking as a model for twenty-first century readers searching for innovative ways of understanding literature and its relevance to contiguous disciplines. The volume provides an in-depth examination of Frye's work on a range of literary questions, periods, and genres, as well as a consideration of his contributions to literary theory, philosophy, and theology. The portrait that emerges is that of a writer who still has much to offer those interested in literature and the ways it represents and transforms our world. The book's overall argument is that Frye's case for the centrality of the imagination has never been more important where understanding history, reconciling science and culture, or reconceptualizing social change is concerned.<br>

  Abstract: If this modest work has achieved its purpose, it has indicated the need, within the human person’s single graced end, for a robust concept of nature. Although weakened, it can be rebuilt, we have argued, by developing a better understanding of the complex analogies that constitute its relation with its partner. We have also argued that the sacramental model constituted by these analogies can address modernity. Moreover, in the essay’s last part, we have shown how this model can deepen insights into several of Christianity’s perennial problems: the doctrine of God, God’s relation with the world, and the relation of<br>

  Abstract: Defining the event of literature as
                  the un-happening within the happeningbrings us to a main intersection between a transcendent understanding of the event and an immanent approach to it. The transcendent approach emphasizes the absolute other that engenders the happening: essentially the impossible horizon of the happening or the ungraspable which is always about to occur. The immanent approach insists, instead, that the event is graspable as it takes place, that it is a fact unfolding among or between its declared historical elements, a real undetermined movement of flight, what Nancy calls “thethatitself of the ‘that-it-happens.’”¹ To<br>

  Abstract: Demonstrating the extent to which ethos attributions, and hence, interpretive acts, play a tacit role in many methods of narratological analysis, Korthals Altes also questions the agenda and epistemological status of various narratologies, both classical and post-classical. Her approach, rooted in a broad understanding of the role and circulation of narrative art in culture, rehabilitates interpretation, both as a tool and as an object of investigation in narrative studies.<br>

  Abstract: While some theorists have suggested that translation is impossible (Payne 1971), to a large degree Western civilization and culture has depended upon translated documents originally written in one language into some other, usually more common, language. A large portion of our current understanding of philosophy, history, mythology, and religion comes to us through translated documents. What could we know of Aristotle, Plato, Moses, or Muhammad without contemporary translations of their writings into our mother tongue? From the philosophy of Immanuel Kant to the literature of Victor Hugo, the breadth of human knowledge is inextricably linked to the translation of documents<br>

American capitalism-renowned for its celebration of market competition, private property, and the self-made man-has its origins in an American slavery predicated on the abhorrent notion that human beings could be legally owned and compelled to work under force of violence.<br>

  Book Title: Useful Fictions-Evolution, Anxiety, and the Origins of Literature<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): AUSTIN MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on evolutionary biology, anthropology, narrative theory, cognitive psychology, game theory, and evolutionary aesthetics, Austin develops the concept of a "useful fiction," a simple narrative that serves an adaptive function unrelated to its factual one. In his work we see how these useful fictions play a key role in neutralizing the overwhelming anxiety that humans can experience as their minds gather and process information. Rudimentary narratives constructed for this purpose, Austin suggests, provided a cognitive scaffold that might have become the basis for our well-documented love of fictional stories. Written in clear, jargon-free prose and employing abundant literary examples-from the Bible to
      One Thousand and One Arabian NightsandDon QuixotetoNo Exit-Austin's work offers a new way of understanding the relationship between fiction and evolutionary processes-and, perhaps, the very origins of literature.<br>

  Abstract: Though lying is not the same as storytelling, the two are not entirely unrelated. Both involve the construction and communication of counterfactual propositions and narratives. The difference between the two is in both the intent of the speaker and the understanding of the audience. Liars know the truth and attempt to conceal it, usually to advantage themselves at the expense of their auditors. On the other hand, both storytellers and story hearers (or story readers) usually understand that a fictional story is something other than literal truth—rather than working against each other, they collaborate in a mutually beneficial form<br>

  Book Title: Violence in Francophone African and Caribbean Women's Literature-  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): KALISA CHANTAL<br>
  Abstract: Chantal Kalisa examines the ways in which women writers lift taboos imposed on them by their society and culture and challenge readers with their unique perspectives on violence. Comparing women from different places and times, Kalisa treats types of violence such as colonial, familial, linguistic, and war-related, specifically linked to dictatorship and genocide. She examines Caribbean writers Michele Lacrosil, Simone Schwartz-Bart, Gisèle Pineau, and Edwidge Danticat, and Africans Ken Begul, Calixthe Beyala, Nadine Bar, and Monique Ilboudo. She also includes Sembène Ousmane and Frantz Fanon for their unique contributions to the questions of violence and gender. This study advances our understanding of the attempts of African and Caribbean women writers to resolve the tension between external forms of violence and internal forms resulting from skewed cultural, social, and political rules based on gender.<br>

While it can be argued that gendered violence is a corollary to imperialism and colonialism, women writers show how their societies contribute to gendered violence.<br>

  Book Title: Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging meditation on the nature and purpose of hermeneutics, Gerald L. Bruns argues that hermeneutics is not merely a contemporary theory but an extended family of questions about understanding and interpretation that have multiple and conflicting histories going back to before the beginning of writing.What does it mean to understand a riddle, an action, a concept, a law, an alien culture, or oneself? Bruns expands our sense of the horizons of hermeneutics by situating its basic questions against a background of different cultural traditions and philosophical topics. He discusses, for example, the interpretation of oracles, the silencing of the muses and the writing of history, the quarrel between philosophy and poetry, the canonization of sacred texts, the nature of allegorical exegesis, rabbinical midrash, the mystical exegesis of the Qur'an, the rise of literalism and the individual interpreter, and the nature of Romantic hermeneutics. Dealing with thinkers ranging from Socrates to Luther to Wordsworth to Ricoeur, Bruns also ponders several basic dilemmas about the nature of hermeneutical experience, the meaning of tradition, the hermeneutical function of narrative, and the conflict between truth and freedom in philosophy and literature. His eloquent book demonstrates the continuing power of hermeneutical thinking to open up questions about the world and our place in it.<br>

  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Harvey Barry<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer writes in one of his last prison letters that he had “come to know and understand more and more the profound this-worldliness of Christianity." In Taking Hold of the Real, Barry Harvey engages in constructive conversation with Bonhoeffer, contending that the “shallow and banal this-worldliness" of modern society is ordered to a significant degree around the social technologies of religion, culture, and race. These mechanisms displace human beings from their traditional connections with particular locales, and relocate them in their “proper places" as determined by the nation-state and capitalist markets. Christians are called to participate in the profound this-worldliness that breaks into the world in the apocalyptic action of Jesus Christ, a form of life that requires discipline and an understanding of death and resurrection. The church is a sacrament of this new humanity, performing for all to hear the polyphony of life that was prefigured in the Old Testament and now is realised in Christ. Unable to find a faithful form of this-worldliness in wartime Germany, Bonhoeffer joined the conspiracy against Hitler, a decision aptly contrasted with a small French church that, prepared by its life together over many generations, saved thousands of Jewish lives.<br>

  Abstract: Gustave Glotz suggested back in the 1920s that the appearance of burial containers in Middle Bronze Age (MBA) I (Middle Minoan or MM I) Crete signalled the break-down of large social groups in Minoan society into smaller families (Glotz 1925, 138). He never really qualified this statement and probably never realised that it would become a pillar for our understanding of change in the period.<br>

  Book Title: At the Limits of Memory-Legacies of Slavery in the Francophone World<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hodgson Kate<br>
  Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing body of literature dedicated to memories of slavery in the Anglophone world, yet little has been done to approach this subject from Francophone perspectives. This collection responds to the urgent need to contribute to current research on slavery and memory studies by focusing specifically on the Francophone world. Featuring the scholarship of leading academics in France, Britain, the United States and Canada, the collection reflects upon contemporary commemorative practices that relate to the history of slavery and the slave trade, and questions how they function in relationship to other, less memorialized histories of exploitation, such as indentured and forced labour. The volume is set against the context of France’s growing body of memory legislation, as well as its close cultural and political connections to its former empire, all of which make it an influential player in how slavery continues to be memorialized and conceptualized in the public sphere. Contributors retrace and redraw the narrative map of slavery and its legacies in the Francophone world through a comparative understanding of how these different, but interconnected forms of labour exploitation have been remembered and/or forgotten from European, West African, Indian Ocean and Caribbean perspectives.<br>

  Abstract: Theodor W. Adorno’s preoccupation with language is gleaned from the context of his theory of knowledge, particularly his critique of identity thinking. He tackles the problem of conceptual reification genealogically, that is, he traces conceptual reification via an analysis of the structure of language. My aim in this paper is to argue that Adorno’s engagement with the nature of language is informed by an implicit attempt at a revaluation of the language of philosophy, a revaluation that has significant consequences for a global understanding of how we conceive the world of objects, in general, and how philosophy’s configurative use of<br>

  Abstract: One of the most interesting and fruitful anthropological discussions of philosophy occurred within the so-called ‘interpretive turn’ in anthropology. This turn was inspired by philosophy and initiated a reconsideration of philosophical concepts. In particular, the reconsideration of the hermeneutic notion of ‘ understanding’ led to new anthropological readings of the works of Martin Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer and Paul Ricoeur. At the same time this anthropological discussion had its impact on philosophy. On the one hand, hermeneutic and analytic philosophy came closer together while questioning the possibilities of understanding alien cultures: Peter Winch and Richard Rorty dealt with the problem of<br>

  Abstract: Pierre Bourdieu’s conception of habitus marks a theoretical step which no adequate understanding of social reality can ignore. By introducing habitus, Bourdieu is able both to integrate and to transcend major insights of the linguistic turn in philosophy, most prominently the idea that conscious intentional understanding necessarily relies on a host of implicit, practical, and holistic background assumptions which constitute meaning while being themselves unrepresented (Searle, 1989). The concept of habitus incorporates this idea since it shows that individual agency and its self-understanding are constituted by relying on an acquired social sense, the cognitive habitus, which defines how an agent<br>

  Book Title: The Resounding Soul-Reflections on the Metaphysics and Vivacity of the Human Person<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Kimbriel Samuel<br>
  Abstract: It is surely not coincidental that the term “soul" should mean not only the centre of a creature’s life and consciousness, but also a thing or action characterized by intense vivacity (“that bike’s got soul!"). It also seems far from coincidental that the same contemporary academic discussions that have largely cast aside the language of “soul" in their quest to define the character of human mental life should themselves be so – how to say it? – bloodless, so lacking in soul. This volume arises from the opposite premise, namely that the task of understanding human nature is bound up with and in important respects dependent upon the more critical task of learning to be fully human, of learning to have soul. The papers collected here are derived from a conference in Oxford sponsored by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy and together explore the often surprising landscape that emerges when human consciousness is approached from this angle. Drawing upon literary, philosophical, theological, historical, and musical modes of analysis, the essays of this volume vividly remind the reader of the power of the ancient language of soul over against contemporary impulses to reduce, fragment, and overly determine human selfhood.<br>

  Book Title: Fueling Culture-101 Words for Energy and Environment<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yaeger Patricia<br>
  Abstract: How has our relation to energy changed over time? What differences do particular energy sources make to human values, politics, and imagination? How have transitions from one energy source to another—from wood to coal, or from oil to solar to whatever comes next—transformed culture and society? What are the implications of uneven access to energy in the past, present, and future? Which concepts and theories clarify our relation to energy, and which just get in the way? Fueling Culture offers a compendium of keywords written by scholars and practitioners from around the world and across the humanities and social sciences. These keywords offer new ways of thinking about energy as both the source and the limit of how we inhabit culture, with the aim of opening up new ways of understanding the seemingly irresolvable contradictions of dependence upon unsustainable energy forms. Fueling Culture brings together writing that is risk-taking and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from literary and cultural studies, environmental history and ecocriticism, political economy and political ecology, postcolonial and globalization studies, and materialisms old and new.

  Book Title: Supper at Emmaus-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): OLSEN GLENN W.<br>
  Abstract: Supper at Emmaus traces various important intellectual topics from the ancient world to the modern period. Generally, as in its treatment of the question of whether the long-standing contrast between cyclical and linear views of history is helpful, it introduces important thinkers who have considered the question. A preoccupation of the book is the appearance and reappearance across the centuries of patterns used to organize temporal and cultural experience. After an opening essay on transcendental truth and cultural relativism, the second chapter traces a distinction, common in historical writings during the past two centuries, between an alleged ancient classical "cyclic" view of time and history, used to describe the claimed repetitiveness of and similarities between historical events ("nothing is new under the sun"), and a contrasting Jewish-Christian linear view, sometimes described as providential in that it moves through a series of unique events to some end intended by God. In the latter, history is "about something," the education of the human race or the redemption of humankind. As in each of the remaining essays, the book then attempts to draw out the limitations of what the current consensus on this topic has become. It does this for such things as our current understanding of religious toleration, humanism, natural law, and teleology. Some of the essays, such as those on debate about Augustine's understanding of marriage or the concluding illustrated essay on the baroque city of Lecce, are published for the first time. Others are based on previously published contributions to the scholarly literature, though generally each of these chapters concludes with a postscript that engages with current scholarly debate on the subject.<br>

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

  Book Title: Seamus Heaney as Aesthetic Thinker-A Study of the Prose<br>
  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): MacKillop James<br>
  Abstract: Seamus Heaney’s unexpected death in August 2013 brought to completion his body of work, and scholars are only now coming to understand the full scale and importance of this extraordinary career. The Nobel Prize–winning poet, translator, and playwright from the North of Ireland is considered the most important Irish poet after Yeats and, at the time of his death, arguably the most famous living poet. For this reason, much of the scholarship to date on Heaney has understandably focused on his poetry. O’Brien’s new work, however, focuses on Heaney’s essays, book chapters, and lectures as it seeks to understand how Heaney explored the poet’s role in the world. By examining Heaney’s prose, O’Brien teases out a clearer understanding of Heaney’s sense of the function of poetry as an act of public intellectual and ethical inquiry. In doing so, O’Brien reads Heaney as an aesthetic thinker in the European tradition, considering him alongside Heidegger, Derrida, Lacan, and Adorno. Studying Heaney within this theoretical and philosophical tradition sheds new and useful light on one of the greatest creative minds of the twentieth century.<br>

  Book Title: Disability Rhetoric-  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dolmage Jay Timothy<br>
  Abstract: Disability Rhetoric is the first book to view rhetorical theory and history through the lens of disability studies. Traditionally, the body has been seen as, at best, a rhetorical distraction; at worst, those whose bodies do not conform to a narrow range of norms are disqualified from speaking. Yet, Dolmage argues that communication has always been obsessed with the meaning of the body and that bodily difference is always highly rhetorical. Following from this rewriting of rhetorical history, he outlines the development of a new theory, affirming the ideas that all communication is embodied, that the body plays a central role in all expression, and that greater attention to a range of bodies is therefore essential to a better understanding of rhetorical histories, theories, and possibilities.<br>

Using David Herman's 1999 definition of "postclassical narratology" from Narratologies: New Perspectives on Narrative Analysis (OSUP) as their launching point, these eleven essayists explore the various ways in which new approaches overlap and interrelate to form new ways of understanding narrative texts.<br>

  Author(s) NIELSEN HENRIK SKOV<br>
  Abstract: In the theory of autobiography, theoretical developments in literary studies are clearly reflected. From an earlier mimetic understanding of the genre as the representation of an autonomous and homogeneous self the pendulum swung to the deconstructionist view, dominant in the late 1970s and early 1980s. According to deconstructionist tenets, there can be no representation of self in language, but only an illusion of “self” generated by a purely textual subject. It was at this point that theorists like Michael Sprinker even went as far as to proclaim the “end of autobiography” (Sprinker 1980). Since the late 1980s, however, the pendulum<br>

  Abstract: Shortly before her baptism into the Catholic Church on March 31, 1956, Elizabeth Hester received from her friend Flannery O’Connor a present in the mail: the final copy of O’Connor’s latest short story, “Greenleaf,” which would be published that summer by John Crowe Ransom in the

  Book Title: Sodomscapes-Hospitality in the Flesh<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gallagher Lowell<br>
  Abstract: Sodomscapes presents a fresh approach to the story of Lot’s wife, as it’s been read across cultures and generations. In the process, it reinterprets foundational concepts of ethics, representation, and the body. While the sudden mutation of Lot’s wife in the flight from Sodom is often read to confirm our antiscopic bias, a rival tradition emphasizes the counterintuitive optics required to nurture sustainable habitations for life in view of its unforeseeable contingency. Whether in medieval exegesis, Russian avant-garde art, Renaissance painting, or today’s Dead Sea health care tourism industry, the repeated desire to reclaim Lot’s wife turns the cautionary emblem of the mutating woman into a figural laboratory for testing the ethical bounds of hospitality. Sodomscape—the book’s name for this gesture—revisits touchstone moments in the history of figural thinking and places them in conversation with key thinkers of hospitality. The book’s cumulative perspective identifies Lot’s wife as the resilient figure of vigilant dwelling, whose in-betweenness discloses counterintuitive ways of understanding what counts as a life amid divergent claims of being-with and being-for.<br>

  Book Title: New Romantic Cyborgs-Romanticism, Information Technology, and the End of the Machine<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Coeckelbergh Mark<br>
  Abstract: Romanticism and technology are widely assumed to be opposed to each other. Romanticism -- understood as a reaction against rationalism and objectivity -- is perhaps the last thing users and developers of information and communication technology (ICT) think about when they engage with computer programs and electronic devices. And yet, as Mark Coeckelbergh argues in this book, this way of thinking about technology is itself shaped by romanticism and obscures a better and deeper understanding of our relationship to technology. Coeckelbergh describes the complex relationship between technology and romanticism that links nineteenth-century monsters, automata, and mesmerism with twenty-first-century technology's magic devices and romantic cyborgs.Coeckelbergh argues that current uses of ICT can be interpreted as attempting a marriage of Enlightenment rationalism and romanticism. He describes the "romantic dialectic," when this new kind of material romanticism, particularly in the form of the cyborg as romantic figure, seems to turn into its opposite. He shows that both material romanticism and the objections to it are still part of modern thinking, and part of the romantic dialectic. Reflecting on what he calls "the end of the machine," Coeckelbergh argues that to achieve a more profound critique of contemporary technologies and culture, we need to explore not only different ways of thinking but also different technologies -- and that to accomplish the former we require the latter.<br>

  Book Title: Freedom and Time-A Theory of Constitutional Self-Government<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): RUBENFELD JED<br>
  Abstract: Should we try to "live in the present"? Such is the imperative of modernity, Jed Rubenfeld writes in this important and original work of political theory. Since Jefferson proclaimed that "the earth belongs to the living"-since Freud announced that mental health requires people to "get free of their past"-since Nietzsche declared that the happy man is the man who "leaps" into "the moment-modernity has directed its inhabitants to live in the present, as if there alone could they find happiness, authenticity, and above all freedom.But this imperative, Rubenfeld argues, rests on a profoundly inadequate, deforming picture of the relationship between freedom and time. Instead, Rubenfeld suggests, human freedom-human being itself--necessarily extends into both past and future; self-government consists of giving our lives meaning and purpose over time. From this conception of self-government, Rubenfeld derives a new theory of constitutional law's place in democracy. Democracy, he writes, is not a matter of governance by the present "will of the people"; it is a matter of a nation's laying down and living up to enduring political and legal commitments. Constitutionalism is not counter to democracy, as many believe, or a pre-condition of democracy; it is or should be democracy itself--over time. On this basis, Rubenfeld offers a new understanding of constitutional interpretation and of the fundamental right of privacy.<br>

  Book Title: The Operation of Grace-Further Essays on Art, Faith, and Mystery<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfe Gregory<br>
  Abstract: The Operation of Grace collects a decade’s worth of essays by Gregory Wolfe taken from the pages of Image, the literary journal he founded more than a quarter century ago. As he notes in the preface, his Image editorials, while they cover a wide range of topics, focus on the intersection of “art, faith, and mystery". Wolfe believes that art and religion, while hardly identical, offer illuminating analogies to one another—art deepening faith through the empathetic reach of the imagination and faith anchoring art in a vision beyond the artist’s ego. Several essays dwell on how aesthetic values like ambiguity, tragedy, and beauty enlarge our understanding of the spiritual life. There are also a series of reflections that extend Wolfe’s campaign to renew the neglected and often misunderstood tradition of Christian humanism. Finally, there are sections that contain more personal meditations arising from Wolfe’s involvement in nurturing and promoting the work of emerging writers and artists. The Operation of Grace demonstrates once again why novelist Ron Hansen has spoken of Wolfe as “one of the most incisive and persuasive voices of our generation".<br>

  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Johnstone Tiffany<br>
  Abstract: As the centenary of the Great War approaches, citizens worldwide are reflecting on the history, trauma, and losses of a war-torn twentieth century. It is in remembering past wars that we are at once confronted with the profound horror and suffering of armed conflict and the increasing elusiveness of peace. The contributors to Bearing Witness do not presume to resolve these troubling questions, but provoke new kinds of reflection. They explore literature, the arts, history, language, and popular culture to move beyond the language of rhetoric and commemoration provided by politicians and the military. Adding nuance to discussions of war and peace, this collection probes the understanding and insight created in the works of musicians, dramatists, poets, painters, photographers, and novelists, to provide a complex view of the ways in which war is waged, witnessed, and remembered. A compelling and informative collection, Bearing Witness sheds new light on the impact of war and the power of suffering, heroism and memory, to expose the human roots of violence and compassion.

  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Ross Christine<br>
  Abstract: Through the study of exemplary media works and practices - photography, film, video, performance, installations, web cams - scholars from various disciplines call attention to the unsettling of identification and the disablement of vision in contemporary aesthetics. To look at an image that prevents the stabilization of identification, identity and place; to perceive a representation that oscillates between visibility and invisibility; to relate to an image which entails a rebalancing of sight through the valorization of other senses; to be exposed, through surveillance devices, to the gaze of new figures of authority - the aesthetic experiences examined here concern a spectator whose perception lacks in certainty, identification, and opticality what it gains in fallibility, complexity, and interrelatedness. Precarious Visualities provides a new understanding of spectatorship as a relation that is at once corporeal and imaginary, and persistently prolific in its cultural, social, and political effects.

  Book Title: The Vision of the Soul-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson James Matthew<br>
  Abstract: Ours is an age full of desires but impoverished in its understanding of where those desires lead-an age that claims mastery over the world but also claims to find the world as a whole absurd or unintelligible. In
      The Vision of the Soul, James Matthew Wilson seeks to conserve the great insights of the western tradition by giving us a new account of them responsive to modern discontents. The western- or Christian Platonist-tradition, he argues, tells us that man is an intellectual animal, born to pursue the good, to know the true, and to contemplate all things in beauty. Wilson begins by reconceiving the intellectual conservatism born of Edmund Burke's jeremiad against the French Revolution as an eff­ort to preserve the West's vision of man and the cosmos as ordered by and to beauty. After defining the achievement of that vision and its tradition, Wilson off­ers an extended study of the nature of beauty and the role of the fine arts in shaping a culture but above all in opening the human intellect to the perception of the form of reality. Through close studies of Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Maritain, he recovers the classical vision of beauty as a revelation of truth and being. Finally, he revisits the ancient distinction between reason and story-telling, between mythos and logos, in order to rejoin the two.Story-telling is foundational to the forms of the fine arts, but it is no less foundational to human reason. Human life in turn constitutes a specific kind of form-a story form. The ancient conception of human life as a pilgrimage to beauty itself is one that we can fully embrace only if we see the essential correlation between reason and story and the essential convertibility of truth, goodness and beauty in beauty. By turns a study in fundamental ontology, aesthetics, and political philosophy, Wilson's book invites its readers to a renewal of the West's intellectual tradition.<br>

I concluded by urging artists and writers to appreciate what such modernist experiments help reveal about the nature of art, but also to return to formal practices that better respect Mnemosyne as the mother of the arts and, in turn, better respect the form of the story as an essential means to understanding the human condition. In this recommendation, I<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapter raised the question of how the concept of the political should be interpreted in theories of democracy. One key difference of interpretation is captured in Hannah Pitkin’s distinction between the idealist and realist dimensions of political life and also in Oliver Marchart’s distinction between associative and dissociative concepts of the political. The distinction at stake is not simply one between more consensual or more agonistic perspectives. It is, rather, a distinction that turns on different ways of understanding the dynamics of conflict and discord. Understood in this way, the difference of interpretation is closely related to another<br>

For a lawyer, history primarily means precedents: prior rulings upon which a new case can be constructed.

  Author(s): White Harrison C.<br>
  Abstract: In this completely revised edition of one of the foundational texts of network sociology, Harrison White refines and enlarges his groundbreaking theory of how social structure and culture emerge from the chaos and uncertainty of social life. Incorporating new contributions from a group of young sociologists and many fascinating and novel case studies, Identity and Control is the only major book of social theory that links social structure with the lived experience of individuals, providing a rich perspective on the kinds of social formations that develop in the process. Going beyond traditional sociological dichotomies such as agency/structure, individual/society, or micro/macro,
      Identity and Controlpresents a toolbox of concepts that will be useful to a wide range of social scientists, as well as those working in public policy, management, or associational life and, beyond, to any reader who is interested in understanding the dynamics of social life.<br>

Motivated by a desire to analyse women’s life stories, and informed by many years as a midwife, I took on the task of retelling a life story revolving around the centrality of the character’s bodily experience of womanhood, manifested through her experiences of rape, intimate violence, birth, and mothering. This enterprise opened the door to a critical understanding of the nature of subjectivity as represented and re-presented in fiction and non-fiction in the form of birth narratives.

Much of the feminist literature on globalization discusses the ways women are affected by global economies, politics, and migration. The economic imperative to cross borders, and what this border crossing means to the identities of both communities and individuals, has been examined.¹ This work is vital to understanding how global capital affects the opportunities and identities of those forced to navigate it, but this focus on borders and identities often obscures the ways in which “the body” is affected by the flows of globalization.<br>

Although migration may be a straightforward demographic event, the context in which it occurs and the mechanisms underlying it are often highly complex, and require careful study. To begin with, it is important to consider the individual role of the migrant.

  Abstract: The turn to biographical methods in social science is invigorating the relationship between policy and practice. This book shows how biographical methods can improve theoretical understanding of professional practice, as well as enrich the development of professionals, and promote more meaningful practitioner - service user relationships.This book uses a range of interpretive approaches to reveal the dynamics of service users' and professionals' individual experiences and life-worlds. From their research the contributors show how biographical methods can improve theoretical understanding of professional practice, as well as enrich the learning and development of professionals, and promote more meaningful and creative practitioner - service user relationships. The book: · reviews applications of biographical methods in both policy and practice in a range of professional contexts, from health and social care to education and employment; · explores the impact of social change in three main arenas - transformation from Eastern to Western types of society in Europe, major shifts in social and welfare principles, experiences of immigration and of new cultural diversities - on professional practice; · critically evaluates subjective and reflexive processes in interactions between researchers, practitioners and users of services; · considers the institutional arrangements and cultural contexts which support effective and sensitive interventions; · draws on actual projects and tracks reflection, progress and outcomes. With contributions from leading international experts, it provides a valuable comparative perspective. Researchers, policy analysts and practitioners, postgraduate students, teachers and trainers will find this book a stimulating read.<br>

  Book Title: Antropologia-  Publisher: John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin, Faculty of Philosophy<br>
  Author(s): JANECZEK Ks. Stanisław<br>
  Abstract: Antropologia [Anthropology] is a gateway to the series of volumes devoted to particular disciplines of philosophy, taking into account their relationship with the Christian worldview and recognizing the need to include the philosophical and ideological diversity of contemporary culture. Antropologia covers Thomist tradition, enriching its achievements with other perspectives, especially Karol Wojtyla's personalism. Increasing influence of "third culture thinking", where the humanities are carried out in the context of the natural sciences, justifies the need to take up the difficult task of demonstrating complex problems of philosophical and natural anthropology. Anthropological considerations force us to realize the multifaceted nature of classical discussions on the nature of man, including theirs scientific and ideological facets, and to demonstrate them in a well-balanced manner. In this context, it enables readers to gain guidance in the debate on the philosophy of mind, providing ways of understanding and assessing the problem of the human soul (concerning the mind-body problem).<br>

Because of this transition, some central elements important to our understanding of human evolution may have been lost, that is, those elements of human evolution that are difficult to quantify or to be “read” directly out of biology.

As critics and scholars, we invoke historical assumptions in our practice, our methods, and our theory. The problem, therefore, is to present a conception of historical knowledge and literary understanding that will acknowledge this phenomenon and make practice consonant with it. And to do this, one must begin by recognizing the historical nature of literary study. In this essay I shall be using examples from my own work in progress—a study of literary change from Milton to Keats—and although I<br>

  Abstract: What is the legacy of James Baldwin? From today’s perspective, there are numerous possibilities for answering this question. One could, for instance, consider his impact on black studies, cultural studies, gay and lesbian studies, diaspora studies, and American studies. Or one might feel inclined to contend that his version of a radical humanism is particularly useful for postidentity politics at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Another possibility for confronting the question of Baldwin’s legacy would be to call attention to his understanding of the function of the writer as a public intellectual.

  Abstract: In this chapter I argue that reproductive politics are foundational to the cosmopolitan project, and its aims for global citizenship and solidarity. I suggest that reproductive politics are not only the struggle over who controls women’s fertility, but are also the cultural context in which certain relationships are perceived, represented, and reproduced, whilst others are not. Seeing reproductive politics in this way allows us to consider reproduction as related to the national structures that give rise to a need for cosmopolitanism in the first instance, as well as to consider reproduction as related to our understanding of whom we imagine<br>

  Book Title: Mourning Nature-Hope at the Heart of Ecological Loss and Grief<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): LANDMAN KAREN<br>
  Abstract: We are facing unprecedented environmental challenges, including global climate change, large-scale industrial development, rapidly increasing species extinction, ocean acidification, and deforestation – challenges that require new vocabularies and new ways to express grief and sorrow over the disappearance, degradation, and loss of nature. Seeking to redress the silence around ecologically based anxiety in academic and public domains, and to extend the concepts of sadness, anger, and loss, Mourning Nature creates a lexicon for the recognition and expression of emotions related to environmental degradation. Exploring the ways in which grief is experienced in numerous contexts, this groundbreaking collection draws on classical, philosophical, artistic, and poetic elements to explain environmental melancholia. Understanding that it is not just how we mourn but what we mourn that defines us, the authors introduce new perspectives on conservation, sustainability, and our relationships with nature. An ecological elegy for a time of climatic and environmental upheaval, Mourning Nature challenges readers to turn devastating events into an opportunity for positive change. Contributors include Glenn Albrecht (Murdoch University, retired); Jessica Marion Barr (Trent University); Sebastian Braun (University of North Dakota); Ashlee Cunsolo (Labrador Institute of Memorial University); Amanda Di Battista (York University); Franklin Ginn (University of Edinburgh); Bernie Krause (soundscape ecologist, author, and independent scholar); Lisa Kretz (University of Evansville); Karen Landman (University of Guelph); Patrick Lane (Poet); Andrew Mark (independent scholar); Nancy Menning (Ithaca College); John Charles Ryan (University of New England); Catriona Sandilands (York University); and Helen Whale (independent scholar).We are facing unprecedented environmental challenges, including global climate change, large-scale industrial development, rapidly increasing species extinction, ocea~<br>

There is a good deal of postmodernism in the quest for rhetoric and aesthetics in modern historiography because the modernism of historiography is defined by it’s academic or, in a broader sense of the word, its scientific character. The widespread and deeply rooted opinion of academic historians, as well as of postmodernist theorists of history, is that this scientific character stands in opposition to rhetoric and<br>

  Book Title: How to Do Comparative Theology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VON STOSCH KLAUS<br>
  Abstract: For a generation and more, the contribution of Christian theology to interreligious understanding has been a subject of debate. Some think of theological perspectives are of themselves inherently too narrow to support interreligious learning, and argue for an approach that is neutral or, on a more popular level, grounded simply open-minded direct experience. In response, comparative theology argues that theology, as faith seeking understanding, offers a vital perspective and a way of advancing interreligious dialogue, aided rather than hindered by commitments; theological perspectives can both complement and step beyond the study of religions by methods detached and merely neutral. Thus comparative theology has been successful in persuading many that interreligious learning from one faith perspective to another is both possible and worthwhile, and so the work of comparative theology has become more recognized and established globally. With this success there has come to the fore new challenges regarding method: How does one do comparative theological work in a way that is theologically grounded, genuinely open to learning from the other, sophisticated in pursuing comparisons, and fruitful on both the academic and practical levels?<br>

  Abstract: Evidence of creative imagistic activity in dream formation does not encourage us to assimilate all dreaming to representational language. Still, the difficulty in evaluating when dream imagery goes beyond prior verbal understanding suggests that imagery and language must continuously interact anyway. The linguistic processes that enter dreams most readily are more presentational than representational—in that “the whole domain of verbal wit is put at the disposal of the dreamwork” (Freud, 1900, p. 376). Certainly, in many of Freud’s own dreams ordinary language has been spontaneously rearranged in the form of rebuslike wordplay, visual hieroglyphics based on special turns of<br>

  Book Title: The Ambiguous Allure of the West-Traces of the Colonial in Thailand<br>
  Publisher: Hong Kong University Press, HKU<br>
  Author(s): Chakrabarty Dipesh<br>
  Abstract: The book brings studies of modern Thai history and culture into dialogue with debates in comparative intellectual history, Asian cultural studies, and postcolonial studies. It takes Thai Studies in new directions through case studies of the cultural hybridity and ambivalences that have emerged from the manifold interactions between Siam/Thailand and the West from 1850 to the present day. Central aims of The Ambiguous Allure of the West are to critique notions of Thai "uniqueness" or "exceptionalism" and locate Thai Studies in a broader, comparative perspective by arguing that modern Siam/Thailand needs to be understood as a semicolonial society. In contrast to conservative nationalist and royalist accounts of Thai history and culture, which resist comparing the country to its once-colonized Asian neighbours, this book's contributors highlight the value of postcolonial analysis in understanding the complexly ambiguous, interstitial, liminal and hybrid character of Thai/Western cultural interrelationships. At the same time, by pointing to the distinctive position of semicolonial societies in the Western-dominated world order, the chapters in this book make significant contributions to developing the critical theoretical perspectives of international cultural studies. The contributors demonstrate how the disciplines of history, anthropology, political science, film and cultural studies all enhance these contestations in intersecting ways, and across different historical moments. Each of the chapters raises manifold themes and questions regarding the nature of intercultural exchange, interrogated through theoretically critical lenses. This book directs its discussions at those studying not only in the fields of Thai and Southeast Asian studies but also in colonial and postcolonial studies, Asian cultural studies, film studies and comparative critical theory.<br>

  Author(s): JAMIESON SANDRA<br>
  Abstract: Points of Departureencourages a return to empirical research about writing, presenting a wealth of transparent, reproducible studies of student sources. The volume shows how to develop methods for coding and characterizing student texts, their choice of source material, and the resources used to teach information literacy. In so doing, the volume advances our understanding of how students actually write.The contributors offer methodologies, techniques, and suggestions for research that move beyond decontextualized guides to grapple with the messiness of research-in-process, as well as design, development, and expansion. Serviss and Jamieson's model of RAD writing studies research is transcontextual and based on hybridized or mixed methods. Among these methods are citation context analysis, research-aloud protocols, textual and genre analysis, surveys, interviews, and focus groups, with an emphasis on process and knowledge as contingent. Chapters report on research projects at different stages and across institution types-from pilot to multi-site, from community college to research university-focusing on the methods and artifacts employed.A rich mosaic of research about research,Points of Departureadvances knowledge about student writing and serves as a guide for both new and experienced researchers in writing studies.Contributors: Crystal Benedicks, Katt Blackwell-Starnes, Lee-Ann Kastman Breuch, Kristi Murray Costello, Anne Diekema, Rebecca Moore Howard, Sandra Jamieson, Elizabeth Kleinfeld, Brian N.

  Abstract: Any glance at the contemporary history of the world shows that the problem of evil is a central concern for people everywhere. In the last few years, terrorist attacks, suicide bombings, and ethnic and religious wars have only emphasized humanity's seemingly insatiable capacity for violence. In Feminist Philosophy and the Problem of Evil, Robin May Schott brings an international group of contemporary feminist philosophers into debates on evil and terrorism. The invaluable essays collected here consider gender-specific evils such as the Salem witch trials, women's suffering during the Holocaust, mass rape in Bosnia, and repression under the Taliban, as well as more generalized acts of violence such as the 9/11 bombings, the Madrid train station bombings, and violence against political prisoners. Readers of this sobering volume will find resources for understanding the vulnerability of human existence and what is at stake in the problem of evil.<br>

  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): RAYMAN JOSHUA<br>
  Abstract: What are the foundations of human self-understanding and the value of responsible philosophical questioning? Focusing on Heidegger's early work on facticity, historicity, and the phenomenological hermeneutics of factical-historical life, Hans-Helmuth Gander develops an idea of understanding that reflects our connection with the world and other, and thus invites deep consideration of phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. He draws usefully on Husserl's phenomenology and provides grounds for exchange with Descartes, Dilthey, Nietzsche, Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Foucault. On the way to developing a contemporary hermeneutical philosophy, Gander clarifies the human relation to self in and through conversation with Heidegger's early hermeneutics. Questions about reading and writing then follow as these are the very actions that structure human self-understanding and world understanding.<br>

  Abstract: With the hermeneutical demonstration that our never other than life worldly situated self-understanding is always already historical at the origin of its self-worldly significance, the factual analysis of Heidegger’s early work comes to an end, in that for one thing, it makes explicit the point of departure of phenomenological hermeneutics of factical historical life in the wealth of its structures. For another, beyond the fact of placing the starting point in life, the central question of his early work illuminates at the same time how “factical life-experience belongs in a wholly originary sense to the problematic of philosophy,”¹ in that<br>

  Author(s) Collins David B.<br>
  Abstract: THE CONCERN WITH the power of judgment arises in Hannah Arendt’s work in response to critical events in modernity. As a result of the impotence of familiar standards and categories to provide answers and orientation, this power has become undone. It is a question not only of the impotence of the common standards regarding certain events of modernity but also of the fact that these events have been so terrifying that they have altogether destroyed all our habitual categories of thought and standards of judgment. Yet, as Arendt remarks in 1953 in “Understanding and Politics (The Difficulties of Understanding),” that<br>

  Book Title: Music and Embodied Cognition-Listening, Moving, Feeling, and Thinking<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): COX ARNIE<br>
  Abstract: Taking a cognitive approach to musical meaning, Arnie Cox explores embodied experiences of hearing music as those that move us both consciously and unconsciously. In this pioneering study that draws on neuroscience and music theory, phenomenology and cognitive science, Cox advances his theory of the "mimetic hypothesis," the notion that a large part of our experience and understanding of music involves an embodied imitation in the listener of bodily motions and exertions that are involved in producing music. Through an often unconscious imitation of action and sound, we feel the music as it moves and grows. With applications to tonal and post-tonal Western classical music, to Western vernacular music, and to non-Western music, Cox's work stands to expand the range of phenomena that can be explained by the role of sensory, motor, and affective aspects of human experience and cognition.<br>

  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Coe Cynthia D.<br>
  Abstract: Levinas's account of responsibility challenges dominant notions of time, autonomy, and subjectivity according to Cynthia D. Coe. Employing the concept of trauma in Levinas's late writings, Coe draws together his understanding of time and his claim that responsibility is an obligation to the other that cannot be anticipated or warded off. Tracing the broad significance of these ideas, Coe shows how Levinas revises our notions of moral agency, knowledge, and embodiment. Her focus on time brings a new interpretive lens to Levinas's work and reflects on a wider discussion of the fragmentation of human experience as an ethical subject. Coe's understanding of trauma and time offers a new appreciation of how Levinas can inform debates about gender, race, mortality, and animality.<br>

  Abstract: This book has focused on the array of issues around subjectivity and time that emerges out of Levinas’s thought and particularly how he challenges the mastery over time that helps to define the ideal of the sovereign subject—an ideal that has prevailed in various iterations in modern Western culture. That sense of mastery and its accompanying anxieties have shaped dominant conceptions of not only responsibility, justice, and freedom, but also of gender, race, embodiment, mortality, and animality. For Levinas, this understanding of subjectivity affirms and perpetuates the basic attitude of the

  Abstract: Part religious studies, part feminist theory, part philosophy, part indescribable: such is Numinous Subjects. Described by the author as 'a kaleidoscopic exploration of why three gendered figures of the sacred matter within western culture,' the experience of reading this text truly is akin to gazing through a constantly turning kaleidoscope. Images, concepts, phrases and quotes are continually revisited, recombined, though never repeated in quite the same way. From these tumbling constellations arises a new understanding and wary appreciation of the figures of the virgin, the mother, and the whore. Drawing on the insights of thinkers as diverse as Rudolph Otto, Julia Kristeva, Simone de Beauvoir, and Martin Buber, Numinous Subjects simultaneously expands and focuses our attention on the myth of the sacred and its implications for female subjects in western culture today.<br>

  Book Title: Desi Divas-Political Activism in South Asian American Cultural Performances<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Mississippi<br>
  Author(s): Garlough Christine L.<br>
  Abstract: Desi Divas: Activism in South Asian American Cultural Performancesis the product of five years of field research with progressive activists associated with the School for Indian Languages and Cultures (SILC), South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT), the feminist dance collective Post Natyam, and the grassroots feminist political organization South Asian Sisters. Christine L. Garlough explores how traditional cultural forms may be critically appropriated by marginalized groups and used as rhetorical tools to promote deliberation and debate, spur understanding and connection, broaden political engagement, and advance particular social identities. Within this framework she examines how these performance activists advocate a political commitment to both justice and care, to both deliberative discussion and deeper understanding. To consider how this might happen in diasporic performance contexts, Garlough weaves together two lines of thinking. One grows from feminist theory and draws upon a core literature concerning the ethics of care. The other comes from rhetoric, philosophy, and political science literature on recognition and acknowledgment. This dual approach is used to reflect upon South Asian American women's performances that address pressing social problems related to gender inequality, immigration rights, ethnic stereotyping, hate crimes, and religious violence.<br>

  Author(s) Verstraeten Johan<br>
  Abstract: The term “patristic social ethics” may convey the impression that the Church Fathers—already an immensely varied group of individuals covering at least half a millennium—shared a number of systematic views on social issues. It seems to suggest that they held a set of norms and rules, which can be reconstructed through the careful reading of their sermons, letters, and dogmatic works. On such an understanding, patristic teaching on property, poverty, or usury, takes the form of a coherent, discrete body of doctrines. Such an approach might work well for theological topics, for example, the interpretation of the Trinity<br>

  Abstract: This volume contains the papers presented at the second biennial Information Systems Foundations ('Constructing and Criticising') Workshop, held at The Australian National University in Canberra from 16-17 July 2004. The focus of the workshop was, as for the first in the series, the foundations of Information Systems as an academic discipline. The particular emphasis was on the adequacy and completeness of theoretical underpinnings and the research methods employed. At the same time the practical nature of the applications and phenomena with which the discipline deals were kept firmly in view. The papers in this volume range from the unashamedly theoretical ('The Struggle Towards an Understanding of Theory in Information Systems') to the much more practically oriented ('A Procedural Model for Ontological Analyses'). The contents of this volume will be of interest and relevance to academics and advanced students as well as thoughtful and reflective practitioners in the Information Systems field.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jcn17">The Philosophy of the Western</a><br>
  Author(s) McMahon Jennifer L.<br>
  Abstract: A common perception associated with the classic western suggests characters welded to their notions of right judgment, characters who will not deviate from their code of honor, regardless of consequences. The honor implied in such deliberate devotion to duty is characteristically celebrated, at least on the surface, in the acts and speeches of typical heroes. It follows that the unyielding posture of the hero suggests a certain understanding of ethics. A strong hero is committed to his course of action because he sees the necessity to choose in a particular way, as the right thing to do, regardless of public<br>

  Abstract: Things long ignored or repressed often return with a vengeance. Evil, or the problem of evil, is a case in point. As heirs to the Enlightenment, Western societies in recent centuries have tended to sideline evil as a spook or as the relic of a distant past. In the poignant words of Lance Morrow: “The children of the Enlightenment sometimes have an inadequate understanding of the possibilities of Endarkenment.”¹ Two events in more recent times have disrupted this complacency and catapulted evil back into the limelight. The first was the experience of totalitarianism, and especially the atrocities of the Nazi<br>

  Book Title: The Governance of Common Property in the Pacific Region-  Publisher: ANU E Press<br>
  Author(s): Larmour Peter<br>
  Abstract: In a region where mining, forestry, fish and other primary resources are so basic to income, employment and national prosperity, an understanding of rights to land, water and minerals is fundamental. Tenure regimes in the Asia-Pacific region are vastly more diverse and complex than in those of any other part of the world for comparable population numbers. These studies will overcome the simplistic misunderstandings that have obscured understanding in so many instances. This book provides an up-to-date overview of the main patterns of indigenous property rights, particularly those held by corporate groups, in the South Pacific Forum region (Australia, New Zealand and the independent Pacific island nations) plus a valuable comparative chapter on Canada. It explores the relative success and failure of a variety of approaches to the management of these complex systems, and offers insights and suggestions for the amelioration of present and likely future stresses in the systems. It is a valuable contribution to the understanding of both governance and property, and to the effective sociopolitical development of the region. - Ron Crocombe, Emeritus Professor, University of the South Pacific<br>

  Abstract: The contributors to this inspiring anthology meet the challenge that everyone faces: that of becoming a whole person in both their personal and professional lives. John C. Haughey, SJ, has gathered twelve professionals in higher education from a variety of disciplines-philosophy, theology, health care, business, and administration. What they have in common reflects the creative understanding of the meaning of "catholic" as Haughey has found it to operate in Catholic higher education. Each essay in the first six chapters describes how its author has assembled a unique whole from within his or her particular area of academic competence. The last six chapters are more autobiographical, with each author describing what has become central to his or her identity. All twelve are "anticipating an entirety" with each contributing a coherence that is as surprising as it is delightful.<br>

  Book Title: Christianity in Evolution-An Exploration<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): MAHONEY JACK<br>
  Abstract: Evolution has provided a new understanding of reality, with revolutionary consequences for Christianity. In an evolutionary perspective the incarnation involved God entering the evolving human species to help it imitate the trinitarian altruism in whose image it was created and counter its tendency to self-absorption. Primarily, however, the evolutionary achievement of Jesus was to confront and overcome death in an act of cosmic significance, ushering humanity into the culminating stage of its evolutionary destiny, the full sharing of God's inner life. Previously such doctrines as original sin, the fall, sacrifice, and atonement stemmed from viewing death as the penalty for sin and are shown not only to have serious difficulties in themselves, but also to emerge from a Jewish culture preoccupied with sin and sacrifice that could not otherwise account for death. The death of Jesus on the cross is now seen as saving humanity, not from sin, but from individual extinction and meaninglessness. Death is now seen as a normal process that affect all living things and the religious doctrines connected with explaining it in humans are no longer required or justified. Similar evolutionary implications are explored affecting other subjects of Christian belief, including the Church, the Eucharist, priesthood, and moral behavior.<br>

  Book Title: The Sexual Person-Toward a Renewed Catholic Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lawler Michael G.<br>
  Abstract: Two principles capture the essence of the official Catholic position on the morality of sexuality: first, that any human genital act must occur within the framework of heterosexual marriage; second, each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life. In this comprehensive overview of Catholicism and sexuality, theologians Todd A. Salzman and Michael G. Lawler examine and challenge these principles. Remaining firmly within the Catholic tradition, they contend that the church is being inconsistent in its teaching by adopting a dynamic, historically conscious anthropology and worldview on social ethics and the interpretation of scripture while adopting a static, classicist anthropology and worldview on sexual ethics. While some documents from Vatican II, like
      Gaudium et spes("the marital act promotes self-giving by which spouses enrich each other"), gave hope for a renewed understanding of sexuality, the church has not carried out the full implications of this approach. In short, say Salzman and Lawler: emphasize relationships, not acts, and recognize Christianity's historically and culturally conditioned understanding of human sexuality.The Sexual Persondraws historically, methodologically, and anthropologically from the best of Catholic tradition and provides a context for current theological debates between traditionalists and revisionists regarding marriage, cohabitation, homosexuality, reproductive technologies, and what it means to be human. This daring and potentially revolutionary book will be sure to provoke constructive dialogue among theologians, and between theologians and the Magisterium.<br>

  Abstract: Throughout this book we have argued that Catholic sexual morality is institutionalized within the confines of marriage and procreation, and we have examined the foundations of two principles that articulate the essence of that Catholic morality. The first principle states that “any human genital act whatsoever may be placed only within the confines of marriage”;¹ the second states that “each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life.”² In contemporary Catholic moral theology, two approaches to understanding these principles demarcate two schools of Catholic moral theology.

Since children are fully a third of all humanity, and since they are not morally reducible to adults, this transformation is no small matter. Reimagining ethics in light of childhood—and not just in light of adulthood—is challenging and often surprising.

  Book Title: Overcoming Our Evil-Human Nature and Spiritual Exercises in Xunzi and Augustine<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stalnaker Aaron<br>
  Abstract: Can people ever really change? Do they ever become more ethical, and if so, how?
      Overcoming Our Evilfocuses on the way ethical and religious commitments are conceived and nurtured through the methodical practices that Pierre Hadot has called "spiritual exercises." These practices engage thought, imagination, and sensibility, and have a significant ethical component, yet aim for a broader transformation of the whole personality. Going beyond recent philosophical and historical work that has focused on ancient Greco-Roman philosophy, Stalnaker broadens ethical inquiry into spiritual exercises by examining East Asian as well as classical Christian sources, and taking religious and seemingly "aesthetic" practices such as prayer, ritual, and music more seriously as objects of study. More specifically,Overcoming Our Evilexamines and compares the thought and practice of the early Christian Augustine of Hippo, and the early Confucian Xunzi. Both have sophisticated and insightful accounts of spiritual exercises, and both make such ethical work central to their religious thought and practice. Yet to understand the two thinkers' recommendations for cultivating virtue we must first understand some important differences. Here Stalnaker disentangles the competing aspects of Augustine and Xunxi's ideas of "human nature." His groundbreaking comparison of their ethical vocabularies also drives a substantive analysis of fundamental issues in moral psychology, especially regarding emotion and the complex idea of "the will," to examine how our dispositions to feel, think, and act might be slowly transformed over time. The comparison meticulously constructs vivid portraits of both thinkers demonstrating where they connect and where they diverge, making the case that both have been misunderstood and misinterpreted. In throwing light on these seemingly disparate ancient figures in unexpected ways, Stalnaker redirects recent debate regarding practices of personal formation, and more ~<br>

  Book Title: Truth Matters-Knowledge, Politics, Ethics, Religion<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Shuker Ronnie<br>
  Abstract: Why should we seek and tell the truth? Does anyone know what truth is? Many are skeptical about the relevance of truth. Truth Matters endeavours to show why truth is important in a world where the very idea of truth is contested. Putting philosophers in conversation with educators, literary scholars, physicists, political theorists, and theologians, Truth Matters ranges across both analytic and continental philosophy and draws on the ideas of thinkers such as Aquinas, Balthasar, Brandom, Davidson, Dooyeweerd, Gadamer, Habermas, Kierkegaard, Plantinga, Ricoeur, and Wolterstorff. Some essays attempt to provide a systematic account of truth, while others wrestle with the question of how truth is told and what it means to live truthfully. Contributors address debates between realists and anti-realists, explore issues surrounding relativism and constructivism in education and the social sciences, examine the politics of truth telling and the ethics of authenticity, and consider various religious perspectives on truth. Most scholars agree that truth is propositional, being expressed in statements that are subject to proof or disproof. This book goes a step farther: yes, propositional truth is important, but truth is more than propositional. To recognize how it is more than propositional is crucial for understanding why truth truly matters.

  Book Title: Art and Its Uses in Thomas Mann's 'Felix Krull'-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Schonfield Ernest<br>
  Abstract: The turn of the twentieth century was a time of identity crisis for the upper and middle classes, one in which increased social mobility caused the blurring of traditional boundaries and created a need for reference works such as the British Who's Who (1897). At the same time, the rise of a new leisure industry and an increase in international travel led to a boom period for confidence men, who frequently operated in hotels and holiday resorts. Thomas Mann's "Felix Krull", written between 1910-13 and continued (though never completed) in 1951-54, uses contemporary accounts of these figures as a starting-point from which to explore the aesthetics of society. The early Krull marks an important stage in Mann's development in a number of respects.In writing it, Mann acquired a more flexible conception of identity and a new understanding of the relation between artist and public. Krull also signals a deeper engagement with Goethe and a shift in Mann's work towards a more open treatment of sexuality. The novel presents art as being central to the development of the individual and to social interaction. While Krull is nominally a confidence man, he is more of a performance artist, a purveyor of beauty who relies upon the complicity of his audience. The later Krull takes up where Mann left off and continues the justification of art as an essential human activity. This study draws upon unpublished material in order to provide a comprehensive reading of "Felix Krull". It examines the novel within the context of Mann's work as a whole, and, in doing so, it seeks to demonstrate the remarkable continuity of Mann's creative achievement.<br>

  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Glejzer Richard R.<br>
  Abstract: In this brilliant collection, literary scholars, philosophers, and teachers inquire into the connections between antifoundational philosophy and the rhetorical tradition. What happens to literary studies and theory when traditional philosophical foundations are disavowed? What happens to the study of teaching and writing when antifoundationalism is accepted? What strategies for human understanding are possible when the weaknesses of antifoundationalism are identified? This volume offers answers in classic essays by such thinkers as Richard Rorty, Terry Eagleton, and Stanley Fish, and in many new essays never published before.The contributors to this book explore the nexus of antifoundationalism and rhetoric, critique that nexus, and suggest a number of pedagogical and theoretical alternatives. The editors place these statements into a context that is both critical and evaluative, and they provide for voices that dissent from the antifoundational perspective and that connect specific, practical pedagogies to the broader philosophical statements. For those with an interest in rhetoric, philosophy, comparative literature, or the teaching of composition, this book sets forth a wealth of thought-provoking ideas.<br>

  Abstract: Since 1980 both Jewish and non-Jewish scholars have made important contributions to the understanding of antisemitism, dubbed by Robert Wistrich “the longest hatred.”¹ But little attention has been given to antisemitism’s opposite, philosemitism.² That lacuna exists even though it has been increasingly recognized that Jewish history is not a story of unremitting worldwide persecution. Allowing for rough patches, America in particular has been hospitable to Jews. Even

  Abstract: Renaissance humanism is defined in large part in terms of its idealization of classical culture and its attempts, implicitly dependent on historical understanding, to imitate the ancient Romans and Greeks in moral, social, and political as well as literary terms.¹ Humanism is defined, too, by its particular attachment to the humanities

  Abstract: It is necessary to refer again to Karl Barth at this point. He proposed that Christian hermeneutics is a procedure whose taxonomy or phenomenology may be very simply set forth in three logically distinct but in fact united elements:
                  explicatio, meditatio, applicatio. Applicatio, the last of these, is for him the transition from the sense to the use of scriptural texts. In his “rules” for using philosophical schemes or some subjective modality in reading, he was talking aboutmeditatio. The proponents of type 5 may be described as saying thatat best, understanding the Bible—and Christian language more generally<br>

First, I will summarize two recent attempts by biblical exegetes, one Catholic and one Protestant, to expose the meaning of John 10:1–18.

  Abstract: Science and philosophy did not develop spontaneously within Judaism. The intellectual activities of traditional Jewish cultures generally focused on the canonical texts of the tradition: the Bible, the Mishnah, the Talmud. Any other type of knowledge, that is, any knowledge not vested with the authority of the canonical texts and of revelation, was considered “foreign.” This point, fundamental for understanding Jewish intellectual history, was forcefully stated in 1933 by the great historian Julius Guttmann: “The history of Jewish philosophy is a history of the successive absorption of foreign ideas.”¹<br>

  Abstract: Avicenna’s theory of allegory is straightforward, easily summarized, and, obviously, highly pertinent to an understanding of the rhetorical dimension of his allegories and philosophical writings. As with any theory of literary creation or interpretation, however, Avicenna’s hermeneutics must be taken with a grain of salt. Authorial theories of composition and reading are indeed relevant, but they should not be accepted so literally that they overly determine our understanding of the workings of the texts themselves. Writers often valorize rules of composition or endorse methods of interpretation that they themselves do not completely follow in practice.¹ Avicenna’s theory of interpretation is<br>

  Abstract: Among the Songhay of Mali and Niger, who consider the stomach the seat of personality, learning is understood not in terms of mental activity but in bodily terms. Songhay bards study history by "eating the words of the ancestors," and sorcerers learn their art by ingesting particular substances, by testing their flesh with knives, by mastering pain and illness. In
      Sensuous ScholarshipPaul Stoller challenges contemporary social theorists and cultural critics who-using the notion of embodiment to critique Eurocentric and phallocentric predispositions in scholarly thought-consider the body primarily as a text that can be read and analyzed. Stoller argues that this attitude is in itself Eurocentric and is particularly inappropriate for anthropologists, who often work in societies in which the notion of text, and textual interpretation, is foreign. ThroughoutSensuous ScholarshipStoller argues for the importance of understanding the "sensuous epistemologies" of many non-Western societies so that we can better understand the societies themselves and what their epistemologies have to teach us about human experience in general.<br>

  Book Title: The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africa-  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): LEMARCHAND RENÉ<br>
  Abstract: Endowed with natural resources, majestic bodies of fresh water, and a relatively mild climate, the Great Lakes region of Central Africa has also been the site of some of the world's bloodiest atrocities. In Rwanda, Burundi, and the Congo-Kinshasa, decades of colonial subjugation-most infamously under Belgium's Leopold II-were followed by decades of civil warfare that spilled into neighboring countries. When these conflicts lead to horrors such as the 1994 Rwandan genocide, ethnic difference and postcolonial legacies are commonly blamed, but, with so much at stake, such simple explanations cannot take the place of detailed, dispassionate analysis.
      The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africaprovides a thorough exploration of the contemporary crises in the region. By focusing on the historical and social forces behind the cycles of bloodshed in Rwanda, Burundi, and the Congo-Kinshasa, René Lemarchand challenges much of the conventional wisdom about the roots of civil strife in former Belgian Africa. He offers telling insights into the appalling cycle of genocidal violence, ethnic strife, and civil war that has made the Great Lakes region of Central Africa the most violent on the continent, and he sheds new light on the dynamics of conflict in the region. Building on a full career of scholarship and fieldwork, Lemarchand's analysis breaks new ground in our understanding of the complex historical forces that continue to shape the destinies of one of Africa's most important regions.<br>

  Book Title: Aliens and Sojourners-Self as Other in Early Christianity<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DUNNING BENJAMIN H.<br>
  Abstract: Early Christians spoke about themselves as resident aliens, strangers, and sojourners, asserting that otherness is a fundamental part of being Christian. But why did they do so and to what ends? How did Christians' claims to foreign status situate them with respect to each other and to the larger Roman world as the new movement grew and struggled to make sense of its own boundaries?
      Aliens and Sojournersargues that the claim to alien status is not a transparent one. Instead, Benjamin Dunning contends, it shaped a rich, pervasive, variegated discourse of identity in early Christianity. Resident aliens and foreigners had long occupied a conflicted space of both repulsion and desire in ancient thinking. Dunning demonstrates how Christians and others in antiquity capitalized on this tension, refiguring the resident alien as being of a compelling doubleness, simultaneously marginal and potent. Early Christians, he argues, used this refiguration to render Christian identity legible, distinct, and even desirable among the vast range of social and religious identities and practices that proliferated in the ancient Mediterranean. Through close readings of ancient Christian texts such as Hebrews, 1 Peter, theShepherd of Hermas, and theEpistle to Diognetus, Dunning examines the markedly different ways that Christians used the language of their own marginality, articulating a range of options for what it means to be Christian in relation to the Roman social order. His conclusions have implications not only for the study of late antiquity but also for understanding the rhetorics of religious alienation more broadly, both in the ancient world and today.<br>

  Author(s) Bastos Susana<br>
  Abstract: The preference for an anthropological reflection upon identity processes as a means to overcome the micro-macro dichotomy that has hampered the development of the social sciences (Calhoun 1996) immediately faces a number of obstacles. A strategy of total subjective and relative social research, reduced to micro-dimensions (limited to the construction of the self and interaction), may impede an analysis of the relationships between socio-historical groups. Similarly, a strategy of conceptual and theoretical babelisation of the concept of identity (and its derivatives) may lead to the loss of its analytical function in understanding historical dynamics.<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy of Communication-  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Butchart Garnet C.<br>
  Abstract: To philosophize is to communicate philosophically. From its inception, philosophy has communicated forcefully. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle talk a lot, and talk ardently. Because philosophy and communication have belonged together from the beginning--and because philosophy comes into its own and solidifies its stance through communication--it is logical that we subject communication to philosophical investigation. This collection of key works of classical, modern, and contemporary philosophers brings communication back into philosophy's orbit. It is the first anthology to gather in a single volume foundational works that address the core questions, concepts, and problems of communication in philosophical terms. The editors have chosen thirty-two selections from the work of Plato, Leibniz, Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Benjamin, Lacan, Derrida, Sloterdijk, and others. They have organized these texts thematically, rather than historically, in seven sections: consciousness; intersubjective understanding; language; writing and context; difference and subjectivity; gift and exchange; and communicability and community. Taken together, these texts not only lay the foundation for establishing communication as a distinct philosophical topic but also provide an outline of what philosophy of communication might look like.<br>

Young’s understanding of technê operates on a more strict definition that ultimately nudges technê toward rigid, formalist practices.

  Abstract: Let us begin to consider that dance evolves by means of aesthetic-historic oppositions, and that it does so in relation to defining constants, which are points of departure and return. The purpose of this chapter is twofold, then, and concerned with tensional factors of definition. In view of this, let us first reject the notion that dance can be redefined, as it is often claimed. Rather, we might see that there are constant points of reference in our understanding of what dance is; sometimes these points are even stated, as we name the aesthetic essence of a particular dance and<br>

  Book Title: The Cultural Values of Europe-  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Skinner Alex<br>
  Abstract: What is the cultural identity of Europe? Are there specifically European values? Questions like these are at the centre of a considerable number of political and scholarly debates in contemporary Europe. In this international best-seller, a group of acclaimed thinkers – including Orlando Patterson, S. N. Eisenstadt, Mark Mazower and Wolfgang Schluchter – examine the most important innovations and culturally vital value traditions of Europe to produce an image of contemporary European self-understanding. The volume combines two possible approaches, examining both specific cultural traditions (‘Athens and Jerusalem’) and specific values (‘freedom’; ‘rationality’). Boasting some of the leading thinkers in Europe and edited by Hans Joas and Klaus Wiegandt, The Cultural Values of Europe will be required reading for anyone hoping to understand the common cultural ground in Europe.<br>

  Abstract: After the Shoah politics and political solidarity take on a different quality. The attribution of an identity and the affirmation of that identity have to be viewed as importantly different. It is no longer possible to define Jewish identity simply in terms of the object of persecution and oppression.¹ Such descriptions deny the possibility of that conception of identity that Jews would attribute to themselves. The politics of identity has to take the divide between attribution and affirmation as central to any understanding and evaluation of claims concerning identity. Within the investigations of solidarity friendship has emerged as a model<br>

  Abstract: France provides a particularly complex and fascinating object of analysis for any investigation into the impact of war on modern and contemporary cultural production and cultural history, having been at war for almost fifty years of the twentieth century. This impact is characterised by radically different experiences and memories of the two world wars, and further complicated by enduring legacies of those wars, and of subsequent, brutal colonial wars. An understanding of the impact that the experiences of these different types of war have made on French cultural, social and political identity is essential for the broader analysis of developments<br>

Its driving interest is instead ontological—an interest in the question of the “meaning of being.” Yet inasmuch as the work adopts a thoroughly hermeneuticized approach to ontology—the very focus on themeaningof being suggests as such—so the inquiry into ontology also involves Heidegger in an inquiry into the “structure” of understanding. Although the explicitly hermeneutic focus disappears from Heidegger’s later work, still the concern with understanding, thought in terms of a broader happening of disclosedness—a happening of world—can be seen<br>

  Abstract: New knowledge may take many forms, ranging from art works to personal narratives to mathematical theorems to scientific findings. Such knowledge emerging from the research process is most often in the form of theory. Theory, like research, has many definitions and applications. Some of these are narrow and restrictive, requiring a theory to be derived from quantifiable data and capable of being tested. Other definitions are more inclusive and consider a theory to be a systematically organized set of statements that analyze and explain the nature and behavior of a specified set of phenomena.

  Abstract: Until recently, the issue of the nature of consciousness was almost exclusively in the hands of philosophers. As the various sciences of the mind progress and accumulate new data, more empirical light is being shed on the phenomenon of consciousness (see, for example, Velmans 1991; Dennett and Kinsbourne 1992; Lahav 1993; Marcel and Bisiach 1988). Although we are still at a very early stage of the scientific understanding of the human mind, I think that the attempt to examine what current scientific knowledge can tell us about that phenomenon is worthwhile.<br>

Animating these technical and rational understandings in spirit and practice is another, quite incommensurable concept. Corruption, under this deeper (and popular) understanding, is a raw moral idea. It invokes ideas of ʺdepravityʺ and ʺevil,ʺ human frailty and temptation. It is the capture of individuals and political systems<br>

  Abstract: How do mobile media technologies shape identities? Identity – what it is to be and have a self, and to belong to social and cultural groups – is always mediated. People understand themselves, others and their world in terms of the media they know and use. According to philosopher Paul Ricoeur, narrative is the privileged medium for self-understanding and social/cultural identifications.¹ The quick and widespread adoption of mobile media technologies prompts us to revisit this claim. In this window I look at the context of Jakarta, Indonesia, to show how urban mobile media practices shape identities in playful ways.<br>

  Book Title: A Jesuit Garden in Beijing and Early Modern Chinese Culture-  Publisher: Purdue University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zou Hui<br>
  Abstract: In this volume, Hui Zou analyzes historical, architectural, visual, literary, and philosophical perspectives on the Western-styled garden that formed part of the great Yuanming Yuan complex in Beijing, constructed during the Qing dynasty. Designed and built in the late eighteenth century by Italian and French Jesuits, the garden described in this book was a wonderland of multistoried buildings, fountains, labyrinths, and geometrical hills. It even included an open-air theater. Through detailed examination of historical literature and representations, Zou analyzes the ways in which the Jesuits accommodated their design within the Chinese cultural context. He shows how an especially important element of their approach was the application of a linear perspective—the “line-method”—to create the jing, the Chinese concept of the bounded bright view of a garden scene. Hui Zou’s book demonstrates how Jesuit metaphysics fused with Chinese cosmology and broadens our understanding of cultural and religious encounters in early Chinese modernity. It presents an intriguing reflection on the interaction between Western metaphysics and the poetical tradition of Chinese culture. The volume will be of interest to scholars and students in a variety of fields, including literature, philosophy, architecture, landscape and urban studies, and East-West comparative cultural studies.<br>

For purposes of understanding the significance of the earlier date, the most important change was the renewal (following Jerome [347–420]) of Hebrew study among Christians.

  Book Title: The Jewish Jesus-Revelation, Reflection, Reclamation<br>
  Publisher: Purdue University Press<br>
  Author(s): Garber Zev<br>
  Abstract: There is a general understanding within religious and academic circles that the incarnate Christ of Christian belief lived and died a faithful Jew. This volume addresses Jesus in the context of Judaism. By emphasizing his Jewishness, the authors challenge today’s Jews to reclaim the Nazarene as a proto-rebel rabbi and invite Christians to discover or rediscover the Church’s Jewish heritage. The essays in this volume cover historical, literary, liturgical, philosophical, religious, theological, and contemporary issues related to the Jewish Jesus. Several of them were originally presented at a three-day symposium on “Jesus in the Context of Judaism and the Challenge to the Church,” hosted by the Samuel Rosenthal Center for Judaic Studies at Case Western Reserve University in 2009. In the context of pluralism, in the temper of growing interreligious dialogue, and in the spirit of reconciliation, encountering Jesus as living history for Christians and Jews is both necessary and proper. This book will be of particular interest to scholars of the New Testament and Early Church who are seeking new ways of understanding Jesus in his religious and cultural milieu, as well Jewish and Christian theologians and thinkers who are concerned with contemporary Jewish and Christian relationships.<br>

Instead, it is the antisemite who constructs the notion of the "Jew" and "Semitism" in a contingent manner (Virchow 162). The standard understanding of the notion is that of "being against Jews."

  Book Title: Making Transcendents-Ascetics and Social Memory in Early Medieval China<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Campany Robert Ford<br>
  Abstract: By the middle of the third century B.C.E. in China there were individuals who sought to become transcendents (xian)—deathless, godlike beings endowed with supernormal powers. This quest for transcendence became a major form of religious expression and helped lay the foundation on which the first Daoist religion was built. Both xian and those who aspired to this exalted status in the centuries leading up to 350 C.E. have traditionally been portrayed as secretive and hermit-like figures. This groundbreaking study offers a very different view of xian-seekers in late classical and early medieval China. It suggests that transcendence did not involve a withdrawal from society but rather should be seen as a religious role situated among other social roles and conceived in contrast to them. Robert Campany argues that the much-discussed secrecy surrounding ascetic disciplines was actually one important way in which practitioners presented themselves to others. He contends, moreover, that many adepts were not socially isolated at all but were much sought after for their power to heal the sick, divine the future, and narrate their exotic experiences.

  Book Title: The Subject in Crisis in Contemporary Chinese Literature-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Cai Rong<br>
  Abstract: Post-Mao China produced two parallel discourses on the human subject in the New Era (1976–1989). One was an autonomous, Enlightenment humanist self aimed at replacing the revolutionary paragon that had dominated under Mao. The other was a more problematic subject suffering from either a symbolic physical deformity or some kind of spiritual paralysis that undermines its apparent normalcy. How do we explain the stubborn presence, in the literature of the 1980s and 1990s, of this crippled agent who fails to realize the humanist autonomy envisioned by post-Mao theorists? What are the anxieties and tensions embedded in this incongruity and what do they reveal? This illuminating and original critical study of the crippled subject in post-Mao literature offers a detailed textual analysis of the work of five well-known contemporary writers: Han Shaogong, Can Xue, Yu Hua, Mo Yan, and Jia Pingwa. The author investigates not only the literary characters within the texts, but also their creators—real subjects in history, Chinese writers whose own agency was being tested and established in the search for a new subjectivity. She argues that, reenacting the Maoist legacy, the literary search failed to provide a viable model for a postrevolutionary China. In addition, the deficiency and inadequacy of the subject cannot always be contained in the Communist past—a history to be transcended in the design of modernity after Mao. The representation of the problematic subject thus punctured post-Mao optimism and foreshadowed the eventual abandonment of the move to rethink subjectivity in the 1990s. By diving beneath the euphoria of the 1980s and the confusion and frustration of the 1990s, these critical readings offer a unique perspective with which to gauge the complexity of China’s quest for modernity and a fuller understanding of the self’s multifaceted experience in the post-Mao era.<br>

  Abstract: Despite the many discussions on the subject, the problem of justice has always retained a freshness and incisiveness that challenges our understanding. This is because, in our search for a theoretical explanation of a theory of justice and a rational account of its applicability, we always start from an immediate and concrete sense of justice or injustice.

  Abstract: The art of the Papunya Tula painting movement has stimulated dozens of exhibitions both locally and internationally in the past twenty-five years. It has inspired many catalogue essays and anthropologically inflected studies. TV documentaries and films have been dedicated to it. Thoroughly researched monographs have been devoted to individual artists involved in the movement’s beginnings. The exhibition catalogue

  Abstract: Anyone who has visited the South Korean capital of Seoul will have noticed the myriad church steeples that dominate the cityscape, especially at night when the crosses atop them light up in red or white neon. The prevalence of these steeples in Seoul—as in other cities and towns across the southern half of the Korean peninsula—speaks to the ubiquity of Christianity in modern South Korea. For understanding modern Korean culture, society, and politics, the importance of Christianity cannot be underestimated.

  Book Title: Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): MATSUMOTO STACIE<br>
  Abstract: The first three centuries of the Heian period (794–1086) saw some of its most fertile innovations and epochal achievements in Japanese literature and the arts. It was also a time of important transitions in the spheres of religion and politics, as aristocratic authority was consolidated in Kyoto, powerful court factions and religious institutions emerged, and adjustments were made in the Chinese-style system of ruler-ship. At the same time, the era’s leaders faced serious challenges from the provinces that called into question the primacy and efficiency of the governmental system and tested the social/cultural status quo. Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries, the first book of its kind to examine the early Heian from a wide variety of multidisciplinary perspectives, offers a fresh look at these seemingly contradictory trends. Essays by fourteen leading American, European, and Japanese scholars of art history, history, literature, and religions take up core texts and iconic images, cultural achievements and social crises, and the ever-fascinating patterns and puzzles of the time. The authors tackle some of Heian Japan’s most enduring paradigms as well as hitherto unexplored problems in search of new ways of understanding the currents of change as well as the processes of institutionalization that shaped the Heian scene, defined the contours of its legacies, and make it one of the most intensely studied periods of the Japanese past.<br>

  Book Title: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains-Culture and Society in the Highlands of Bali<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Reuter Thomas A.<br>
  Abstract: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains is the first comprehensive ethnography of the Bali Aga, a large ethnic minority that occupies the island's central highlands. The Bali Aga are popularly viewed as the indigenous counterparts to other Balinese who trace their origin to invaders from the Javanese kingdom of Majapait, who have ruled Bali from the fourteenth century A.D. Although Bali remains one of the most intensely researched localities in the world, the Bali Aga have long been overshadowed by the more exotic courtly culture of the south. A closer analysis of the changing position of the Bali Aga within Balinese society provides a key to understanding the politics and social process of cultural representation in Bali and beyond. The process is marked by a blend of representational competition and cooperation among the Bali Aga themselves, among the Bali Aga and southern Balinese, and later among the island's aristocratic elites and foreign colonizers or scholars, and state authorities. The study of this process raises important issues about the establishment and maintenance of status and power structures at regional, national, and global levels. Custodians of the Sacred Mountains explores the marginalization of the Bali Aga in light of a critical theory of cultural representation and calls for a morally engaged approach to ethnographic research. It proposes an intersubjective and communicative model of human interaction as the foundation for understanding the relative significance of cooperation and competition in the cultural production of knowledge.<br>

We all have a practical interest in representational models insofar as they have a tangible effect on all of our lives, for better or worse, as models for living. Social scientists also have a theoretical interest in representational models, as they struggle to gain a general understanding of particular societies and of society in general. The Bali Aga, likewise, approach representation from these two inseparable perspectives as they negotiate practical conflicts among self-interested subjects and simultaneously<br>

His deep and insightful analysis of key works by novelists Juan José Saer

  Abstract: Anyone who has sat on a jury or followed a high-profile trial on television usually comes to the realization that a trial, particularly a criminal trial, is really a performance. Verdicts seem determined as much by which lawyer can best connect with the hearts and minds of the jurors as by what the evidence might suggest. In this celebration of the American trial as a great cultural achievement, Robert Burns, a trial lawyer and a trained philosopher, explores how these legal proceedings bring about justice. The trial, he reminds us, is not confined to the impartial application of legal rules to factual findings. Burns depicts the trial as an institution employing its own language and styles of performance that elevate the understanding of decision-makers, bringing them in contact with moral sources beyond the limits of law.<br>

  Abstract: From Augustine to our own era, introspection is inextricable from “self-consciousness,” which in turn is integral to and, in some sense, coincident with various understandings of selfhood. Simply, self-consciousness is enacted through self-reflexivity, and in this process of self-awareness, identity emerges. But the word “reflexivity” has a more circumscribed history. Reflexivity appears as a paradigm of understanding the self during the early modern period, coincident with the preoccupation with optics and the birth of a new physics of light. “Reflexivity” was first applied to cognitive introspection, in referring to “thought as bending back upon itself,” in the 1640s, when theologians,<br>

Considering themes of loss, witness, translation, identity, and exclusion, Seyhan interprets diasporic literatures as condensed archives of cultural and linguistic memory that give integrity and coherence to pasts ruptured by migration.<br>

Wolin examines how Maoism captured the imaginations of France's leading cultural figures, influencing Sartre's "perfect Maoist moment"; Foucault's conception of power; Sollers's chic, leftist intellectual journal

Only then can a government count itself as securely established on its social foundations. Since democracy implies that each individual is the bearer of fundamental rights, the consent of all is the only incontestable guarantee of respect for each.

In early modern Europe, Calvin and Spinoza did their best to define contingency out of existence. In the eighteenth century, Leibniz, Montesquieu, and Hume followed suit. Outcomes that appear to be the result of chance, Hume wrote, may be the product of “the secret operation of contrary causes.”¹ Montesquieu makes a more extreme claim, insisting, “If the fortune of a battle, that is, a particular case, has<br>

  Book Title: War at a Distance-Romanticism and the Making of Modern Wartime<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Favret Mary A.<br>
  Abstract: What does it mean to live during wartime away from the battle zone? What is it like for citizens to go about daily routines while their country sends soldiers to kill and be killed across the globe? Timely and thought-provoking,
         War at a Distanceconsiders how those left on the home front register wars and wartime in their everyday lives, particularly when military conflict remains removed from immediate perception, available only through media forms. Looking back over two centuries, Mary Favret locates the origins of modern wartime in the Napoleonic era and describes how global military operations affected the British populace, as the nation's army and navy waged battles far from home for decades. She reveals that the literature and art produced in Britain during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries obsessively cultivated means for feeling as much as understanding such wars, and established forms still relevant today.<br>

  Abstract: Understanding war. This book has been asking what war meant to a population whose experience and memory were shaped by warfare, a population whose armies and navies were almost constantly engaged in military conflict across the globe, though rarely, if ever, on home ground. It has asked how war was understood by those who were, at least as subjects of a sovereign state, often at war, though never actually in battle. But it has not yet asked what it meant to make war an object of understanding.<br>

  Abstract: The necessity of narrative—indeed the hunger for it—evident in these epigraphs resonates with the work of narrative theorists such as Robert Caserio and Peter Brooks, both of whom identify narrative as an essential mode of understanding reality. But curiously, their insistence on narrative is out of tune with the views of a number of poststructuralist theorists such as Roland Barthes, Julia Kristeva, and Hélène Cixous as well as those whom they have influenced. These theorists have variously suggested that what they loosely call “poetry,” the “poetic,” or the “lyric” is the avant-garde of modernity’s disruptions of the symbolic<br>

In its challenge to exclusivist modes of social imagination and practice there emerges in this art a different mentality characterized by an insistence on balancing public and private modes of discourse, a love of ideological play, and an acknowledgment of the thinking, discerning person.

Our discussion of genre suggested that to read a poem as lyric is to read it as creating a reciprocal relation between mind and world. Such reflections do not by themselves suffice to ground a hermeneutic theory or a program of interpretation.

Portentous and wistful by turns, our talk about Shakespeare habitually sets him between times, last witness for the old, first prophet of the new, a genius of the divided vision and a symbol of our own life on the margins of tradition.

In so saying we use the term ‘contribution’ in rather different senses, the first two of which are, if trite, unexceptionable insofar as they refer to tangible quantitative phenomena.

  Abstract: Thus far, we have identified a few guidelines that governed historical writing as an art of the imagination. Like any compositions, the works with which we are concerned depended on exclusion as well as inclusion, but even what was included has appeared shapeless to modern scholars. There is little regard for narrative unity, no organic wholeness. At some times, one encounters gaps in a narrative; at others, a concatenation of narratives.

  Abstract: Important trends in contemporary intellectual life celebrate difference, divisiveness, and distinction. Speculative writing increasingly highlights "hermeneutic gaps" between human beings, their histories, and their hopes. In this book Karl Morrison identifies an alternative to this disruption. He explores for the first time the entire legacy of thought revolving around the challenging claim "I am you"--perhaps the most concise possible statement of bonding through empathy. Professor Morrison shows that the hope for thoroughgoing understanding and inclusion in another's world view is central to the West's moral/intellectual tradition. He maintains that the West may yet escape the fatal flaw of casting that hope in paradigms of sexual and aesthetic dominance--examples of empathetic participation inspired by hunger for power, as well as by love.<br>

  Author(s): Tatar Maria<br>
  Abstract: In these compelling new essays, leading critics sharpen our understanding of the narrative structures that convey meaning in fiction, taking as their point of departure the narratological positions of Dorrit Cohn, Grard Genette, and Franz Stanzel. This collection demonstrates how narratology, with its attention to the modalities of presenting consciousness, offers a point of entry for scholars investigating the socio-cultural dimensions of literary representations. Drawing from a wide range of literary texts, the essays explore the borderline between fiction and history; explain how characters are constructed by both author and reader through the narration of consciousness; show how gender shapes narrative strategies ranging from the depiction of consciousness through intertextuality to the representation of the body; address issues of contingency in narrative; and present a debate on the crucial function of person in the literary text. The contributors are Stanley Corngold, Gail Finney, Kte Hamburger, Paul Michael Ltzeler, David Mickelsen, John Neubauer, Thomas Pavel, Jens Rieckmann, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, Judith Ryan, Franz Stanzel, Susan Suleiman, Maria Tatar, David Wellbery, and Larry Wolff.<br>

  Abstract: It has been impossible, in this exposition of the “self” as a “task,” to trace the emergence of self-consciousness without constant reference to the topic of freedom. At the very begining, it was said that the transition from possibility to actuality occurs only as the “leap” of freedom. But before freedom could be described, it was necessary to analyse its precursors: angst, reflection, and consciousness. And a brief preliminary summary of some aspects of freedom was required in order to clarify the nature of angst. Now those aspects must be explored and exposited in detail. Kierkegaard's understanding of “freedom” is<br>

  Book Title: Karl Polanyi on Ethics and Economics-Foreword by Marguerite Mendell<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Baum Gregory<br>
  Abstract: Exploring Polanyi's lesser-known works as well as The Great Transformation, Baum provides a more complete and nuanced understanding of Polanyi's thought. He examines Polanyi's interpretation of modern economic and social history, clarifies the ethical presuppositions present in Polanyi's work, and addresses how Polanyi's understanding of the relation between ethics and economics touches on many issues relevant to the contemporary debate about the world's economic future. Baum argues that we should look to Polanyi's understanding of modern capitalism to reinstate the social discourse and, in political practice, the principles of reciprocity and solidarity. He points to examples, both in Canada and abroad, of attempts to formulate alternative models of economic development and to create new forms of institutional and cultural intervention.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I study Karl Polanyi’s reflection on the role of ethics in the making of society and in the social scientific understanding of it. Polanyi, who in his personal life was greatly inspired by Leo Tolstoy,¹ was not a philosopher in the strict sense. Yet he believed that as a social and political thinker he had to articulate his intuitions regarding the ethical foundation of human thought and action. He first did so as a young man in the Vienna of the 1920s while struggling against his depression over the useless killing of the Great War. As Polanyi<br>

  Author(s) Rutland Barry<br>
  Abstract: That higher life forms exist in the two physical categories of female and male is universally self-evident and is not of itself a problem. Beyond this basic understanding, however, the two sexes become associated with a vast panorama of cultural phenomena, including categorical ascriptions of social roles, behavioural expectations, and personality characteristics. How does the simple, incontrovertible, and universal fact of biological dimorphism generate the staggering complexity of cultural, social, and psychological dynamics of the human condition? It is the translation of the biological into social/cultural experience that is the heart of an epistemology of gender. An elaboration of the<br>

  Abstract: Academic postcolonialism has generally neglected to address the politics of reconciliation, despite the recent emergence of reconciliation political programs and movements in a wide range of national and international contexts. However, one obligation of postcolonial work is to “fully recognize” what Gyan Prakash refers to as “another history of agency and knowledge alive in the dead weight of the colonial past.”¹ This task of recognition necessitates understanding acts of anti-colonial dissent not only as theorizable but as fully productive, conceptually constructive theoretical “events” in their own right.

This loss resonated with the French, who had dealt with smaller epidemics in France and were also mourning their absent communities through a nostalgia for home. Blum traces how ghosts provided transgenerational and transcultural links that guided understanding rather than encouraging violence.

In a land whose resilient bounty promised that no wound need fester, an integrated, more comprehensive analysis of the past can yield some insights into dealing with the future. French Nativization was the fruit of the dialogue of a budding seventeenth-century global dialogue and interdependence, which entailed many layers of belonging.

  Book Title: Philosophy of Merleau-Ponty-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Matthews Eric<br>
  Abstract: In this clear and comprehensive account of Merleau-Ponty's thought Eric Matthews shows how Merleau-Ponty has contributed to current debates in philosophy, such as the nature of consciousness, the relation between biology and personality, the historical understanding of human thought and society, and many others. Surveying the whole range of Merleau-Ponty's thinking, Matthews examines his views about the nature of phenomenology and the primacy of perception; his account of human embodiment, being-in-the-world, and the understanding of human behaviour; his conception of the self and its relation to other selves; and his views on society, politics, and the arts. A final chapter considers his later thought, published posthumously. The ideas of Merleau-Ponty are of immensely important to the development of modern French philosophy. Matthews evaluates his distinctive contributions and relates his thought to that of his predecessors, contemporaries, and successors, both in France and elsewhere. This unrivalled introduction will be welcomed by analytic philosophers and cognitive scientists as well as all students taking courses in contemporary continental philosophy.<br>

This hidden predicament lies in the fact that cosmology is being constructed from within the

Interpretation is deliberative exploration and creative expression of fruitful encounter. It is essential to understanding scripture texts, historical sources and artifacts, theological writers across time, and real-time conversations about ethical, spiritual, and pastoral matters. The finding and sharing of insight involved in interpretation is always shaped by encounters between ourselves and what we read, ourselves and other people, and our own life experiences and the presence of God.<br>

  Book Title: Consider Leviathan-Narratives of Nature and the Self in Job<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Doak Brian R.<br>
  Abstract: Theologians and philosophers are turning again to questions of the meaning, or non-meaning, of the natural world for human self-understanding. Brian R. Doak observes that the book of Job, more than any other book in the Bible, uses metaphors drawn from the natural world, especially of plants and animals, as raw material for thinking about human suffering. Doak argues that Job should be viewed as an anthropological “ground zero” for the traumatic definition of the post-exilic human self in ancient Israel. Furthermore, the battered shape of the Joban experience should provide a starting point for reconfiguring our thinking about “natural theology” as a category of intellectual history in the ancient world. Doak examines how the development of the human subject is portrayed in the biblical text in either radical continuity or discontinuity with plants and animals. Consider Leviathan explores the text at the intersection of anthropology, theology, and ecology, opening up new possibilities for charting the view of nature in the Hebrew Bible.<br>

  Book Title: Stardom in Postwar France-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Holmes Diana<br>
  Abstract: The 1950s and 1960s were a key moment in the development of postwar France. The period was one of rapid change, derived from post-World War II economic and social modernization; yet many traditional characteristics were retained. By analyzing the eruption of the new postwar world in the context of a France that was both modern and traditional, we can see how these worlds met and interacted, and how they set the scene for the turbulent 1960s and 70s. The examination of the development of mass culture in post-war France, undertaken in this volume, offers a valuable insight into the shifts that took place. By exploring stardom from the domain of cinema and other fields, represented here by famous figures such as Brigitte Bardot, Johnny Hallyday or Jean-Luc Godard, and less conventionally treated areas of enquiry (politics [de Gaulle], literary [Francoise Sagan], and intellectual culture [Levi-Strauss]) the reader is provided with a broad understanding of the mechanisms of popularity and success, and their cultural, social, and political roles. The picture that emerges shows that many cultural articulations remained or became identifiably "French," in spite of the American mass-culture origins of these social, economic, and cultural transformations.<br>

  Abstract: Undoubtedly, the relevance of a psychoanalytic dimension in historical understanding correlates with the importance that is attributed to anxiety and fantasy in history. In circumstances in which historical agents—both groups and individuals—conduct themselves in what seems to observers and commentators to be a rational manner, the contribution of anxiety and fantasy to their conduct is usually taken to be negligible. Only when rational explanations are no longer considered sufficient will affects such as anxiety or unconscious fantasies play a major role in an historical analysis.<br>

  Book Title: Culture and Rhetoric-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Tyler Stephen<br>
  Abstract: While some scholars have said that there is no such thing as culture and have urged to abandon the concept altogether, the contributors to this volume overcome this impasse by understanding cultures and their representations for what they ultimately are - rhetorical constructs. These senior, international scholars explore the complex relationships between culture and rhetoric arguing that just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric. This intersection constitutes the central theme of the first part of the book, while the second is dedicated to the study of figuration as a common ground of rhetoric and anthropology. The book offers a compelling range of theoretical reflections, historical vistas, and empirical investigations, which aim to show how people talk themselves and others into particular modalities of thought and action, and how rhetoric and culture, in this way, are co-emergent. It thus turns a new page in the history of academic discourse by bringing two disciplines - anthropology and rhetoric - together in a way that has never been done before.<br>

  Book Title: Young Men in Uncertain Times-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Dyck Noel<br>
  Abstract: Anthropology is particularly well suited to explore the contemporary predicament in the coming of age of young men. Its grounded and comparative empiricism provides the opportunity to move beyond statistics, moral panics, or gender stereotypes in order to explore specific aspects of life course transitions, as well as the similar or divergent barriers or opportunities that young men in different parts of the world face. Yet, effective contextualization and comparison cannot be achieved by looking at male youths in isolation. This volume undertakes to contextualize male youths' circumstances and to learn about their lives, perspectives, and actions, and in turn illuminates the larger structures and processes that mediate the experiences entailed in becoming young men. The situation of male youths provides an important vantage point from which to consider broader social transformations and continuities. By paying careful attention to these contexts, we achieve a better understanding of the current influences encountered and acted upon by young people.<br>

  Author(s) De Kesel Marc<br>
  Abstract: In what way can Freudian psychoanalysis help contribute to a naturalist, yet non-reductionist anthropology? Such an anthropology would be one that takes into account the significance of the natural history of the human species for our understanding of the human being, but without reducing the specificity of the human to processes of natural or sexual selection. The question of reductionism is all the more relevant today given that naturalism has become a major paradigm in contemporary philosophy. Simply put, naturalism’s basic tenet is that human beings are genealogically related to each other and have common ancestors with other species. Nevertheless,<br>

  Book Title: Beyond Federal Dogmatics (pdf)-The Influence of EU Law on Belgian Constitutional Case Law Regarding Federalism<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Feyen Stef<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between EU law and national constitutional law, including constitutional law in federalism matters, has been subject to an ongoing scholarly debate. This monograph contributes to this debate in two ways. The author argues for an approach to constitutional law that goes beyond the classic - coined dogmatic - understanding of constitutional case law regarding federalism as expounded in Belgian academia. Building on that basis, he sets out to rethink the framework within which the connection between EU law and national constitutional law can be understood. The analysis delves into the relationship (and sometimes tension) between ‘rule-of-law' values (which may serve as checks upon instrumental forms of reasoning) and the toolbox deployed in constitutional court case law to accommodate several rather pragmatic needs.<br>

  Abstract: We mentioned that the object of our investigation would be how European Union law
                  influencesBelgian constitutional case law on federalism. “Influence”, however, is a difficult concept to grasp here, because it may mean a myriad of things depending on the perspective, because the object and subject of influence do not always allow for a clear definition, and because of issues related to understanding how law in general should be conceived of. The latter reason will lead us to consider the toolbox concept we deploy here in order to enrich our understanding of Belgian constitutional case law relating to federalism.<br>

  Book Title: Islam & Europe-Crises are Challenges<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): SHAH Prakash<br>
  Abstract: Within the framework of the Forum A. & A Leysen, several experts from in and outside the Muslim world contributed to this book. In Islam and Europe: Crises Are Challenges they discuss how dialogues between Islam and the West, with a focus on Europe, can be achieved. The various authors (legal scholars, political theorists, social scientists, and psychologists) explore in these collected essays such interrelated questions as: How much diversity is permissible within a liberal pluralistic democratic society? How strong are the implications of citizenship? What are equitable accommodations of contested practices? They argue for an adequate understanding of how Western Muslim communities in Europe experience their minority position and what needs to be done to improve their participation in European society. The second part of this volume is a collection of papers written around the work of Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, who also makes his own contribution to the book. The Catholic University of Leuven awarded An-Na'im an honorary doctorate in 2009 on the theme of multiculturalism, intercultural relations and diversity. An-Na'im is recognized the world over as a leading expert in the area of religion and law, and as a human rights activist. Islam and Europe: Crises Are Challenges reinforces our sense that a better knowledge and awareness of the growing diversity of our society, and striving for harmonious relations between Islam and the West, are among the most important challenges of our time.

Ahmed, Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, Shaheen Sardar Ali, Mohamed Benzakour, Jean-Yves Carlier, Marie-Claire Foblets, Ziba Mir-Hosseini, Fouad Laroui, Bettina Leysen, Rashida Manjoo, Bhikhu Parekh, Mathias Rohe, Cedric Ryngaert, Prakash Shah.

  Abstract: It goes without saying that neither secular democratic states nor Islam as a religion could be perceived to be homogeneous and immutable in time and space. this paper will firstly focus on misunderstandings relating to secularity and democracy: Contrary to the widespread understanding of secularity among Muslims, secular states open broad space not only for the private exercise of religion, but also for its public practice and appearance. As to democracy, Muslim traditionalists use to juxtapose its mechanisms to the ‘eternal provisions of God-given Sharia’. It will be briefly demonstrated that every norm, being derived from God or a human<br>

  Abstract: The jurisprudential movements of the 1980s deepened and advanced a process of crisis and transition in modern jurisprudence. The most striking facet of this transformation has been the success of new forms of jurisprudential discourse or “law talk” in penetrating, subverting, and decentering the conventional forms of legal discourse. The proliferation of different jurisprudential discourses has erased the lines between description and advocacy, making it much more difficult for traditionalists to maintain their belief in neutral and objective law.

  Book Title: Jewish Concepts of Scripture-A Comparative Introduction<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Sommer Benjamin D.<br>
  Abstract: What do Jews think scripture is? How do the People of the Book conceive of the Book of Books? In what ways is it authoritative? Who has the right to interpret it? Is it divinely or humanly written? And have Jews always thought about the Bible in the same way? In seventeen cohesive and rigorously researched essays, this volume traces the way some of the most important Jewish thinkers throughout history have addressed these questions from the rabbinic era through the medieval Islamic world to modern Jewish scholarship. They address why different Jewish thinkers, writers, and communities have turned to the Bible - and what they expect to get from it. Ultimately, argues editor Benjamin D. Sommer, in understanding the ways Jews construct scripture, we begin to understand the ways Jews construct themselves.<br>

  Book Title: 22 Ideas to Fix the World-Conversations with the World's Foremost Thinkers<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Sakwa Richard<br>
  Abstract: The aftershocks of the 2008 financial crisis still reverberate throughout the globe. Markets are down, unemployment is up, and nations from Greece to Ireland find their very infrastructure on the brink of collapse. There is also a crisis in the management of global affairs, with the institutions of global governance challenged as never before, accompanied by conflicts ranging from Syria, to Iran, to Mali. Domestically, the bases for democratic legitimacy, social sustainability, and environmental adaptability are also changing. In this unique volume from the World Public Forum Dialogue of Civilizations and the Social Science Research Council, some of the world's greatest minds - from Nobel Prize winners to long-time activists - explore what the prolonged instability of the so-called Great Recession means for our traditional understanding of how governments can and should function. Through interviews that are sure to spark lively debate,22 Ideas to Fix the Worldpresents both analysis of past geopolitical events and possible solutions and predictions for the future.The book surveys issues relevant to the U.S., Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Speaking from a variety of perspectives, including economic, social, developmental, and political, the discussions here increase our understanding of what's wrong with the world and how to get it right. Interviewees explore topics like the Arab Spring, the influence of international financial organizations, the possibilities for the growth of democracy, the acceleration of global warming, and how to develop enforceable standards for market and social regulation. These inspiring exchanges from some of our most sophisticated thinkers on world policy are honest, brief, and easily understood, presenting thought-provoking ideas in a clear and accessible manner that cuts through the academic jargon that too often obscures more than it reveals.22 Ideas to Fix the Worldis living history in the finest sense - a lasting chronicle ~<br>

Imagining women as important actors shaping the destiny of humanity was an act of faith, necessary for her to challenge historians to approach their work with an enlarged understanding of how societies advanced. She had to review books across a variety of fields to cull any references to women’s contributions in previous societies. Stanton’s methodology suggests her sympathy for new positivist trends in history that were concerned with reconstructing patterns of everyday life rather than narrating the stories of kings,<br>

  Book Title: Religious Imaginaries-The Liturgical and Poetic Practices of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Christina Rossetti, and Adelaide Procter<br>
  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): DIELEMAN KAREN<br>
  Abstract: Religious Imaginariesexplores liturgical practice as formative for how three Victorian women poets imagined the world and their place in it and, consequently, for how they developed their creative and critical religious poetics. In doing so, this new study rethinks several assumptions in the field: that Victorian women's faith commitments tend to limit creativity; that the contours of church experiences matter little for understanding religious poetry; and that gender is more significant than liturgy in shaping women's religious poetry.Exploring the import of bodily experience for spiritual, emotional, and cognitive forms of knowing, Karen Dieleman explains and clarifies the deep orientations of different strands of nineteenth-century Christianity, such as Congregationalism's high regard for verbal proclamation, Anglicanism and Anglo-Catholicism's valuation of manifestation, and revivalist Roman Catholicism's recuperation of an affective aesthetic. Looking specifically at Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Christina Rossetti, and Adelaide Procter as astute participants in their chosen strands of Christianity, Dieleman reveals the subtle textures of these women's religious poetry: the different voices, genres, and aesthetics they create in response to their worship experiences. Part recuperation, part reinterpretation, Dieleman's readings highlight each poet's innovative religious poetics.Dieleman devotes two chapters to each of the three poets: the first chapter in each pair delineates the poet's denominational practices and commitments; the second reads the corresponding poetry.Religious Imaginarieshas appeal for scholars of Victorian literary criticism and scholars of Victorian religion, supporting its theoretical paradigm by digging deeply into primary sources associated with the actual churches in which the poets worshipped, detailing not only the liturgical practices but also the architectural environments that influenced the worshipper's formation.

  Book Title: Biography and turning points in Europe and America-  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Négroni Catherine<br>
  Abstract: This sociological collection advances the argument that the concept of a turning point expands our understanding of life experiences from a descriptive to a deeper and more abstract level of analysis. It addresses the conceptual issue of what distinguishes turning points from life transitions in general and raises crucial questions about the application of turning points as a biographical research method. Biography and turning points in Europe and America is all the more distinctive and significant due to its broad empirical database. The anthology includes authors from ten different countries, providing a number of contexts for thinking about how turning points relate to constructions of meaning shaped by globalization and by cultural and structural meanings unique to each country. The book will be useful across a wide range of social sciences and particularly valuable for researchers needing a stronger theoretical base for biographical work.<br>

In times of global migration, there are countless people on the move every day. They intentionally set forth to make new achievements and take new chances in life. Thus, it often surprises me that there is hardly any empirical research that emphasises the empowering aspects of migration experience, and only a few researchers who conceptualise migration as an exciting, hopeful, future-oriented biographical project (see Morokvasic, 1991, 1993; Apitzsch, 2000, 2003; Lutz, 2000).

  Book Title: Scientific Understanding-Philosophical Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Eigner Kai<br>
  Abstract: To most scientists, and to those interested in the sciences, understanding is the ultimate aim of scientific endeavor. In spite of this, understanding, and how it is achieved, has received little attention in recent philosophy of science.
      Scientific Understandingseeks to reverse this trend by providing original and in-depth accounts of the concept of understanding and its essential role in the scientific process. To this end, the chapters in this volume explore and develop three key topics: understanding and explanation, understanding and models, and understanding in scientific practice.Earlier philosophers, such as Carl Hempel, dismissed understanding as subjective and pragmatic. They believed that the essence of science was to be found in scientific theories and explanations. In Scientific Understanding, the contributors maintain that we must also consider the relation between explanations and the scientists who construct and use them. They focus on understanding as the cognitive state that is a goal of explanation and on the understanding of theories and models as a means to this end.The chapters in this book highlight the multifaceted nature of the process of scientific research. The contributors examine current uses of theory, models, simulations, and experiments to evaluate the degree to which these elements contribute to understanding. Their analyses pay due attention to the roles of intelligibility, tacit knowledge, and feelings of understanding. Furthermore, they investigate how understanding is obtained within diverse scientific disciplines and examine how the acquisition of understanding depends on specific contexts, the objects of study, and the stated aims of research.<br>

  Book Title: Externalism-Putting Mind and World Back Together Again<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Rowlands Mark<br>
  Abstract: The externalist conception of the mind was one of the most significant developments in the philosophy of mind in the second half of the twentieth century. Despite its central importance, however, most recent work on externalism has been very technical, often making the basic ideas and principles difficult for students to grasp. As well, comparatively little work has been done to situate externalism in the history of philosophy, in either analytic and continental traditions. Mark Rowlands remedies both these problems, presenting a clear and accessible introduction to externalism that is grounded in wider developments in the history of philosophy. Rowlands discusses Sartre's radical reversal of idealism and the Husserlian views that prompted it; Wittgenstein's attack on the assimilation of meaning and understanding to an inner process; Putnam's and Burge's thought experiments and the externalism about content to which those experiments gave rise; the scope and limits of content externalism; and the extension of externalism to consciousness.<br>

  Book Title: Everyone Says No-Public Service Broadcasting and the Failure of Translation<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): CONWAY KYLE<br>
  Abstract: Quebec has never signed on to Canada's constitution. After both major attempts to win Quebec's approval - the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords - failed, Quebec came within a fraction of a percentage point of voting for independence. Everyone Says No examines how the failure of these accords was depicted in French and English media and the ways in which journalists' reporting failed to translate the differences between Quebec and the rest of Canada. Focusing on the English- and French-language networks of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Kyle Conway draws on the CBC/Radio Canada rich print and video archive as well as journalists' accounts of their reporting to revisit the story of the accords and the furor they stirred in both French and English Canada. He shows that CBC/Radio Canada attempts to translate language and culture and encourage understanding among Canadians actually confirmed viewers' pre-existing assumptions rather than challenging them.

  Abstract: The ‘evil eye,’ the notion that a
                  lookorstarecan operate as a potential source of human suffering, is prevalent in a number of societies. How people conceptualize the phenomenon, however, varies considerably not only from society to society, but also from individual to individual. Following Pirandello’s (1990) logic, I believe that there are as many models of evil eye as there are people who have formulated some idea about the phenomenon.² The model I am about to present is not necessarily shared by all Sicilian Canadians. Instead, it represents my understanding of the phenomenon based on a synthesis<br>

Jay Winter, Kate McLoughlin, and Brad Prager all work to show how silences about war may be deployed to animate an understanding of warʹs representational elusiveness.

  Abstract: The study of the historical background of a culture is vital to one’s understanding of its civility practices as well as its ongoing present. Yet, there are other equally important factors that must be considered. Although they may in some measure be the outcomes of historical and moral forces, these factors need to be studied on their own merit because the manner in which they intersect makes for an ‘anatomy of civility’ that is sociological as well as psychological. In this part of the book we will discuss these various factors and show how a ‘cultural sociology of civility’ needs<br>

And what does the possibility of sudden death mean for our ability to understand the narrative of ourselves?For the first time, this collection brings together figures in contemporary philosophy and Kierkegaard studies to explore pressing questions like these in the philosophy of personal identity and moral psychology. These essays will both advance important ongoing discussions of selfhood and expand the light that, 200 years after his birth, Kierkegaard is still able to shed on contemporary problems.<br>

  Author(s) PATTISON GEORGE<br>
  Abstract: The ‘signature narrative thesis’ serves particularly well in explaining how personal identity gets constituted through one’s reflective consciousness or understanding, although it leaves open the question of how reflective consciousness itself is constituted (cf. Davenport 2012: 2–3). Is the ‘self’ identical to the narrative form of a person’s understanding, or is there a deeper self than that which emerges on the reflective level? In contrast to this narrative view, according to recent scholarship the phenomenological tradition unanimously affirms that the core self is to be found in pre-reflective consciousness. Further, Kierkegaard has not only been suggested to be significant<br>

  Abstract: In the early nineteenth century, Schleiermacher noted that ‘understanding is an unending task’ and ‘the talent for misunderstanding is infinite’.² In more recent times, meaning has been understood as an endless deferral; the more one tries to grasp it, the more it appears ungraspable. This rings especially true if we consider the particular form of understanding that is translation. Since the meaning of a text is closely attached to its ‘letter’ – its sound or signifier – translation can never be a simple transfer of meaning. Indeed, no matter how accurately one brings meaning ‘home’,³ the result is inevitably approximate,<br>

  Abstract: Francis Bacon is famous today as one of the founding fathers of the so-called ‘scientific revolution’ of the seventeenth century. Although not an especially successful scientist himself, he was nevertheless the most eloquent and influential spokesperson for an approach to knowledge that promised to transform human understanding of both humanity and its relationship with the natural and social worlds.¹ The central features of this approach, as they emerged in Bacon’s own writings and the work of his protégés and associates after 1605, are equally well known.

As a structure of meaning and a source of norms, framed through general and abstract standards, law has an especial, inevitable capacity to misrecognise ‘the other’ at the precise moment that the other is in most need of its justice. The significance of the other, upon which Levinas speaks with unparalleled philosophical authority, is instead personal, unique, singular, and fundamental in informing our understanding of ourselves, our desires and our duties.

                  Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics(Heidegger 1997). Through his interpretation of Kant’s First Critique, Heidegger led us to the “hidden art” of the schematism. The core of Heidegger’s interpretation consists in showing that the schematism, lying in the middle between the faculties of the sensibility and the understanding, must be understood as a pure form of auto-affection, and that auto-affection must be understood through the flow of time. Heidegger shows us that the temporal movement of auto-affection contains a difference that cannot be closed off from becoming other.<br>

The past is not, since it is no longer present; the future is not, since it is not yet present; and the present is only insofar as it slips by and is already no more, since its being is to become.

  Book Title: The Ethics of Deconstruction-Derrida and Levinas<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Critchley Simon<br>
  Abstract: The Ethics of Deconstruction, Simon Critchley's first book, was originally published to great acclaim in 1992. It was the first book to argue for the ethical turn in Derrida's work and to show as powerfully as possible how deconstruction has persuasive ethical consequences that are vital to our thinking through of questions of politics and democracy. Rather than being concerned with deconstruction in terms of the contradictions inherent in any text - an approach typical of the early Derrida and those in literary criticism aiming to extract a critical method for an application to literature - Critchley concerns himself with the philosophical context necessary for an understanding of the ethics of deconstructive reading. Far from being some sort of value-free nihilism or textual free-play, Critchley showed the ethical impetus that was driving Derrida's work. His claim was that Derrida's understanding of ethics has to be understood in relation to his engagement with the work of Levinas and the book lays out the details of their philosophical confrontation.<br>

  Abstract: The argument about the relationship between time and narrative is now coming into focus. It begins in the Kantian notion that we have no access to things in themselves, but only, as phenomenology holds, to things as they are experienced, apprehended in consciousness, thought about, or understood. But the concept of consciousness cannot be taken for granted. Philosophy in general, both in the phenomenological and in the Anglo-American analytical traditions, has turned to language in order to investigate the realms of experience, perception, thought and understanding. If consciousness is fundamentally linguistic, it follows that we ought to be able to<br>

  Abstract: There is a tendency within media studies to ignore sound. The visual image has dominated: art, photography, advertising, film, television, video games, online media, mobile phones. Just compare the amount of scholarly texts on television to radio, on cinema and gaming rather than soundtracks and soundscapes. Even the mobile phone, which is essentially a listening device, has only become interesting to media studies since it has a screen interface of applications, games, graphics, e-mail, photos and videos. When it comes to memory we assume that the visual dominates and structures our understanding of the world. We do not assume that<br>

  Abstract: Intimate engagement between friends provides a unique context for the development of relations with others and for understanding of the self. The tension between our sense of connection with a friend and our recognition of our separateness from the friend within a relationship of choice is likely to present us with dilemmas. The liking, care and concern we have for a friend, which are expressive of our connection, must be balanced by a concern for the self as a separate individual, especially in situations in which these concerns come into conflict. Kant notes in his discussion of friendship that ‘if<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenology or Deconstruction?-The Question of Ontology in Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricoeur and Jean-Luc Nancy<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Watkin Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Phenomenology or Deconstruction? challenges traditional understandings of the relationship between phenomenology and deconstruction through new readings of the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricœur and Jean-Luc Nancy. A constant dialogue with Jacques Derrida's engagement with phenomenological themes provides the impetus to establishing a new understanding of 'being' and 'presence' that exposes significant blindspots inherent in traditional readings of both phenomenology and deconstruction.In reproducing neither a stock phenomenological reaction to deconstruction nor the routine deconstructive reading of phenomenology, Christopher Watkin provides a fresh assessment of the possibilities for the future of phenomenology, along with a new reading of the deconstructive legacy. Through detailed studies of the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty, Ricœur and Nancy, he shows how a phenomenological tradition much wider and richer than Husserlian or Heideggerean thought alone can take account of Derrida's critique of ontology and yet still hold a commitment to the ontological. This new reading of being and presence fundamentally re-draws our understanding of the relation of deconstruction and phenomenology, and provides the first sustained discussion of the possibilities and problems for any future 'deconstructive phenomenology'.<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter we explored the relationship between Ricoeur’s hermeneutic phenomenology and Derrida’s deconstruction by moving the ontological question from a focus on ‘what?’ to ‘who?’ While allowing us to make progress in understanding how the question of alterity in Derrida must be reconsidered when we are coming to grips with Ricoeur’s hermeneutics of the self and narrative identity, the investigation also opened, without satisfactorily resolving, the issue of coherence and multiplicity. In stating 
                  that the various discourses of Ricoeur’s hermeneutics of the self cohere, we left hanging the question as to how they cohere, which is precisely what<br>

  Abstract: Orality has been an important method for self-understanding, creating relationships, and establishing an equilibrium between body, soul and the environment. Through oral narratives, communities have been able to pass on values, attitudes, knowledge and modes of practice to generations. Because ‘story telling occupies a natural role in many African cultures’ (Pillay 2003: 109), it has the potential of functioning as a key strategy for the promotion of health and well-being. In many cases, therapeutic stories are transmitted through the mass media to be consumed by individuals in their homes or by groups in schools, orphanages, prisons, dispensaries, market places, and<br>

  Abstract: The argument in this book has suggested that democratic theory and practice needs to be reconsidered in order to accommodate the shifting meanings of democracy in contemporary politics and the spaces that have opened up between democratic aspirations and the actual operation of democratic societies.

  Abstract: Where does the history of the history of intelligence begin? As a self-conscious academic subject, intelligence history is widely understood to have started in the 1980s. In Britain, Christopher Andrew and David Dilks proclaimed a deliberate manifesto for intelligence historians in 1984, urging scholars to explore the ‘missing dimension’. Broadly contemporaneous with this, the American historian Richard Immerman asserted that it was important to incorporate covert action into any sophisticated understanding of foreign policy. The mid-1980s also saw the creation of the journal

  Abstract: This book centres on Deleuze’s understanding of literature as ‘an enterprise of health’ and of literary criticism’s links to aspects of pathology and clinical practice, especially as these latter come under scrutiny in Deleuze and Guattari’s ‘schizoanalysis’ project (CC 3). The relation between literature and health is argued for most explicitly by Deleuze in his last published book,
                  Essays Critical and Clinical. It is here that he lays out the principal hypothesis of a clinical criticism: certain authors have a weak health, but literature, by gaining a perspective on sickness, is capable of transforming this weakness into a creative power.<br>

  Abstract: What does Gadamer mean by his claim that ‘art addresses us’? It is a signature claim of philosophical hermeneutics and follows directly upon Gadamer’s assertion of the phenomenological priority of meaning in the experience of art. Not only does this emphasise Gadamer’s dialogical approach to art but it is the culmination of his critique of aesthetic subjectivism. By asserting the primacy of meaning, philosophical hermeneutics affirms the ontic priority of those cultural horizons which shape a spectator’s consciousness and in which he or she must partake as a precondition of achieving transformed understanding.

  Abstract: In the 1980s, just as the textual revolution was entering its secondary phase and sweeping the discipline, a few anthropologists began to question the disembodied nature of much of contemporary ethnography and its conceptual reliance on language-based models of analysis. Their work prepared the ground for a sensual turn in anthropological understanding—that is, a move away from linguistic and textual paradigms toward an understanding that treats cultures as ways of sensing the world. This chapter documents this countertradition within the anthropology of the 1980s and 1990s, which culminated in the emergence of the anthropology of the senses.<br>

To extend the medical metaphor, we would then see in the present or in confident prospect reductions in the incidence and severity of insecurity, destruction, casualties, and deaths, and in the opportunity costs of measures to achieve such reductions.<br>

  Abstract: The multiplicity of configurations and the multiplicity of options within each configuration support the claim that theory indeed is a theoretical construction, or a mode of political thought in Freeden’s sense. Theories offer not just explanations for complex phenomena, but also an inclusive understanding of the phenomena. They do this by defining the political concepts and thus decontesting them. This is a point worth stressing: theories do offer explanations—that being their manifest function, after all—but on a prior and deeper level, they define political concepts for

  Book Title: Understanding Health Inequalities and Justice-New Conversations across the Disciplines<br>
  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): Walker Rebecca L.<br>
  Abstract: The need for informed analyses of health policy is now greater than ever. The twelve essays in this volume show that public debates routinely bypass complex ethical, sociocultural, historical, and political questions about how we should address ideals of justice and equality in health care. Integrating perspectives from the humanities, social sciences, medicine, and public health, this volume illuminates the relationships between justice and health inequalities to enrich debates.
      Understanding Health Inequalities and Justiceexplores three questions: How do scholars approach relations between health inequalities and ideals of justice? When do justice considerations inform solutions to health inequalities, and how do specific health inequalities affect perceptions of injustice? And how can diverse scholarly approaches contribute to better health policy? From addressing patient agency in an inequitable health care environment to examining how scholars of social justice and health care amass evidence, this volume promotes a richer understanding of health and justice and how to achieve both.The contributors are Judith C.

  Book Title: Race and the Making of the Mormon People-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): MUELLER MAX PERRY<br>
  Abstract: The nineteenth-century history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Max Perry Mueller argues, illuminates the role that religion played in forming the notion of three "original" American races-red, black, and white-for Mormons and others in the early American Republic. Recovering the voices of a handful of black and Native American Mormons who resolutely wrote themselves into the Mormon archive, Mueller threads together historical experience and Mormon scriptural interpretations. He finds that the Book of Mormon is key to understanding how early followers reflected but also departed from antebellum conceptions of race as biblically and biologically predetermined. Mormon theology and policy both challenged and reaffirmed the essentialist nature of the racialized American experience.The Book of Mormon presented its believers with a radical worldview, proclaiming that all schisms within the human family were anathematic to God's design. That said, church founders were not racial egalitarians. They promoted whiteness as an aspirational racial identity that nonwhites could achieve through conversion to Mormonism. Mueller also shows how, on a broader level, scripture and history may become mutually constituted. For the Mormons, that process shaped a religious movement in perpetual tension between its racialist and universalist impulses during an era before the concept of race was secularized.<br>

  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): HARRIS ROBIN P.<br>
  Abstract: Olonkho , the epic narrative and song tradition of Siberia 's Sakha people, declined to the brink of extinction during the Soviet era. In 2005, UNESCO 's Masterpiece Proclamation sparked a resurgence of interest in olonkho by recognizing its important role in humanity 's oral and intangible heritage. Drawing on her ten years living in the Russian North, Robin P. Harris documents how the Sakha have used the Masterpiece program to revive olonkho and strengthen their cultural identity. Harris 's personal relationships with and primary research among Sakha people provide vivid insights into understanding olonkho and the attenuation, revitalization, transformation, and sustainability of the Sakha 's cultural reemergence. Interdisciplinary in scope, Storytelling in Siberia considers the nature of folklore alongside ethnomusicology, anthropology, comparative literature, and cultural studies to shed light on how marginalized peoples are revitalizing their own intangible cultural heritage.<br>

  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): AL-SUMAIT FAHED<br>
  Abstract: Starting in 2001, much of the world media used the image of Osama bin Laden as a shorthand for terrorism. Bin Laden himself considered media manipulation on a par with military, political, and ideological tools, and intentionally used interviews, taped speeches, and distributed statements to further al-Qaida's ends. In Covering Bin Laden , editors Susan Jeffords and Fahed Yahya Al-Sumait collect perspectives from global scholars exploring a startling premise: that media depictions of Bin Laden not only diverge but often contradict each other, depending on the media provider and format, the place in which the depiction is presented, and the viewer's political and cultural background. The contributors analyze the representations of the many Bin Ladens, ranging from Al Jazeera broadcasts to video games. They examine the media's dominant role in shaping our understanding of terrorists and why/how they should be feared, and they engage with the ways the mosaic of Bin Laden images and narratives have influenced policies and actions around the world. Contributors include Fahed Al-Sumait, Saranaz Barforoush, Aditi Bhatia, Purnima Bose, Ryan Croken, Simon Ferrari, Andrew Hill, Richard Jackson, Susan Jeffords, Joanna Margueritte-Giecewicz, Noha Mellor, Susan Moeller, Brigitte Nacos, Courtney C.

  Abstract: To be a historian of contemporary art is to work in a rather challenging and uncomfortable profession. First, no one can really agree on what we’re talking about when we use the term

  Author(s) CAMPBELL TRISHA N.<br>
  Abstract: This chapter develops a brief historical and theoretical overview of hardware hacking within the context of electronic music instruments, suggesting how component-level analysis of some specific artifacts can help scholars to appreciate accelerating shifts in musical production as well as larger cultural trends. The chapter does not promote hardware hacking as an optimal solution for every musician. Rather, it recognizes hacking as a long-lasting and self-sustaining technocultural practice. This recognition is achieved in part by developing an adapted understanding of Anthony Dunne’s “post-optimal electronics” (2005). Such understanding investigates what makes electronic instrument design unique, how each artist bends the traditions<br>

  Abstract: In this remarkable and often dazzling book, Paul Carter explores the conditions for sociability in a globalized future. He argues that we make many assumptions about communication but overlook barriers to understanding between strangers as well as the importance of improvisation in overcoming these obstacles to meeting. While disciplines such as sociology, legal studies, psychology, political theory, and even urban planning treat meeting as a good in its own right, they fail to provide a model of what makes meeting possible and worth pursuing: a yearning for encounter.<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, I tried to show that Modernism in Western literature—and in the New Critical and structuralist hermeneutics to which it gave rise—is grounded in a representational strategy that spatializes the temporal process of existence as being-in-the-world. It is, in other words, a strategy that is subject to a vicious circularity that closes off the phenomenological/existential understanding of the temporal being of existence, and analogously, of the literary text: the sequence of words.

  Abstract: The burden of the argument to this point has been that philosophy, in response to needs generated within its “own” history, has come to be at necessary odds with its self, its history, and the proprietary self-presence implicit in such notions of self and history. In these straits, philosophy has turned increasingly to criticism for an understanding of its activity, and so has risked also its possible disappearance into literature. Literary criticism and theory thus find themselves in an odd position: a discipline that has a long-established habit of looking elsewhere—primarily to science or philosophy—for models of its<br>

An active engagement policy is badly needed on the peninsula, but in order to overcome some of the most difficult existing security dilemmas, the policy must integrate an understanding and appreciation of difference. Democracy is crucial to this endeavor too, for in its essence a democratic ethos is all about finding ways of appreciating and redeeming difference.

  Book Title: Narratives of Agency-Self-Making in China, India, and Japan<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Dissanayake Wimal<br>
  Abstract: This multidisciplinary collection underlines the importance of understanding the operations of human agency-defined here as the ability to exert power, specifically in resistance to ideological pressure. In particular, the contributors emphasize the historical and cultural conditions that facilitate the production of agency in an effort to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures of China, India, and Japan. In Narratives of Agency, scholars from a variety of disciplines argue that traditional Western approaches to the study of these cultures have unduly focused on the pervasive influence of family and clan (China), caste and fatalism (India), and groupism (Japan). This tendency has been exacerbated by modern critical approaches, such as postmodernism and poststructuralism, that not only are increasingly popular in studying these cultures but also de-emphasize the role of the individual. The resultant undermining of the notion of human agency tends to give short shrift to the very real individual differences between groups and ignores questions of personal desire and intentionality. These essays remind us that members of a community have to make personal choices, struggle and interact with others, argue about positions, and confront new challenges, all of which involve intentionality and human agency. A new look at a topic central to cross-cultural understanding, Narratives of Agency will be essential reading for those interested in China, India, Japan, and the world beyond._x000B_ _x000B_Contributors: Richard G.

However, we rarely focus on how our seeing, thinking, and understanding of architecture or on how the social construction of our field can obstruct or advance our ability to create a built world viable and valuable for the next century.<br>

However, despite Frampton’s enormous influence in architectural culture around the world, the experiential core of his theory of critical regionalism remains unexamined. Unless we deeply comprehend how Frampton understood aesthetic experience, we will minimize its political thrust and import in architecture. Significantly, Frampton’s critics and commentators have not dealt with his peculiar understanding of experience in any detail.

  Abstract: Andrews provides new readings and interpretations of Bolaño's novels, including

He begins with a consideration of the reception of Bolaño's fiction in English translation, examining the reasons behind its popularity. Subsequent chapters explore aspects of Bolaño's fictional universe and the political, ethical, and aesthetic values that shape it. Bolaño emerges as the inventor of a prodigiously effective "fiction-making system," a subtle handler of suspense, a chronicler of aimlessness, a celebrator of courage, an anatomist of evil, and a proponent of youthful openness. Written in a clear and engaging style,Roberto's Bolano's Fictionoffers an invaluable understanding of one of the most important authors of the last thirty years.<br>

  Abstract: The 1970s brought a new understanding of the biological and intellectual impact of environmental crises on human beings, and as efforts to prevent ecological and human degradation aligned, a new literature of sickness emerged. "Ecosickness fiction" imaginatively rethinks the link between ecological and bodily endangerment and uses affect and the sick body to bring readers to environmental consciousness.<br>

  Abstract: Cosmopolitanism is an attempt to realize the imperative of universalism—to grasp the human world as one and ourselves as, to at least some extent, connected to, and therefore at least to some degree responsible for, all of it.¹ Cosmopolitics, as I will use the term, is the attempt to act politically in the world on the basis of this understanding. Our present interest in cosmopolitanism derives from the renaissance it enjoyed in the 1990s, when, in a way only partially anticipated in the high Enlightenment or after the Second World War, it struck many observers as imperative to “re-imagine<br>

  Book Title: Narrating Evil-A Postmetaphysical Theory of Reflective Judgment<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Allen Amy<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on Immanuel Kant's and Hannah Arendt's ideas about reflective judgment, Lara argues that narrative plays a key role in helping societies acknowledge their pasts. Particular stories haunt our consciousness and lead to a kind of examination and dialogue that shape notions of morality. A powerful description of a crime can act as a filter, helping us to draw conclusions about what constitutes a moral wrong, and public debates over these narratives allow us to construct a more accurate picture of historical truth, leading to a better understanding of why such actions are possible.<br>

  Abstract: Adorno claimed that, after Auschwitz, the moral imperative for the twentieth century was “never again.” It was through the use of a historical understanding of his experience that he arrived at this reflective judgment of what it meant to be alive after Auschwitz. His assessment pointed to a historical rupture between our traditions and modernity itself. Instead of founding the normative basis for morality on the positive use of reason, as Kant had done before, Adorno sought to recover the negative aspect of the categorical imperative through the notion that our experience of evil is the most significant historical knowledge<br>

  Book Title: The Disclosure of Politics-Struggles Over the Semantics of Secularization<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lara María Pía<br>
  Abstract: For Lara, secularization means three things: the translation of religious semantics into politics; a transformation of religious notions into political ideas; and the reoccupation of a space left void by changing political actors that gives rise to new conceptions of political interaction. Conceptual innovation redefines politics as a horizontal relationship between governments and the governed and better enables societies (and individual political actors) to articulate meaning through action -- that is, through the emergence of new concepts. These actions, Lara proves, radically transform our understanding of politics and the role of political agents and are further enhanced by challenging the structural dependence of politics on religious phenomena.<br>

  Abstract: In previous chapters I have often referred to Reinhart Koselleck’s work, especially his method of conceptual history, which I consistently find useful with regard to questions of translation and innovation in the emergence of secularized forms of political concepts. Koselleck is also helpful for understanding the dynamic feedback between the formulation of a concept and the social reality that creates the space in which the concept is accepted and used. In this chapter I will focus on Koselleck’s largely negative assessment of the ways in which the problem of politics versus morality has been addressed in Enlightenment thought. Koselleck’s model<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I continue to trace the movement of cultural translation designated by the term “Sikh theology” into the humanities program of the modern Western university, specifically the discourse of the history of religions. To do this it is necessary to determine how the subject of Sikhism, or the Sikh subject, came to be determined as a distinctly “religious” subject. I argue that a certain understanding of violence, or, rather, a set of unexamined assumptions about the relationship between religion and violence, is necessary for the construction and deployment of this subject as “religious” in the modern academic study<br>

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Obeyesekere Gananath<br>
  Abstract: Throughout his career, Obeyesekere has combined psychoanalysis and anthropology to illuminate the relationship between personal symbolism and religious experience. In this book, he begins with Buddha's visionary trances wherein, over the course of four hours, he witnesses hundreds of thousands of his past births and eons of world evolution, renewal, and disappearance. He then connects this fracturing of empirical and visionary time to the realm of space, considering the experience of a female Christian penitent, who stares devotedly at a tiny crucifix only to see the space around it expand to mirror Christ's suffering. Obeyesekere follows the unconscious motivations underlying rapture, the fantastical consumption of Christ's body and blood, and body mutilation and levitation, bridging medieval Catholicism and the movements of early modern thought as reflected in William Blake's artistic visions and poetic dreams. He develops the term "dream-ego" through a discussion of visionary journeys, Carl Jung's and Sigmund Freud's scientific dreaming, and the cosmic and erotic dream-visions of New Age virtuosos, and he defines the parameters of a visionary mode of knowledge that provides a more elastic understanding of truth. A career-culminating work, this volume translates the epistemology of Hindu and Buddhist thinkers for western audiences while revitalizing western philosophical and scientific inquiry.<br>

The late nineteenth century did not make it easy to be an antirationalist as Blake was. It was not only the impact of science that began to erode the field of visionary religion but also a galaxy of philosophers and thinkers who questioned the intellectual legitimacy of the Christian faith.

  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassett Molly H.<br>
  Abstract: Following their first contact in 1519, accounts of Aztecs identifying Spaniards as gods proliferated. But what exactly did the Aztecs mean by a "god" (teotl), and how could human beings become gods or take on godlike properties? This sophisticated, interdisciplinary study analyzes three concepts that are foundational to Aztec religion—teotl (god), teixiptla (localized embodiment of a god), and tlaquimilolli (sacred bundles containing precious objects)—to shed new light on the Aztec understanding of how spiritual beings take on form and agency in the material world. In The Fate of Earthly Things, Molly Bassett draws on ethnographic fieldwork, linguistic analyses, visual culture, and ritual studies to explore what ritual practices such as human sacrifice and the manufacture of deity embodiments (including humans who became gods), material effigies, and sacred bundles meant to the Aztecs. She analyzes the Aztec belief that wearing the flayed skin of a sacrificial victim during a sacred rite could transform a priest into an embodiment of a god or goddess, as well as how figurines and sacred bundles could become localized embodiments of gods. Without arguing for unbroken continuity between the Aztecs and modern speakers of Nahuatl, Bassett also describes contemporary rituals in which indigenous Mexicans who preserve costumbres (traditions) incorporate totiotzin (gods) made from paper into their daily lives. This research allows us to understand a religious imagination that found life in death and believed that deity embodiments became animate through the ritual binding of blood, skin, and bone.<br>

How then can the literature of other ages be understood by readers from a present that is culturally so different from the past? Marxism lies at the foundation of Jameson's answer, because it conceives of history as a single collective narrative that links past and present; Marxist literary criticism reveals the unity of that uninterrupted narrative.<br>

  Abstract: The Light of Knowledgeis set primarily in the rural district of Pudukkottai in Tamil Nadu, and it is about activism among laboring women from marginalized castes who have been particularly active as learners and volunteers in the movement. In their endeavors to remake the Tamil countryside through literacy activism, workers in the movement found that their own understanding of the politics of writing and Enlightenment was often transformed as they encountered vastly different notions of language and imaginations of social order. Indeed, while activists of the movement successfully mobilized large numbers of rural women, they did so through logics that often pushed against the very Enlightenment rationality they hoped to foster. Offering a rare behind-the-scenes look at an increasingly important area of social and political activism,The Light of Knowledgebrings tools of linguistic anthropology to engage with critical social theories of the postcolonial state.<br>

Moreover, our understanding of happiness is indubitably in large part the one produced by the eighteenth century. But if these effects continue today, the reader may well wonder where the trial narrative itself is to be found. We can still detect vestigial forms of<br>

  Book Title: A Companion to the Works of Johann Gottfried Herder-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Koepke Wulf<br>
  Abstract: Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) is one of the great names of the classical age of German literature. One of the last universalists, he wrote on aesthetics, literary history and theory, historiography, anthropology, psychology, education, and theology; translated and adapted poetry from ancient Greek, English, Italian, even from Persian and Arabic; collected folk songs from around the world; and pioneered a better understanding of non-European cultures. A student of Kant's, he became Goethe's mentor in Strasbourg, and was a mastermind of the Sturm und Drang and a luminary of classical Weimar. But the wide range of Herder's interests and writings, along with his unorthodox ways of seeing things, seems to have prevented him being fully appreciated for any of them. His image has also been clouded by association with political ideologies, the proponents of which ignored the message of Humanität in his texts. So although Herder is acknowledged by scholars to be one of the great thinkers of European Enlightenment, there is no up-to-date, comprehensive introduction to his works in English, a lacuna this book fills with seventeen new, specially commissioned essays.

  Abstract: Devotion to the Trinity was growing in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries: ‘In 1334 Pope John XXII set aside the first Sunday after Pentecost as Trinity Sunday. Increasing devotion to the Trinity can also be seen in the many prayers addressed to the Trinity’.¹ Theology, however, did not necessarily keep pace. In his study of the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, Thomas Marsh has claimed: ‘In spite of the formal, notional acknowledgement of the doctrine, a real understanding of God as Trinity practically disappeared from the Christian consciousness of the Middle Ages’.² This sweeping condemnation, however, ignores the notable contribution<br>

  Book Title: Textual Cultures: Cultural Texts-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Treharne Elaine<br>
  Abstract: The dynamic fields of the history of the book and the sociology of the text are the areas this volume investigates, bringing together ten specially commissioned essays that between them demonstrate a range of critical and material approaches to medieval, early modern, and digital books and texts. They scrutinize individual medieval manuscripts to illustrate how careful re-reading of evidence permits a more nuanced apprehension of production, and reception across time; analyse metaphor for our understanding of the Byzantine book; examine the materiality of textuality from Beowulf to Pepys and the digital work in the twenty-first century; place manuscripts back into specific historical context; and re-appraise scholarly interpretation of significant periods of manuscript and print production in the later medieval and early modern periods. All of these essays call for a new assessment of the ways in which we read books and texts, making a major contribution to book history, and illustrating how detailed focus on individual cases can yield important new findings.

  Book Title: Aesthetic Vision and German Romanticism-Writing Images<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Prager Brad<br>
  Abstract: The work of the groundbreaking writers and artists of German Romanticism -- including the writers Tieck, Brentano, and Eichendorff and the artists Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge -- followed from the philosophical arguments of the German Idealists, who placed emphasis on exploring the subjective space of the imagination. The Romantic perspective was a form of engagement with Idealist discourses, especially Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and Fichte's Science of Knowledge. Through an aggressive, speculative reading of Kant, the Romantics abandoned the binary distinction between the palpable outer world and the ungraspable space of the mind's eye and were therefore compelled to develop new terms for understanding the distinction between "internal" and "external." In this light, Brad Prager urges a reassessment of some of Romanticism's major oppositional tropes, contending that binaries such as "self and other," "symbol and allegory," and "light and dark," should be understood as alternatives to Lessing's distinction between interior and exterior worlds. Prager thus crosses the boundaries between philosophy, literature, and art history to explore German Romantic writing about visual experience, examining the interplay of text and image in the formulation of Romantic epistemology.

He then adds that there is a higher reflectiveness that divides that inner world into two parts: a self and its realm, or the creator and his world. While such statements are intended to describe the inner lives of Romantic geniuses, they are also indicative of an overall understanding of the life of the mind as it was discussed among the German Romantics.

  Book Title: Cultural Performances in Medieval France-Essays in Honor of Nancy Freeman Regalado<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Burns E. Jane<br>
  Abstract: This collection of essays pays tribute to Nancy Freeman Regalado, a ground-breaking scholar in the field of medieval French literature whose research has always pushed beyond disciplinary boundaries. The articles in the volume reflect the depth and diversity of her scholarship, as well as her collaborations with literary critics, philologists, historians, art historians, musicologists, and vocalists - in France, England, and the United States. Inspired by her most recent work, these twenty-four essays are tied together by a single question, rich in ramifications: how does performance shape our understanding of medieval and pre-modern literature and culture, whether the nature of that performance is visual, linguistic, theatrical, musical, religious, didactic, socio-political, or editorial? The studies presented here invite us to look afresh at the interrelationship of audience, author, text, and artifact, to imagine new ways of conceptualizing the creation, transmission, and reception of medieval literature, music, and art.

  Abstract: An important strategy in the method of early Franciscan preachers and poets was to evoke understanding of vice and virtue through concrete and visible examples. In sermons and catechetical texts, Franciscans used stories and poetry full of lively images to describe sin and show it in action; in this way, the Friars Minor provided literary performance of the vices and virtues for the purpose of correcting the sins of lay society.¹ Indeed our understanding today of what “sinful” behavior was for medieval people is greatly enhanced by the depiction and enactment of specific vices in Franciscan literature.

  Book Title: Twenty Years On-Competing Memories of the GDR in Postunification German Culture<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Tate Dennis<br>
  Abstract: Twenty years on from the dramatic events that led to the opening of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the GDR, the subjective dimension of German unification is still far from complete. The nature of the East German state remains a matter of cultural as well as political debate. This volume of new research focuses on competing memories of the GDR and the ways they have evolved in the mass media, literature, and film since 1989-90. Taking as its point of departure the impact of iconic visual images of the fall of the Wall on our understanding of the historical GDR, the volume first considers the decade of cultural conflict that followed unification and then the emergence of a more complex and diverse "textual memory" of the GDR since the Berlin Republic was established in 1999. It highlights competing generational perspectives on the GDR era and the unexpected "afterlife" of the GDR in recent publications. The volume as a whole shows the vitality of eastern German culture two decades after the demise of the GDR and the centrality of these memory debates to the success of Germany's unification process.

  Author(s): Gross Ruth V.<br>
  Abstract: Franz Kafka's literary career began in the first decade of the twentieth century and produced some of the most fascinating and influential works in all of modern European literature. Now, a hundred years later, the concerns of a new century call for a look at the challenges facing Kafka scholarship in the decades ahead: What more can we hope to learn about the context in which Kafka wrote? How does understanding that context affect how we read his stories? What are the consequences of new critical editions that offer unprecedented access to Kafka's works in manuscript form? How does our view of Kafka change the priorities and fashions of literary scholarship? What elements in Kafka's fiction will find resonance in the historical context of a new millennium? How do we compose a coherent account of a personality with so many contradictory aspects? All these questions and more are addressed by the essays in this volume, written by a group of leading international Kafka scholars.

  Book Title: The Novels of Josefina Aldecoa-Women, Society and Cultural Memory in Contemporary Spain<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): KENNY NUALA<br>
  Abstract: Josefina Aldecoa, in her treatment of themes such as a woman's place in society under and after dictatorship, mother-daughter relationships, war, and memory, confirmed her unique role as a contemporary novelist concerned with women's identity in Spain and as a writer of the mid-century generation ('los niños de la guerra'). The first volume of her trilogy, Historia de una maestra, was one of the earliest narratives of historical memory to be produced in Spain. In this sense, Aldecoa's work anticipated new developments in gender studies, such as the intersection of feminist concerns and cultural memory. This book offers a comprehensive examination of Aldecoa's trajectory as a novelist, from La enredadera to Hermanas, centring on her primary preoccupations of gender and memory, arguing that Aldecoa's fiction offers a new, more complex understanding of women's identity than previously understood. The work combines the two dominating theoretical components of feminism and cultural memory with close textual analysis of Aldecoa's narratives. Her novels highlight the importance of the details of women's daily experiences and struggles throughout the twentieth century, a period of significant socio-political upheaval and change in Spain's history.

  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Marx Wolfgang<br>
  Abstract: Rethinking Hanslick: Music, Formalism, and Expression' is the first extensive English-language study devoted to Eduard Hanslick--a seminal figure in nineteenth-century musical life. Bringing together eminent scholars from several disciplines, this volume examines Hanslick's contribution to the aesthetics and philosophy of music and looks anew at his literary interests. The essays embrace ways of thinking about Hanslick's writings that go beyond the polarities that have long marked discussion of his work such as form/expression, absolute/program music, objectivity/subjectivity, and formalist/hermeneutic criticism. This approach takes into consideration both Hanslick's important 'On the Musically Beautiful' and his critical and autobiographical writings, demonstrating Hanslick's rich insights into the context in which a musical work is composed, performed, and received. 'Rethinking Hanslick' serves as an invaluable companion to Hanslick's prodigious scholarship and criticism, deepening our understanding of the major themes and ideas of one of the most influential music critics of the nineteenth century.

  Book Title: Love Poetry in the Spanish Golden Age-Eros, Eris and Empire<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): TORRES ISABEL<br>
  Abstract: This work engages with a broader evaluation of early modern poetics that foregrounds the processes rather than the products of thinking. The locus of the study is the Imperial 'home' space, where love poetry meets early modern empire at the inception of a very conflicted national consciousness, and where the vernacular language, Castilian, emerges in the encounter as a strategic site of national and imperial identity. The political is, therefore, a pervasive presence, teased out where relevant in recognition of the poet's sensitivity to the ideologies within which writing comes into being. But the primary commitment of the book is to lyric poetry, and to poets, individually and in their dynamic interconnectedness. Moving beyond a re-evaluation of critical responses to four major poets of the period (Garcilaso de la Vega, Herrera, Góngora and Quevedo), this study disengages respectfully with the substantial body of biographical research that continues to impact upon our understanding of the genre, and renegotiates the Foucauldian concept of the 'epistemic break', often associated with the anti-mimetic impulses of the Baroque. This more flexible model accommodates the multiperspectivism that interrogated Imperial ideology even in the earliest sixteenth-century poetry, and allows for the exploration of new horizons in interpretation.

Our contemporary understanding of linear history, as an accumulation of personal and communal experience, is, of course, more complex and, indeed, less ‘linear’ than the Aristotelian concept of the numerical estimation of movement.

  Book Title: Expressing Identities in the Basque Arena-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Allen N.J.<br>
  Abstract: Everyday nationalism, the human and cultural aspects of identity, is a neglected subject in the literature on nationalism in Europe. Jeremy MacClancy redresses the balance in this unusual and sharp book on the human and cultural aspects of the idea of being Basque in the modern world. The style is fresh and colloquial, dealing with several of the kinds of issues that usually appear in popular magazines - cuisine, football, art and graffiti - but the treatment is serious and illustrative of underlying currents in social life. MacClancy argues that the ethnographic understanding of nationalisms, rather than the orthodox studies of ideology, political parties, social classes and centre-periphery clashes - offers a more nuanced comprehension of the lived reality of people in areas where nationalism is a significant force. This is very much nationalism from the bottom up. JEREMY MACCLANCY is Professor of Social Anthropology at Oxford Brookes University. Series editors: Wendy James & Nick Allen<br>

  Abstract: The first point should have been repeatedly demonstrated to all those who have read the text, rather than skipped straight to this endnote, i.e. that we impoverish our understanding of nationalism if we are not prepared to study its lived reality. If one definition of anthropology is to take people seriously, then it behoves us to listen to what locals are saying and to attend to what they are doing.

  Abstract: Berg’s fascination with Wagner,
                  Tristanin particular, complicates our understanding of his music because it underlies not only his creative identity and actions but also some principles behind his musical compositions. In his writings, Adorno often tries to draw a distinction between Berg and Wagner, but his explanations, while illuminating, only contribute to the problem. In his reevaluation of Berg, written about twenty years after Berg’s death, Adorno recognizes the “autonomy” of Berg’s works but points to a peculiar sort of metaphysics in which Berg’s music would emerge from underneath the music drama. In other words, Adorno draws a distinction<br>

  Book Title: Spanish Golden Age Poetry in Motion-The Dynamics of Creation and Conversation<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): TORRES ISABEL<br>
  Abstract: The fourteen essays of this volume engage in distinct ways with the matter of motion in early modern Spanish poetics, without limiting the dialectic of stasis and movement to any single sphere or manifestation. Interrogation of the interdependence of tradition and innovation, poetry, power and politics, shifting signifiers, the intersection of topography and deviant temporalities, the movement between the secular and the sacred, tensions between centres and peripheries, issues of manuscript circulation and reception, poetic calls and echoes across continents and centuries, and between creative writing and reading subjects, all demonstrate that Helgerson's central notion of conspicuous movement is relevant beyond early sixteenth-century secular poetics, By opening it up we approximate a better understanding of poetry's flexible spatio-temporal co-ordinates in a period of extraordinary historical circumstances and conterminous radical cultural transformation. Los catorce ensayos de este volumen conectan de una manera perceptible con el tema del movimiento en la poesía española del siglo de oro, sin limitar la dialéctica de la estasis y movimiento a una sola esfera o manifestación única. Entre los multiples enfoques cabe destacar: el cuestionamiento de la interdependencia de la tradición e inovación, de la poesía, del poder y la política, de los significantes que se transforman, de los espacios que conectan y cruzan con los tiempos 'desviados'; análisis de las tensiones entre lo sagrado y lo secular, del conflicto centro-periferia y del complejo sistema de producción, circulación y recepción de los manuscritos; el diálogo con el eco poético a través de los siglos y de los continentes y la construcción creativa del sujeto escritor y/o lector. Al abrir la noción central de Helgerson del "movimiento conspicuo" más allá de la poesía nueva secular, este libro propone un entendimiento más completo de las coordinadas espacio-temporales de la poesía en un periodo de circunstan~<br>

An inquiry into what constitutes subjectivity seems even more necessary since Schmidt alludes to the androgynous character of our being. Schmidt’s stress on the unconscious as the prime determinant of our conscious mode of processing information unveils the central role the unconscious assumes in any reflection on subjectivity.

  Book Title: Spanish American Poetry after 1950-Beyond the Vanguard<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): SHAW DONALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a basis for understanding the main lines of development of poetry in Spanish America after Vanguardism, this volume begins with an overview of the situation at the mid-century: the later work of Neruda and Borges, the emergence of Paz. Consideration is then given to the decisive impact of Parra and the rise of colloquial poetry, politico-social poetry (Dalton, Cardenal) and representative figures such as Orozco, Pacheco and Cisneros. The aim is to establish a few paths through the largely unmapped jungle of Spanish American poetry in the time period. The author emphasises the persistence of a generally negative view of the human condition and the poets' exploration of different ways of responding to it. These vary from outright scepticism to the ideological, the religious or those derived from some degree of confidence in the creative imagination as cognitive. At the same time there is analysis of the evolving outlook on poetry of the writers in question, both in regard to its possible social role and in regard to diction. DONALD SHAW holds the Brown Forman Chair of Spanish American literature in the University of Virginia.<br>

  Abstract: The ‘Goethe Yearbook’ is a publication of the Goethe Society of North America, encouraging North American Goethe scholarship by publishing original English-language contributions to the understanding of Goethe and other authors of the ‘Goethezeit’ while also welcoming contributions from scholars around the world. Volume 19 of the ‘Goethe Yearbook’ continues to investigate the connection between Goethe's scientific theories and his aesthetics, with essays on his optics and his plant morphology. A special section examines the central role that Goethe philology has had in establishing practices that shaped the history of ‘Germanistik’ as a whole. The yearbook also includes essays on legal history and the novella, Goethe ‘Lieder’, esoteric mysticism in ‘Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre’, and Werther's sexual pathology. The volume also includes three essays re-examining Goethe's aesthetics in the context of the history of deconstruction, as well as the customary book review section.

  Book Title: Museums and Biographies-Stories, Objects, Identities<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Hill Kate<br>
  Abstract: Museums and biographies both tell the stories of lives. This innovative collection examines for the first time biography - of individuals, objects and institutions - in relationship to the museum, casting new light on the many facets of museum history and theory, from the lives of prominent curators, to the context of museums of biography and autobiography. Separate sections cover individual biography and museum history, problematising individual biographies, institutional biographies, object biographies, and museums as biographies/autobiographies. These articles offer new ways of thinking about museums and museum history, exploring how biography in and of the museum enriches museum stories by stressing the inter-related nature of lives of people, objects and institutions as part of a dense web of relationships. Through their widely ranging research, the contributors demonstrate the value of thinking about the stories told in and by museums, and the relationships which make up museums; and suggest new ways of undertaking and understanding museum biographies.

  Abstract: David Treuer translates this Wenabozho story by Rose Foss, an elder from the Mille Lacs reservation, to demonstrate a disconnect between Ojibwe oral tradition and the postmodern sensibilities of Louise Erdrich’s novel 
                     Love Medicine (Treuer 2005, 31–32). For Treuer, this Wenabozho story moreover allegorizes the quest for “authentic Indigenous culture” that so often impels readers, critics, and even authors in the field of Indigenous literature. Smartberries—discrete, displaced packets of cultural knowledge—are but signs of the literature’s desire for a holistic, tribally specific cultural understanding, and should not be mistaken for an end in themselves.<br>

Events are created and interpreted to confirm the situational meanings provided by the definition of the situation. People create events to establish identities, to maintain identities, and to restore damaged identities.

  Abstract: The twentieth century has left behind a painful and complicated legacy of massive trauma, monstrous crimes, radical social engineering, or collective/individual guilt syndromes that were often the premises for and the specters haunting the process of democratization in the various societies that emerged out of these profoundly de-structuring contexts. The present manuscript is a state of the art reassessment and analysis of how the interplay between memory, history, and justice generates insight that is multifariously relevant for comprehending the present and future of democracy without becoming limited to a Europe-centric framework of understanding. The manuscript is structured on three complementary and interconnected trajectories: the public use of history, politics of memory, and transitional justice. Key words 1.

  Book Title: What Holds Europe Together?-  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Michalski Krzysztof<br>
  Abstract: The book addresses contemporary developments in European identity politics as part of a larger historical trajectory of a common European identity based on the idea of 'solidarity.' The authors explain the special sense in which Europeans perceive their obligations to their less fortunate compatriots, to the new East European members, and to the world at large. An understanding of this notion of 'solidarity' is critical to understanding the specific European commitment to social justice and equality. The specificity of this term helps to distinguish between what the Germans call "social state" from the Anglo-Saxon, and particularly American, political and social system focused on capitalism and economic liberalism. This collection is the result of the work of an extremely distinguished group of scholars and politicians, invited by the previous President of the European Union, Romano Prodi, to reflect on some of the most important subjects affecting the future of Europe.<br>

As Balázs Trencsényi argues, “historians of political thought try to renegotiate the relationship between history, literary studies and the social sciences, pointing out that the understanding of a political interaction might necessitate the use of a variety of different interpretative techniques and approaches.”¹ Yet interdisciplinarity is not only a technical issue.

  Abstract: The artistic tradition that emerged as a form of cultural resistance in the 1970s changed during the transition from socialism to capitalism. This volume presents the evolution of the Moscow-based conceptual artist group called Collective Actions, proposing it as a case-study for understanding the transformations that took place in Eastern European art after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Esanu introduces Moscow Conceptualism by performing a close examination of the Collective Actions group’s ten-volume publication Journeys Outside the City and of the Dictionary of Moscow Conceptualism. He analyzes above all the evolution of Collective Actions through ten consecutive phases, discussing changes that occur in each new volume of the Journeys. Compares the part of the Journeys produced in the Soviet period with those volumes assembled after the dissolution of the USSR. The concept of “transition” and the activities of Soros Centers for Contemporary Art are also analyzed.<br>

The other is to show how Mill saw freedom as both threatened by and supported by various forms of social power. Mill is criticized as an “essentialist” (p. 39) for insisting that truly free persons must be taught a wide variety of practices and traditions from which to choose. Nonetheless, the author argues that Mill has a richer understanding of the value of “positive freedom” than do Berlin, Nozick, and Rawls.<br>

Abstract: The constructionist Foucauldian orientation poses a challenge opposite to that of the philosophical. Philosophers’ narratives focus on the concept of self or on discourses from which the concept can supposedly be inferred. Historians, in contrast, tend to overlook the concept, as if its history qua concept played no role in instituting the regimes of the self. Although I do not assume an underlying perennial self, what I have done here is obviously closer to the history of ideas than to genealogy. Nevertheless, I want to suggest that concepts have their own efficacy and should be incorporated into genealogy as active agents. In the same way that, say, child‐rearing techniques are not
         aboutthe self nor applied to it as a preexisting object, debates about the resurrection of the body were notaboutidentity, nor were the issues discussed in connection with them contemplated as puzzle cases in the philosophy of mind. Rather, they were among the materials with which notions of identity were elaborated and through which, historically, such notions came into existence. This became apparent in the wake of Locke’sEssay Concerning Human Understanding,when the resurrection of the body was explicitly linked to personal identity. The “modern” regimes of self, and the corresponding ways of experiencing oneself, were thus connected to the development of new concepts of the self. The redefinition of the resurrected identity belonged in the construction of new models of being based less on the hierarchical subordination of the body to the soul than on a generative subordination of selfhood to the brain and to an objectified self‐consciousness. The glorious body was no longer necessary as ideal for the discipline of terrestrial bodies.134The story sketched here thus suggests the need for bringing the history of ideas and the genealogy of subjectification together into an approach that will ultimately do for personal identity what historical epistemology is doing for the histo~<br>

Abstract: In these ways, the “group style” concept extends neoinstitutionalists’ insights. A study of “culture in interaction” ties interactional routines to large‐scale, enduring patterns of “culture” in groups. And it shows how those patterns work with widespread, collective representations. Some analysts of large‐scale cultural codes have argued that the neoinstitutionalist approach is a competing approach to culture, one that neglects the richness of symbolic meaning (Kane
         1997). We argue, instead, that analyzing a group’s routines actually enhances our understanding of symbolic codes and meanings they produce in everyday life.<br>

Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Juillerat has an extended view of the Oedipus complex, one that includes the tales/complexes of Laius and Jocasta. His understanding of the complex incorporates at least two not altogether compatible approaches. On the one hand, following Paul Ricoeur, the complex is a
      seuilor threshold, a structured moment that opens up a set of possibilities. Methodologically one decomposes the range of possibilities that are given expression in the cultural products of the unconscious (p. 72)myths, rituals, and dreamsin order to discover the minimal structure from which they can be derived. That which is universal is not such and such a particular form of the Oedipus [complex], but rather that which is common in all the possible figures of the Oedipus combinatory, the varied cultural expressions of which must be able to be reduced to a model that contains them all (p. 69). Like all quest arguments, Juillerats is circular: that for which he searches is predetermined by the object of his questthe Oedipus complexand by the range and definition of material that quest presupposes. What is more interesting, as Juillerat acknowledges at times, is the transformational capacity of the minimal structurethe thresholdas it is given varied cultural expression.<br>

Abstract: Despite this, metaphysics has indeed replied (whether it should be allowed to or not) to the question concerning man’s definition of himself. And we know well that the Cartesian
         cogitohas no other importance than to assure theegoits comprehension of itself and thus to impose itself as the first principle of every other science. Nevertheless, it would be more fitting to doubt this vulgate of Cartesianism, because the texts of Descartes so often contradict it. Contradiction occurs first of all because theego’s very performance of its existence unfolds within a space that is, from the outset, dialogical (with theDeus qui potest omnia, with thegenius aliquis malignius).43Next, contradiction occurs because theegoof thecogitorecognizes that its finite thought culminates in a faculty of will that is paradoxically infinite, “ratione cujus imaginem quandam et similitudinem Dei me refere intelligo” (“in virtue of [which] … I understand myself to bear in some way the image and likeness of God”); and above all the common understanding of the comprehensibility of theegois contradicted because theegoidentifies its faculty of thinking of itself with the image and likeness of God within it, to the point that the faculty of self‐knowing is simply one with the faculty of knowing God: “ex hoc uno quod Deus me creavit, valde credibile est me quodammodo ad imaginem et similitudinem ejus factum esse, illamque similitudinem, in qua Dei idea continetur, a me precipi per eandem facultatem, per quam ego ipse a me percipior” (“but the mere fact that God created me is a very strong basis for believing that I am somehow made in his image and likeness and that I perceive that likeness, which includes the idea of God, by the same faculty which enables me to perceive myself”).44Let us consider this extraordinary text: founding the thinking of self upon my thinking of God, to the point of merging them within the space opened by the image of and likeness to God.

Abstract: Braudel addressed the critics directly in
            The Mediterranean,2d ed. (1972), 2:1243–44: “The question is frequently put to me, both by historians and philosophers, if we view history from such a distance, what becomes of man, his role in history, his freedom of action?” A classic example is embodied in Braudel’s portrait of Philip II himself. “What degree of freedom was possessed by Philip II, or by Don Juan of Austria as he rode at anchor among his ships, allies, and troops? Each of these so‐called freedoms seems to me to resemble a tiny island, almost a prison.” See the conclusion of Part III, 2:1236 that recounts the death of Philip II on September 13, 1598, based on three secondary sources of the 1920s, not from contemporary accounts of Philip’s “good death.” Braudel’s last poignant paragraph suggests that Philip did not know what he was doing: “[Philip] was not a man of vision: he saw his task as an unending succession of small details. Every one of his annotations is a small precise point, whether an order, a remark, or the correction of a spelling mistake or geographical error. Never do we find general notions or grand strategies under his pen.” The king’s “grand strategy,” however, is exactly what Geoffrey Parker set out to demonstrate inThe Grand Strategy of Philip II(New Haven, Conn., 1998). Braudel may be correct that Philip, as a prince, was not a student of geography. But what Philip did study, architecture, emphasized design. No discipline was more useful to understanding “general notions or grand strategies.” Thus, Braudel’s Part III, as traditional as it is often said to be, appears to get the story and the king wrong because Braudel’s steering assumption, not Philip II, was in control: “Good reasons for us to reflect once more on the distance separating biographical history from the history of structures, and even more from the history of geographical areas” (2:1237).

Abstract: Lewis Coser’s concept of “non‐realistic” conflict (
            The Functions of Social Conflict[Glencoe, IL: Free Press, 1956], 48–55 and passim) is helpful for understanding this notion of the priority of the need to affirm communal identity over objective conflicts. In contrast to “realistic” struggles motivated by actual conflicts of interest, nonrealistic conflicts derive from an underlying need to maintain the cohesion of a social group. The actual matter of contention is more or less accidental in a situation of nonrealistic conflict. Coser, following Georg Simmel, notes that nonrealistic conflict is more apt to occur with respect to groups in which members participate with their entire personalities (58, 67ff.). Religious communities would represent the paradigmatic form of this type of social group. Of course, actual religious conflicts would involve both realistic and nonrealistic elements.<br>

Abstract: Scholars and their students interested in the field would do well to begin with these studies, despite some unevenness in period, place, and theme. Developments in the twentieth century, for example, are not well served, especially as their globalization bursts all traditional boundaries in the discipline, making a historical perspective essential to an understanding of ongoing transformations in literate life everywhere, not just in the West. Similarly, the absence of illustrations undermines the potential value of these books as introductions to the history of reading. Much of the work here depends on the material objects that readers actually had; without images of them, the reader develops less of a sense of the field. Finally, the exclusion of the essays on correspondence from the original collection is deeply regrettable; Chartier’s summary of their implications in the introduction hardly does justice to them, especially to the important study of the 1847 postal survey by Dauphin and two other colleagues. The translations are generally accurate, but the indexes are barely adequate.<br>

Author(s): Robbins,  Jeffrey W.<br>
Abstract: After this historical, critical section, Robbins develops a more constructive approach toward a philosophical theology that capitalizes on the ontotheological condition. He claims as his models Paul Ricoeur and, ultimately, Jean‐Luc Marion and Emmanuel Lévinas. Understanding Ricoeur’s hermeneutics “according to the model of religious orthodoxy in which faith and practice translate into knowledge” (p. 123), Robbins praises Ricoeur for offering a model of philosophical theology but criticizes this model because, like all orthodoxy, the philosophy remains uncritical of its foundations—that is, of the religion to which it gives conceptual formulation. Another model of philosophical theology is provided by Marion and Lévinas. In Marion, Robbins asserts, phenomenology and theology each pass into the other in such a way that there is not a confusion or reduction but a mutual criticism and modification of each by the other (p. 113). Marion’s supposed embrace of the ontotheological dialogue between philosophy and theology is foreshadowed, according to Robbins, in Lévinas, who first modeled “an alternative strategy for contemporary philosophical and theological thought … a strategy that is
      otherwise than overcoming” (p. 132).<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Bourgeois contends that there are two ways of getting the relation between the enterprise of critique and its grounding in reason wrong. Neither understands the distinction between limit and boundary adequately, and, consequently, both produce untenable philosophical positions, in Bourgeois’s view. The first way, exemplified by Heidegger, attempts to derive the limit from below in finite human subjectivity (or Dasein). Heidegger, fatefully neglecting the essential idea of boundary according to Bourgeois, argues, in
      Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics(1929), that the origin of Kant’s two sources of cognition, sensibility and the understanding, resides in the creative intuition of the productive imagination. Going beyond Kant, Heidegger locates the genesis of the pure concepts or categories of the understanding in the imagination. In fact, in Heidegger’s account, the transcendental imagination becomes nothing other than the primordial time of Dasein. Reason does not set the limits of knowledge. Rather, imagination, or Dasein, limits itself through the existential projection of the meaning of Being as determined by Dasein’s own structure of finite temporality.<br>

Abstract: We saw above how configuration is the work of the productive imagination [
         14]. This imagination is not only rule governed; Ricoeur argues that it “constitutes the generative matrix of rules” [14, p. 68]. The imagination synthesizes in a narrative way that connects understanding and intuition such that it is possible to speak of “a schematism of the narrative function” [14, p. 68]. This schematism in turn is constituted within a tradition, where tradition is understood as an interplay of innovation and sedimentation; that is, there is a history of interpretation in conflict with “interpretation now” [38]. Beyond this, Ricoeur argues that tradition in turn is referenced to paradigms encompassing form, genre, and type and that paradigms constitute the “grammar that governs composition of new works” [14, p. 69]. This narrative tradition enriches the labor of imagination in the operation of configuration. A library, when defined as a synthesis of narratives, both embodies and signifies acts of imagination. Such acts can operate at different levels; for example, they are inherent to the levels of the hierarchy of activity we see above. They are inherent in personal acts and in cultural acts. The library is an enabler of new meanings and active participant in the creation of “worlds in front of the text.” Given the above, new work could take these ideas much further in LIS and well beyond the framework that is currently offered [3].<br>

Author(s): Johar Schueller Malini<br>
Abstract: I point to the similarities between Haraway’s cyborg theory and theories of several other poststructuralists in order to suggest that there is nothing inherently subversive for feminism about such theorizing unless the theory can be shown to have specific, material, and located ramifications (a fact Haraway seems to have partially recognized in
         Modest_Witness[1997a], which I will briefly discuss at the end of this essay). Indeed, as Susan Bordo suggests, the epistemologicaljouissancesuggested by the image of the cyborg denies locatedness and fantasizes itself as a postmodern “dream of everywhere” (1990, 136, 144–45).10Here it is important to distinguish betweenlocatednessand a simple celebration of thelocalas endless possibility. I am not advocating what Manuel Castells (1997) describes as a defensive and retrenched localism (manifested most disturbingly in the “not in my backyard” ideal) in the face of globalization as a basis for feminist identity but rather a relationship to materiality and sociopolitical specificity as a basis for theorizing, much in the manner of Castells’s own analyses (1997, 61–62). In arguing for a relationship to locatedness, I am taking a stance about critical responsibility in a postcolonial world. As third‐world environmentalists such as Vandana Shiva (1997) and subaltern studies historians have demonstrated, policies and political concepts of postcolonial nations cannot be understood through universal (read: Western) concepts alone, even though local concepts need to be related to the global. Witness Shiva’s call for international legal ecological policies based on an understanding of indigenous knowledges and Partha Chatterjee’s (1986) critique of the Western idea of nation as inapplicable to postcolonial countries. In the United States, critical race theorists have argued for what legal theorist Richard Delgado (1995) terms thecall to context, which challenges the traditional juridical preference for universalism over particu~<br>

Abstract: See Hans‐Georg Gadamer,
            Truth and Method, trans. Joel Weinsheimer and Donald G. Marshall, 2nd ed. and 2nd rev. ed. (New York: Crossroad, 1989; Continuum, 1998); Emmanuel Levinas,Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority, trans. Alphonso Lingis (Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1969), 33–52. Levinas argues that dialogue is founded upon the asymmetrical relationship between the self and the infinite Other (“Dialogue … is a thinking of theunequal, a thought thinkingbeyondthe given” [Emmanuel Levinas,God Who Comes to Mind, trans. Bettina Bergo (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998), 151]) and in that sense not a method of uncovering truth but a call to (self‐) transcendence, i.e., to ethics (ibid., 143–51). Levinas’s purely asymmetrical ethical understanding of the self‐other relation, in which the practice of dialogue is reduced to the infinite Other’s “breaking in” and rupturing of the totalizing horizon of my world, is meant as a critique of Hegel’s more symmetrical, interdependent, and holistic understanding of the self‐other relation in terms of mutual recognition. But this criticism is predicated on what in my view is an unconvincing identification of holism, which is an internally differentiated harmony, with totality, which is devoid of internal differentiation whatsoever. I follow Paul Ricoeur’s more Hegelian, dialectical understanding of the self‐other relation (that is at the same time informed by the Levinasian critique), in which the horizon of my world is driven by its own logic to a universalizability test via the sieve of the other’s scrutiny and is transformed in the process.

Abstract: We have seen that the shroud is the Word’s “symbol” and the relics are its “agents.” We glean a clearer understanding of this rhetorical and linguistic connection if we read it in the light of Renaissance notions of emblematic expression. In an earlier section of this essay, I explained Tesauro’s innovative theories. I pointed out that Tesauro believes in the existence of visual hybrids, some sorts of emblematic
      imprese, at once “heroic” and personal messages expressed through general visual statements. Contradicting a tenet of the Renaissance concept of emblem, in theTelescopeTesauro contends that “the [impresa] is a miraculous composition whose soul is outside of the body.”121For Tesauro, the “miracle” of animpresalies in the fact that its message turns into a personal, nonvisible insight. The “soul” of the shroud‐impresais the marvel brought about in the “mirror” of our intellect.<br>

Abstract: According to James Lowenthal, “sacralizing some chosen time in the past … impedes historical understanding” (2000, 67) because the sacred defies explanation. For religious fundamentalists, all time—past, present, and future—is sacralized, as God’s plan constitutes the meta‐narrative of all history. Thus, history becomes imbued with inevitability, the richness of historical dilemmas is flattened out, the potential appreciation for multiple causalities is quashed, and all of history leads to a renewed avowal of faith or the condemnation for lack thereof. Moreover, the tantalizing sense of strangeness that all deep historical inquiry ought to engender (Wineburg
         2001) becomes an impossibility, for in a world where all events are simultaneously foretold and foretelling, “astonishment” as a “delight of learning history” (Lowenthal2000) is unlikely at best. Astonishment, after all, remains the domain of unbelievers.<br>

Abstract: Such an evaluation clearly fits into an interpretive framework emphasizing primarily the modernizing aspects of the Communist episode. There have been many contending approaches trying to fit communism/socialism as a historical phenomenon into a broader theoretical perspective: communism as totalitarianism, as state capitalism, as hypermodernity, as a specific version of paternalism, as the economy of shortage, as elitist political voluntarism, etc. If I obviously privilege the modernization paradigm, it is because for me it gives the most convincing overall framework. This, however, does not mean that it has to be applied in an unimaginative rational‐choice model to the exclusion of a host of other explanations, complicating and enriching our understanding, especially with anthropological and psychological insights.<br>

Abstract: Through various techniques of careful observation, the human sciences stand in a unique position, methodologically, to dig beneath assumptions and stereotypes and explain what makes American child poverty so problematic. This is the case in at least three important respects. First, they can explain how poverty plays into children’s underlying developmental vulnerabilities. For example, the younger a child is, the fewer basic capabilities he or she is likely to possess for such things as securing social capital, supporting parents leaving home to work, resisting mass media exploitation to sell toys, or making heard his or her plight. Second, the human sciences can describe the unique conditions that contribute toward poverty in contemporary families. For example, families in the United States bear significant burdens for children’s health and economic well‐being, so that high rates of family and marital disruption represent a major cause of children’s economic hardship. And third, the human sciences can map the multiple and diverse ways in which children’s poverty is related to larger social structures. These include inequalities in the job market, impacts of mass media, and access to political power. The human sciences are particularly well suited to understanding such experiences from the point of view of children because empirical methods can test and disrupt the ordinary assumptions by which adults so easily oversimplify children’s lives. Somewhat as in environmental ethics, the theological ethics of childhood relies deeply on empirical observation for fully understanding the complexities of its subject.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Abstract: In this case, the moral imitation of Creation must inevitably remain both hopeful and problematic. At the center of moral creativity lies the ambiguity of human social tension. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote from his jail cell in Birmingham, Alabama: “I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ‘tension.’ I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a kind of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. … [We need] to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.”
         36Moral intentionality does not find peace and rest—its desired ethical Sabbath—by fixed values and orders alone, however necessary these may be for limiting violence and oppression, but by embracing as far as possible human tension in its possibility for narrating ever more inclusive moral worlds. The negative prohibitions that “separate” or “part” violent persons and groups should ultimately serve the positive possibility for the “participation” of all in creating community between rather than in spite of human difference.<br>

Abstract: To my modest knowledge, this rapprochement of economics and virtue ethics is quite novel. Ricoeur makes an important opening in this direction. As is characteristic of this chapter, the endeavor is to unearth an “anthropological base” at the foundation of the capabilities approach: “What is important is our having discovered reinforcement for a concept of human action as rooted in a fundamental anthropology” (146). But, as I have said earlier, I believe this anthropology is faulty if it insists on understanding action in a precommunicative way.<br>

Abstract: A recent article by Martin Frické, Kay Mathiesen, and Don Fallis [
         22] reviews some examinations of the LBR that argue that it is ambiguous and political and emphasizes censorship while underemphasizing intellectual property rights and patron privacy. They then contend that, given a philosophical foundation of fallibilism (no knowledge is absolutely certain, and there is the possibility of correction), some of the tenets of the LBR are problematic. They point in particular to Articles II, III, and V. The third article, for example, prohibits censorship; the authors raise the question of what should be done when one right (the right to free expression) conflicts with another right (say, to privacy). Their questioning is reflected in the first scenario presented above. At that point of conflict, a decision must be made, and the LBR does not address such conflict directly. Some interpretations of the LBR do address privacy rights but from the standpoint of access to information and patron records rather than from the standpoint of the content of the information carriers. Frické and his colleagues urge that social‐contract theory be the basis for considering intellectual freedom within the context of the LBR. Building upon Rawls’s conception of rights, they argue that, while some individuals have an idea of the good, “it may be that not all conceptions of the good should be accommodated, by means of the principle chosen for distributing information in society. If we contemplated from behind the veil of ignorance the possibility that we might be placed in society as child pornographers, perhaps we would desire society to supply the means for sympathetic understanding and medical help, rather than public libraries full of child pornography” [22, p. 482].<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: While acknowledging the genre’s limitations, Popkin also insists that the best achieve literary excellence by dramatizing the humdrum rhythms of academic research into meaningful stories—about physical and emotional experiences in the archives, for instance, or the links between historical research and larger issues. Such autobiography thus enriches the understanding of both the human condition and the past. Popkin argues in an excellent chapter that historians’ memoirs of the Holocaust are both transformative texts, through which authors question their “earlier senses of self” (224), and sources of original historical understanding. By defining themselves as scholars rather than as Jews alone, their authors suggest that all survivors did not come out of the war with strengthened Jewish identities. Whether one agrees or not that autobiographies alone could have yielded such insights, the chapter’s broader claim—that the genre illuminates dimensions that conventional scholarship may have missed—is tenable. But one wonders what exactly Popkin is driving at. Should historians simply grant the genre more respect? Engage in it? Use it less fearfully as a source?<br>

Abstract: Moreover, Derrida does not seem to have been familiar with the basic tenets of Patočka’s later phenomenology, in particular his reinterpretation of the Husserlian conception of the lifeworld. According to Patočka, the natural world is constituted by three movements that are fundamental for understanding his reference to the exceptional (the orgiastic, demonic, or sacred), the inauthenticity of everydayness, and, above all, the motif of the care of the soul. Nonetheless, Derrida’s reading of the essay in question is a very fine account of Patočka’s thought.<br>

Abstract: If, for Halbwachs, history delegitimizes the “lived
         (vécu)past,” it is possible to observe a similar impulse occurring elsewhere, namely, Japan, where Yanagita Kunio produced a history(Meiji Taishoshi: Sesohen)on the model of an immense tableau comprised of past and present customs mingling together in 1920s Tokyo and actually envisaged history’s vocation as recording the cohabitation of different customs reflecting mixed temporalities in the present. In Peru at around the same time, Jose Carlos Mariátegui was reflecting on the intersection of historical times coexisting in conflict within a developmental framework and with the figure of unevenness that clearly signified the noncontemporaneity of the contemporaneous.32And in our time this fixation on the historical present as the punctual point of mixed temporalities has appeared more frequently, throughout the world, as evidenced by Chinua Achebe’s novelization of the conflict produced by clashing times in eastern Nigeria(The Arrow of God)—the visualization of temporal islands where contacts and collisions have taken place and have launched the production and spread of culturalmétissage—and even Achille Mbembe’s formulation of the entanglements of time employed to explain the postcolony. In fact, there are innumerable examples of the noncontemporaneous contemporary that can be recruited from the domains of literature, cinema, and, obviously, sociology, an immense literature analyzing the conflicts of tradition and modernity that, especially in the great cities of the world, take place between immigrant parents and their children, among the claims and practices of diasporic peoples in the heart of modern metropolitan life, and within virtual pockets of a transplanted Third World. Also, movements like the Zapatistas in Chiapas have managed to balance the cyclical time of the indigenous community with a political project of liberation inscribed in a Marxian narrative of modernity (though free of progressivist~<br>

Abstract: Professional self‐awareness is widely considered a necessary condition for competent social work practice. Alternate prescriptions for self‐awareness rely implicitly on varying definitions of what it means to be a “self” and what it means to be “aware.” I will review three approaches to professional self‐awareness conventionally adopted in the literature: (
         a) simple conscious awareness (awareness of whatever is being experienced), (b) reflective awareness (awareness of a self who is experiencing something), and (c) reflexive awareness (the self's awareness of how his or her awareness is constituted in direct experience). Strengths and limitations of these three epistemological approaches are discussed. An alternate framework, based on Anthony Giddens's “structuration theory,” is developed and advanced as a more macro‐level and less exclusively psychological understanding of practitioner self‐awareness. The article concludes with illustrations from practice.<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: After the JST describes the evolution of a godly order and rebellious antiorder among Adam and Eve’s immediate progeny, the generations of the patriarchs are listed consistent with the KJV. While the KJV was able to tell Enoch’s story in thirteen words—“And Enoch walked with God, and he was not; for God took him”—the
         JSTrequired 4,600.80Smith’s Enoch is the most representative of Mormonism’s understanding of the divine‐human relationship and its rejection of contemporary Christian anthropology. For the sake of brevity, two themes must suffice to make this point. First, in the JST, Enoch “built a city that was called the city of Holiness, even Zion.”81The people were also called Zion “because they were of one heart and of one mind and dwelt in righteousness and there were no poor among them.” In short, the story of Enoch tells of a community that experienced the end of evil. This is made clear in their overcoming the separation from God occasioned by the fall: “Enoch and all his people walked with God, and he dwelt in the midst of Zion.” They triumphed over their enemies because Enoch “spake in the word of the Lord,” and, when he did, humans and nature “were turned out of their course.” Ultimately, not only Enoch, as implied in the KJV, but also his city were taken up to heaven without experiencing death.82Second, and most significant for the argument of this article, Smith’s narrative depicts an extended theophany in which Enoch is portrayed as obtaining guarantees of redemption from God in virtue of Enoch’s God‐given right to access heavenly power and exercise it in temporal affairs. This is the final example of the way in which Smith’s mythos “recalibrates” categories of thought and privilege inherent in the status quo of Christian theologizing on the divine human relationship.83<br>

Abstract: A reading of the

The first of these is the illusory nature of the phenomenal world, a presupposition of the alleged quietism and ethical indifference of the Brahmin sage.112The second is the understanding of brahman as an inert and pallid abstraction, an “abstract unity without determination,” as Hegel puts it.113<br>

Abstract: Whoever has followed Browning’s publications over the last three decades will easily recognize the impressive continuity of his interest in the relationship between practical theology and ethics. As he points out himself (193), the present book elaborates what Browning refers to as the different “levels or dimensions of the human” implied in the conversation between theology and psychology (193). At the same time, the book is much more than a mere sequel to Browning’s earlier statements. It is a major step toward a “practical theological ethics” (85) that brings together theology, philosophical ethics, and the varieties of moral psychology. It takes up the most recent challenges of evolutionary psychology. Finally, it makes a major step toward a theological understanding of premoral goods—a topic that Browning rightly considers of key importance for the public role of theology.<br>

Abstract: How, then, are we to get out of the impasse and return a sense of vision to re‐vision? If rewriting is indeed change (see Moraru
         2001, 144), is change a positive value in itself? In his discussion of what he terms “radical typology,” Laurence Coupe emphasizes what he sees as myth’s “permanent possibility,” its “dynamic tension between the already and the not yet” (Coupe1997, 106). As Coupe argues, “all myths presuppose a previous narrative, and in turn form the model for future narratives” (108). In consequence, it is not toward demythologization (which is, after all, oriented toward the past and works, as Coupe points out, “in terms of closure” [108]) but toward remythologization that rewriting as re‐vision ought to aspire: to work toward disclosure, opening narratives to ever new re‐visions, and thus to “evade the stasis of doctrine” (110). “Permanent possibility,” “narrative dynamism”—Coupe’s terms echo distinctly with Bauman’s liquidity and should therefore be regarded with similar suspicion. More crucially, Coupe’s understanding of myth (derived from Paul Ricoeur) relies on a sense of utopia that is external to the rewriting it informs. As he explains, myth “is synonymous with a ‘social imagination’ which functions by virtue of a dialectic between ‘ideology’ and ‘utopia.’ … Without [ideology], we would have no sense of society or tradition; without [utopia], we would simply equate the given society and tradition with eternal truth” (1997, 96). The question remains: in the absence of utopia, what role for re‐vision?<br>

Author(s): Scimeca Ross<br>
Abstract: The suspension of truth becomes a methodology for the practice of librarianship, not only in collection development, preservation, and provision of access to information but also in reference services. With the historicist perspective that propositions are affirmed or denied within a spatial‐temporal continuum, librarians working in reference and information services can better understand what underlies knowledge and how that knowledge is transmitted. For example, a patron has just read Dan Brown’s
         The Da Vinci Code[68] and expresses an interest in understanding where the ideas about Jesus and Mary Magdalene as presented in this work of fiction originated. Besides showing the patronHoly Blood, Holy Grailby Michael Baigent and Henry Lincoln [72], the reference librarian can direct the patron to information about the Gnostic tradition in early Christianity through primary and selected scholarly secondary sources. The patron would then learn from these other materials how Gnosticism originated and how it reemerged in various periods of history as heresies opposing the beliefs of traditional Christianity. Using the historicist perspective, reference and information services can better understand the ideas and concepts that underlie knowledge and how that knowledge is transmitted.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: In
      The Broken Whole, Thomas Reynolds argues that postmodern “pluralistic consciousness” invites a stance of nontotalizing, nonpolemical availability and trust toward others and deepens our understanding of identity and tradition, which are themselves constituted by polycentrism and difference. In the book’s concluding chapters, Reynolds attempts to show how religion—at least in theory—exemplifies this thesis, and he outlines a corresponding theological paradigm.<br>

Abstract: When it comes to the relative independence of the human mind from the physical brain, Edelman’s scheme of perception and apprehension does not diverge significantly from Augustine’s indifference to the physical logic of cause‐and‐effect or, more precisely, of organization and function. Augustine’s scheme of sense impression makes the perceptive functions of the five senses depend on their specific organization (
         Confessions10.8), just like Edelman’s scheme makes the mental apprehension of sense perception depend on the sensory‐ and psychomotor organization of the brain. Augustine leaves behind the realm of cause‐ and‐effect no sooner than sense impression engenders a sensation in the mind, the seat of self‐awareness; this sensation engenders, by the self’s willful concentration on it, animagoorsimilitudo(image, simile) of the sensation in memory, and subsequently an intellectual understanding of it (De quantitate animae25.48;De Trinitate11.9.16). Analogously to Augustine, Edelman elides the conventional separation between organization and function as soon as, by “phenomenal transform,” the subject of perception enters the self‐reflective stage of a subject aware both of itself and of the scene in front of it.16At this stage, Edelman explains the coordination of mental apprehension and subjective awareness by the noncausal notion of “implication” or “reflection.”<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 592372<br>

Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Augustine’s apology for Christianity and the idea of just war suggests a point that he and his interlocutors presumed as obvious, namely, that there is an ethics of memory—a duty to remember justly for the sake of history, self‐understanding, and narrative recollection. He thus invites us to consider the obligations and virtues of what Ricoeur calls a “just memory.”
         82Augustine’s ethics is, as I noted above, “agent‐referring”: it attends to the moral effects of an action on the character of the person carrying out that action. He developed his agent‐referring concerns, moreover, not by looking at the morality of individuals as isolated monads but as situated and affected by cultural forces that help shape character over time. The temporal quality of character and culture led him naturally to consider the virtues that surround memory, both individual and collective.83Given the intimate connection between memory and identity, there is an obvious obligation to remember for Augustine, a responsibility to remember truthfully. He thus worried about whether what people remember about themselves is prone to self‐aggrandizement and, with that, self‐deception. For these reasons, we can say that an Augustinian ethics of war is, among other things, an ethics of memory. That Rome’s morality “proceeded to bloody strife of all parties and then to the social and civil wars” is not his own personal judgment; it is, in his words, “the witness of history.”84<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Rather than simply reading Ricoeur’s work in chronological sequence to make this case, Hall aims for what he calls a “critical constructive interpretation” that will yield something like a “situated reading” of Ricoeur’s thought (4), one that will better demonstrate this thesis than Ricoeur’s own words do. Basically, the structure of the argument Hall proposes begins from what Ricoeur has to say about the idea of agency in relation to the understanding of selfhood. Hall then moves on to consider the narrative configuration of a meaningful existence that follows from this understanding. He then takes up questions that can arise regarding our practical experience and moral concerns from this perspective. It is the testimony of conscience that comes in at this latter level that brings in the theological perspective. It does so through a discussion of what Ricoeur has to say about the Golden Rule in relation to the love commandment and in relation to what Ricoeur calls a logic of superabundance, one that goes beyond any logic of equivalence. It is this idea of a possible logic of superabundance that leads in turn to a discussion of what Hall calls the economy of the gift and the poetic imperative that Hall sees in Ricoeur’s concept of a theonomy that stands over against Kant’s call for an autonomy that all too easily isolates people from one another. It is love that drives this poetic imperative, and what love calls for is something more than, not less than, justice.<br>

Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: Some people find this situation terrifying and retreat into strident humanistic or fanatic religious outlooks centered on man or God. They hope to control the whirl of the age through the reduction of complexity to a single center or form of knowledge. Others see the polycontextual space of social life backing a free play of meaning and the destruction of inherited binary oppositions that are encrusted in traditional thought forms.
         29Yet for some thinkers, myself included, our global, polycontextual condition invigorates a search for more complex and yet also coherent accounts of knowledge. Knowledge is multidimensional, I contend, and is constituted by the interaction among codes and frames rather than being organized through a “center” or a “hierarchy,” whether that center is the man of humanism, the god of religion, or the deconstruction of those binaries. Ironically, it seems that both contemporary religionists and strident humanists want to push back on the complexity of contemporary societies and champion simpler modes of thought and yet in doing so risk a reduction and not a gain in understanding.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 598771<br>
Date: 8 2009<br>
Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: We should have been paying more attention. Thomas Elsaesser, shuttling frequently across the Atlantic from the late 1970s on and current with developments in French, German, and English, had been pointing to the place that critical theory, and especially the Frankfurt school, should occupy in any full‐dimensional film studies. During the 1980s his perspective teamed up with an avalanche of research on early cinema that had been ongoing since the famous Brighton conference of 1978. Elsaesser staged a conference in England in 1983 on various aspects of early cinema and eventually published a carefully wrought anthology through the British Film Institute in 1990, where Benjamin's name shows up in the first paragraph to underwrite a “new archeology of the artwork, because of the fundamental change film had brought to the notion of time, space and material culture.”
         50After helping Noel Burch, André Gaudreault, Yuri Tzivian, Charles Musser, Tom Gunning, and others blow apart the dominance of the feature film, Elsaesser aimed to reassemble film studies by bringing to traditional questions of form and narrative the integral dimension of social experience that critical theory always turns forefront. Simultaneously Miriam Hansen publishedBabel and Babylon: Spectatorship in American Silent Film, contributing in a more concentrated way to the massive rediscovery of silent (and presilent) cinema through a sophisticated understanding of experience.51Of course, attention to viewing and viewers had also been central for Morin, Metz, and Baudry. But, in her clarifying introduction, Hansen rejected the hubris of French psychoanalytic theory that had made spectators slaves to the apparatus. She remained even more skeptical of American approaches, including both empirical research into audience demography and the emerging cognitive paradigm that reaches for universal, if specific, laws governing how narratives or individual genres (for example, horror) are processed by the mi~<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: This is not Ricoeur at his most accessible, and I would not recommend the work as an entrance point for engaging his corpus. The essays are tough going, and the essays in the second section are particularly difficult. The essays do deal with important themes in Ricoeur’s work, ones especially visible in his later writings. Many of the essays are introduced with footnotes that indicate a debt to previous works, and nearly all the essays make some reference to the “little ethics” of
      Oneself as Anotherbut suggest that knowledge of these works is not necessary. This is not completely true in my estimation; it is difficult to discern where Ricoeur is headed in this volume if one knows little or nothing of where he has been. Some understanding may be gained without previous knowledge, but grounding in previous works is essential for a thorough understanding of this volume.<br>

Author(s): Mrozik,  Susanne<br>
Abstract: In another respect, however, Mrozik’s work moves beyond the aims of classical historical and philological research by attempting to engage this text as a “living argument” that has implications for how contemporary scholars and religious practitioners should engage in ethical reflection. This engagement represents the second goal of her work, to “explore the ethical implications of the
      Compendium of Training's discourse on bodies for both medieval and contemporary audiences” (7), a goal that she takes up explicitly only in a brief concluding chapter. This project clearly resonates with the work of other contemporary scholars, including those who, influenced by feminist and postcolonial critiques of positivist methodologies, emphasize the intersubjective character of human encounter and understanding. Here Mrozik, drawing on Ricoeur’s work, employs a feminist “hermeneutics of recovery and suspicion” that seeks to take seriously the truth claims presented by the text as a valuable resource for contemporary ethics while also critiquing the text’s validation of particular social hierarchies, including those based on sex and caste. The author questions the assertion of some scholars that Indian Mahayana Buddhism invariably represented an elevation of the status of Buddhist women and argues against attempts to downplay evidence of sexual inequality by recourse to the Buddhist doctrine of “emptiness.” For Mrozik, the diverse forms of human embodiment provide the ground on which a serious engagement with ideals of human virtue must proceed.<br>

Article Title: Coleridge’s Philosophy of Prayer: Responsibility, Parergon, and Catachresis<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: In conclusion, Coleridge testifies, in poetry and theological reflection alike, to an internal struggle constitutive of prayer and its language. Going back to the most recent philosophical discussions, this is not incompatible with Derrida’s insistence that the words of prayer are always inappropriate to the Other. Yet because Coleridgean prayer is a response, this struggle is entirely fitting: the call of God upon the subject is to open up the for‐God in one’s being, thus by definition practicing a kind of violence against one’s current being—including one’s speech. In
         Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit, Coleridge describes the name of God, the “I Am,” as part of a religious category called “stasis.” Prayer, however, is part ofmetastasis‐anastasis(change of state/rising up): the conflictual, dynamic, unfinished scene of human redemption that includes grace, love, hope, and perseverance.71Appropriately enough, the primary signification of metastasis is a transition between rhetorical figures. For Coleridge, there can be no transformation in one’s spiritual state unless the language in which one responds is also transformed, wrenched toward the improper. The heart of Coleridgean prayer is the metastasis between proper signification and catachresis that cuts against one’s language, one’s understanding, and hence one’s being in order to open oneself up to God. Perhaps one may even argue that in this cut, this wound, made against the “fleshly Understanding” (N6666, fol. 83), “the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered” (Rom. 8:26). This, certainly, is a hope on which much of his poetry and certainly his philosophy of prayer is founded.<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: Franke’s book has considerable merit, but I have a theoretical and a practical concern with his appropriation of negative theology. First, negative theology is never entirely negative, and while Franke recognizes that poetic language is both deconstructive and open, he nevertheless insists that our various theologies—literary or religious—finally have no positive content. Perhaps this is the postmodernism in his negative theology because this is not entirely consistent with the theological tradition. A good counterexample is Pseudo‐Dionysius, whose mystical theology seeks finally to overcome the limitations of both positive and negative speaking. Dionysius insists that God is love in a way that is both negative and positive. On this, Franke should consider the work of Jean‐Luc Marion and especially his response to Jacques Derrida on the subject of negative theology, and this omission is a considerable oversight. Second, many people of various faiths will never accept that their understanding of the transcendent has no positive content, and if this is a precondition for dialogue, then it is unlikely to occur. On this, the practical dimension of Franke’s study needs more development, as well as more traditional examples of poetic and theological openness from contemporary religious life.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 605587<br>
Date: 6 2010<br>
Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Despite these oppositions, secularization and resacralization should be regarded as complementary phenomena that arose in response to the problem of a radically transcendent, hidden God. The studies under review, then, are of crucial importance, but their full significance requires a supplementary analysis. Novel conceptions of society, the nation, Scripture, and personhood followed from an intensification of divine transcendence, and, at the same time, necessitated a reworking of the immanent relations between worldly persons, institutions, and things. It was not merely that secularization, now understood by Bell and others as the translation of divine authority into a worldly register, entailed that the latter incorporate the properties and prerogatives once reserved for God alone. Enlightenment-era efforts to resacralize the self as an object of a totalizing force—situated either in the mystic divine or in a purely immanent, materialist conception of nature—suggest another dynamic at work: the closing of the chasm between the divine and terrestrial spheres and the identification of one with the other. Even if human effort was increasingly regarded as the source of one's understanding of the world, the humans undertaking this work had become newly alien to themselves, and in a manner that recalled the radical distance of the divine.<br>

Author(s): Kitts Margo<br>
Abstract: Understanding the play of metaphor is therefore critical to understanding the last instructions. As Ricoeur might see it, the ritual actor has suspended his literal reference (the 9/11 hijackers are not really seventh‐century jihadists fighting Meccan polytheists) in order to allow a metaphorical reference (their motives are the same!) to emerge when he reads and follows the last instructions. At the same time, he had to preserve the ordinary vision (twenty‐first‐century hijacker) in tension with the figurative one (seventh‐century holy warrior) in order to grasp the ancient relevance of the contemporary situation. Based upon the repeated invocations of primordial battles and detailed ritual preparations (i.e., praying, purifying, blowing Quranic verses), it would appear to be the figurative vision that gave the ritual actors their motivating punch.<br>

Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: Writing, a word Blanchot uses to replaceliteratureinThe Infinite Conversation,is finally for Blanchot the only way to remain true to the idea of Judaism. It is also the only way, Blanchot will argue, to remain true to the impulse of estrangement that he locates at the heart of Lévinas's philosophy. For Blanchot, insofar as the relation to the other is one of infinite distance between myself and the Other, inaugurating “a relation of impossibility and strangeness,” the language that invokes this relation must be one unsupported by presence; that is, it must be writing (EI, p. 101;IC, p. 71). Blanchot suggests further that as a mode of communication philosophy itself fails to be faithful to the relation with the Other because it requires a language that prioritizes clarity. “How can one say inequality by means of what tends to equalize?” Blanchot asks. The only speech that “would speak without leveling . . . without tending toward the identity implied by satisfaction and full understanding” is a speech that can speak of difference without grasping it or capturing it, for even when it represents its relation toward a referent it is characterized by a turn (EI, p. 90;IC, p. 63).<br>

Author(s): Bono James J.<br>
Abstract: Let me end by offering my own provocation to thinking about the relationship of history of science with literature and science, one that aims to invite historians of science to explore science as a form of making that involves the convergence of things, material practices, and “meaningful artifacts,” embracing a panoply of possibilities from metaphoric to narrative to visual to instrumental resources.
         8Elsewhere, I have written:
               At stake in the convergence of history of science and literature and science, I would submit, is the very possibility of a poetics of science: of understanding science as itself a form ofThe world as we know it and operate upon it is one in which we continually conjoin discourse and practice, text and action: where we simultaneously learn
            andact by embodying intentions and projecting our metaphorically constructed models onto matter which we shape and use to our ends asinstrumentsof thought and action. The world as we know it and study it is filled with material‐textual, or material‐discursive, hybrids—instruments; machines; illustrations; diagrams; maps; charts; physical models; computer simulations—that are simultaneously part of the material world andinstrumentsfor our knowing and manipulating it.

Abstract: However, while it could be argued that these similes function allegorically to show the loss of rational faculty to instinctual drives that explains the condition of the sinners in this circle, and while the similes do indeed describe the actions of the sinners, the vehicles in the similes are not just analogies. Rather, they function as microscopic views of the natural world of creatures and as part of the natural order of Dante's created universe: existing alone, they become sign, signified, and signifying, indifferent to humans or even to their place in the order of creatures; and, like all other creatures, in their immanent presence they perform and participate in a vast cosmic dance. Again, as Agamben puts it, describing animal captivation, the animal possesses a “more spellbinding and intense openness than any kind of human knowledge,” yet “it is closed in a total opacity.”
         62Animals—in this case, ants, fish, and birds—lacking consciousness of themselves as selves are captivated within themselves and by instinct and needs. This captivation, according to Agamben, following Heidegger, makes the world opaque to the nonhuman creature, yet this “captivation” also allows the animal to be “open” to the world, as vestige or footprint of a living divine presence. In this understanding of the ontology of the animal, we recognize that the animal is not in the postlapsarian human strife-ridden condition, trapped between being and nonbeing (consciousness and finitude). Rather, the animal exists in a state of obliviousness about the cares and anxieties that plague human consciousness. With the similes functioning heuristically, we then see the lustful inPurgatorio26, who are harnessing their recalcitrant desires, to aspire to this state possessed by nonhuman creatures and epitomized by the unconscious action of ants. In one sense the condition of the blessed, like that of the ants, is fullness of being, outside consciousness.<br>

Abstract: Kafka himself brings up yet another corollary: “An appendix to this story has also been handed down. Ulysses, it is said, was so full of guile, was such a fox, that not even the goddess of fate could penetrate his inner self. Perhaps he had really noticed, although it is beyond human understanding, that the Sirens were silent and perhaps somehow opposed them and the gods using the aforementioned sham as a shield.”
   
            Why not? Why should it not be the case that, ultimately, Augustine, while confessing uninterruptedly, has succeeded in having his Confessee not penetrate his heart? Who can tell? Once in the grasp of the seductive act of24
         confessioas inextricably linked to the moment the confession is made and to the everlasting Confessee hovering over it, who indeed can tell? An angel to an angel? Yet this question regards the fullness of sound: “Only you can be asked, only you can be begged, only on your door can we knock. Yes, indeed, that is how it is received, how it is found, how the door is opened.”

Abstract: My approach has something in common with that of Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht's
            Production of Presence: What Meaning Cannot Convey(Stanford, Calif., 2004). I differ, however, in viewing the crucial contemporary barrier to contemplation as that of an obsession with narrative rather than an obsession with meaning. (The last thing I would accuse contemporary culture of is a surfeit of intellectualism!) To be reengaged with nonnarrative phenomena does not require us to surrender all interest in meanings; perceiving the beauty of a gesture, for example, requires understanding what it signifies. Nor does it require us to surrender all interest in depth, another of Gumbrecht's targets; on the contrary, the beauty of other human beingsistheir depth, the depth of that invisible perspective which emerges in their aesthetic and everyday style. Even scientific knowledge—such as the delightful fact, inAdaptation, about Darwin's moth—can be truly enchanting, an enrichment rather than a desiccation of experience. We may well wish to save all these charming babies from going out with the “meaning” bathwater. What is more, the contemplation of orchids need, on my account, have nothing mystical about it (it would certainly not need to involve a perception of “Being”) and need not be transitory in the manner of epiphanies (orchid-lovers can happily stare at bromeliads all day). Finally, I hope to have given a substantive account of the role that the non-“presence” elements play in the fictional work; as I see it, these elements are absolutely necessary for making the flowers available in the first place.<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: In saying this, I am not arguing that Marlowe “appropriated” the sacred from its dominant institutional contexts. On the contrary, the rumors of devils appearing on the Faustian stage belie that model of the relationship between the dramatic and the theological in which the theater evacuates the spiritual content from theological forms only to stage those forms within a sphere of rational disenchantment that supposedly frames the experience of a play.
   41Such a model relies on a modern, indeed modernist, understanding of theater as a compartmentalized zone of experience where entertainment has no further end than its own production and consumption, and where aesthetic efficacy, if it exists at all, remains limited to art's ability to contain the contradictions of ideology. Theatrical representation clearly had a certain kind of autonomy in Marlowe's England, produced and consumed as it was in its own institutional space, yet at the same time, as I hope I have been able to show, that very representation could be understood by antitheatrical writers and theatergoers alike as an instrument that had theological ends. Another way to put this claim is to say that theater was not always understood as a disenchanted product of human agency. When the reformers argued that Satan staged theater pieces through the instrumentality of the magician to the end of creating beliefs in the audience that would augment his own power, they were quite capable of imagining that such spectacles were well-crafted illusions without needing to go on to posit that the devil was an ideological fiction. The rumors of the Faustian devils powerfully demonstrate that even representations that announced their own theatricality—even illusions that were institutionally marked out as such—could still be understood as having theological consequences. Those who believed that the devil came when Faustus called him may have been fully invested in their faith, but they were never so gullible as to believe ~<br>

Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
Abstract: Three epigraphs circumscribe the book’s broader themes. The first, from the late philosopher Paul Ricoeur (LaCocque’s friend and collaborator), identifies the role of myth in combining the innocence and guilt of humanity. The second, from Norman Brown’s
      Life against Death, points out how “pyramids and skyscrapers” represent a “flight from death.” The third, from Jacques Derrida, characterizes the Tower of Babel as “an incompletion, the impossibility of finishing, of totalizing” (v). Taken together, these three reflections affirm an understanding of the Babel story as a timeless “symbol of all our constructions and fabrications, with their inexorable outcome: confusion (of our life messages) and scattering (of all the pieces of our projects)” (21). They also provide a model for LaCocque’s own scholarly practice, which is distinctively rigorous yet exploratory at the same time. If, for example, Genesis 11 dates from the exile, it then becomes possible to depict it as a mythic critique of architectural fetishism and political ambition. The “gate of the divine” (Bab-El) thus becomes a dangerous threshold from profane to sacred, one in which the desire to “make a name” reflects an arrogance doomed to confuse all names. As myth, Genesis 11 captures enduring tendencies in human psychology such as infants’ fascination with presence and absence (“fort” and “da”) and the politics of empire.<br>

Author(s): Regan Ethna<br>
Abstract: With this understanding of human rights, Regan shows how secular human rights and Christian theology engage in common themes, interests, and areas of concern, arguing that both have in the recent past and could continue in the future to benefit from a reciprocity of critique. In this descriptive mode, Regan discusses the emergence and development of liberation theology but also highlights intellectual engagement with human rights discourse of the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church from the end of WWII to the post–Second Vatican Council era. While reverent toward the deepening and thickening of the church’s vision of the human person, Regan also challenges the institutional church to reflect on apparent moments of dissonance between its theory of human personalism and praxis.<br>

Author(s): Walton Heather,<br>
Abstract: What does this tensional approach look like in practice? A few noteworthy examples illustrate the scope of this collection. In her own essay, Walton destabilizes the conventional hetero-normative ordering of the disciplines. With Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray, Walton seeks to reclaim the metaphysical power of the feminine (and the literary) through a genuine “honouring of difference” that stresses “alterity rather than complimentarity” via tension without hierarchy (43). She demonstrates this through brief but insightful readings of Toni Morrison’s
      Beloved(New York, 1987), Ian McEwan’sAtonement(New York, 2002), and J. M. Coetzee’sElizabeth Costello(New York, 2003). Fiona Darroch examines the politics of representation in postcolonial Caribbean literature—specifically, the various ways the literature reimagines the sacred and thereby challenges Western conceptions of the religious and the sacred that persist within comparative religious studies. Finally, John O’Connor exposes the tendency of recent theological aesthetics (following Hans Urs von Balthasar) to ignore or oversimplify aesthetics since the Enlightenment. Theology thereby assimilates aesthetics and fails to take seriously the ambiguities present in actual aesthetic experience—namely, the tensions between our experience and our understanding of beauty as revelatory, including “the possible untrustworthiness of the imagination” (123).<br>

Abstract: This straight-forward reading of the passage has been obscured by interpreters, ancient and modern, who interpret מחניהם as referring to “their camps” (plural) and thus assert the existence of a requirement to maintain purity in all cities. For a coherent understanding of the syntax and content of this passage, it is necessary to understand the form as singular (“their camp”). Note the form מחניך alongside מחנך in Deut. 23:15, both meaning “your camp” (singular). Among the moderns, the fact that מחניהם in our verse is singular has been noted by J. Licht (
         A Commentary on the Book of Numbers, vol. 1 [Jerusalem, 1985], 59–60 [Heb.]), and Levine (Numbers 1–20, 182, 186), and it is assumed by the JPS translation. I plan on elaborating on these points in a study in progress, “The Wilderness Camp Paradigm in the Holiness Source and the Temple Scroll: From Purity Laws to Cult Politics.”<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: Amélie Rorty, the one philosopher among the commentators, engages with the systematic elements of my argument: the problems of considering morality as a cultural system and of whether a systematic understanding of evil as a category is possible. She agrees that morality is not properly a system but a “polymorphous pluralism” in practice and observes that the multiple concerns of Anglo-American moral theory exhibit distinctive and even incommensurable logics and rationales. Rorty, like Parkin, accepts that attention to the dark side can illuminate what is at stake in morality but is surprised at my focus on evil as the “primary default contrast.” As with Crapanzano’s reading of my argument as dualist, I must rejoin that I take evil to be not so much a default contrast as an existential possibility that subtends morality and makes it necessary. However, the core of Rorty’s commentary makes it clear that the category of evil exhibits multiple concerns that are just as incommensurable and unsystematic as those of morality in general. In a tour de force paragraph that is both analytic and historical, she parses 11 components of evil broadly conceived (I only wonder if there are others, including violence and wickedness) and weaves them into a coherent narrative of incommensurability (I only wonder if this is lack of a system or complexity of a system). This is particularly valuable because it makes me realize the extent to which my argument is inflected toward one of those components, namely, malevolence. Finally, I reiterate that philosophers have not been as reticent as anthropologists to engage evil (see my footnote listing several recent philosophical works on the topic, not least among which is a book by Rorty herself). I resist attributing this to philosophers’ ethnocentrism. As Rorty observes (and Crapanzano as well), it has something to do with the morality of anthropology as a social practice.<br>

Author(s): Fisher Cass<br>
Abstract: However, Fisher’s methodology seems somewhat circular: he privileges four elements that fit his understanding of theology and then “proves” their presence in two select Jewish texts, one ancient and one modern. This procedure leaves out about fifteen hundred years of Jewish philosophical theology that may or may not confirm the model. It is no coincidence that Fisher left out Jewish philosophy from Saadia Gaon to Mendelssohn, since it has a strong propositional dimension in addition to being exegetical and hermeneutical. Conversely, Fisher’s analysis excludes the Jewish mystical tradition, which could have given further support for his Jewish theological practice model. In other words, more textual work is needed before Jewish theological practice could be accepted as definitive.<br>

Abstract: But even as the play frustrates our understanding, it requires our response. This requirement is especially acute in the case of Cordelia, for the king is not the only one caught up in the face-to-face encounter with her. As the drama draws to a close, Lear exhorts every person in the theater to cast eyes on his daughter: “Do you see this? Look on her. Look, her lips, / Look there, look there” (5.3.285–86).
      
            In performance, it is not uncommon for the actor playing Lear to turn his body and speak these lines directly to the audience, rotating and elevating Cordelia’s inert form so as to present it to the seated spectators. The staging feels right, for in his last lines the king offers to each of us the daughter who has repeatedly offered herself to him. Yet what do we see if we obey Lear’s injunction and look? We see, to be sure, a beloved daughter who is dead, but we also see an actor who is dressed up and dissimulating. “Beholders are asked to see what may not exist,” Holahan writes, “for this is and is not Cordelia. Her character now appears only in an actor’s body’s mimicry of a past life—a striking union of death and theatrical illusion.”48
         
            The “Cordelia” we are asked to consider is a theatrical construct: a person masked in a dramatic character. To what degree, then, can we live up to Lear’s final command and look on, lament, and love this virtuous girl? Is it even possible for us to submit ourselves to a simulation?49<br>

Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: In the context of the poem’s obsession with manufacturing satanic speech, these seemingly trivial lines may hold the key to understanding the fate of the serpent. Teskey provides another helpful gloss: “Satan emits sound through the serpent either by using the serpent’s tongue or by emitting pulses of air, which make sound by vibrating in the elongated tube of the serpent’s body.”
         
               In pursuing the question of who ultimately speaks the words that seduce Eve, we are led to the perhaps unexpected question—Is the serpent more like a singer or more like a trumpet? If the latter is true, if Satan merely emitted pulses of air through his body, then surely the serpent is innocent (we might imagine two serpentine fangs hanging like quotation marks over his mouth, signifying that the pulses of air that glide through them have their true origin in another). But what if the serpent used his own tongue? What if he was inspired by Satan and took some pleasure in shaping those seductive syllables? What if he experienced the satanic voice uniquely as his own, even for a moment—as we saw comically in the case of Raphael and tragically in the case of Adam? How well, we might ask, did the serpent govern his tongue?38<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D.<br>
Abstract: The value of Popkin's approach becomes clear in his chapter on two historians whose autobiographies have been included in the literary canon for many years: Edward Gibbon and Henry Adams. By reading them as historians, Popkin offers new insights to an already great body of literature on these authors, for instance by showing that both Gibbon and Adams believed that their personal experiences helped them in understanding the past. Not all 327 autobiographers listed in the bibliography are discussed in depth, and in chapters on vocation and career their works serve to sketch an impression of the historical profession in the twentieth century. Bookish children from middle‐class backgrounds, as most historians have been, often picked up their vocation from parents or teachers. They were also often inspired by children's books like those by Jules Verne and Karl May, which is interesting, because despite these literary models they chose to write nonfiction. For Popkin this is a telling detail, as he concludes that historians are obviously motivated by a wish to tell stories. With few exceptions historians are reluctant to write about their careers. Most are silent about their academic successes, failures, and frustrations, and few pages are spent on the daily life of teaching courses and doing administrative work. On the contrary, most authors want to show that they had another life besides their profession. Therefore they often describe their own lives against the background of great events. Since Jean‐Jacques Rousseau's
      Confessions, autobiography has been seen as a genre that should focus on the innermost experience and not world events, but many historians simply could not cast off their professional background. Often only those historians who were involved in politics became aware of how little an individual could accomplish, or lost faith in the ideas they once had believed. Holocaust memoirs are discussed in a separate chapter, in which Popkin concludes that t~<br>

Abstract: The Ionian cosmogonies of the sixth century b.c.e. explained how an ordered world evolved out of an undifferentiated initial state of “things.” In the fifth century, science became more particularly an inquiry into the ultimate constitution of material substance: the uniform and permanent “nature of things.” The notion of substance derives from tactile sensation. The belief in substantial things outside us reverts to the original detachment of self from the object. With Heraclitus of Ephesus, philosophy focused on knowing the thing, not on that which is known. Thought controls the phenomena as it constitutes the thinker. The problem of understanding nature was taken to a new level. The Milesian school of philosophers had moved it to the realm of the intellect in that they claimed the universe to be an intelligible whole. The manifold was to be understood as deriving from a sustaining principle or first cause, but was to be perceived in the phenomena.<br>

Author(s): Gutterman David S.<br>
Abstract: Ultimately it is at times unclear what is gained in making these comparisons or if such analysis “enhances our understanding of the relationship between religious narratives and politics” (p. 92). What precisely is revealed in grouping these movements together, other than that political crisis invites prophetic criticism? Gutterman carefully unpacks the readings of shared Biblical texts, and he skillfully details contextual and interpretative differences. But one wishes he had gone beyond these descriptive endeavors to construct a more nuanced account of the relationship between religion and politics and, more importantly, of the specifically religious grounds of the activism he examines. While Gutterman can be theoretically deft—in exploring the relation between narrative and politics (p. 21) or garden/wilderness metaphors (p. 47)—he is not fully engaged with the literature on political religion, often citing unrepresentative figures like William Connolly or Stephen Carter. He is a sharp writer with an eye for interesting problems and material. I applaud his engagement with important issues and also the ambition of his thinking. But his central categories require further explication, and this book speaks to the need for more conversations across disciplines.<br>

Abstract: William Paul Simmons and Edward Finley, in their respective essays, “Voegelin and Levinas” and “Politics, Metaphysics, and Anti-Foundationalism,” compare Voegelin's, Levinas', and Patočka's philosophies in the recovery of transcendence. For Simmons, both Voegelin and Levinas recognize transcendence as a guide instead of a foundation. For the former, politics and ethics are justified “from the individual's existential participation in the
         metaxy,” while for the latter, “Politics must answer to ethics” (139). Patočka and Voegelin also accept transcendence into their politics, but they approach transcendence in different ways: Patočka employs postmodern techniques, “negative Platoism,” to reject metaphysical thinking, while Voegelin adopts a classical approach for understanding Plato. Although both Simmons and Findley provide an excellent delineation of the differences among these thinkers, they leave open the question of which approach—Voegelin's, Levinas', or Patočka's—is the best way to recover a meaning of transcendence for society.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores visual response methods as a representation of student learning in a college-level interdisciplinary curriculum integrating art and engineering. The visual response methods, specifically visual journals and postcards, are examples of authentic assessment and alternative data collection methods embedded in a mixed-methods (qualitative dominant) practitioner research case study. In the paper, we focus on different means for analyzing these visual responses (e.g., through hermeneutic analysis, document analysis, and narrative analysis) and deliberate the contribution of diverse analysis methods to the researchers’ understanding of students’ experiences of interdisciplinarity in this course.<br>

Abstract: Among other interpretations one should also think of this rhetoric as a means to justify the subdivision of power within architectural offices. Sociologist Judith Blau stated, in her
               Architects and Firms: A Sociological Perspective on Architectural Practice(Cambridge and London: MIT Press, 1987), 26, that in architecture similar training and shared knowledge create a bond between different echelons within the firm. Blau and Cuff (Architecture,130–37), demonstrate that this bond brings the sense of purpose to entry-level architects' every day activities—but it could also lead to subtle forms of exploitation. Clearly, the presentation of the production of working drawings as pleasurable and enjoyable was directed toward aspiring architects and the lower echelons of architects' offices, to encourage an understanding of the material qualities of a project, and this rewarding and pleasurable aspect of being an architect. See Woods,From Craft to Profession, 141–46, for her depiction of the complex mixture of camaraderie and exploitation that took place in architectural offices at the turn of the century.<br>

Abstract: Review of Robert D. Romanyshyn's The Wounded Researcher: Research with Soul in Mind, New Orleans, Louisiana: Spring Journal Books, 2007. Robert Romanyshyn has written a treatise on the question of understanding that brings together the fields of phenomenology and depth psychology. Following the thought of C. G. Jung, Romanyshyn has presented an archetypal view of the dilemma of psychological research that he sees as a story of loss, mourning, descent, re-search and homecoming expressed in the mythical image of Orpheus. Going deeper into the actual process of psychological research, Romanyshyn looks to the ancient art of alchemy as providing a model of the attitude and action of imagination that most closely suits psychological life.<br>

Abstract: This essay addresses the problematical nature of the meaning of religion as it is related to the formation and destiny of peoples of African descent in the United States. Moving beyond a narrow understanding of the nature of religion as expressed in much of Black Theology, for example, this essay proposes a "thick" and complex depiction of religion in the African American context through a recognition of its relationship to the contact and conquest that marked the modern world.<br>

Abstract: The L.D.S Church's use of commemorative rituals and narrative history to simultaneously adapt and maintain identity is not unique, but it is uniquely available to analysis because of the immediacy of the change and the Saints' devotion to record-keeping. Thus, the drama of LDS survival during the Progressive Era illuminates age-old religious strategies for adaptation to social norms, which strategies preserve the faithful's confidence in the timelessness of their god's moral and ecclesiastical order. More narrowly, these events in American church history are critical for understanding how the civilly disobedient Saints finally accepted the rule of federal law without losing their religion.<br>

Author(s): Newman Sara<br>
Abstract: In the
         Rhetoric, Aristotle identifies "bringing-before-the-eyes" as a capacity that is crucial to metaphors because it allows rhetors to actualize actions immediately before audiences, leading those audiences to insight. Because this description suggests that metaphors activate cognitive mechanisms on the part of their listeners, "bringing-before-the-eyes" has been considered a key element within Aristotle's theory and the nexus of that approach to metaphor and contemporary conceptual ones. Yet, no study has probed these claims to any degree. Accordingly, this paper examines Aristotle's references to "bringing-before-the-eyes" as well as to two associated concerns,energeia/actualization and sense perception. This examination demonstrates that "bringing-before-the-eyes" is not explicitly cognitive but instead a perceptive capacity. In this, Aristotle's theory anticipates recent approaches to language because it allows the audience to participate in the persuasive process at a level that extends its role beyond the traditional Aristotelian understanding that it is the target of emotional appeals.<br>

Abstract: The study of teachers' personal practical knowledge is an emerging orientation that focuses on the way teachers' understanding of their world affects the way they structure classroom experience and interact with students, parents, colleagues, and administrators. I argue that several recent articles on this topic are developing greatly enriched models of cognition, meaning, understanding, and knowledge. These models emphasize nonpropositional, pre-reflective dimensions of meaning that arise in our spatio-temporal orientations, perceptual interactions, and bodily movements. To take these experiential dimensions seriously requires new models of cognition and thus marks out a new territory for curriculum inquiry.<br>

Author(s): White Marcy Singer<br>
Abstract: This article examines challenges to discourses of curriculum research and practice by the growing fascination with alternative forms of representation. The author takes as a starting point a cluster of exchanges with students that were situated in a study of a classroom in which music and image joined word and number as essential sources for learning about a context irreducibly distant from students' own: the past. In the study, what seemed to make painting, photography, film, and poetry potent sources of understanding was their capacity to bridge the gap between a remote, textbook past, and the sensory world of the students' present; these forms expressed to students not only the outline of events, but also what the events signified and felt like. Yet, in juxtaposing students' comments against discourses of historiography, philosophical aesthetics, and history teaching and learning, one soon recognizes that the very ability of the arts to communicate a sense of immediacy and human intention is what makes them problematic as sources of historical insight: in pushing out the boundaries of "acceptable" forms beyond discursive text, one also pushes up against assumptions about the nature and purposes of knowledge and inquiry. While the starting point of this article is historical inquiry, the author argues that the difficulties of representing experiences of persons in contexts removed in time or space, and of making sense of others' representations, are relevant to other forms of inquiry; the challenge of the arts to historical inquiry is paralleled in other fields, and no less in educational research.<br>

Publisher: National Art Education Association<br>
Issue: i256677<br>
Date: 1 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Schwaller De Lubicz William<br>
Abstract: This paper follows two purposes: the first to unpack some of the artistic cargo of symbols as distinct from the more conventional aspects of them (e. g., their ability to refer to other things or events, and their ability to communicate ideas), and the second to show, by means of contrasts, the actual workings of Interpretation Theory as it could be applied to the analysis of art-making and art-viewing. For the first purpose, the author draws material from philosophy, dramatic writings, linguistic theory, and statements of artists in an analytic search for the often intractable character of the artistic image. For the second purpose, the author demonstrates, through the use of logic and the poetic metaphor, how a particular form of hermeneutic inquiry can be applied to assist an understanding of the assumptions upon which research is often built.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur Steven D.<br>
Abstract: Methods of studying religion can be divided into those which help the investigator "understand" religion from the believer's standpoint and those which "explain" religion in the terms of the sciences. Yet despite the contemporary polemics, these methods need not be alienated from one another. Applying the hermeneutic theory of Paul Ricoeur we can see that the study of religion involves us in an act of interpretation which necessarily requires both methods of understanding and explanation. Ricoeur's theory is employed to show how these methods can be systematically used in tandem so that the most adequate interpretation of the religious world is produced.<br>

Publisher: Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, Inc.<br>
Issue: i262141<br>
Date: 1 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Tyler Daniel M.<br>
Abstract: This paper proposes a theoretical foundation for extending our understanding of study drawings by bringing forward concepts from a number of disciplines that are concerned with the structure of knowledge. Study drawings are defined as the informal, private drawings that architectural designers use as a medium for graphic thinking in the exploratory stages of their work. Drawings from the work of Paxton through Picasso are analyzed to confirm the familiar characteristics of study drawings and to identify the properties which account for their role in the working process of design, including their use as a means of inquiry. This epistemological function is compared with certain features of written language in order to propose an internal structure for study drawings. The paper concludes that much of the origin and nature of knowledge in design can be explained in terms of the properties and processes of study drawings and that these terms should be used to evaluate proposals for new media in design.<br>

Author(s): Ulmer David<br>
Abstract: The study of metaphor provides valuable insights into the workings of thought and understanding. This article addresses the important question of what the study of metaphor has to say about the design process and design teaching. We include the findings of a series of studies involving architectural design students who were asked to report on their own design experience and that of colleagues in the context of specific projects. Our conclusions are that (1) there is a close relationship between design and metaphor that provides insights into effective design education; (2) metaphor operates through privilege, directing concern and the identification of difference; and (3) design involves the generation of action within a collaborative environment in which there is the free play of enabling metaphors.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263715<br>

Author(s): Windisch William A.<br>
Abstract: Considered rhetorically, or by phenomenological-literary analysis, the saying about finding one's life by losing it intends to break up the continuity of existence of the hearer to the extent that he or she is left without a frame of reference. Considered from a historical-literary point of view, however, the saying occurs in an environment and presupposes a context which gives meaning to the response. A Whiteheadian or process perspective of interpretation offers an approach which can relate these two types of understanding of the saying, and can also cast light on contemporary styles of interpretation with their ontological presuppositions, either to set the saying in a framework of "rightness" or in one of "creativity."<br>

Article Title: Generic Studies: Their Renewed Importance in Religious and Literary Interpretation<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263709<br>

Author(s): Wiggins Mary<br>
Abstract: In recent years, the need for a critique of "reader" as rigorous as that which has been developed for "text" and for "author" has become increasingly acute. Whether in the study of religion as story and biography or in interpretative reading in general, a critical notion of reader is essential if the act of reading is to be anything other than mere consumption of texts. Some new way of understanding the hermeneutical circle is required to avert the narcissism latent in the Anselmian model. The notion of "genre" as developed by four recent theorists is helpful in the task of constructing a critique of "reader." E. D. Hirsch, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Tzvetán Todorov, and Paul Ricoeur have each surpassed the idealist notion of genre as a classificatory device and developed in its place the notion of genre as a generative pinciple. Todorov, for example, illustrates how "form" is a theoretical, as distinct from a descriptive or explanatory, issue. According to both Hirsch and Todorov, somewhere between empirical details and metaphysical thematizations lie generic formulations which can assist the reader to organize his/her response to the text and to recognize the probable understanding toward which the conventions of the text are directed. In Gadamer's theory of interpretation, the notion of genre acquires historicity. After Gadamer, genres can no longer be regarded as timeless a priori categories. Rather, because they are constituted by historical reflections, their rise and decline are intrinsic to text-interpretation. Finally, in Ricoeur's theory that generic considerations are correlative principles of production and interpretation, we find a basis for understanding genre as praxis. If we understand reading to be isomorphic to authoring, it becomes clear that the reader can no longer be regarded as the self-evident recipient of text-signification. Genre, in Ricoeur's theory, transforms "speech" into a "work" and points toward a new notion of "reader" as one whose reconst~<br>

Article Title: Ricoeur's "Symbolism of Evil" and Cross-Cultural Comparison: The Representation of Evil in Maya Indian Culture<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263706<br>
Date: 12 1, 1951<br>
Author(s): Makemson Laurence L.<br>
Abstract: The principal purpose of this essay is to examine the theory of culture (and the role of symbols of the sacred in culture) which is presupposed in Ricoeur's Symbolism of Evil. The examination is motivated by the question whether or not the etiology of the symbolism of evil which Ricoeur offers in his important text will stand up to the demands imposed by cross-cultural applications. It is argued that Ricoeur's exposition invites an assumption of the cross-cultural validity of his schema. The process of examination comprises two major sections. First, a synopsis of Ricoeur's text is offered to establish a working understanding of the concepts which offer themselves as integral to any cross-cultural evaluation of the "symbolism of evil." Second, a "test-case" is defined: the religious symbolisms of Maya Indian culture. The definition of this test-case involves two secondary tasks: 1) a brief description of the general features of Maya religious symbolism; and, 2) an analysis of how Ricoeur's categories of the symbolism of evil fail to define accurately symbolisms of evil which occur in Maya mythology both before and after the conquest. This analysis leads finally to an assessment of the impact of western religious symbolisms on indigenous Maya symbolisms of evil. Ultimately, Ricoeur's analysis of the symbolism of evil is argued to be invalid for cross-cultural comparisons which extend beyond the cultural ambience of the western world.<br>

Issue: i263719<br>
Date: 3 1, 1933<br>
Author(s): Whitehead Charles E.<br>
Abstract: The focus of contemporary studies in religion on methodology can be explored as the recognition of a fundamental epistemological problem. This paper is first an acknowledgment that we do not have an adequate conceptuality to render intelligible inward turning and then an experiment with the meaning of intelligibility. The dispossession of consciousness as the sole place and origin of meaning constituting an intellectual aporia is presented as an experience of the subversion of the subject by the discovery of the unconscious in depth psychologies and the discovery of the transcendence of the subject in foundational theologies. Taking account of this duplex expression of what lingers in disguise behind the scripts of ordinary life is defined as a fundamental exigency in the further development of human understanding and theological reflection.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263710<br>
Date: 12 1, 1966<br>
Author(s): Winter Charles R.<br>
Abstract: Through the provision of a set of theses for the interpretation and evaluation of theologies of liberation, this paper attempts to mediate the existing conflict between academic theologians and theologians of liberation. It seeks to establish the legitimacy of theological discourse focused on the problem of alienation and liberation if carefully executed according to a clear set of guidelines. The paper begins with the argument that all interpretations of theologies of liberation must begin with an analysis of the theological genre within which these works fall. After insisting that theologies of liberation belong neither to the genre of systematic theology nor that of Christian social ethics, the paper develops the second thesis that theologies of liberation are best understood as members of a genre whose distinctive characteristics and functions are analogous to those intrinsic to secular ideologies. This thesis hinges upon a revisionist understanding of ideology drawn from the works of Clifford Geertz et al. and upon a careful specification of the generic similarities between the two forms of discourse. The second part of the paper moves from the level of interpretation to that of evaluation. It argues that theologies of liberation share with ideologies a tendency to occlude self-critical reflection. It suggests that a conscious recognition that theologies of liberation do not exhaust the possibilities of theological discourse but are relative models which select and interpret Christian symbols and doctrines in the light of the central dynamic of alienation and liberation might provide an antidote to this pathology. It maintains with Rosemary Ruether that there is no absolutely adequate model of alienation and liberation and that various models of alienation and liberation must be "interstructured" in order to overcome the perspectival biases of models which focus upon a single root of oppression. To establish relative degrees of adequacy between various theologi~<br>

Author(s): Williamson Tod<br>
Abstract: Using George Bataille's reflections on desire, death, and God as the basis for considering the love poetry of the Song of Songs as a manifestation of the commingling of separate realms and separate bodies in the service of a longed-for continuity helps us to see that such a commingling is never far from the domain of violence and that such continuity of being is never far from death. But the biblical book itself helps us to see something that is missing from Bataille's analysis-that is, a more complex understanding of the implications of desire for the divine. What if, contra Bataille, God were not "by definition" immune to risk? What if the divine were not understood to be perfection but, rather, bound as well to the vicissitudes of desire, with all the anguish and ecstasy that it implies? The Song of Song's lyrical presentation of Eros, carried over as it is into the tradition of allegorical interpretation, may, in fact, have rather profound implications for how we talk about God.<br>

Abstract: In this essay, I explore the work of two scholars-Ian Morris and Leslie Kurke-and one of their claims: that the archaic Greek symposium served as the site for an anti-polis ideology. I first examine the conceptual underpinnings that guide their understanding of the operation of ideology. I then look closely at the arguments and evidence provided by Morris and Kurke. I argue that their respective conclusions about the symposium are not sustained even by their own evidence but rest on a set of problematic assumptions about the operation of ideology that they have imported into their analysis.<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303101<br>
Date: 7 1, 1938<br>
Author(s): Al-Zayyat Israel<br>
Abstract: This paper is an attempt to rethink the much-discussed topic of the so-called crisis of orientation among, or shift of, Egyptian intellectuals who turned to Islamic subjects in the 1930s. Those intellectuals who, during the 1920s, had adhered to the principles of Westernization and secularization were said to have abandoned these principles to embrace Islam and Arabism a decade later. The commonly ventured historical account of this shift attempted to describe and explain it from the "top down," that is, from the perspective of the intellectual producers, either on the basis of content analysis of their texts or through the reconstruction of authorial intentions. It was assumed that the impact of this shift on the culture and politics of contemporary society could be extracted from the meanings invested by the authors in their texts or from the context of the act of writing. This paper approaches the subject from a different perspective, namely, from the "bottom up." While not ignoring authorial intentions or the meanings with which authors invested their texts, I emphasize the ways in which readers reinterpreted intellectual literature on Islam as they consumed it and argue that a proper understanding of the social and political impact of literary products cannot be attained without also understanding the reception of these products. I concentrate especially on one of the major representative texts of this shift, Muhammad Husayn Haykal's biography of the Prophet, and reconstruct the different interpretations of this work's major communities of contemporary readers in the discursive context of their different "horizons of expectations." Through recontextualizing the "crisis of orientation" debate in the paradigm of reader-response criticism and reception theory, the paper is intended to show that each community of readers produces an autonomous interpretation, "another reading." Despite differences among the various reading communities, some common features emerge f~<br>

Abstract: My purpose in this article is to describe how and why theories of metaphor vary in the ways they do. I argue that theories of metaphor differ precisely because they emphasize different temporal stages in the process of understanding metaphorical expressions. The different temporal points at which theories propose that a metaphor has been understood, ranging from the first milliseconds of processing to extended, reflective analysis, distinguish rival accounts of metaphor. In this respect, metaphor theories do not necessarily compete with one another, but can best be evaluated through an appreciation of the specific time-course that underlies metaphor understanding. My discussion reviews some of the major theoretical approaches to metaphor and reveals their (mostly implicit) assumptions about the time-course of interpretation. I suggest that most theories of metaphor draw unjustified conclusions about the entire time-course of metaphor understanding because of the particular temporal stage of understanding that each attempts to describe. Thinking about metaphor in terms of the time-course of comprehension should permit much of the theoretical pluralism presently seen in the multidisciplinary study of metaphor.<br>

Abstract: Recent challenges to traditional approaches and purposes for studying the history of political theory have raised questions about its constitution as both a subject matter and subfield of political science. Methodological arguments advocating what is characterized as a more truly historical mode of inquiry for understanding political ideas and recovering textual meaning have become increasingly popular. The relationship of these hermeneutical claims about historicity, such as that advanced by Quentin Skinner, to the actual practice of interpretation is problematical. Such claims are more a defense of a certain norm of historical investigation than a method of interpretation, and the implications of this norm for the reconstitution of the history of political theory require careful consideration.<br>

Author(s): Tinder Deborah<br>
Abstract: The phrasing of the title telegraphs the thesis of this essay: study of the history of political theory ought to be understood and approached as a branch of political studies. Prior to the postwar success of empirical political science, the view would have seemed unexceptional. But the need for a defense against the empiricist attack impelled many theorists to turn to theories of interpretation in search of a philosophical and methodological identity. A preoccupation with issues of interpretation now threatens the customary, political study of the tradition. This essay, written in defense of a political understanding of the field, identifies fundamental propositions distinguishing @`political commentary@' and suggests critical standards appropriate to the enterprise. It also criticizes two currently fashionable applications of interpretative theory to the study of politics, historicist commentary and hermeneutical political science.<br>

Article Title: Merleau-Pontian Phenomenology as Non-Conventionally Utopian<br>
Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20010333<br>
Date: 1 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Johnson Greg<br>
Abstract: This essay takes up the claim made recently by Simon Critchley in The Companion to Continental Philosophy that a "feature common to many philosophers in the Continental tradition" is the "utopian demand that things be otherwise." The general question I pursue has to do with whether or not such a claim includes movements within Continental philosophy that do not self-identify with the utopian (like critical theory). The particular question has to do with whether or not the movement of phenomenology is utopian or does it, because of its other commitments, view the utopian as the antithesis to its orientation, which makes that claim that phenomenology is utopian seem strange. My thesis is that phenomenology can be seen as a utopian tradition but that some account must be given that demonstrates this connection to the utopian. In particular, I argue that Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology provides an understanding of the utopian, which I call a non-conventional view, that is vastly different from the one assumed by most when they see or hear the word "utopian," which I lable conventional. I show that such a non-conventional understanding can be developed in a way that neither requires us to view the utopian solely as opposed to finitude and contingency, nor a form of thought and action from which we necessarily need to dissociate ourselves. It is this non-conventional view of the utopian that in the end enables us to understand how Continental philosophy in general and phenomenology in particular are important bearers of the utopian demand that things be otherwise.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20011066<br>
Date: 1 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Vinyard Dana<br>
Abstract: This paper provides a phenomenological account of the writing of a young woman diagnosed with schizophrenia. The method of interpretation is to put ourselves in the place of the author drawing upon a combination of sympathy, reason, common-sense, experience, and "an intersubjective world, common to us all" (Schutz, 1945: 536). The result is the recognition of the person as also capable of putting herself in the place of others so as to understand their behavior. This "role-taking success" identifies the limits of the current sociological understanding of insanity's significance in social interaction as an instance of "role-taking failure" (Rosenberg, 1992).<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20011143<br>
Date: 4 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Brockelman Paul<br>
Abstract: The new scientific cosmology which has emerged over the past forty years seems to be forcing philosophers and theologians alike to rethink the traditional theistic conception of God in which God is pictured as a First Cause designer of the universe in favor of what Joseph Campbell more mystically calls an "immanent ground of being, transcendent of conceptualization." The central thrust of these reflections is that we encounter that "immanent ground of being" through the experience of wonder and awe. Since actual experience is involved, then a phenomenological description of exactly what it is in the new cosmology (and the universe) which induces such wonder is possible. The basic thesis is that we experience wonder in the face of the remarkable and transcendent (beyond finite predicates and understanding) coming-into-being of nature over twelve to fifteen billion years. Wonder is the human reaction to and appreciation for the astounding fact that nature and all of its parts actually are. It is; we are; such is the ineffable beyond in our midst.<br>

Author(s): Hahm Chaibong<br>
Abstract: This paper reflects on the implications of postmodern political discourse for East-Asian politics. It argues that the postmodernist deconstruction of modern epistemology and politics provides an opportunity for the reappraisal and rehabilitation of Confucianism in East Asia. First, the paper begins with an account of Cartesian epistemology which undergirds the liberal conceptions of selfhood and politics. Second, it provides a brief history of the Neo-Confucian synthesis and the resulting epistemology based on an intersubjective and ethical understanding of being human. Third, it gives an account of how East Asian thinkers have until recently tried to overcome Confucianism as a way of achieving modernity. Fourth, it attempts to show how the Heideggerian deconstruction of Cartesian epistemology reveals the intersubjective and ethical nature of Dasein which allows for a reevaluation of Confucianism. Fifth, this paper describes earlier attempts by East Asians to go beyond modernity and the way they have led to detrimental consequences. It concludes that the current debate should proceed with a more careful and balanced consideration of both modernity and Confucianism.<br>

Author(s): Vion Antoine<br>
Abstract: Town twinning can be seen as the first activity to involve municipal institutions as such in wide-ranging and long-term international action. Twinning fits Eric Hobsbawm's definition of an 'invented tradition'. The French federalists played a decisive part in this process of invention, bringing European municipalities together in order to ensure an eventual European political union. Before long, however, the so-called bilingualist movement also turned to twinning as a way to further a universal mutual understanding that transcended the East-West divide. This resulted in a big clash between the French twinning organisations. Thus, the invention of town twinning needs to be studied alongside the dynamic political tensions that emerged on the French political scene during the Cold War. /// Les jumelages urbains peuvent être considérés comme la première activité à impliquer les institutions municipales en tant que telles dans une action internationale de grande ampleur et de long terme. Le jumelage est un de ces 'traditions inventées' définies par Eric Hobsbawm. Les Fédéralistes français jouèrent un rôle décisif dans cette invention, qui regroupa un nombre important de municipalités européennes dans la perspective de construire l'union politique de la région. Très vite, des mouvements et définitions concurrentes se mirent en place, notamment avec le 'mouvement bilingue' qui s'empara des jumelages pour en faire l'outil d'une compréhension universelle qui aurait transcendé la division Est-Ouest. Une 'guerre des jumelages' fit rage pendant plusieurs années sur la scène française, guerre dont la compréhension appelle à l'inscription de ses enjeux dans le contexte de la Guerre Froide, et dont le déroulement participe de la dynamique de cette période. /// Städtepartnerschaften können als erster Versuch, städtische Institutionen in weiterreichende und dauerhafte internationale Aktivitäten einzubeziehen, gesehen werden.

Issue: i20099867<br>

Abstract: Aleksej Losev's definition of myth centres on the concept of detachment. In modern times detachment has most often figured in the context of philosophical aesthetics, where it is a cognitive category akin to Kant's "disinterestedness" or the Russian formalists' "estrangement." However Losev's usage also makes reference to the ontological sense of detachment as contemplative ascent (cf. Meister Eckhardt's "Abgeschiedenheit"). Thus, Losev's concept of myth combines both senses of detachment, binding perceptual attitude and being together in a double movement of resignation from the world and union with meaning; this movement literally makes sense out of reality. It therefore bears comparison to the treatment of distanciation in contemporary hermeneutics, where detachment is a key condition of understanding. By investigating Losev's connections to other Russian thinkers, the author makes a case for a distinct Russian tradition of hermeneutic philosophy (V. Ivanov, G. Shpet, A. Bakshy, A. Losev).<br>

Author(s): Prendeville Brendan<br>
Abstract: Painting is a mute art, abstract painting conspicuously so; how might its meanings be constituted in acts of painting and looking, respectively, without explicit and articulate guidance, always assuming that such meanings are not arbitrary? How might we identify these meanings, other than through 'reading' or decoding? Agnes Martin's work of the New York years suggests particular ways of answering such questions. Crucial factors are: the practical rather than axiomatic or geometric character of Martin's grids; the perceptual instability of her work; the 'dissonance' between rectangle and square, field and frame; the bodily address of the work; Martin's aspiration to make a new American art. Circumstantially important are the close friendships among the artists at Coenties Slip, as interpreted in photographs by Hans Namuth, and the marginal and temporary status of the loft community, set in the shadow of Wall Street, as viewed in the context of urban development. The argument is that the ethos of friendship and temporary community was particularly important in the formation of Martin's work, and helps in understanding the terms of our encounter with it. Here it is essential to recogn3ize the difference in historical situation between painter and viewer -- these indeed being works in respect to which situatedness is acutely felt. The argument is sustained with reference to: the phenomenology of embodied perception and tacit understanding (Todes and Merleau-Ponty); the dialectic between self-definition and subjection to power (Foucault); Gertrude Stein's modernism and "The Making of Americans".<br>

Abstract: Working-class people perform class identities. These performances are marked with ironies in which working class symbolizes power and powerlessness. Such performances elide linear meaning-making in favor of poetic paradox and help us understand the contradictions of working-class life. "The New Deal," a chapbook by my great-grandfather, represents an occasion for understanding how one working-class person used language to consider his life's contradictions. The chapbook articulates a unique "working-class poetics" and suggests why rhetoricians ought to locate representations of the paradoxes of working-class life.<br>

Abstract: One of the most prominent features of the Irish landscape is the great multitude of megalithic sites which date back to the Neolithic. In this paper, I will attempt to demonstrate that the understanding of these sites in Ireland can be enhanced by referencing the native tradition, including the Irish word for the sites, sí, and the sí's powerful cultural tradition attested to throughout native Irish folklore, literature, onomastics, and traditional knowledge. In doing so, I will explore the difficulties and the potentials of interdisciplinary communication between archaeology and folkloristics, and the related issues regarding communication between official and unofficial discourses.<br>

Abstract: This article seeks to explore the act of reading as an essential element of notated musical practices and of the construction of knowledge about them. By examining how musical notations affect their reader-performers (and vice versa) in two different musical contexts in Japan--the Kyoto Gion festival and amateur lessons on the nohkan flute--the article draws attention to the ways in which the act of reading notation is central to the construction of knowledge about such musical practices. With reference to Etienne Wenger's notion of learning as a process of alignment, and to debates in the anthropology of reading, it then argues that, for learners of these musics, reading notations is a practice of reverse tracing towards the bodily practices of the accomplished. In discussing the musicians' concern for the efficacy of reading as a means of achieving a relevant state of understanding, the article also addresses questions on the role of reading as a method of becoming knowledgeable in the practice of anthropological inquiry.<br>

Abstract: As a tool for understanding the world in which we live the study of the history of political thought is stunted because of a preoccupation with the Western canon as the history of political thought to the exclusion of other histories and traditions. This ongoing exclusion is itself facilitated by a deeply entrenched select reading of the Western canon; a reading that overlooks a tendency within the canon to not just ignore but suppress and dismiss the value of other accounts of history and traditions of thought. An opening of the Western mind to these assumed to be alien traditions of social, legal and political thought reveals that, in the global market place of ideas, these purportedly competing and non-compatible traditions of thought might in fact have considerably more in common than what sets them apart: thus opening the way for an authentic inter-civilisational dialogue that focuses more on co-operation and less on clashes.<br>

Abstract: Euro-American theories of psychotherapeutic intervention focus on therapist behavior or the therapeutic relationship, conceived in dyadic terms. The cultural prototype is individualistic and rationalistic: a one-to-one conversation in which the patient discloses and discusses innermost feelings in regular office visits. This may be appropriate for modern Euro-Americans. However, anthropological research finds that in many traditional healing systems, intervention is communal, it utilizes dramatic ritual ordeals and altered states of consciousness rather than rational conversations, and the healer-patient relationship may be less central. This article argues that the latter approach is not ignorant of psychotherapeutic principles; it has its own (however opposed to Euro-American assumptions they may be). Understanding this paradigm clash broadens our understanding of what psychotherapeutic intervention is. It also allows clinicians and policy makers to support traditional peoples in their own efforts at self-healing. Examples will be drawn from the author's work on the healing ceremonies of the Native American Church among contemporary Navajos.<br>

Abstract: Dopo un periodo, negli anni Sessanta e Settanta, in cui la fortuna di Lovejoy sembrò
declinare, lo studioso è tornato d'attualità negli anni Ottanta, con la ripresa della di-
scussione teorica intorno alia storia intellettuale. Nel 1987 il «Journal of the History of
Ideas» dedicò un numero per celebrare il mezzo secolo della Great Chain of Being, con
articoli di D.J. Wilson, G. Gordon-Bournique, E.P. Mahoney, F. Oakley e Melvin Ri-
chter (cfr. Lovejoy, «The Great Chain of Being» and the History of Ideas, in «Journal of
the History of Ideas», 48, 2, 1987). Contributi importanti sono inoltre venuti da Donald
R. Kelley, Tattuale editor del «Journal». Tra questi citiamo D.R. Kelley, Horizons of In-
tellectual History: Retrospect, Circumspect, Prospect, in «Journal of the History of Ideas»,
48, 1, 1987, pp. 143-169; e, sempre di Kelley, What is happening to the History of Ideas?,
in «Journal of the History of Ideas», 51, 1990, pp. 3-25. Proprio quest'ultimo articolo
rappresenta a tutt'oggi uno dei piú equilibrad tentativi di bilancio della history of ideas,
e al tempo stesso una meditazione sui futuro della disciplina da parte di uno degli «ere-
di» di Lovejoy. Significativamente Kelley propone di utilizzare Tespressione intellectual
history, e non piú history of ideas, proprio a voler allontanare i «fantasmi» di idealismo
impliciti nella scelta di fare della storia della filosofia il referente privilegiato della di-
sciplina (un'attitudine che era certamente di Lovejoy). Intellectual history è secondo Kel-
ley «doing a kind, or several kinds, of historical interpretation, in which philosophy and
literature figure not as controlling methods but as human creations suggesting the con-
ditions of historical understanding» [What is happening, cit., p. 18). L'approccio inter-
disciplinare, che era stato uno dei punti centrali del programma lovejoyano, rimane an-
cor oggi secondo Kelley valido, anche se ciò non deve significare Tadozione di strumenti
critici «alla moda» propri~<br>

Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between the new comparative theology and the theology of religions in light of their common genealogy in the comparative theology of the late nineteenth century. Noting that the latter's blindness to its considerable biases was sustained by its oppositional relationship with the exclusionary apologetic theology of the day, the paper argues that the new comparative theology risks repeating the same pattern of self-deception when it dichotomizes its relationship with the theology of religions. At the same time, however, the new comparative theology, by openly acknowledging its theological commitments, strips the comparative method of the aura of "science" which has often functioned ideologically to mask bias. In this way, the new comparative theology exemplifies the recent shift in the understanding of comparison from a method of discovery to a critical method for the testing and revision of the categories through which scholars interpret their data.<br>

Abstract: At its most a typical sports narrative records what happens in space and time. Alongside this traditional history of events there has emerged a research approach that might be called structural sports history. Its methods move in the world under the surface of facts, explored by researchers in ways that resemble archaeology. The aim is to uncover the changed human relationships and new forms of presence in sport-figurations of corporeality, space and time. Where the event-history approach recounts and recapitulates, the new approach works towards interpretation and understanding. These two are joined by yet a third element, the most intimate aspect of sports narratives: microhistory and the routes that it opens to the interfaces between the public and the private and the general and the particular, where the reader-oriented focus of the experiencing and narrating subject is necessarily foregrounded and at this point surface such elements of narrativity as the "confessional", the "meditative" and the "fragmentary" (auto)biography. The article describes different levels of a sports narrative and their conventions in qualitative sports research.<br>

Article Title: The Making of a Social Theory: Anthony Giddens' Theory of Structuration<br>
Publisher: North Central Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i20831390<br>
Date: 4 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Dickie-Clark Hamish F.<br>
Abstract: In this paper I try to show what kind of theory Giddens' theory of structuration is. I do so by first listing what Giddens accepts and what he rejects in his assessments of functionalism, hermeneutics, structuralism, and the writings of Marx. For what I think are good reasons, most of this part is given over to the use Giddens makes of Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy. Next I set out my understanding of Giddens' view of theory as primarily concerned "with reworking conceptions of human being and human doing, social reproduction and social transformation" (Giddens 1984:xx). I seek to show the crucial implications of this for the way that theory enters directly into and helps to consitute social life. Taken together, these two steps lead to the conclusion that Giddens' theory is neither an attempt at an over-arching "Grand Theory," nor an imposition of new orthodoxy in place of the old. Instead I suggest that his avowed eclecticism is closely akin to the hermeneutic goal contained in Gadamer's concept of the "fusion of horizons." This notion recognizes the never-to-be-completed, but basic, human activity of creatively questioning what has been handed down from the past. It is questioned so that it may be applied — incomplete as it is — to the changed situation of the present with its different interests and problems. That those who can and do question it are themselves the products of past tradition, calls for a kind of social theory that is in some ways different from that modeled on the explanatory "laws" of natural science. I contend that Giddens' theory of structuration is such a theory. (For an introductory overview of the theory itself, see Dickie-Clark, 1984).<br>

Abstract: In many parts of the world, excavations of British military sites have unearthed material reflecting lifeways in the British Empire. Specifically, studies of historical ceramics and glass have greatly advanced our understanding of status and material expression. This study highlights the current body of knowledge on British military crested ceramics, contrasting the rarity of archaeological finds with their abundance in documentary sources. An elemental stylistic analysis reveals that these crests expressed regimental affiliation as the fundamental unit of self-identification. Symbolic interpretation of these crests stresses their active role in the socialization of officers and structuring collective memory, particularly through the mess institution.<br>

Article Title: Being `rasikas': the affective pleasures of music and dance spectatorship and nationhood in Indian middle-class modernity<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i23011419<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Ram Kalpana<br>
Abstract: The long-standing dominance of history in the adjudication of debates on postcolonialism and modernity in India has resulted in the relegation of the knowledge claims of `classical' performance traditions and aesthetic concepts to the domain of the essentializing and the untrustworthy. This paper argues that performances of music and dance have preserved an understanding of tradition that is more dynamic and agential than that put forward by nationalist understandings of tradition, and that aesthetic conceptions continue to illuminate the values and efficacy of these practices in engaging the affects of spectators. The paper explores in particular the subject position of the rasika as offering a distinctive way of inhabiting the present. The class privilege implicit in being able to take up such an invitation is explored in the second part of the paper. La longue domination de l'histoire dans l'orientation des débats sur le post-colonialisme et la modernité en Inde a relégué les prétentions au statut de savoir des arts performatifs et des concepts esthétiques « classiques » au domaine des choses essentialisantes et peu fiables. Le présent article fait valoir que les performances de musique et de danse ont préservé une compréhension de la tradition plus dynamique et agentielle que celle mise en avant dans les interprétations nationalistes, et que les conceptions esthétiques continuent de mettre en lumière les valeurs et l'efficacité de ces pratiques en faisant appel aux affects des spectateurs. L'article explore en particulier la position de sujet du rasika comme une manière différente d'habiter le présent. Le privilège de classe, implicite dans la possibilité d'accepter une telle invitation, est exploré dans la deuxième partie de l'article.<br>

Author(s): Marks Susan<br>
Abstract: Tannaitic rabbis permit wedding processions but prohibit practices associated with these festivities, including the wearing of bridal crowns. Studies of rabbinic ritual based on social scientific models have overlooked the historical disjunction between Tannaitic and Amoraic evidence for weddings. This study explores this puzzling combination of prohibitions and permissions by making use of Catherine Bell's discussion of ritualization. Attention to practice as outlined by Bell leads to a renewed focus on the textual framing of Tannaitic discourse concerning wedding processions. This focus in turn leads to the recognition that the early rabbis create their own vision of wedding practice through negotiating their own historic moment—end-times. The larger eschatological context explored at the end of Sotah with its talk of extreme ascetic responses to end-times provides a framework for understanding Sotah's limited prohibitions concerning wedding processions and reveals a compromise reached by the various agents that remains otherwise obscured.<br>

Abstract: What role do emotions play in the way in which young people confront the history of the Holocaust? This article examines memorial sites and video interviews of survivors as interfaces of the representation and appropriation of the past. These contact zones satisfy the need for emotional participation and for information. Videos uploaded by youngsters on the internet following their visit to memorial sites, and short films extracted by pupils from survivor's video interviews, were used as examples in order to examine emotional strategies. These products of involvement point to stored images and ideas mediated by mass media. This repertoire of cultural knowledge and feelings can serve as a template for understanding how young people process the Holocaust emotionally.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Scott Bede<br>
Abstract: This article explores the crisis initiated by colonial modernity in Naguib Mahfouz's 1947 novel Midaq Alley. I begin by discussing the significance of anger within the narrative, arguing that this dominant structure of feeling could be read as a collective response to wider social and historical forces. In other words, rather than understanding emotion as the "subjective property" of the individual, I regard it here as a relational practice embedded within and determined by quite specific sociocultural circumstances. I then proceed to discuss the role of rumour in the novel and the significance of its pronounced melodramatic qualities. In the first case, I shall argue, the circulation of rumour provides a way of containing or quarantining the negative feelings produced by modernity, while also reinforcing the boundaries of a community facing the very real possibility of its own demise. In the second case, I would like to suggest that the narrative's tendency to privilege the melodramatic mode creates a sense of social order and moral intelligibility by channelling these feelings into a stable and predictable generic structure. This latter project is ultimately frustrated, however, when the forces of evil emerge to destroy the novel's principle representative of virtue.<br>

Issue: i23072521<br>

Author(s): Sabloff Jeremy A.<br>
Abstract: This study builds on the premise that local knowledge of limestone—and its workable characteristics—was foundational to landscape inhabitation in the Puuc region of Yucatán, México. Classic Maya architecture of the northern Yucatán generally is considered to represent the apogee of Maya construction prowess with extensive use of core-veneer masonry and the creation of tall, wide corbelled vaults. Less commonly discussed is the variable distribution of high-quality limestone across the Yucatán, the social matrix that undergirds the quarrying, transporting, and working of limestone, and the pronounced social differences materialized in stone architecture. This study explores these three topics by bringing to bear Yucatec Mayan linguistic evidence and excavation data from the archaeological site of Sayil, in the hilly Puuc region of Yucatán. That information provides a basis for understanding the development of a sprawling residential complex, the role that variable limestone quality played in its expansion, and serves as an index of intra-compound social difference. Late additions to the dwellings indicate that recognition of the cultural value of carved stone persisted long after masonry skills became attenuated. The durability of stone renders it a particularly effective—if underutilized—medium for interpreting social landscapes of the past. Este estudio amplifica la premisa de que el conocimiento de la piedra caliza—y sus propiedades arteseanales—fue una base fundamental para la ocupación del paisaje de la Región Puuc, Yucatán, México. En general, la arquitectura de los mayas de la época Clásica del norte de Yucatán se considera representativa del apogeo de su proeza arquitectónica con el uso extensivo de núcleos de piedra burda recubiertos de piedra labrada y la creación de habitaciones con bóvedas altas y anchas. Menos mencionados son la distribución geográfica variable de piedra caliza de alta calidad a través de Yucatán, la matriz social que permite la explotac~<br>

Abstract: Alvin Gouldner's life and work is considered within the framework of his own attempt to fashion a reflexive sociology during the second half of his career. In the first half, Gouldner was a functionalist and dutifully contributed insights and theoretical innovations to the paradigm, even while remaining critical of Talcott Parsons' own version of structural-functionalism. Later, by 1962, Gouldner broke from the dominant tradition to become an outspoken critique of establishment sociology, in the process becoming more sympathetic to competing theories, especially Marxism. Eventually, Marxism, too, was found to be inadequate because of its lack of reflexivity, and Gouldner became further alienated from both traditions of sociology. Concomitantly, Gouldner was battling on personal and professional fronts in his role of social critic. He became increasingly hostile toward others for their willing compliance with prevailing cultural prescriptions, which he believed were robbing human beings of their agency, vitality, and will to power. Lacking authentic knowledge of oneself, one could not hope to create social theories which benefited society and contributed to the liberation of the human spirit. Gouldner was a tragic hero, for although he came to an understanding of the limitations of human strivings in creating socially beneficial social theory, and fought valiantly to establish a program to fill this lacuna, he ultimately failed to deliver upon the promise of these insights because of his own hubris (on the personal front) and the internal paradoxes of reflexive sociology (on the professional front).<br>

Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining~<br>

Abstract: Social scientific explanations of the role of European law associations in the making of a new European legal order argue that they were critical in empowering the European Court of Justice and defining the results of European legal integration. However, these approaches fail to highlight the complex context in which these associations evolved. By exploring the history of the French Association des juristes européens from 1951 to 1970 on the basis of comprehensive archival material, this paper provides a more contextualised understanding of what appears as a struggle with limited impact on the French reception of European law. La recherche en sciences sociales sur le rôle d'associations nationales de juristes et de leur fédération dans l'élaboration d'un nouvel ordre juridique européen soutient qu'elles contribuèrent fortement à l'essor d'un droit spécifiquement européen. Néanmoins, cette recherche échoue à mettre en évidence la complexité du contexte dans lequel ces associations se sont développées. Fondé sur une documentation d'archives très complètes sur les premières années d'existence de l'Association française des juristes européens, cet article permet de mieux saisir les difficultés d'une lutte à l'effet limité sur la réception en France d'un droit fondamentalement européen entre 1951 et 1970. Sozialwissenschaftliche Erklärungen zur Rolle europäischer juristischer Vereinigungen beim Aufbau einer neuen europäischen Rechtsordnung argumentieren, dass sie beim Ermächtigen des Europäischen Gerichtshofs und Definieren der Ergebnisse der europäischen Rechtsintegration entscheidend gewesen seien. Doch diese Ansätze beleuchten nicht die komplexen Umstände, unter denen sich diese Vereinigungen entwickelt haben. Diese Studie untersucht die Geschichte der französischen Association des juristes européens von 1951 bis 1970 auf der Grundlage umfassender Archivunterlagen und vermittelt dadurch ein kontextualisierteres Verständnis dessen, was als Kampf mit begrenzten Auswirku~<br>

Abstract: Derrida and Foucault provide key starting points to understanding archives. They see archives as hegemonic, characterizing ways of thought, modes of colonization, and the control of citizens. However, they also make clear that archives can be read subversively. With patience, counter-readings allow the excavation of the voices (sometimes names) of subaltern and otherwise suppressed others from the archive. By reading along and across the archival grain, researchers can follow the development of ideas and processes across historical periods. Archives can be seen as orphanages, containing surrogates of performances. Archives (paper and digital) also provide access to the results of anthropological research in ways mandated by ethics codes, but these are subject to controversy. What sorts of consent and what sorts of anonymization should be provided? Archives run by the groups traditionally studied by anthropologists provide models of radical archives that are very different from those conceived of by traditional archivists.<br>

Abstract: The narrativist turn of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the discussion of general history. With the rejection of Rankean historical realism, the focus shifted to the historian as a narrator and on narratives as literary products. Oddly, the historiography of science took a turn in the opposite direction at the same time. The social turn in the historiography of science emphasized studying science as a material and practical activity with traceable and documentable traits. This empirization of the field has led to an understanding that history of science could be directly describable from scientific practice alone without acknowledging the role of the historian as a constructor of narratives about these practices. Contemporary historians of science tend to be critical of science's ability to describe its object—nature, as it is—but they often are not similarly skeptical of their own abilities to describe their object: past science, as it is. I will argue that historiography of science can only gain from a belated narrativist turn.<br>

Abstract: Remonstrances (jian ﻿諫) reveal a great deal about the writing of history in China during the Eastern Zhou. As represented in the Zuozhuan and Guoyu, remonstrances, like other speeches, are normally delivered in court and address questions of official policy. They tend to test contemporary phenomena against the lessons of the past, especially as those lessons have been formulated in the Shijing, the Shangshu, aphorisms, and other forms of what I term "inherited speech." Remonstrances also have the support of the third-person historical narrative which surrounds them; the ruler who ignores a remonstrance always suffers for his obstinacy. After briefly discussing the importance of speeches in the Zuozhuan and Guoyu, I outline the structure of a remonstrance and examine four passages in which critical speech, including remonstrance, is said to have circulated freely in the courts of an idealized early period. Next I show how remonstrances match observed historical particulars with fragments of inherited speech. The famous remonstrance of Gong zhi Qi, an exemplary episode, shows how this application of inherited speech guides rhetorical choices and establishes Traditionalist or Confucian terms as the keys to historical intelligibility. Finally, I examine a set of remonstrances which are exceptional in that they do not include overt citations of inherited speech. Among these, military remonstrances can genuinely eschew explicit citation of lessons of the past, while others borrow the authority of inherited speech without seeming to do so. In one case, a brief remonstrance has apparently acquired the status of an aphorism, so that already when it is first uttered it qualifies as a sort of inherited speech. In another case, a precursor of the indirect remonstrances (fengjian ﻿諷諫) of later periods, remonstrators use a theatrical combination of actions and speech to criticize their superior's departure from correct ways.

Abstract: Nietzsche's impact on educational thought has always been surprisingly neglected, possibly because it is hard to divorce his educational views from his philosophical endeavour, as a whole which has given rise to considerable scholarly polemics during the last few decades. Recently several articles propagating various interpretations of Nietzsche's educational teaching have been published Their main weakness lies in the fact that Nietzsche's central educational theses are discussed quite apart from his "psychological" philosophy, while it is the philosophy that serves as the necessary background for understanding those theses. The present paper, mainly analyzing nietzsche's essay "Schopenhauer as Educator", will attempt to provide a better insight into Nietzsche's early psychological and pedagogic thought. It will also demonsrate those basic criteria implicit in his method of psychologization, which at the very outset had served Nietzsche as an educational means of testing the integrity of certain examplary personalities. Nietzsche's Educational Thought is established in the service of authenticity — a central and influential Existentialist concept, the main ideas of which are explicated in the paper. Another Nietzschean concept, much negleted yet significant, that of the "Higher-Self", is elaborated and compared to Freud's parallel notion of the "Super-Ego".<br>

Abstract: Jacques Derrida's deconstructionism has influenced some American shools of literary criticism which aim at abolishing the distinction between literary and philosophical texts and, at the same time, deconstructing the text from its inherent meaning. If no text has any determined meaning, every interpretation is as correct as any other. This article examines some tenets of Derrida and his followers, especially their definitions of the words understanding, interpretation, and difference. It finds some surprizing affinities between Kant's formalistic esthetics and certain formalistic trends in modern criticism, in particular the concept of autonomy, which implies, in deconstructionism, the uniqueness of every text. However, if so, every reading is inevitably a 'misreading' or 'misinterpretation' thereof. This has led to the paradoxical and unwarranted conclusion that reading is impossible... The article questions some eccentric implications of this paralogism, for example, if no text is readable, does this apply to Derrida's writings as well? The article also calls attention to some interesting concepts of Jewish Kabala and of 'negative theology', which bear a striking resemblance to certain of Derrida's and other deconstructionists' ideas. Without diminishing the importance of Derrida's philosohpical work or the contribution of deconstructionism to modern hermeneutics, this article refutes certain nihilistic claims of the 'deconstructors' regarding philosophical hermeneutics and literary criticism.<br>

Author(s): Lévy Jacques<br>
Abstract: Innovante en apparence dans son énoncé, la géographie culturelle pose un double problème épistémologique. D'abord, s'agit-il d'une nouvelle branche de la géographie ou d'une école de pensée qui prétend réorganiser l'ensemble des savoirs de la discipline? Le projet d'une géographie culturelle reprend et endosse les ambiguïtés du mot « culture » dans les sciences sociales contemporaines. Ensuite, le mot « culture » correspond le plus souvent à une version faible de la notion de société, en particulier dans les travaux anglophones. Cette géographie, qui aborde les sociétés sans le dire clairement, a-t-elle forgé de nouveaux outils pour explorer la dimension spatiale de ces sociétés? Si le « tournant culturel » a certainement contribué à faire avancer notre regard sur le monde social dans certains domaines, la réponse à cette question n'est pas toujours consistante. Au bout du compte, deux caractéristiques, qui pouvaient paraître périphériques, se révèlent essentielles pour éclairer les logiques de ces hésitations. L'une, théorique, concerne la mise en place éventuelle d'un paradigme du social qui se passerait d'un concept de société. L'autre, effet pratique du premier, concerne l'usage de discours universitaires prétendant fonder le « multiculturalisme » sur le respect des « cultures » pour légitimer le communautarisme contre la « société des individus ». Cultural geography proposes an apparently innovative project but it actually raises a dual epistemological issue. First of all, is it a new field inside geography or a school of thought that contends to redesign the overall geography's disciplinary layout? The perspective of a "cultural geography" encompasses and endorses the ambiguity of the word "culture" in contemporary social sciences. Secondly, "culture" is predominantly used as a weak version of "society", namely in English-speaking literature. Cultural geographers address societies but do not explicitly admit it. Have cultural geographers built fresh tools to e~<br>

Abstract: In this article, an attempt is made to relate the "intuitive" classical phenomenology of Gerardus van der Leeuw and the neo-phenomenology of Jacques Waardenburg. An outline of van der Leeuw's methodology is presented along with a summary of Waardenburg's critique. An account is then given of Waardenburg's alternative approach. When the two methodologies are juxtaposed, two points of convergence emerge. The first relates to the nonempirical nature of meanings; the second relates to the need to reconstitute the believer's world in order to gain understanding of phenomena. Discussion suggests that both methodologies entail the combined use of Erklären ['explanation'] and Verstehen ['understanding'] in explicating meanings. The conclusion is ventured that neo-phenomenology can be plausibly viewed as a modification of van der Leeuw's approach which is distinguished by greater hermeneutical sensitivity.<br>

Author(s): Ross Susan A.<br>
Abstract: IN THIS ESSAY I CONSIDER POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF FEMINIST THEOLogy to theological aesthetics and ethics by comparing the work of Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905—88), the predominant figure in theological aesthetics, with that of Elizabeth Johnson and Sallie McFague. Balthasar's emphasis on contemplation and obedience in response to the unexpected revelation of God's glory contrasts with the practicality, mutuality, and creativity of feminist theological ethics. On the other hand, feminist theology's emphasis on appropriate language and images for God suggests an implicit aesthetics. The artistic work of contemporary African women in crisis situations sheds further light on both Balthasar and feminist theology and brings into relief the relationship of beauty and justice. Although Balthasar's emphasis on the transcendent glory of God may leave him with an undeveloped ethics, feminist theology's agent-oriented approach could benefit from greater attention to contemplation and a transformed understanding of obedience. These conclusions urge greater appreciation and development of the aesthetic and imaginative dimensions of feminist theological ethics.<br>

Abstract: IN THIS ESSAY I EXPLORE THE WAYS IN WHICH OBEDIENCE TO AUTHORITY functions as a moral norm in evangelical ethics, with the potential of constraining and even endangering the multifaceted nature of Christian morality. I consider two particular sources of moral authority in evangelicalism: the Bible and leaders. I discuss the reasons and ways in which obedience to these two sources of moral authority functions in evangelical ethics and provide an ethical critique to these two moral norms and ethical practices. My primary aim is to expand an understanding of Christian morality that takes seriously the narrative dimensions of Christian ethics, conscience formation, moral agency, and skills in moral discernment.<br>

Abstract: The author studies systematically the internal criteria which he considers most valid, in so far as they are critically established, for providing access through the gospels to Jesus and for guaranteeing the historical authenticity of his life and message. After placing the problem of establishing valid criteria (la critériologie) in the context of the current critical study of the gospels and offering a number of critical observations designed to avoid confusions (especially the distinction between pure data, criteria and proof; between literary and historical criteria; between criteria and the intellectual attitudes that thereby follow), the author presents and discusses seven criteria which he groups under three headings: basic criteria (critères fondamentaux), dependent criteria (critères dérivés), and composite criteria (critères mixtes). Among the basic criteria he discusses: 1. the criterion of multiple testimony, together with the principal objection which can be raised against it, i.e. the extent to which one can speak of independent sources with regard to the gospels since all derive from oral tradition; 2. the criterion of discontinuity, considered on the levels of form and content; 3. the criterion of conformity (or of continuity or coherence), including the different formulations which contemporary exegetes propose, as well as its connections with the criterion of discontinuity; 4. the criterion of required explanation (explication nécessaire) or of sufficient reason for a group of convergent and well-attested facts. As an example of a dependent criterion called such since it is established in relation to the basic criteria, the author proposes the living, personal style of Jesus as distinguished from the gospels' literary style. Finally, among the composite criteria, that is to say the cases where an important literary characteristic is linked with one or several historical criteria, he mentions: the internal intelligibility of an account or of a group~<br>

Abstract: Freud's metapsychology, although it is not identical with the whole field of psychoanalytic psychology, originated under the controlling influence of a questionable positivistic model of science. The analysis begun in a previous study (Gregorianum, 61 [1980] 97-136) continues in this study of the relationship in Freud's thought between theory and empirical observation. We also treat the attempts by Freud and by the later neopositivist schools of classical ego-theory to articulate psychoanalytic insights about the person in terms taken from neurophysiology, biology, and classical mechanics. Such terms pervade the terminology used to express the metapsychological viewpoints, albeit in disharmonious juxtaposition with more specifically psychological terms. Freud's whole work was affected by his desire to propose psychoanalysis as a natural science on the model of the positivistic outlook of late nineteenth century Viennese physicalism. Opposition arose in the 1950s and 1960s to understanding psychoanalysis as a natural science, especially because of problems of conceptual definition, language, and verification or validation. Orthodox Freudians themselves were troubled by the problem of psychic energy and the discussion finally led to critical doubts about Freud's whole metapsychology. One reason was the dependence on a physical and mechanical model of science and on a neurophysiology no longer tenable. Other frames of reference in the exact sciences were sought, such as cybernetics and information theory, in an attempt to remain to some extent in harmony with the original epistemological ideology. There are those today who remain convinced that psychoanalysis is an exact science, and who in turn reject the different psychologies of understanding and the hermeneutical sciences. In the context of a basic-level discussion, this contribution explores, in their context, the principles of the worldview found at the most theoretical level of metapsychology. Among these, the p~<br>

Abstract: The relationship between Sören Kierkegaard and Johann Gottlieb Fichte has been a desideratum of philosophical inquiry for a considerable time. And this for two reasons: firstly, we do not know enough about Kierkegaard's relationship to German idealism, as long as we limit ourselves to the relationship of Kierkegaard-Hegel or Kierkegaard-Schelling. Secondly, there are quite a number of publications, which see in Fichte the most noteworthly intellectual relationship to Kierkegaard within the framework of idealism. It is necessary therefore to raise the following questions: what can we determine from the texts and historical material, which we possess, about Kierkegaard's relationship to Fichte? Is the opinion justified that Fichte is intellectually related to Kierkegaard? The present article's research gives the following answers to these questions: historically speaking there are again and again texts in which Kierkegaard relates to Fichte. Particulary for the early years, a certain occupation with him cannot be denied. As a matter of fact a whole series of formal agreements cannot be overlooked. Nevertheless there can be no question of a real meeting of minds. Fichte was merely an occasion for Kierkegaard to form his own philosophy, in no way however an intellectual partner. This historical result in no way excludes the possibility of comparing Kierkegaard and Fichte on the same intellectual level. Seen from this point of view there is actually a certain reason in establishing an intellectual relationship in the secondary literature. But nevertheless the differences outweigh the agreements. This can not only be ascertained fundamentally insofar as both come from a completely different understanding of reality, but also as regards their concept of subjectivity. Especially, as far as the structures, which ascertain the self-realization of the subjectivity, are concerned, the differences are particulary noticeable. With this result one does not however intend to say, t~<br>

Abstract: Between the sixties and the eighties metaphysics has been in a state of crisis; logic and the human sciences seemed to have taken over. The last few years have, however, witnessed a return of metaphysics. Having first called to mind some of the features of the aforetold crisis and evoked some recent authors, the article proceeds to show how reflexive metaphysics is capable of integrating the demands of the physical sciences and mathematics, and through them of building up the idea of being. A constitutive requirement of this idea is that epistemology and its categories of objectivity be surpassed through the affirmation of the other, whose existence and essence are the fundamental categories of transcendence. The ethical experience is surpassed in its turn, in such a way that through transcendence a fulness may manifest itself; the doctrine of analogy and the transcendentals opens the understanding of that fulness. Reflexive experience enlivens the discourse and ensures its exactness.<br>

Abstract: The present article considers the relationship between the understanding of the Word of God on the part of the Church and on the part of the individual theologian. The importance of written communication for this relationship is presented and analysed. The concept of body (corpus) is applied analogically to the Church and to texts of the Tradition. The author suggests that fruitful incorporation of theological texts into the corpus of the living texts of Christian faith actualizes and symbolises the integration of individual theological understanding with that of the Church. L'articolo considera la relazione della Chiesa da una parte e del teologo individuale da un'altra alla comprensione della Parola di Dio. Analizza l'importanza, per questo rapporto, della comunicazione scritta del lavoro teologico. Il concetto di corpo si applica analogicamente tanto alla Chiesa quanto ai testi scritti della Tradizione. L'incorporazione feconda del testo teologico nel corpus dei testi viventi della fede cristiana attualizza e simboleggia l'integrazione della comprensione del teologo individuale con quella della Chiesa.<br>

Abstract: Johann Georg Hamann saw the written word of God as the ultimate consequence of his incarnation. The biblical texts as well also carry the death of Christ in their essence as a figure of incarnation. Roland Barthes called the process of putting these texts into writing, by which the text gains autonomy in relation to the author, the "death of the author". In terms of the theology of the Holy Scriptures, this idea can be connected to the way people have been talking about the death of God in the modern age. One must however distinguish between the death of the author and the death of the text. This occurs when exegesis does not want to accept the death of the author. When however during reading there is a new understanding of biblical texts, this means to a certain extent their resurrection.<br>

Abstract: Biblical texts make demands which the reader cannot refrain from answering. In giving an answer, the reader should dare to say more than the text has already said and to take responsibility for this. This biblical demand forces us to understand by ourselves and does not offer the possibility of referring to something that is already understood. To understand a biblical text, one must therefore take the risk of misunderstanding. In view of this precarious freedom, the author shows that hermeneutical research is necessary in order to avoid accidents in understanding. We first see a text, then we read it and finally understand it by creating a "text world". Thus we can misunderstand a text if we don't see or read it correctly or if we miss the essence of the text. Any research on misunderstanding texts would have to deal with the relationship between the reader's own understanding and that which is not the reader's own. Understanding is not only what we understand, nor is it only understanding that which is foreign to us in a text, it is always both.<br>

Author(s): HAYS GEORGE<br>
Abstract: This article examines Campbell's concept of 'foreign policy' and its application to identifiers 'below' those utilized by Campbell. Campbell's discussion of 'foreign policy' at the level of the ruling elite, though perhaps necessary for the historical breadth of his analysis, provides a skewed and privileged understanding of both national identity and its creation. Through an analysis of 'foreign policy' at the sub-elite level, using the three versions of The Quiet American as illustrative examples, this article demonstrates that a separation of 'foreign policy' from Foreign Policy can yield multiple potentially conflicting national identities. While at times taking on the form of an argument ad absurdum, it is not the intent of this article to disprove Campbell's work. Rather, its intent is to use the concept of 'foreign policy' with a different level of identifier to demonstrate that the tenuousness and indefiniteness of national identity are actually greater than those proposed by Campbell.<br>

Abstract: »Die räumlichen und zeitlichen Schichten der Globalgeschichte: Überlegungen zu einer globalen Begriffsgeschichte anhand der Ausweitung von Reinhart Kosellecks Zeitschichten in globale Räume«. Recent debates on global history have challenged the understanding of history beyond the nation-state. Simultaneously, they search for non-Eurocentric approaches. This has repercussions on the relation between historical space and time in both historical interpretation and in research design. This article reflects on the possibilities of a global conceptual history by expanding Reinhart Koselleck's theory of temporal layers (Zeitschichten) into global spaces. To this end, it introduces the notion of spatial layers (Raumschichten). First, historicisation and its relation to and interaction with spatialisation and temporalisation is pondered; then, the impact of global spatial and temporal complexities on comparative and conceptual history is considered, before, thirdly, a framework of three tensions of global history - normative, temporal and spatial - is introduced as a way to concretely unfold historical research questions through global conceptual history. Regarding time and space, the main lines of argument in global history have focused either on the question of whether or not European powers were ahead of non-European ones or on the supposedly Western linearity of time as opposed to a non-Western cosmology or circularity of time. Taking its point of departure in Zeitschichten, which break from the linear-vs.-circular logic, this article instead proposes to foreground an actor-based, multi-lingual, global conceptual history to better understand spatio-temporal practices.<br>

Abstract: The antipositivist movement of the past two decades or so in economics, economic history, and history reveals the scope for a rapprochement, a growth of mutual respect and understanding, and perhaps even more active collaboration between the practitioners of these disciplines. The emergence of a more open-minded and flexible approach to economic methodology, and a more sophisticated awareness of the nature of historical explanation underlie this process. And the economists' increasing preoccupation with problems of time, expectations, uncertainty, and limited information provides substantive incentives for the widespread and varied efforts to break out of the confines of conventional static equilibrium theorizing.<br>

Abstract: This article attempts to refine the understanding of translation, thus contributing to evaluate its role in reception theory and in the history of ideas. A discussion of on the character, theories, and practices of translation in early-modern times is its entry point of analysis. During this period, what mattered in the first place was not the extent to which the translated text succeeded or failed in making the source text and its "original" ideas accessible in the target language, but rather the extent and the way in which the source text was instrumental in pursuing the agenda set by the translator or others in compliance with specific contexts. Such a perspective on translation seems also appropriate to current modes of inquiry for which translation is not an instance of inter-cultural communication, aiming to penetrate the Other in its fullness and make it intelligible in its otherness, but a communicative act whose purposes are predominantly intra-cultural and consist in supporting domestic agendas to which the translated text looks instrumental.<br>

Abstract: Present discourses on technology education are taking a positive and value-neutral approach with utilitarian and vocational overtones. The discourses generally lack discussions of human agency and human responsibility for techno-scientific activities and technological literacy. To support the emergence of a collective civic literacy, we argue in this text that technology education needs to take up critical and value-acknowledging aspects with emphasis on building sustainable relationships among human beings, technology, and lifeworld. To understand the relationship between human agency and modern technology, we examine the nature of technology in the dimensions of technology as causality and technology as a relationship of lifeworld. Discussing Martin Heidegger's perspectives on the causalities of technology, we question how the nature of technology situates human beings in power-related relationships to the world. Understanding technology as process and relationship of lifeworld, the paper extends its discussion of the responsibility of a dialectical human-technology-lifeworld relation based on a socio-technical and ethico-moral framework of technology. By recognizing human responsibility of and for modern technology, we outline a critical and reflective approach to technological literacy. The approach challenges the position of current approaches to technology in the attempt to provide a foundation for a contemporary pedagogy of technological awareness and values. Aujourd'hui, les discours en matière d'enseignement de la technologie sont en train de prendre une orientation positive et dépourvue de jugement de valeur comportant des connotations utilitaristes et professionnelles. En général, les discours n'ouvrent pas assez de discussions sur l'action humaine et la responsabilité humaine dans les activités technico-scientifiques et dans l'alphabétisme technologique. Dans ce papier, afin de renforcer l'éclosion de l'alphabétisme civique collectif, nous ouvrons le déb~<br>

Author(s): ANTHIAS FLOYA<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the concept of 'identity' is of limited heuristic value and proposes that it may instead be more useful to deploy the notion of narratives of location and positionality for addressing the range of issues normally thought to be about collective identity. Location and positionality (and translocational positionality) are more useful concepts for investigating processes and outcomes of collective identification — that is, the claims and attributions that individuals make about their position in the social order of things, their views of where and to what they belong (and to what they do not belong) as well as an understanding of the broader social relations that constitute and are constituted in this process. This enables a complete abandonment of the residual elements of essentialization retained even within the idea of fragmented and multiple identities so favoured by critics of unitary notions of identity. The article will draw on research into the ways in which experiences of 'race' and ethnicity were articulated in the narrations produced by British-born youngsters of Greek Cypriot background.<br>

Abstract: In order to manage our daily lives, we make many decisions based on empirical evidence derived from instrumental action. At the other extreme, we are often attracted by a so-called postmodern solution that invites us to make arbitrary choices. In the education system, the pressing dilemma should not be a choice between standards of competence or unthinking relativism, but how to take action towards intercultural tolerance. Establishing a small teacher training course for a group of British Muslims has shown that communicative action informed by understanding can be disabled by the instrumentality of positivist frameworks, such as those used by government inspectors. In philosophy, Ricoeur offers a provisional dialectic of hope that can be used to show why neither positivist methods, rational analytic philosophy, postmodernity nor any one belief system for interpreting the world should be allowed to exert hegemonic control. The ethicopractical philosophy of Ricoeur also offers a reconstructive view of reality that helps us to rehabilitate belief in human nature and encourages us to seek solutions to conflicts of interpretation in understanding others. It is applied, in this instance, to project work with Muslim women in the UK, in which an ontology of action shows the power of working collaboratively towards an understanding of oneself as another.<br>

Abstract: The current methods in psychoanalytic studies of God images and representations have focused almost exclusively on individual, internal processes. This article examines how psychological anthropologists go about formulating symbolic representations of deity in their research, in comparison with the object relations method of God-representations. Drawing on Melford Spiro's integrative proposal for interpreting the mental and collective representations in religious symbol systems, this paper proposes that there is a need for a comprehensive model of the representational process in the Eastern world in order to suit its cultural traditions. The author uses both theoretical and historical materials as well as personal narrative throughout its entirety to balance the two in a mutual and coherent flow of understanding. Noting the culturally patterned interactions with culturally postulated God-symbols, the object relations method of God-representations will be utilized to probe how God is both created and found on a collective (cultural) level as well as individual level.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917901<br>
Date: 6 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): LeBlanc John Randolph<br>
Abstract: Albert Camus's interrogation of the ethical and spiritual vacuity of the twentieth century convinced him that authentic political existence requires a vision that embraces while transcending the human condition. He found his ethical model in art. The work of the artist can be analogous to that of the just political actor. The principal components of ethical political being are all present in Camus's aesthetics: a vision of life in human community (lucidity), a grounded sense of justice subject to the limitations of human existence (beauty), a need to redress the defects of political reality (the urge to create), and an understanding that any structural solution is of necessity temporary (the need to rearticulate the initial vision). Camus's vision requires him to reject our positive political categories in the name of creative, grounded human being.<br>

Author(s): Loughlin Gerard<br>
Abstract: This essay argues for an understanding of the literal sense of Scripture after its diremption in the modern period between the written and the historical. It introduces John Spong as exemplary of a liberal tendency to disparage the literal, and Hans Frei as showing how the sensus literalis was, and may be again, found in the 'world' of the scriptural narrative, and how it came to be dirempted. Finally I argue that the literal sense of Scripture is locatable in the mutual constitution of Church and Scripture, of text and reading-community. The literal and historical are rebound insofar as the Church performs the letter of the text.<br>

Abstract: Examining the relevance of communitarian thought for feminist theory, this essay considers the idea of narrative identity in certain types of communitarianism and feminism. It claims that the particular way in which the idea of narrative identity is elaborated raises difficulties for a feminist understanding of gender identity. The syncretic and over generalised idea of narrative identity derived from communitarian thought ode snot adequately grasp important aspects of the ways in which gender inequalities are constructed.<br>

Author(s): Mei Todd S.<br>
Abstract: Is liability insurance simply a necessary evil in today's climate of litigation? Or does it have greater implications beyond its social and economic remit? In this article, I argue that when the insurance policy is viewed hermeneutically as a text, its negligence-based definition of action supplants the understanding of responsibility, therefore having theological and philosophical implications. Insurance, in this sense, comes 'in between' humanity and its relation to others and fundamental ontological questions concerning the meaning of uncertainty and suffering.<br>

Article Title: "Money is the Filial Child. But, at the same time, it is also the Enemy!": Korean Shamanic Rituals for Luck and Fortune<br>
Publisher: Institute for the Study of Religion<br>
Issue: i23942764<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Park Jun Hwan<br>
Abstract: In the world of Korean shamanism, there is a particular god, called taegam, which is allegedly famous for its love of money and its abundance of greed for material wealth. During the shamanic ritual of chaesu-kut, the rites for good fortune and luck, this god is popularly worshipped as the Deity of Wealth and is typically symbolized by money placed all over its face and spirit costumes. Nonetheless, as money has the two sides of heads and tails, taegam also has two very different faces—so-taegam and taegam. This article explores the ambiguity of the two taegam gods, focusing on the symbolic action of money-offerings and how its meaning is taken from the perspective of the ritual actors, in the hope of shedding light on the place of Korea's traditional popular religion of shamanism in today's transformed urban landscape. By discussing the semantics of "money is the filial child" (a remark made by so-taegam) and "money is the enemy" (as remarked by taegam), statements I often heard during my fieldwork in Seoul, I suggest that the ambivalent symbolic nature of taegam should be seen as an indispensible vehicle for understanding ritual life, as well as everyday life, of urban Korean people since it is closely related to both normative orientations and the contradictory aspects of the material culture of contemporary urbanites inhabiting the borderless, globalized, and fluctuating modern capitalist market. This conclusion is reached partly with reference to existing sociological theories of money and anthropological inquiries into the ambivalent aspects of taegam.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Picone Michelangelo<br>
Abstract: The problem that Petrarch's Canzoniere poses for the modern reader is the same as that posed by all collections of poems assembled by their author: it is a matter of understanding the connection between each of the poems and the collection, the relation between the whole and the parts. On the one hand, the collection presents a discontinuous series of poems composed separately that can be read as discrete works; on the other hand, the same poems come together as part of a love and/or existential story. Our task is to study the Canzoniere as a macrotext and to clarify the relation of each of the compositions to the collection of lyric verse to which it belongs. Petrarch's desperate attempt to complete his work is the same hopeless challenge that the mythical Arachne dared to make to Minerva. At the deepest level Petrarch reveals an awareness of the fact that every human endeavor is a spider's web that is woven in the course of a lifetime, and thus is never completed. The destiny of human beings therefore is to weave a tapestry that is never finished, just as the fate of the poet is to write an in-finite work; namely, a work that in the end can never reach the perfection and integrity of the divine work.<br>

Article Title: Bourdieu and Derrida on Gift: Beyond "Double Truth" and Paradox<br>
Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i24021505<br>
Date: 10 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Ungureanu Camil<br>
Abstract: Bourdieu and Derrida share a focus on the ambiguity of the practice of gift relationships already pointed out by Mauss. From Bourdieu's perspective, the question of gratuity is epistemically futile, as it veils the objective truth of gift-giving, yet ethically and politically relevant, as it refers to a hypocrisy which can be instrumental to enhancing civic virtue and solidarity. Bourdieu's "scientific humanism," however, implausibly reduces this ambiguity to interest maximization, and aims to build a solidaristic democracy by means of the generalization of the hypocrisy of gratuity. In turn, by interpreting gratuity as "unconditionality," Derrida aims not at dissolving, but at dramatizing the ambiguity of gift relationships by turning it into "madness" and an "impossible possibility". Whereas I agree with Derrida's insistence on the salience of the requirement of gratuity, his approach can lead to counterintuitive and hubristic consequences. Instead, I suggest some elements of an alternative way of understanding gratuitous gifts as communicative acts irreducible to an economic calculation or circle. From this standpoint, a gratuitous gift can be constituted by certain forms of recognition, emotions, or convictions without for that becoming an "impossibility".<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24046637<br>
Date: 9 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Souza lara<br>
Abstract: This article inquires as to the meaning of nervoso (nerves) among poor, working-class women from Salvador, Brazil. Our aim is to understand nerves as an experience that emerges from the background of a life trajectory and that, in many significant ways, disrupts the taken-for-granted character of that trajectory. From a phenomenological-hermeneutical tradition, we explore the links between experience, embodiment and temporality and then discuss the relevance of this approach for the understanding of women′s nervoso. In order to do so we present the life histories of three middle-aged women who have been afflicted with nerves. The accounts describe significant ways in which culturally inherited possibilities – grounded in a lived context of class and gender – are recovered and come to pre-figure a certain future. As we argue throughout the article, it is only when we situate the experience of nervoso within the temporal frame of life that we can truly understand it – that is, grasp it as part of a movement that involves both recovery and creation of meaning.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h~<br>

Author(s): Pellauer David<br>
Abstract: I offer some comments from the perspective of someone familiar with the work of Paul Ricoeur on Allan Bell's proposal that discourse studies take a hermeneutic turn drawing on Ricoeur's idea of an arc of interpretation. I suggest that such a hermeneutic turn would need to be more radical than Bell proposes in that he limits it largely to questions of method, without really addressing how it might affect our understanding of either the object of discourse studies or the goal of such studies. This does raise the question, however, whether discourse studies should be considered a subdiscipline of hermeneutical philosophy.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Scott-Baumann Alison<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Abstract: Text interpretation – the main interest of discourse analysts – is a central component of the text understanding process. In this article we introduce the Landscape Model, which describes the cognitive processes underlying reading comprehension in a detailed and precise manner. Moreover, this model captures the interpretative processes in which the human mind engages during reading. Within the context of the Landscape Model, we describe the relation between discourse understanding and discourse interpretation, and explain some of the phenomena that are central to the field of discourse analysis as seen from a cognitive perspective. In the first section we describe the basic cognitive processes that underlie discourse understanding, as captured by the Landscape Model. In the following section we illustrate the way that the Landscape Model can be applied to the work of discourse analysts. We conclude by discussing the usefulness of the cognitive Landscape Model for the field of discourse analysis.<br>

Abstract: The article calls attention to the role and function of exemplary "models", defined as evoking signs that move people to reflect their own values and orientations. It was Albert Bandura who first showed that human learning generally has the form of learning from models. Recent insights of neuroscience confirm and explain Bandura's theories: The human brain as a neuronal network estimates things according to similarities of their entire structure. Thus it can be called a "machine estimating structural connections". These insights can inspire moral theology: A concrete model can show the wide range of possibilities christian faith can open to believers. Christian tradition has always maintained this idea by understanding christian life as imitatio Christi. However, "imitatio" must be understood as the free and creative act of an autonomous subject.<br>

Abstract: The new theology of revelation in dealing with the inspiration of the Scriptures has to face the problem of time. Such a theory should neither be based on the concept of a pure „inspiration at the beginning“ nor on the „inspiration of the reader“. Whilst the former alone is unsatisfactory the latter would abandon the normativity of Scriptures and Tradition. By drawing on some ideas of Paul Ricoeur, the article develops an understanding of inspiration that is guided by the concept of „pneumatological passivity“. This pneumatological perspective enables under the aspect of time a „narrative“ understanding of the identity of the church.<br>

Nevertheless, an analysis of apparently forgotten Jewish treatises — most of which are to be found only in manuscript form — reveals that an extraordinary philosophical theory of Original Sin is present in late medieval Jewish thought. It implies, therefore, a new dimension in characterising this doctrine and has implications for the understanding of the process of inter-communicating of Jewish and Christian thought. This study focuses on fundamental Jewish passages, beginning with Apocalyptic literature and ending with medieval philosophical texts. Yet, the examination of those Hebrew texts is carried out in the light of the writing of Christian scholars. This means that the attempt to clarify this Jewish doctrine is made, from a methodological viewpoint, both by looking at the development of this doctrine trough the history of the Jewish thought, and by a close examination of the parallel general sources. It is only then that one can see that rudiments of the Christian doctrine of Original Sin were inserted into the Aristotelian theory of Nature, and combined with elements from Maimonides' Biblical-allegoric exegesis.<br>

Abstract: The article deals with the problem of revelation in Levinas' writings. The first part of the article analizes Levinas' ideas on the Same and the Other, more particularly the topics of the face and of discourse, as these come to the fore in the first section of Totality and Infinity. Investigating the non-totalising relationship between the Same and the Other presents us with the suitable framework for understanding the relation between the finite and the Infinite. Leaving out any ontotheological speech, Levinas shows how Metaphysics is enacted in the ethical relation. The second part cootinues with a description of Levinas' position on revelation in the Jewish tradition. The active Interpretation of Biblical texts "beyond the verse" represents an opportunity of hearing the divine word today and to enter into a more primordial Order than the Order of the Same. In the course of the article, we point to affinities and striking similarities between E. Levinas' and F. Rosenzweig's view on revelation. We also demonstrate how Levinas Orients his Jewish writings to his philosophy of the Other and vice versa. In writing on revelation, Levinas' main concern seems to be the description of the possibility of a fracture in the immanent order of totality and in the self-sufficiency of reason which is its correlative. This fraction is produced by the command "thou shalt not kill", calling the Same to open itself to the Other.<br>

Abstract: This article concerns itself with the question of what constitutes a hymn, within the framework of the existing state church. This framework is defined as "religious pluralization", characterized by an individualized understanding of Christ, and the parallel development of a new interdenominational religious awareness, two trends which have been increasingly prominent since the days of post-Reformation Orthodoxy and the Enlightenment. "Pluralization" is intimately associated with a fundamental movement away from traditional forms of religious piety. The article attempts to describe the hymn as a figure of "tentative continuity"; that ist, the hymn is the means by which human beings symbolically express their religious perception of their own finiteness in history. The hymn can therefore claim a more universal validity than if it merely pinpoints a specific moment of human religious history. At this point, the article carefully examines several examples of older as well as of more modern hymnody.<br>

Author(s): FREEMAN MICHAEL<br>
Abstract: Genocide is a political catastrophe. Yet it has not received much academic attention. A few social scientists have studied it. Philosophers have largely ignored it. There is a large literature on the Holocaust, but there is little agreement as to how this should be related to other genocides. Some have argued that the Holocaust represented a crisis of Western culture, but that Western culture has not responded adequately for the lack of the appropriate self-understanding. This crisis has been attributed to the predominance of scientistic models of rationality in our culture. Social-scientific approaches to genocide have been criticised because of their commitment to logical empiricism, which is held to be epistemologically and ethically inadequate. Ethical approaches based on liberal humanism have been criticised by post-Nietzschean philosophers for their attachment to allegedly outworn metaphysical assumptions. However, the deconstruction of social science and liberal ethics leads in the direction of relativism and nihilism, which are either useless or dangerous in the face of evils such as genocide. The arguments against conventional social science and ethics are examined, and a counter-critique made of post-modern philosophy in order to clear the ground for constructive thinking about genocide.<br>

Author(s): ATKINS KIM<br>
Abstract: In his famous paper, What Is It Like To Be A Bat?, Thomas Nagel argues against a reductive physicalist account of consciousness by highlighting what he calls "the subjective character of experience". In this paper I will argue that Nagel's insight is important for understanding the value placed on patient autonomy in medical ethics. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience brings with it the necessity for an epistemological humility with respect to the lives of others and what can be said to be "right" for them. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience lies at the heart of empathy and our capacity to make decisions that genuinely reflect respect for the patient's autonomy. Through the example of a case involving extreme medical intervention, I identify some impediments to the proper recognition of autonomy. These kind of cases highlight the significance of affective responses with respect to the subjective character of experience, and, by extension, to our capacity to imagine and act in accordance with another's perspective. I argue that affective responses are appropriate and needed considerations in the case where one must attempt to assume another's perspective in order to respect autonomy. I conclude that understanding that experience has an irreducibly subjective character is essential to respecting patient autonomy.<br>

Abstract: This essay discusses Heidegger's interpretation of autobiographical narration in his lecture on Basic Problems of Phenomenology (WS 1919/20) as an alternative conception of authenticity. A focused comparison between Heidegger's early understanding of the 'narrated self' and the analysis of the call of conscience in Being and Time shows that the most problematic aspects of Heidegger's later idea of authenticity result from a distinct isolation of the authentic self, which is specific for his conception of authenticity since the mid-twenties. At last, the article intends to demonstrate that Heidegger's early idea of an original self-understanding is close to current philosophical theories which assume a holistic idea of authenticity and point out a strong relation between authenticity and narrativity.<br>

Abstract: El artículo se propone como un acercamiento crítico a los modelos normativistas y acciorracionalistas de la sociología partiendo de la idea de que sobrevaloran las capacidades agenciales para entender y evaluar los mecanismos de la vida social. Frente a esos planteamientos teóricos proponemos que la contingencia y el fracaso (con la que no cuentan esas perspectivas) comparezcan como realidades constantes, inevitables e idóneas para comprender la acción social. En ese recorrido nos apoyamos en la propuesta de Ramos sobre la dimensión trágica de la acción, además de en la reformulación por parte de Arendt del concepto heideggeriano de cuidado. Finalmente, recalamos en la crítica a la función atribuida a determinados expertos en el escenario actual de la crisis económica, desde el presupuesto sobre su capacidad para predecir y corregir los rumbos sociales orientándolos hacia la consecución del éxito. This paper is proposed as a critical approach to normativism and rational-action based sociological models, starting from the idea that they overrate the capacities of agents to understand and evaluate the mechanisms of social life. In opposition to these theoretical approaches, we suggest that contingency and failure (not taken into account by these approaches) appear as constant realities, inevitable and appropriate for understanding social action. In this journey we rely on Ramos' proposal on the tragic dimension of action, in addition to the reformulation by Arendt of Heidegger's concept of care. Finally, we critique the role assigned to certain experts in the current scenario of economic crisis,from presumption of the ability to predict and correct social paths, pushing for success as a goal.<br>

Abstract: La Modernidad parecía condenar a la expulsión de la religión respecto del proyecto ilustrado al considerar que fe y razón eran excluyentes. No obstante, esa promesa de futuro de emancipación y de racionalidad ilustrada ha incurrido en sus propios aspectos negativos, hasta llegar, en la postmodernidad, a la deconstrucción de todo y la pérdida de sentido. El filósofo Habermas y el teólogo Ratzinger, después Papa Benedicto XVI, debatieron el papel que razón y fe debían desempeñar en las actuales sociedades plurales. Ambos partían de premisas distintas –Habermas desde la confianza en la Ilustración y en la religión como humanismo y Ratzinger desde el necesario entendimiento entre fe y razón– para llegar a un punto de encuentro: la necesidad de defender una nueva Ilustración, compatible con la religión, para operar en la postmodernidad. Modernity seemed to replace religion with the Enlightenment project, since it considered that reason and faith were mutually exclusive. However, the promise of a future of emancipation and Enlightenment reason has finally culminated, in Postmodernity, in the destruction of everything and the loss of meaning. Habermas, philosopher, and Ratzinger, theologian and later Pope Benedict XVI, discussed the role that ought to be played by reason and faith in the current plural societies. They were based on different premises—Habermas on trust in the Enlightenment and in religion from a humanistic perspective and Ratzinger on the necessary understanding between faith and reason—and reached a common point: the need to defend a new Enlightenment, compatible with religion, which can operate in Postmodernity.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i24438872<br>

Author(s): KNIGHT DEBORAH<br>
Abstract: Intentional, 'commonsense,' or 'folk' psychology is, as Jerry Fodor has remarked, ubiquitous. Explanations of what we say and do in terms of our reasons for acting are the stock in trade of intentional psychology. But there is a question whether explanations in terms of reasons are properly explanatory. Donald Davidson and Daniel Dennett, to name two, have defended intentional psychology and its reason-explanations. Still, many philosophers — including Fodor, Davidson and Dennett — fail to pay due attention to the narrative basis of such agent-centered accounts of action. In this paper, I argue that psychological explanation is an agent-centered, narrative-based interpretive practice. To make my case, I present a poetics of psychological explanation: seven elements which collectively describe what makes psychological explanations work. Narrative form allows us to represent the temporal arc of agents' actions — as well as the temporal arc of their reasoning about their actions, both prospective and retrospective. It allows us to negotiate between the canonical and the exceptional in human experience, and thus to account for actions that strike us as puzzling or unusual — whether the puzzle originates in our suboptimal understanding or the agent's suboptimal reasoning. And it allows us to juxtapose different perspectives on any action. Such juxtapositioning gives us a mechanism for coming to see how an action that strikes us as misguided might have been construed by the agent as reasonable given her understanding of her circumstances. After establishing the seven elements of the poetics, I address the objection that narrative-based accounts of intentional action are not properly explanatory.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i24438933<br>
Date: 4 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): MacAVOY LESLIE<br>
Abstract: In this paper I take issue with Heidegger's use of the concept of death as a means of disclosing human finitude. I argue that Being-towards-death is inadequate to the disclosure of Dasein's thrownness which is necessary for the kind of authentic historizing that Heidegger describes and furthermore leads to a reading of authenticity which is preclusive of Being-with-Others. I suggest that this difficulty may be alleviated through increased attention to the opposite boundary of Dasein's existence, namely its birth. Although I do not pursue the project here of conducting a phenomenology of birth, I suggest some directions for proceeding with that task, and I illustrate that a greater emphasis on Dasein's beginning will increase the richness of our understanding of our Being-with-Others.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>
Issue: i24439507<br>
Date: 10 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): CHRISTMAN JOHN<br>
Abstract: In this article I critically discuss a claim made by several writers in philosophy and the social sciences that for an individual to count as a person, a single personality, or the subject of a life, the experiences of the subject in question must take a narrative form. I argue that narrativity is a misleading and, in some ways of understanding it, implausible condition of what it is that adds unity to personhood and personality. I pursue this critique by considering canonical accounts of narrativity in philosophy and literary studies. I consider those connections between events that must hold for the sequence to be considered a narrative: causal, teleological, and thematic connections. I argue that for each of these, the condition that experiential sequences (for a given subject) must have this structure is empty: any life sequence that is reflected upon in an interpretive spirit can meet it. What the condition of narrativity amounts to, then, is the more basic requirement that the person must be able to look upon the factors and events of her life with a certain interpretive reflection, whether or not those factors and events have any particular narrative unity in a traditional sense.<br>

Abstract: Cet article interroge les modes de production et de reproduction des récits de migration. Les histoires seront traitées non seulement comme sources de recherche ethnographique et comme enquête journalistique, mais aussi comme des moyens spécifiques de comprendre et de façonner l'expérience de la migration. De cette façon, nous viserons moins à alimenter un débat méthodologique sur l'usage des matériaux biographiques dans une recherche qualitative, qu'à mettre en lumière les multiples effets de ce phénomène sur la société, en termes de création d'une demande d'histoires de migration et, par conséquence, d'un véritable « marché de mots » où les migrants, qui ont acquis une solide maîtrise narrative, peuvent troquer leurs récits de vie contre une reconnaissance sociale, du prestige ou même de l'argent. This article studies the ways migration narratives are being produced and reproduced. Such stories shall be treated not only as sources of the ethnographical research and journalistic enquiry, but also as specific ways of understanding and shaping the experience of migration. This way I intend—more than feeding the methodological debate of how to use the biographical materials in a research—to highlight the multiple effects of this phenomenon over society, in terms of creation of a market of migrational stories. In this market, migrants, acting as true narrative experts, can exchange their stories for social recognition, prestige, or even money.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i24484208<br>
Date: 8 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): da Silva António Barbosa<br>
Abstract: The purpose of this theoretical article is to discuss the existential and universal feature of suffering—as illustrated by Job's suffering in the Book of Job in the Bible and by the survivors of the 2004 Asian tsunami catastrophe—and to highlight its significance for health care. Further, the study is aiming at contributing to health professionals' understanding of patients' suffering. The sources are narratives, comprising Job's book, TV interviews 1 year after the tsunami catastrophe and the survivors' autobiographies. The methodological approach is a philosophical analysis. The existential, universal, ontological and epistemological aspects of suffering are carefully scrutinized to unveil the universal and existential versus culture-specific features of suffering. Based on the results, the authors' recommendations are (1) a holistic concept of the patient and health care has to seriously consider suffering in all its complexity because when a person is in pain, it is not his/her body but the whole person as a unity of body, psyche and spirit that suffers and (2) suffering should be seen as the most central concept of health care, which should provide treatment for physical pain and all dimensions of suffering: physical, social, mental and spiritual aspects.<br>

Article Title: THE POETICS OF ANCIENT GREEK MEMORY AND THE HISTORICAL IMPERATIVE<br>
Publisher: Wiley Periodicals, Inc.<br>
Issue: i24542986<br>
Date: 10 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Grethlein Jonas<br>
Abstract: This book examines Greek engagements with the past as articulations of memory formulated against the contingency of chance associated with temporality. Based on a phenomenological understanding of temporality, it identifies four memorializing strategies: continuity (tradition), regularity (exemplarity), development, and acceptance of chance. This framework serves in pursuing a twofold aim: to reconstruct the literary field of memory in fifth-century BCE Greece; and to interpret Greek historiography as a memorializing mode. The key contention advanced by this approach is that acts of memory entailed an "idea of history" that was articulated not only in historiography, but also in epinician poetry, elegy, tragedy, and oratory. The book offers a rich account of poetic conventions and contexts through which each of these genres counterbalanced contingency through the use of exemplary and traditional modes of memory. This fine analysis highlights the grip of the present on the past as a significant feature of both historiographical and nonhistoriographical genres. The essay argues that this work fills a disciplinary gap by extending the reflection on memory to a new period, Greek antiquity. The retrospective positioning of this period at the outset of Western historical thought brings Grethlein's investigation to the center of debates about memory, temporality, and the meaning history. In engaging with the book's argument, the essay suggests that historiographical memory emerged in Greece not as a first-order encounter with time, but as a second-order encounter with forgetting. This confrontation marked a certain separation of historiography from other memorializing genres. Whereas poetic and rhetorical memories were posited against contingency, historiography sought to retrieve those aspects of the past that may otherwise have been irretrievably lost and forgotten. In doing so, it formulated the historiographical imperative as a negation of forgetting that problematized~<br>

Abstract: Este artículo tiene por objetivo presentar una estrategia metodológica para el estudio de las urbanizaciones cerradas que se centre en la mirada de los actores sociales involucrados, teniendo en cuenta las representaciones sociales y las percepciones que sustentan. Dicha estrategia se enmarca en una investigación cualitativa que permite reconstruir teóricamente un objeto en permanente dinamismo y obtener una comprensión holística de las situaciones sociales; propone para su desarrollo la utilización de un enfoque etnográfico, en tanto la etnografía es una modalidad de investigación que favorece la comprensión de los procesos sociales. This article seeks to present a methodological approach to the study of gated communities in order to focus on the perspective of the actors involved, taking into account the social representations and perceptions those supports. This strategy is part of a qualitative research project that enables one to theoretically reconstruct an object in constant dynamism and obtain a holistic understanding of social situations. To this end, it proposes using an ethnographic approach, since ethnography is a form of research that promotes the understanding of social processes.<br>

Publisher: IRSA<br>
Issue: i24595727<br>
Date: 1 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Burroughs Charles<br>
Abstract: Through the analysis of a major religious painting by Botticelli, this article builds on important recent work on Botticelli's sacred art to explore apparent responses on the part of an especially sophisticated artist to the gathering atmosphere of crisis in the city's political and religious life. The artist uses various devices of connection or separation between the viewer/worshiper and the holy image; these devices are not unique to the painting, but their combination is exceptional. First, Botticelli uses a hieratic gold ground to distinguish a scene set in heaven, the coronation of the Virgin, from a more earthly zone; here recent scruples about the representation of transcendence seem to be in play. Second, the figures beneath, four major saints, embody different ways of addressing the viewer and mediating between him/her and the heavenly event. Third, the latter appears to be treated as an apsidal image within an implied architectural setting, in other words, as a representation of a representation. By establishing modes of mediation, then, Botticelli confronts issues emerging as central to the representation of the sacred, in part on the basis of a critical understanding of Albertian picture theory.<br>

Abstract: Les auteurs proposent de concevoir les idéologies politiques comme des « trames », c'est-à-dire des véhicules de narration qui organisent la production de récits identitaires. Cette proposition, de pair avec l'analyse compréhensive des idéologies, pourrait apporter une solution aux problèmes liés au changement et à la permanence de ces procédés rhétoriques, thématiques, symboliques, etc. Pour illustrer cette théorie, les auteurs analysent le cas de la Navarre depuis le dernier tiers du XIXe siècle. On peut ainsi observer comment l'affrontement de deux trames idéologiques a provoqué le grave conflit d'identité dont souffre cette communauté depuis la transition démocratique. It is being suggested here that ideologies can be conceived of as « textures » or narrative vehicles organizing the production of identity-narratives. That suggestion together with the related understanding analysis of ideologies may solve the problems tied to change and permanence in their rhetorical, topical and symbolic processes. To illustrate their theory, the authors study the case of Navarra since the late 19th century, showing how the antagonism of two ideological textures yielded the deep identity conflict that has been affecting this community since the democratic transition.<br>

Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers, Inc.<br>
Issue: i24649492<br>
Date: 1 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): WATSON STEPHEN H.<br>
Abstract: Paul Klee's art found broad impact upon philosophers of varying commitments, including Hans-Georg Gadamer. Moreover, Klee himself was not only one of the most important artists of aesthetic modernism but one of its leading theoreticians, and much in his work, as in Gadamer's, originated in post-Kantian literary theory's explications of symbol and allegory. Indeed at one point in Truth and Method, Gadamer associates his project for a general "theory of hermeneutic experience" not only with Goethe's metaphysical account of the symbolic but equally with a "rehabilitation" of allegory. In this paper, I examine this position and Gadamer's own use of it in his analysis of Klee's work, contrasting it with that of Walter Benjamin's account of allegory, equally indebted to Goethe and this archive. Finally, I contrast the resulting interpretations of Klee, discussing the implications that evolve for understanding both Gadamer and Benjamin—but equally for understanding Klee's work and, provisionally, the work of art, thus construed, for philosophy.<br>

Abstract: This article examines Gadamer's claim that language is fundamentally metaphorical from the perspective of Ricoeur's complementary analysis of metaphor. I argue that Gadamer's claim can only be understood in relation to a broader understanding of metaphor in which metaphor is not regarded as secondary to literal meaning. From this context one is better able to understand the connection Gadamer makes between language and ontology, which is found in his statement "Being that can be understood is language."<br>

Abstract: The article comprises three parts. Part I contains an overview of the areas in the analysis of modern French philosophy that have been of the greatest relevance to Russian researchers over the last years. We conclude that numerous aspects of the French philosophical thought of the twentieth century are well represented in the research of Russian authors, who also point out the emerging trends in its development. Part II deals with the development of analytic philosophy in Russia within the framework of such areas as "critique of bourgeois philosophy", a purely ideological stand only nominally related to philosophy, logic, and the history of philosophy and theoretical research. Part III contains a periodization of the history of phenomenology in Russia, pointing out the most important achievements of the contemporary Russian scholars of phenomenology as well as their understanding of the essence, the problems, and the aims of phenomenological philosophy. We also indicate the tendencies within the development of the discipline in the Russian Federation.<br>

Abstract: En 2006, en Afrique du Sud, une chanson évoquant la guerre anglo-boer (1899-1902), « De La Rey », connut un succès exceptionnel chez les jeunes Afrikaners. Entendue selon les uns comme un appel aux armes contre le gouvernement, selon d'autres comme l'expression de l'incertitude de ces jeunes blancs parlant afrikaans quant à leur avenir dans le pays, elle libéra la parole, permit à de nombreuses interrogations de s'exprimer, notamment quant au poids de l'héritage de l'apartheid et à la possibilité de s'en libérer. Après avoir brièvement présenté la position des Afrikaners dans la société sud-africaine, cet article évoque l'histoire de la chanson et du rock afrikaans pour y situer « De La Rey »; il envisage ensuite les débats qu'elle a provoqués avant de procéder à une étude systématique du clip vidéo qui l'a illustré. Il met en lumière l'instabilité des configurations identitaires afrikaners et propose une méthode d'analyse du clip vidéo qui fait ressortir sa capacité à exprimer ambiguïtés et contradictions. In 2006, a song dedicated to the Boer general Koos De La Rey, a forgotten hero of the second Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902), became a hit among young Afrikaners and provoked heated debates about Afrikaners' attitudes towards the « new » South Africa. Some commentators heard in its lyrics a call to arms against the Anc government, others interpreted it as an expression of the anxiety young Afrikaners felt about their future in the country. Beyond what was written and said in the media, debating the song « De La Rey » allowed the public articulation of interrogations about the legacy of apartheid and the possibility to overcome it. After a brief presentation of the current situation of Afrikaners in South Africa, this paper introduces the history of Afrikaans song and rock music to provide the backcloth to an analysis of « De La Rey ». Opinions expressed in various forums are reviewed before a structural analysis of the video clip that greatly contributed to the succes~<br>

Abstract: It is important, however, to note Johan van der Hoeven's corrections of C. T. Mclntire's
reading of Dooyeweerd on history (in Philosophia Reformata 52 lno.2, 19871: 194-202).
Jan Dengerink's precision on the respective understanding of 'historicism' by Vollen-
hoven and Dooyeweerd, as he calls Jacob Klapwijk to precision on exegeting Dooye-
weerd's view of 'ontsluiting', is also, 1 think, on target ('Hen brug te ver', in Philosophia
Reformata 53 (no.l, 19881: 17-22). Sander Griffioen's incisive article on 'De Betekenis van
Dooyeweerd's Ontwikkelingsidee' is particularly helpful in delineating the nuances of
Dooyeweerd's reflections (Philosophia Reformata 51 (nos. 1-2, 1986): 83-109).<br>

Abstract: Steen indicates that the term "above time" (boventijdelijk) was abandoned by Dooyeweerd
in his later years under intense criticism, in favor of the expression "religious transcendence."
Yet, according to Steen, this substitution by no means represented a change in Dooyeweerd's
own understanding of the whole structure to which the former term applied, but rather a
concession to what he regarded as a misunderstanding that had arisen concerning the whole
complex of ideas involved. (Structure, p. 6, n. 6).<br>

Author(s): Glas Gerrit<br>
Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: Dieser Aufsatz greift auf die Forschungen des Altgermanisten Friedrich Ohly zurück, der die Geisteswissenschaften durch eine metaphern-orientierte Forschung neu stimulieren wollte: Metaphern, so Friedrich Ohly, seien nicht Restbestände, sondern Grundbestände menschlichen Lebens. Besonders die religiöse Sprache komme nicht ohne Metaphern aus. So sei die Beziehung zwischen Gott und den Menschen allein metaphorisch zu versprachlichen. Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird der metaphern-orientierte Zugang von Friedrich Ohly auf die Metapher „Gotteskind“ bzw. „Gotteskindschaft“ angewendet. Näherhin analysiert der Beitrag die Prägekraft der Metapher „Gotteskind“ bzw. „Gotteskindschaft“ mit Blick auf die Taufliturgie und die Tauftheologie der Alten Kirche. Unabhängig von seinem biologischen Alter – so geben sich die Jesus-Anhänger von Anfang an überzeugt – wird der Christ jung in der Taufe und bleibt jung, wenn er seine Taufberufung in Treue bewahrt. So seien als Schlüsselgedanken des vorliegenden Aufsatzes hervorgehoben: erstens die Taufe als geistliche Geburt und Anfang der Kindwerdung; zweitens die metaphorische Rede von der Taufeucharistie als Milch, welche als lebenslängliche geistliche Speise für die Gotteskinder gilt (1 Petr 2,2). This article examines the research of Friedrich Ohly, a medievalist who sought to stimulate spiritual understanding through thought which explored the significance of metaphor. For him, metaphors were not merely the remains, but parts of the active inventory of human life. Religious language, in particular, could not do without them. The relationship between God and man could be articulated only by metaphoric means. In this article Ohly's approach is applied to the metaphor of 'God's Child', or 'Divine Filiation'. The article seeks to analyse the power of the impression of the metaphor itself with a view to the baptismal liturgy and baptismal theology of the ancient Church. From the very beginning Christians had been convinced that new believers be~<br>

Our reading focuses in particular on his understanding of the evanescent presence of the present and of its debt vis-à-vis the "unconscious" consciousness of a "virtual" past. We wish to show that the Bergsonian version of a critique of "the metaphysics of presence" is, for all that, an offshoot of a Platonic type of metaphysics. It is true that Bergson departs from traditional stand-points on the side of a self-sufficient and original present and a form of presence to which the transparency of consciousness would confer the character of immediate evidence. All the same, it can hardly be claimed that his rehabilitation of the past and the unconscious opens up new perspectives on how forgetting and death are bound up with the work of memory.<br>

Abstract: El presente trabajo analiza la forma de comprensión de los casos de aprobación y rechazo de acuerdos reparatorios en materias de violencia doméstica, cuando tanto la víctima como el imputado pertenecen al pueblo mapuche, que han sido resueltos desde el año 2011 por tribunales de la Región de La Araucanía. Se plantea que las formas de comprender estos casos por los tribunales y la doctrina no ha sido la correcta, por cuanto se han centrado en determinar la primacía exclusiva que tendría uno de los derechos en disputa por sobre el otro. Frente a ello, el artículo sugiere que la forma adecuada de entender estos conflictos multiculturales, y a la decisión judicial que se pronuncia sobre los mismos, es reconociendo el elemento "trágico" que se encuentra presente, y que se configura a partir de un reconocimiento de las características e importancia de los principios en colisión y de los bienes jurídicos que protegen. This paper analyzes the way of understanding the cases of approval and rejection of compensation agreements in matters of domestic violence, where both the victim and the accused belong to the Mapuche people, which have been resolved since 2011 by courts of the Araucanía Region. It argues that the ways of understanding these cases by the courts and the doctrine has not been proper, since ithas focused on determine the exclusive primacy that one of the colliding rights would have over the other. Facing this issue, the article suggests that the best way to understand these multicultural conflicts, and the judicial decision pronounced on them, is considering the "tragic" element present in these cases, which is configured from the recognition of the characteristics and importance of the principles in collision and the legal goods they protect.<br>

Abstract: The Earth’s Children series of prehistoric novels by Jean M. Auel, beginning with
         The Clan of the Cave Bear(1980) and culminating inThe Land of Painted Caves(2010), contains a compelling vision of two species of human practising two utterly different kinds of religion. On the one hand there are the Neanderthals, who practice a pure totemism, while on the other there are the anatomically modern humans, whose religion centres on the worship of an Earth Goddess. Auel’s heroine, Ayla, straddles both religious spheres, but she herself initiates a crisis within the anatomically modern human religious world. This article examines the different fictional religions in these popular and influential books, considers the sources Auel drew on in creating them and considers the influence these books may exert on public understanding of religion, including among future cohorts of students of religion.<br>

Publisher: Journal of Consumer Research<br>
Issue: i342750<br>

Author(s): Zaner Howard R.<br>
Abstract: Existential-phenomenology is presented as an alternative paradigm for conceptualizing and studying consumer experience. Basic theoretical tenets of existential-phenomenology are contrasted with more traditional assumptions and methods used in consumer research. The metaphors used by each paradigm to describe its world view are provided and their respective implications for consumer research discussed. One phenomenological research method is detailed, and examples of how the method is applied and the type of data it produces are provided. An epistemological analysis reveals that existential-phenomenology can provide an empirically based and methodologically rigorous understanding of consumer phenomena.<br>

Author(s): Zuckerman Elizabeth C.<br>
Abstract: This article reviews and integrates recent theories of addiction drawn from a diverse set of disciplines-consumer behavior, medicine, sociology, psychiatry, and psychology-to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the etiology of addiction and other compulsive consumer behaviors. Interpretive material from personal interviews with addicted and nonaddicted drug users is then used to illustrate the consciousness of addictive consumption. Two a priori themes-serial/simultaneous addictions and personal crises/role transitions-and five emergent themes-relapse, deception, dysfunctional families, suicide, and boundaries-are discussed.<br>

Article Title: Can Histories be True? Narrativism, Positivism, and the "Metaphorical Turn"<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342994<br>
Date: 10 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Nelson Chris<br>
Abstract: Narrativism, as represented by Hayden White and Frank Ankersmit, can fruitfully be analyzed as an inversion of two brands of positivism. First, narrativist epistemology can be regarded as an inversion of empiricism. Its thesis that narratives function as metaphors which do not possess a cognitive content is built on an empiricist, "picture view" of knowledge. Moreover, all the non-cognitive aspects attributed to narrative as such are dependent on this picture theory of knowledge and a picture theory of representation. Most of the epistemological characteristics that White and Ankersmit attribute to historical narratives therefore share the problems of this picture theory. The article's second thesis is that the theories of narrative explanation can also fruitfully be analyzed as inversions of positivist covering-law theory. Ankersmit's brand of narrativism is the most radical in this respect because it posits an opposition between narrative and causal modes of comprehension while simultaneously eliminating causality from narrativist historical understanding. White's brand of narrativism is more of a hybrid than is Ankersmit's as far as its theory of explanation is concerned; nevertheless, it can also be fruitfully interpreted as an inversion of covering-law theory, replacing it by an indefinite multitude of explanatory strategies. Most of the striking characteristics of both White's and Ankersmit's narrativism presuppose positivism in these two senses, especially their claim that historical narratives have a metaphorical structure and therefore no truth-value. These claims are hard to reconcile with the factual characteristics of debates by historians; this problem can be tracked down to the absence in "metaphorical" narrativism of a conceptual connection between historical narratives and historical research.<br>

Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>

Date: 2 1, 1983<br>
Author(s): LaCapra Dale S.<br>
Abstract: This paper analyzes the kind of historical understanding presupposed in the writing of classical Chinese Ch'an Buddhist "transmission" narratives and places this historical understanding into comparative juxtaposition with modern Western historiographic practice. It finds that fundamental to Chinese Ch'an historical awareness are genealogical metaphors structuring historical time and meaning in terms of generations of family relations and the practices of inheritance. These metaphors link the Ch'an historian to the texts of historical study in ways that contrast with the posture of modern historians. The essay outlines four basic differences between the self-understanding presupposed in Ch'an Buddhist historical writing and that assumed in modern historical research and concludes by suggesting how contemporary historical thinking might benefit from reflection on these differences.<br>

Abstract: On September 11, 2001, the passengers and crew members aboard Flight 93 responded to the hijacking of their airplane by organizing a counterattack against the hijackers. The airplane crashed into an unpopulated field, causing no damage to human lives or national landmarks beyond the lives of those aboard the airplane. We draw on this story of courageous collective action to explore the question of what makes this kind of action possible. We propose that to take courageous collective action, people need three narratives-a personal narrative that helps them understand who they are beyond the immediate situation and manage the intense emotions that accompany duress, a narrative that explains the duress that has been imposed upon them sufficiently to make moral and practical judgments about how to act, and a narrative of collective action-and the resources that make the creation of these narratives feasible. We also consider how the creation of these narratives is relevant to courageous collective action in more common organizational circumstances, and identify how this analysis suggests new insights into our understanding of the core framing tasks of social movements, ways in which social movement actors draw on social infrastructure, the role of discourse and morality in social movements, the formation of collective identity, and resource mobilization.<br>

elementary words in which Dasein expresses itself, and to keep the common understanding from
leveling them off to that unintelligibility which functions in turn as a source of pseudo problems"

Abstract: La réflexion offerte dans cet essai s'inscrit dans une entreprise d'approfondissement de la compréhension générale que nous avons de l'activité politique (parler, écrire, revendiquer, mettre en scène), et particulièrement de la relation que cette activité entretient avec l'idée de l'émancipation. Plus précisément, il s'agit de prendre pour objet d'exploration théorique le fait de parole, défini en termes d'articulation performative des espaces-temps humains, et d'en faire le paradigme de toute action politique. L'analyse de ce paradigme, au terme, permettra de pointer vers une matière utopique qui se qualifie à la fois comme événement et comme permanence du commun. /// In this article, the author seeks a better understanding of the modalities of political action (speaking, writing, claming, staging), and more specifically of the relation between political action and the idea of emancipation. To do so, the author proposes that the speech act, comprehended as the performed articulation of lived space/time, is to be taken as the paradigm of political action. Further analysis of this paradigm, as developed in the article, compels the manifestation of a philosophical object which qualifies both as event and as the manifestation of the perennially of the common.<br>

Article Title: Mathematics and Mathematics Education as Triadic Communication? A Semiotic Framework Exemplified<br>
Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i25472056<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Ongstad Sigmund<br>
Abstract: The article investigates in the first part critically dyadic and essentialist understanding of signs and utterances in mathematics and mathematics education as opposed to a triadic view. However even Peircean semiotics, giving priority to triadic, dynamic sign may face challenges, such as explaining the sign as a pragmatic act and how signs are related to context. To meet these and other hurdles an explicit communicational, pragmatic and triadic view, found in parts of the works of Bühler, Bakhtin, Habermas, and Halliday, is developed. Two basic principles are combined and established in a theoretical framework. Firstly, whenever uttering, there will exist in any semiotic sign system, dynamic reciprocity and simultaneity between expressing through form, referring to content, and addressing as an act. Secondly, meaning will be created by the dynamics between given and new in utterances and between utterances and contextual genres. The latter principle explains how meaning merge in communication dynamically and create the basis for a discursive understanding of semiosis and hence even learning at large. The second part exemplifies each of the three main aspects and the dynamics of utterance and genre and given and new by excerpts from a textbook in mathematics education. The concept 'positioning', in use for operationalisation, is explained in relation to main principles of the framework. The article ends focusing crucial implications for validation when moving from a dyadic to a triadic understanding of mathematics and mathematics education.<br>

Article Title: What Cultural Theorists of Religion Have to Learn from Wittgenstein; Or, How to Read Geertz as a Practice Theorist<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion, Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i25484065<br>

Author(s): Springs Jason A.<br>
Abstract: Amid the debates over the meaning and usefulness of the word "culture" during the 1980s and 1990s, practice theory emerged as a framework for analysis and criticism in cultural anthropology. Although theorists have gradually begun to explore practice-oriented frameworks as promising vistas in cultural anthropology and the study of religion, these remain relatively recent developments that stand to be historically explicated and conceptually refined. This article assesses several ways that practice theory has been articulated by some of its chief expositors and critics, and places these developments in conversation with comparable accounts of "social practices" by recent pragmatist philosophers. My aim in generating such a conversation is to illuminate the ways that Ludwig Wittgenstein's later work provides important resources for cultural analysis that are already implicit in practice theory, yet either frequently overlooked or dismissed by practice theorists. I demonstrate how a Wittgensteinian understanding of practice theory coheres with, and illuminates, Clifford Geertz's account of meaning, thick description, and religious practices. Reading Geertz as a practice theorist, I argue, helps alleviate the apparent opposition between assessing meaning and analyzing power in the study of religious practices and institutions, and unsettles dichotomous accounts of belief and intentional action.<br>

Abstract: Relating Religion, Smith describes his career in terms of the "constant... argument that
religion is not best understood as a disclosure that gives rise to a particular mode of experience. To
the contrary, religion is the relentlessly human activity of thinking through a 'situation,' an
understanding that requires assenting to Lévi-Strauss's dictum, 'man has always been thinking
equally well'" (2004: 32).<br>

Publisher: American Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i25593909<br>

Author(s): Schwartz Barry<br>
Abstract: Oneness refers to the convention of recognizing a single individual's performance and ignoring others, including those who may have performed as well. Although oneness is an adaptation to cognitive deficits, it cannot be explained by them. If long-term and working memory were more capacious, society's need for ideals to establish realm-specific standards and meanings would tend to limit recognition and renown to one individual. The apotheosis of Rosa Parks is a case in point. Her celebrity and the obscurity of others who risked and accomplished more than she are two aspects of the same social process. Revealing oneness to be a social imperative, this case study leads to a broader understanding of collective forgetting.<br>

Publisher: American Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i25593919<br>
Date: 9 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Pagis Michal<br>
Abstract: Drawing on G. H. Mead and Merleau-Ponty, this paper aims to extend our understanding of self-reflexivity beyond the notion of a discursive, abstract, and symbolic process. It offers a framework for embodied self-reflexivity, which anchors the self in the reflexive capacity of bodily sensations. The data consist of two years of ethnographic observations and in-depth interviews of vipassana meditation practitioners in Israel and the United States. The findings illustrate how bodily sensations are used as indexes to psychological states, emotions, and past experiences, while constant awareness of embodied responses is used as a tool for self-monitoring. The paper follows the interaction between discursive and embodied modes of reflexivity and the attempt to shift from one mode to the other. I suggest that currently popular practices of embodied awareness, from meditation to yoga, are based on embodied self-reflexivity and are part of the postindustrial culture of self-awareness.<br>

Abstract: This essay traces the involution of anthropological understanding from the 1950s to the present. It is shown that as the conception of "doing ethnography" changed from sensing patterns to reading texts, and from reading texts to writing culture, so too did the content of anthropological knowledge change from being multi-sensory to being self-centred. The essay also proposes a way of escaping the tunnel-vision of contemporary (post-modern) ethnography — namely, by treating cultures as constituted by a particular interplay of the senses which the ethnographer must simulate before making any attempt to describe or evoke the culture under study. /// Cet article trace l'enchevêtrement qu'a subi l'étude de l'anthropologie depuis les années cinquante à nos jours. L'auteur démontre que le concept de "faire de l'ethnographie" a changé radicalement — de la perception sensorielle à la lecture des textes et de cette lecture à l'acte d'écrire une culture. Également, le contenu des connaissances anthropologiques a subi un changement du multi-sensoriel à l'égocentrique. L'article propose comment s'éloigner du champ de vue plutôt étroit de l'ethnographie contemporaine (dite post-moderne) en suggérant que les ethnographes traitent les cultures telles que constituées par l'action réciproque particulière des sens qui doivent être simulés avant que les ethnographes puissent essayer de décrire ou d'évoquer la culture en question.<br>

Abstract: The attentions given to textual production in composition scholarship have led to a neglect of the dynamics of textual reception. Renewed acquaintance with the discipline of hermeneutics will provide scholars and instructors with a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between interpretive processes and rhetorical strategies. Building on the work of Phelps, Mailloux, and Crusius, this article revisits Gadamer and Ricoeur, two of the more prominent scholars of modern hermeneutics, for the purpose of applying their principles to learning objectives and class assignments in college-level writing courses.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyse some questions proposed by the debate on the issue of modernity and post-modernity in the context of the philosophy of Leonardo Coimbra, from the reflection on these issues made by Jürgen Habermas in the work
         The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity. Thus, the critique to modern reason, the reflection on the metaphysics, the issues about the relationship between reason and faith, the religious phenomenon, the process of secularization, are our starting point for the questioning and the philosophical understanding that postmodernity makes of these problems The inauguration of this new rationality allows a new questioning about the reason and the world, manifesting the sublime character of its nature, allowing a new reflection, a critique of self-sufficient and self-reflexive reason and recovering another discursive and cooperative form of reason.<br>

Abstract: In the context of the family’s crisis, in addition to the marital failures that produce suffering and inconvenience, there are biases due to controversies, ideological interests and opinions, which originate general and simplistic solutions to complex problems with peculiar characteristics. The article, – according to the commitment of the Holy Father Francisco to mitigate the heavy burden of people in “irregular” unions (where situations of fragility or misery improve stigma of exclusion) – try demonstrate the continuity of the Magisterium Pontifical Council, in which
         Amoris Laetitiaand the reform of the canonical matrimonial process were inserted. Through the study of the answers and the search for solutions that are careful to the hierarchy of truths, the Holy Father pointed out: “to generate personal and personalized processes”; to follow paths of reflection and discreet understanding the conditions of each case; ultimately, to help progress guided by a logic of forgiveness and reconciliation, according to a merciful and encouraging pastoral care. Sacraments and consciences, both sacred, require to be served with truth.<br>

Abstract: Cet entretien, réalisé à l'occasion de la parution du dernier ouvrage d'Arno J. Mayer, Les Furies, permet de retracer l'itinéraire intellectuel de cet historien du contemporain nourri de science politique et d'un marxisme hétérodoxe. Il met en lumière tout l'intérêt des méthodes et des questionnements d'un chercheur soucieux de penser de manière comparée les moments de crise sociale et politique en Europe et d'en comprendre la violence. Les prises de position politiques d'A. J. Mayer éclairent son œuvre et dessinent les difficultés et les originalités d'un parcours engagé dans l'université américaine depuis la fin des années 1950. This interview, conducted on the occasion of the publication of Arno J. Mayer's latest book, Les Furies, recounts the intellectual itinerary of this historian of the contemporary period, nurtured by political science and unorthodox Marxism. It brings out the interesting aspects of the methods and questioning used by this researcher who studies moments of social and political crisis in Europe comparatively and aims at understanding their violence. The political positions taken by A. J. Mayer help explain his writings and indicate the problems and originality of the path taken by a committed scholar who has been working in American universities since the end of the 1950s.<br>

Abstract: Alasdair Maclntyre, After Virtue (Notre Dame, 1984), p. 220. See also Charles
Taylor, Hegel and Modern Society (Cambridge, 1979), pp. 157-8. For a psychoanalytic
critique of Maclntyre, see Fred Alford, The Self in Social Theory (New Haven, CT,
1991), ch. 1. Alford shares Maclntyre's understanding of the self in terms of narrative
within a given, constitutive social context. He criticizes Maclntyre, however, for not
granting the self sufficient capacity to change and shape its circumstances in the face of
tradition and social expectations. Alford also discusses other communitarian theorists in
this chapter.<br>

Abstract: I again send the reader to the unpublished dissertation of Janet Altman,
which attempts "to isolate those literary phenomena which are particular
to or present in unique ways in the letter form" (p. 7). I would hope that
my own study, biased as it is toward a fuller understanding of the
development of narrative fiction in general, would complement Profes-
sor Altman's. My own approach seeks less to discover what is unique
about epistolary fiction than to isolate and understand its narrative con-
formity. Nonetheless, our analyses intersect in important ways.<br>

Publisher: Institute of Management Sciences<br>
Issue: i345213<br>
Date: 5 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Zigurs Marshall Scott<br>
Abstract: The past decade has brought advanced information technologies, which include electronic messaging systems, executive information systems, collaborative systems, group decision support systems, and other technologies that use sophisticated information management to enable multiparty participation in organization activities. Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose adaptive structuration theory (AST) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. AST examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of AST, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system (GDSS). A GDSS is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the GDSS is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied. We begin by positioning AST among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to GDSS use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of AST. We outline an analytic strategy for applying AST principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of AST is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization r~<br>

Author(s): Warren Peter A.<br>
Abstract: Albert Camus's political philosophy of rebellion and limits is ultimately grounded in an aesthetic theory, which in turn is dependent on a broader understanding of the nature of symbols. In his essays and notes. Camus develops a theory of symbols in which he insists that human beings are symbolic creatures and that human experience and symbolization are interdependent realities. Camus felt that art, in particular the philosophical novel, played a significant role in the rearticulation of symbols. The basis of the recollection or the creation of symbols is the consciousness of the community, particularly the shared consciousness of the human condition. Symbols act as mediations between the empirical world and the world of imagination. They are not literal descriptions of that empirical reality, nor are they simply flights of fancy. Symbols are necessarily bound and free. So, too, Camus argues, must be the politics on which they are based.<br>

Publisher: International Phenomenological Society<br>
Issue: i345615<br>
Date: 6 1, 1958<br>
Author(s): Wittgenstein Daniel<br>
Abstract: This paper argues against causalism about reasons in three stages. First, the paper investigates Professor Davidson's sophisticated version of the claim that we must understand reason-explanations as a kind of causal explanation to highlight the fact that this move does no explanatory work in telling us how we determine for which reasons we act. Second, the paper considers Davidson's true motivation for regarding reasons-explanations as causal which connects with his claim that reasons are causes. He advocates anomalous monism in order to solve the mysterious connection problem. In assessing his proposed solution to this problem, the paper examines his `extension reply' to the charge that his token identity theory ultimately results in epiphenomenalism. The paper argues that only a reading of this reply makes for a stable anomalous monism but for this reason Davidson's compatiblist metaphysics is unfit for the task of solving the mysterious connection problem. Given that reductive accounts are incompatible with the special features of reasons explanations, the paper concludes that we must reverse the orthodoxy once again and eschew causalism about reasons and reason-explanations. Finally, the paper considers a possible way of recasting our understanding of causation so that the mysterious connection problem disappears.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Schiemann John W.<br>
Abstract: Rational choice theory and the critical theory of Jurgen Habermas exclude important social categories from their analyses of strategic interaction. Successful strategic action in many contexts, however, depends upon the irreducibly intersubjective categories of the lifeworld. I defend this claim by analyzing the use of focal points to solve the multiple equilibria problem in coordination games, reconstructing both the generation of the salience behind focal points as well as the strategic rationality of using them. The goal of this reconstruction is to demonstrate the compatibility of what appears to be mutually hostile research traditions, validating the intuition that together they provide a better understanding of politics than either school can on its own.<br>

Issue: i345907<br>
Date: 2 1, 1969<br>
Author(s): Althusser Nicole<br>
Abstract: This article, written by a Russian cultural historian, analyzes the concept of "ideology" in the work of Clifford Geertz and his role in understanding the figurative nature of ideology as a cultural system. The author compares Geertz's semiotic approach to culture with the semiotics of culture developed by Russian theorists, particularly Yuri Lotman, showing the convergence and divergence of the two different national traditions. This understanding of the nature and functions of ideology opens new possibilities for discussing the tortured relations of ideology and literature, showing the way fiction can affect the formation of ideological systems and influence practical politics. The analysis is illustrated by examples from Russian political life of the 1990s, when revolutionary changes demanded new sets of ideological metaphors that in their turn shaped the direction of events.<br>

Author(s): Scholte Bob<br>
Abstract: The task of anthropology consists in describing and explaining cultures and ultimately reaching an understanding of them through interpretation. The practical difficulties of this are obvious to all those who have dealth with members of another culture. As Malinowski observed, the anthropologist's task is to be "the interpreter of the native." It is suggested that some of the principles elucidated in the philosophical discipline of hermeneutics, such as understanding in context as opposed to preunderstanding and the dialectical relationship between the interpreter and the object of interpretation, may be helpful in defining the essential problems that anthropologists may encounter in their attempts to interpret cultures.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Webster Steven<br>
Abstract: Using the hermeneutical theory of Paul Ricoeur, it is possible to discern symbolic dimensions in cultural anthropology. Symbols, here, are dominant images in anthropologists' texts, creatively posited by inquirers, that, most importantly, possess a surplus of meaning. A symbol's fullest surplus of meaning is a prereflexive and comprehensive "understanding" (Verstehen) that may encompass a scholar's attempts at "explanation" (Erklaren). Examples of this symbolic dimension are the "understandings" that lie implicit in two elaborate anthropological systems: Levi-Strauss's structuralism and Harris's cultural materialism. Amid their commitments to anthropological "science" and "explanation," the works of each disclose a distinctive Verstehen. For Levi-Strauss, this "understanding" is nurtured by his image "world of reciprocity." For Harris, it is carried by the image "nature." This "understanding" has two major functions. On the level of the intellectual coherence of their texts, it gives unity to their intercultural interpretations of other societies and to their intracultural interpretations of their own traditions. On a moral level, it includes modes of being-in-the-world that Levi-Strauss and Harris prefer and ocasionally press upon their readers. Discernment of symbolic dimensions of "understanding" in anthropologists' texts may be an initial step toward reflection on the matrices out of which diverse explanations are presented in anthropological literature.<br>

Author(s): Bulkley Kelly<br>
Abstract: The subject of dreams and spirituality has received a great deal of attention in recent years. It has not, however, been seriously examined by religious studies scholars; thus, our ability to explore the spiritual potentials of dreams has been left sadly undeveloped. This essay attempts to improve that understanding. The concept of "root metaphors" will be presented as a means of developing a sophisticated, critical understanding of dreams and spirituality. Three dreams in which root metaphors emerge to provide important spiritual meanings for the dreamer will be discussed. Some practical guidelines, oriented around the model of playing with dreams, will also be presented to help make the spiritual dimension of dreams more accessible to psychotherapists, pastoral counselors, and lay people.<br>

Date: 7 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Maidment Richard<br>
Abstract: The conflict between President John F. Kennedy and the management of the steel industry in April, 1962 has been interpreted in an unsatisfactory manner. Many of Kennedy's reactions appear to be inexplicable and do not conform with the impression of him either as an "idealist without illusions" or the calculating cynic of recent revisionist writing. This paper is an attempt to provide another understanding of Kennedy's behaviour. We argue that Kennedy was neither hero nor villain, but a practising politician aware of the obligations and function of his profession in a liberal democratic polity. We suggest that Kennedy was aware of the sensibilities of his constituency and that he possessed a finely attuned ear to the language and discourse of American politics in the early 1960s. Consequently Kennedy realised the peril, in the steel crisis, to his political standing and thus felt compelled to embark on a dramatic and potentially dangerous course of action. We attempt to sustain this argument by closely examining the political language of the participants, relying heavily for our analysis on the writings of the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, the Italian semiologist, Umberto Eco and the Russian linguist V.N. Volosinov.<br>

Author(s): Casey Edward<br>
Abstract: This essay begins by situating the work of David Carr in relation to the reception of phenomenology in the United States. It addresses Carr's early (and continuing) contributions to the philosophy of history, especially as this topic emerges in Husserl's middle and later writings. The idea of point of view as this emerges in Carr's own writings on history is examined, with special attention to differences between its spatial and temporal instantiations. Carr's emphasis on the primacy of temporality in human experience is contrasted with an approach that is more appreciative of the role of place in this experience. It is suggested that place offers an important alternative to time as a basis for the understanding of history and narrative.<br>

Abstract: La autora se interroga acerca del significado de la expresión construir la paz en situaciones posteriores a la comisión de crímenes masivos. Subraya las dificultades específicas que plantea este tipo de circunstancias tanto a los analistas como a los profesionales que participan del proceso, y hace una serie de propuestas metodológicas que atañen al impacto de los crímenes masivos sobre la reconstrucción de las relaciones sociales y políticas en sociedades desgarradas por la guerra. Además, pone énfasis en la importancia de una mejor comprensión de estos procesos, con el fin de destacar los programas de asistencia más eficaces, ya que aquéllos surgen en situaciones sociopolíticas particulares. Al intentar una aproximación a este delicado tema, analistas y profesionales enfrentan dos retos. Primero, deben entender cómo pudo haberse llevado a cabo el crimen masivo. Segundo, deben identificar las posibilidades de paz existentes dentro de la sociedad afectada. Indudablemente, para que las reglas del juego social y político funcionen o, en otras palabras, para que todos los actores se interesen en unirse al juego colectivo, tales posibilidades no pueden ser ignoradas. La construcción de la paz debe incluir métodos locales que, en la mayoría de los casos, se han ido construyendo con el tiempo y han adoptado diferentes métodos provenientes de otras latitudes. /// The author questions the meaning of the expression "peace-building" in circumstances following the perpetration of massive crimes. She stresses the specific difficulties raised by these kind of situations to both analysts and professionals involved in the process, and puts forward a series of methodological proposals concerning the impact of massive crimes on social and political relations' reconstruction within societies torn by war. Also, the author underlines the relevance of having a better understanding of these processes in order to identify which assistance programs may be more effective, as those processes~<br>

Abstract: Handwritten documents as well as printed books and tracts in the indigenous languages of New England's Native Americans in the colonial era enable linguistic scholars to "reclaim" traditional Native speech, "closing the circle" for many Native Americans and providing a solid foundation for group cohesion and cultural identity. In addition, writings by Native Americans and Native voices inherent in documents penned by Euro-American colonials are essential to understanding the details and dynamics of acculturation. A key focus of this article is the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project, which relies heavily on linguistic analysis of historical documents scattered throughout repositories in New England. Endangered languages, cultural diversity, and the multifaceted perspectives preserved in archival repositories have much to teach us.<br>

Article Title: Narrative, Event-Structure Analysis, and Causal Interpretation in Historical Sociology<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i329114<br>
Date: 3 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Zeitlin Larry J.<br>
Abstract: Recent developments in historical sociology emphasize the centrality of temporality to analysis and explanation. Narrative uses temporal order to organize information about events and to foster their understanding but is insufficiently systematic to substitute for sociological explanation. This article illustrates a new interpretative heuristic for the computer- assisted analysis of qualitative narrative sequences, "event-structure analysis,"that infuses narrative with greater rigor and explicitness. Through the analysis of a lynching that took place in Mississippi in 1930, this article shows how event-structure analysis can be used to build replicable and generalizable causal interpretations of events.<br>

Publisher: Franz Steiner Verlag<br>

Date: 1 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): ESCHER ANTON<br>
Abstract: This article pleads for a pragmatic strategy of transcultural understanding as a dialogic concept of insight in social geographic research in the „Islamic Orient“. Transcultural understanding is interpreted as a process of assimilating different systems of meaning, norms, and values of subjects on the one hand, and discourses on how those systems fit together on the other hand (cf. Schwemmer 1996). Understanding is organized by scientifically working out common connections respecting and recognizing foreign codes. As it were, social geographic research needs to generate theoretical frames on a common basis in order to take the differences between cultures as a theme afterwards. In preparation of the argument, the concept of the „gelebten Raum“ (Baier 1996), and the post-modern understanding of space in social geography respectively (Claval 1999) is shortly presented. Additionally, a differentiation of the „Islamic Orient“ is outlined, as are the problems of understanding everyday life and social scientific problems of understanding agency.<br>

Publisher: Higher Education Press and Springer<br>
Issue: i27823295<br>

Author(s): Yiyu Liu<br>
Abstract: The essential significance of scientific metaphor lies in applying the general metaphorical theory to specific interpretations and elaborations of scientific theories to form a methodology of scientific explanation. It is a contextual grasp of objective reality. A given metaphorical context and its grasp of the essence of reality can only be valid when the context is continually restructured. Taking the context as a whole, the methodological characteristic of scientific metaphor lies in the unity of understanding and choice, experience and concepts, semantic structures and metaphorical domains, rationality and irrationality. As a form of thinking based on reasons, scientific metaphor plays an important role in invention, representation, explanation, evaluation, and communication. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦐒𶄶𤡇𠁁𢌒𤅸𣕘𙥨𳌤𰍀𸕄𡥇𩜂𵝰𤈒𩦒𠄐𱆅𣎘𩜂𵝰𰍀𠡕𠌇𵊙𷌢 𡙄𵠨𦄦𠀓, 𰀁𧒒𤐘𥄄𙥨𱆁𱆅𣎘𵊙𷌢𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𤘅𤠙. 𣐧𦅙𣕅𣑘𵉦𣑔𢌒𰍀𙥨𱆁𵠡𢙙𡉰 𥈦𥕩, 𡒂𦍷𵠡𢙙𰍀𙦁𦀩𷌥𦔀, 𥅥𳀡𲑳𣑐𸕄𡥇𵠡𢙙𰍀𣎄𢌒𡑐𠡔𥈦𥕩𣑔𢌒𦐒𶄶𰍀 𦍷𥤨𤘕. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𩌅𤑉𴤠𩘖𠀦: 𩜂𵊙𙦂𶡳𥌡, 𲑣𹕤𙦂𧀐𤕥, 𵠡𠁁𲑧𦔀𙦂 𸕄𡥇𢒕, 𩜂𤘕𙦂𸝐𩜂𤘕𰍀𲑹𙥨. 𠌖𠀦𙥨𱆁𦍷𩜂𰀁𥔒𩜂𰍀𤘅𲔀𤐘𤌵, 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𠡕𦍷 𡑗𦄦, 𴤠𤑉, 𵠨𦄦, 𵞀𠈕𡑐𠄲𧥩𱕡𦁁𸝔𰍀𷌥𵈁𡅑𳀡.<br>

Article Title: Tillich['s] Remains...<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion, Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i27919256<br>
Date: 12 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Smith Jonathan Z.<br>
Abstract: This essay makes explicit what lay behind the author's earlier casual observation that "Tillich remains the unacknowledged theoretician of our entire enterprise"—whether in the AAR or in North American studies of religion more generally. While the article does not make a narrowly (i.e., archivally verified) causal claim about Tillich's influence on the study of religion in the academy, it does point out three crucial roles Tillich's thought and practice played in the development of North American religious studies. (i) Tillich's understanding of religion as an "ultimate concern" provided a language deemed suitable to the new departments of religious studies in this country's higher education institutions (especially at state-run colleges and universities). (ii) Though not uniquely formative of the academy's longstanding discourse on symbolism, Tillich's interest in the symbol served as a legitimating vote of confidence about the worth of that discourse. Moreover, his understanding of the symbol (as that which "points to") ostensibly struck a balance between Eliade's onto-realistic and Geertz's more minimal fictive views of the symbol. (iii) Through his sustained interest in cultural institutions and products of cultural labor—more than through his theories about the relation between religion and culture (e.g., his method of correlation)—Tillich inspired the "dialogic fields" (e.g., Religion and Literature) and subsequent cultural and anthropological studies of religion. The author's earlier claim, then, was intended as a double critique: first, that the study of religion in secular public institutions should ground itself in a Protestant Christian theological project; second, that this influence should remain largely unacknowledged.<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>

Author(s): Pepper Chunglin<br>
Abstract: This paper considers some aspects of the early history of the American contribution to the International Biological Programme (IBP), ecology's only venture into 'Big Science'. It is argued that American ecologists were successful in obtaining generous funding for the IBP from the US Congress, thanks to a shared understanding of the way in which controlling nature was to be accomplished, expressed in the metaphor of the 'cybernetic machine'. To support this argument, a literary analysis is performed on Congressional documents, on scientific and popular books and papers by ecologists, and on writings of the environmental movement. The paper explores how a dominant representation of nature, or mentalité, is brought about, and its political effects.<br>

Abstract: Before World War II the intellectual climate of American sociology was congenial to the growth of a sociology of knowledge akin to Mannheim's. Yet in the postwar period American sociologists committed themselves to ahistorical theory, positivist methodology, and team research; their "scientistic" sociology did not permit the historicism, relativism, and holism necessary to Mannheimian analysis. Currently, however, convergent trends in a number of disciplines--not only sociology but also philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, and the histories of ideas, science, and art--favor a revival of the Mannheimian program. Analysts of culture now seek to integrate the sociological goals of "explanation" and "understanding"--the formulation of quasi-laws of behavior, based on identification of the social structural elements of culture production, and the interpretation of the subjective meaning of culture, based on recovery of actors' intentions. Their research program requires investigation of the peculiar sociohistorical circumstances that condition actors' perceptions, necessitating attention to the cognitive content of culture. This article surveys both the theoretical justifications for such a research program and recent exemplifications of it, focusing on anlyses of what Mannheim termed "objective culture"--such symbolic vehicles for conceptions as religion, the arts, science, and political thought that acquire independent existence, becoming subject to diverse interpretations.<br>

Abstract: Particular problems are posed in the study of lives since the course of life may be less continuous and predictable than sometimes assumed. Further, the most important aspect of developmental study may be the subjectively constructed narrative of development, or life history, which itself changes over personal and historical time. Following the interpretive approach pioneered by Dilthey, Weber, Freud, and, more recently, Ricoeur, Taylor, and others, lives may be considered as texts to be studied in a systematic manner. The concept of empathy as formulated within the clinical situation, and applied most recently to study of biography, may also foster understanding of changes over time in the life history.<br>

Issue: i360633<br>
Date: 7 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Blades David<br>
Abstract: Against the backdrop of Blades's analysis in Foucauldian terms of the failure of a particular science-technology-society reform, this review addresses four questions: (1) the problem of postmodern writing as a language of rupture; (2) the justification of science-technology-society approaches to science teaching; (3) the fruitfulness of Foucault's explanatory framework for understanding educational change; (4) the fruitfulness of Foucault's framework for education theory in general. It is argued that Foucault's notion of authors who are "founders of discursivity" can form the basis of both a productive theory of educational change and also of an educational vision in which a school strives to become a community of such founders of discursivity.<br>

Publisher: Northeastern Political Science Association<br>

Date: 12 1, 1977<br>
Author(s): Lukács William M.<br>
Abstract: Students of society are increasingly relating the legitimacy crisis facing industrial nations to the erosion of moral traditions. Habermas sees the problem as a historical crisis and calls for the reconstruction of our understanding of moral authority on the basis of practical reason, on which justice and truth rest. The key to our understanding of growth problems is to be found in our cultural situation rather than in the formalistic functional or instrumental theories of positivism. William Sullivan sees a major problem of Habermas's approach, which he subjects to careful examination, in the relation of theoretical understanding to engaged critical activity.<br>

Article Title: The Division of Labor in Social Science Research: Unified Methodology or "Organic Solidarity"?<br>
Publisher: Northeastern Political Science Association<br>
Issue: i362393<br>
Date: 7 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Somers Rudra<br>
Abstract: Since contending methodological perspectives and different types of research products are founded on irreconcilable philosophical assumptions, the sharp, recurrent debates over social science research methods are likely to be fruitless and counterproductive. This article begins by exposing some of the philosophical assumptions underlying the most recent calls for a unified social science methodology and seeks to help develop a common appreciation of how different kinds of methods and research products advance our understanding of different aspects of social life at different levels of abstraction. Such commonly posited dichotomies as deductivist/inductivist logic, quantitative/qualitative analysis, and nomothetic/idiographic research products are shown to obscure significant differences along a continuum of strategies through which context-bound information and analytic constructs are combined to produce interpretations of varying degrees of complexity or generality. Durkheim's conception of "organic solidarity" in a social "division of labor" serves as a useful metaphor here to capture the complementary roles performed by various research products as well as the trade-offs arising from the strengths and weaknesses of various methodological approaches (ranging from formal and statistical approaches to various case-based and interpretive approaches). Thus, sharp claims regarding the strengths and limitations of particular methods are transformed into elements of an overarching agnostic understanding of the trade-offs and complementarities among these methods. Finally, a distinctive role is identified for an ideal-typical "middle-range" comparative-historical approach in fostering greater communication among a more inclusively defined community of methodologically diverse social scientists.<br>

Article Title: Semantic Innovation: Arithmetical and Algebraic Metaphors within Narratives of Learning<br>
Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i277383<br>
Date: 10 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Wilden Dave<br>
Abstract: This paper examines a theoretical perspective on the ways in which children progress in learning mathematics. It suggests that there is a difficulty in associating teaching discourses with the mathematics they locate. This can result in an incommensurability between alternative perspectives being offered. The paper resists attempts to privilege any particular account but rather demands an analysis of these discourses and their presuppositions. In developing these themes the paper invokes Ricoeur's analysis of time and narrative as an analytical approach to treating notions such as transition, development and progression in mathematical learning. His notion of semantic innovation is introduced. This embraces both the introduction of a new metaphor into a sentence or the creation of a new narrative which reorganises events into a new 'plot'. The notion is utilised in arguing that the shift in the student's mathematical development from arithmetic to first order linear equations with unknowns reconfigures the contextual parameters governing the understanding of these mathematical forms. It is also utilised in showing how alternative approaches to accounting for such transitions suit different and perhaps conflicting outcomes. For example, demonstrating awareness of generality or performing well in a diagnostic test featuring the solution of linear equations.<br>

Author(s): Zuck W. Widick<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the professionalization of religious research in the United States and related topics. Because professional societies illumine value orientations and practices among workers in a given field, the nature of the American Catholic Sociological Society, the American Society of Christian Ethics, the Religious Research Association, and the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion are briefly considered. The differential appropriation of religious research in various ecclesiastical bodies, the problem of funding religious research in the American situation, and the shift in emphasis from a pragmatic problem-solving approach focused on institutional survival to a more theoretical approach to the understanding of religious phenomena are discussed. The bifurcation between persons interested in religious research trained under theological faculties and those trained under social science faculties is noted. Likely future lines of development in theory and research are projected.<br>

Abstract: Desde hace una década, el concepto tradicional de "cultura" en antropología ha experimentado un nuevo auge tanto en las ciencias sociales como en el público en general. No obstante, en el discurso de la antropología, la teoría holística de la cultura fue abandonada desde hace mucho tiempo debido a problemas de variación entre las culturas, de poder, de cambio cultural y de acción individual. La parte principal del artículo formula un concepto de "cultura" como proceso inestable, abierto, de negociación del significado; si puede establecerse un consenso, dicho proceso conduce a una estabilización de los sistemas simbólicos y observamos los procesos correspondientes de una relación social cerrada al exterior [Weber]. La última parte analiza las repercusiones que dicho concepto de "cultura" (vinculado a una teoría del conflicto y del consenso) acarrea para el papel que tiene la antropología en el ámbito público y en el campo de las disciplinas científicas. /// Since a decade, a revival of the traditional anthropological concept of "culture" can be observed in the social sciences as well as in the larger public. In anthropological discourse, however, the holistic theory of culture has long been abandoned, because of the problems of intra-cultural variation, of power, of cultural change and individual action. The main part of the article develops an understanding of culture as an unstable, open process of negotiating meaning, which leads, if a consensus can be established, to a stabilization of symbolic systems and corresponding processes of social closure [Weber]. The concluding part discusses the implications that such a conflict-compromise oriented concept of "culture" has for the role of anthropology in the public sphere and in the field of scientific disciplines.<br>

Author(s): Marcus Fred<br>
Abstract: This essay serves to introduce Jasper Johns' most recent series of paintings and, in particular, "Catenary (Manet-Degas)" of 1999 (Private collection). It does this with reference to the use that Johns made of a note from Marcel Duchamp's "Green Box" when, in 1959, he had to provide a statement about his art for inclusion in the catalogue that accompanied the 'Sixteen Americans' exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Johns' use of this note is considered with regard to seeing and understanding "Flag" of 1954-55 (Museum of Modern Art, New York), "Souvenir" of 1964 (Collection of the artist on loan to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art), and "Catenary" (Manet-Degas). The essay insists on the distinction that can be made between the 'art object' and the 'work of art' and between the 'ordinary' or 'everyday self' of the artist who makes the former and the 'extraordinary self' of the artist that comes in place by way of the latter. In the work of art the human being tries 'to reach the Impossibility of a different way of being-in-the world and of being-at-one-with-itself'.<br>

Abstract: N'y aurait-il que les philosophes à s'interroger sur le temps? Les historiens resteraient-ils positivistes au point de bouder toute réflexion sur cette catégorie qui gît pourtant au cœur de leur discipline? "L'ordre du temps," de K. Pomian, qui vient de paraître chez Gallimard, montre combien le temps des historiens a varié et à quels dangers ils s'exposent en n'y prenant pas garde. /// Should time be a philosophical question? In general, French historians seem to have neglected this essential problem concerning reflection on time. Both because of a positivist tradition which seeks the linearity of the event and of a mistrust of the philosophy of history, they have not wanted to come to grips with the question of temporality. And yet the very nature of history comes from this question. K. Pomian's recent book, "L'ordre du temps" (Gallimard) illustrates the richness of the philosophic thinking on the variation of the notion of time and its importance in understanding the various historical schools.<br>

Abstract: Memory, persistence, and cultural transmission are hot topics in anthropology today. Contributing to an increasing anthropological interest in youth agency, in this article I invite readers to look at youth as a crucial site for understanding issues of religious memory and cultural transmission. In the past five decades, Bulongic people (Guinea-Conakry) have undergone significant religious changes caused by the introduction of Islam, which has led to the official disappearance of pre-Islamic rituals. In this article, I explore how young Bulongic remember a pre-Islamic past that they have never experienced. I argue that, to understand how they assimilate and perpetuate this religious heritage, one must examine the subtle processes of intergenerational transmission through which their memories are dynamically shaped.<br>

Abstract: In this article, I examine the institutional, cultural, and discursive foundations of a historical event. I explicate global, transnational, national, intercultural, ethnic, regional, local, and personal realms of understanding as well as a range of discursive and pragmatic strategies as they came into play in a schoolroom meeting that led to the writing of a letter to the United Nations for help. The case presented is that of a group of people in a small, majority-indigenous village in Kamchatka in the Russian Far East, who, in 1993, after the collapse of the Soviet government and its support network, decided to turn to the United Nations for help.<br>

Author(s): Westin Georges<br>
Abstract: Recalling several profound disagreements about business ethics as it is currently discussed in Western societies, I emphasize the need for business ethics as an academic discipline that constitutes the "backbone" for both teaching business ethics and improving business practice (section 1). Then I outline a conceptual framework of business ethics that promotes a "bottom-up" approach (section 2). This "problem- and action-oriented" conception appears to be fruitful in terms of both practical relevance and theoretical understanding. Finally, I argue for (section 3) the relevance of discussing goals at all levels of human action (i.e., individuals, organizations, systems) as well as the indispensability of human rights, and propose Amartya Sen's "goal-rights-system" approach as a normative-ethical framework for business ethics that integrates these two fundamental aspects.<br>

Abstract: There can be ethical understanding of organizational policy issues and that is important. However, there can be policy understanding about what the organization should do without understanding of individual level responsibility. There can be cognitive understanding of both policy and individual level ethics responsibilities and that is important. However, there can be cognitive understanding without affective, emotive concern. intellectual understanding without affective concern can lead to understanding without motivation. There can be cognitive understanding and affective concern and that is important, but not enough. There can be cognitive understanding and affective concern without effective political method. An action-learning approach to organizational ethics can join cognitive understanding of policy and individual level issues with both affective concern and effective political method. Joining of cognitive understanding, affective concern, and effective political method can stimulate and enable ethical character.<br>

Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's understanding of the relations of faith, love, and hope suggests a unique approach to theological ethics, one that holds fresh promise for bringing together considerations of the good (teleology) and the right (deontology) around the notion of an "economy of the gift." The economy of the gift articulates Ricoeur's distinctively dialectical understanding of the relation of the human and the divine, and the resulting dialectical moral relation of the self and the other. Despite our fallen condition, Ricoeur suggests, we are called by the divine to embrace the radical possibility of the reconciliation of human goods under the requirement of accountability to human diversity and otherness.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000790<br>
Date: 10 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Ferreira M. Jamie<br>
Abstract: Levinas's ethics of other-centered service has been criticized at the theoretical level for failing to offer a conception of moral agency adequate to ground its imperative and at the practical level for encouraging self-hatred. Levinas's explicit resistance to the incorporation of the phrase "as yourself" in the Judaeo-Christian love command might seem to validate the critics' complaints. The author argues, on the contrary, that Levinas does offer a strong and compelling conception of moral agency and that his ethics, properly understood, does not entail self-abnegation. Levinas's attempt to counter excessive and manipulative self-concern and self-inflation by insisting on the dependent and situational position of the self has been wrongly overinterpreted as an abandonment of the self and its just claims. The author seeks to establish a more balanced understanding by focusing attention on the "ethics of welcome," on Levinas's distinctive conception of passivity, and on the role of "the third" in all human relations.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000901<br>

Author(s): Ferreira M. Jamie<br>
Abstract: Levinas himself raises the question: "why would I feel responsible in the presence of the Face" since "we are separate ontological beings?" This questions the character of our response to the other--both in terms of agency and motivation. While the general reception of Levinas's thought has focused on his description of us as "hostage"--that is, on the moment of assignation (or assignment) by the other--I suggest that Levinas himself also, though not as directly, addresses (as he needs to) the correlative moment, the moment of response. My essay reconstructs Levinas's implicit understanding of the character of our initiative in the light of his concept of Desire. I explore the different dimensions of Desire as appetite and generosity, and I argue that the "transition to moral consciousness" that Levinas wants to "justify" is one from complacent happiness to "non-complacent happiness" and can be illuminated by the notion of "passion seeking its downfall."<br>

Issue: i40000905<br>

Author(s): Ogletree Thomas W.<br>
Abstract: The essay sets forth a historical style in ethics. At the center is the explication of meanings forming the life worlds of representative actors in concrete situations. The sense of life world is sketched in terms of intentionality, intersubjectivity, temporality and embodiment. The essay then delineates the kinds of interpretative activity relevant for understanding life situations: the application of received conventions; suspicion of those conventions as distortions of underlying personal/social dynamics; and a dialectical interplay between a retrieval of one's own traditions, and hospitality to understandings of others differently oriented to the situations in question. The goal is the achievement of common ground which enables us to determine "fitting" action, or at least to keep open the wholeness it promises.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000935<br>
Date: 3 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: Challenging a long-standing assumption of the separation of ethical from poetic activity, this essay develops the basis for a theory of moral life as inherently and radically creative. A range of contemporary post-Kantian ethicists--including Ricoeur, Nussbaum, Kearney, and Gutiérrez--are employed to make the argument that moral practice requires a fundamental capability for creative transformation, imagination, and social renewal. In addition, this poetic moral capability can finally be understood only from the primordial religious point of view of the mystery of Creation as such. Humanity as an image of its Creator is called to the endless impossible possibility of the re-creation of its own complex, plural, and fallen social world. Such a perspective is opposed to views of moral life as the application of law-like principles or the recovery of past moral histories. Without a better understanding of moral life's radically creative imperative, we miss a vital element of social relations' distinctive humanity.<br>

Abstract: El objetivo del artículo es describir rasgos estructurales de la comprensión de metáforas mediante una comparación con la comprensión de otras culturas, tal como ésta ha sido comentada por Wittgenstein y Geertz. El fenómeno de estudio es la comprensión enfática (no básica) de metáforas fuertes (no de metáforas convencionales y muertas). La comparación entre ambos tipos de comprensión sirve para plantear y dar respuesta a tres preguntas desatendidas en la profusa literatura sobre la metáfora: 1) ¿En qué sentido nos sorprenden las metáforas fuertes? 2) ¿En qué sentido pueden ser profundas? 3) ¿En qué sentido hablamos de la riqueza de este fenómeno lingüístico? /// This paper sets out to describe the structural features of metaphor comprehension through a comparison with the process of understanding other cultures construed along the lines proposed by Wittgenstein and Geertz. The phenomenon under analysis is the emphatic (not basic) understanding of strong (not conventional or dead) metaphors. The comparison between understanding metaphors and cultures serves to raise and answer three questions that have been neglected in the vast literature on metaphors: 1) In which sense do strong metaphors surprise us? 2) In which sense can a metaphor be profound? 3) In which sense do we speak of the richness of this linguistic phenomenon?<br>

Abstract: The development of the intellectual basis for planning activity has been a slow and problematic process. This paper seeks to build on existing intellectual understanding to argue that future developments in planning thought must take questions of ethical value as their starting point. The paper is essentially divided into three parts. The first makes the important distinction between planning as a narrow set of regulatory practices and planning as an idea, or more particularly a long-enduring societal activity. It is the latter concept of planning that frames the discussion in the remainder of the paper. The second, in which the core of the argument is developed, explores the nature of planning as an activity; an activity that is centrally concerned with making ethical judgements about better and worse, with and for others, in just institutions. It is about an idea of value. The third section examines the implications of this perspective for planning as a subject of academic endeavour. The argument is illustrated throughout with examples drawn from the author's research.<br>

Abstract: Vico maintained that metaphor is a fundamental process of human mental life which bridges the gap between emotion and cognition. This Vichian perspective is reflected in areas of critical theory treating metaphor and other tropes, particularly their use in narrative. In psychology too, the significance of metaphor is increasingly recognized despite the Cartesian emphasis on literal thought and language in contemporary psychology's central paradigm, cognitive science. The paper compares the Cartesian and Vichian perspectives and suggests that the former limits the integrated treatment of cognition and emotion. This is illustrated with an example of how a child's feelings about a distressing situation are both revealed and changed in storytelling. The Vichian perspective is more appropriate to understanding this therapeutic interaction of cognition and emotion through metaphoric narrative play. This perspective has significant echoes in psychoanalytic and textual studies suggesting how sensitivity to the latent content of narrative metaphors offers both speaker and hearer a unique insight into the experience of the narrator.<br>

Las teorías sociológicas, desde el Ochocientos hasta hoy, se han dividido en dos grandes campos: a) Por un lado, han habido teorías que han adoptado un "paradigma olístico". b) Por otro, han emergido teorías que, juzgando las primeras como infectadas de determinismo, han elaborado un "paradigma accionista". Muchos autores han mezclado o combinado juntos ora una, ora otra de estas posturas sin lograr encontrar un punto de vista capaz de integrarlas o trascenderlas. El resultado es que, hoy, la mayor parte de las teorías oscilan entre el primer y el segundo paradigma, o bien tratan de comprender el cambio social a través de mezclas o "fórmulas combinatorias" entre las dos. La tesis del autor es que ni las teorías sistémicas (olísticas) ni las accionísticas (individualistas) ni sus combinaciones pueden encontrar una "comprensión adecuada" del cambio social. Ofrecen visiones parciales de la historia, que son insuficientes en tanto que comparten una carencia común: la idea de que la relación social sea un resultado (un efecto) de "otras" variables en juego, como las estructuras sociales o --por el contrario-- la subjetividad individual, o bien un determinismo en sí misma. Para comprender el cambio social se precisa de una teoría adecuada al carácter relacional de la realidad social, como realidad sui generis "hecha de" relaciones sociales. Se propone aquí un paradigma, denominado "relacional", según el cual el cambio social consiste en la "emergencia" de realidades sociales movidas por sujetos (individuales y colectivos) queestán en relación entre ellos en un determinado sentido. "Comprender" signifìca "relacionarse" con todo lo que tal relación (¡social!) significa y comporta. En la parte final se trata de ejemplificar las potenc~<br>

Abstract: El artículo trata de resaltar tanto la especificidad como las dificultades en la comprensión de la comunicación política. Concebida ésta, desde Aristóteles, como singular combinación de racionalidad y emotividad, ha sido blanco de variados ataques. Estos abarcan desde la habitual desconfianza, intelectual y popular, hacia las prácticas políticas hasta la búsqueda, en filosofía y lógica, de un lenguaje puramente referencial o denotativo. Sin embargo, se argumenta aquí, entender el lenguaje político requiere conjugar otros enfoques sobre significado (antropología del lenguaje, pragmática de Austin y continuadores, teoría habermasiana de la acción comunicativa), diferentes entre sí, pero coincidentes en recuperar aspectos clave de la retórica clásica. También se apunta a algunas inevitables carencias de esos enfoques en materias tan complejas como las que tienen que ver con el lenguaje. /// This paper sets out to highlight both the specifíc nature and the difficulties of understanding political communication. Conceived since Aristotle's day as a singular combination of rationality and emotion, it has been the target of varied attacks. These range from the habitual distrust, intellectual and popular, of politics, to the quest, in philosophy and logic, of a purely referential or denotative language. However, the author contends that in order to understand political language, other approaches to its meaning must be taken into account (linguistic anthropology, the pragmatics of Austin and those who followed him, Habermas' theory of commuhicative action), which, while different in themselves, retrieve key aspects of classical rhetoric. The author also singles out certain inevitable shortfalls vis-à-vis these approaches in such complex fíelds as those related to language.<br>

Abstract: Reinhart Koselleck outlined a model of historical time in various essays most of them collected in the anthologies "Zeitschichten" and "Vergangene Zukunft". The article tries to reconstruct Koselleck's transcendental principals of history. It questions Koselleck's understanding of natural time and anthropological categories. According to Hans Georg Gadamer's criticism of Koselleck, the article argues that even Koselleck's anthropological categories are always already determined by culture and history. Historical time and historical truth are constructed by historical narrations. This conviction does not imply, however, the denial of historical reality. The author suggests combining Koselleck's categories "Erfahrungsraum" and "Erwartungshorizont" with a narratological point of view.<br>

Abstract: Examining historical photographs can open paths to improved understanding of the history of most disciplines, including medicine. Images can be "read" and advantageously integrated with other historical "traces." Documents, including photographs, are "orphaned" when separated from their creators and used out of context. Archivists share with historians the responsibility for considering interpretations of the documentary record. Cultivating subject-specific understanding as well as general historical awareness expands our competency to read photographs and promotes more contextualized and historically grounded uses of information.<br>

Author(s): Fink-Jensen Kirsten<br>
Abstract: In this paper Kirsten Fink-Jensen suggests how a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective can contribute to the knowledge of learning and teaching processes in music education in school The philosophical frame is Danish philosophy of life, represented by Knud Ejler Løgstrup, and Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of body, both pointing to the wholeness of mind and body in all kinds of actions. Within this framework interpretation is an epistemological, practical-hermeneutic activity based on different analytical methods. Phenomenologically, experiences of music are constituted in an intertwinement of personal, cultural, and local meaning. The challenge facing the teacher is then to understand what becomes meaningful to persons in a given situation. 'Bodily dialogue' is a metaphor of a hermeneutic process of understanding that highlights the importance of bodily aspects in the teacher's answer to a child's musical attuned articulations. This focus can facilitate children's learning processes and change and qualify the teacher's didactic reflections on the impact and progression of music lessons.<br>

Author(s): Do Carmo Silva Carlos Henrique<br>
Abstract: O presente estudo constitui um ensaio crítico de reflexão sobre a questão dos limites da linguagem em Wittgenstein. A perspectiva deste estudo observa, numa primeira parte, o próprio procedimento do método wittgen-steiniano e segue um modelo de discurso plural, a partir de várias perspectivas que, não só permitem desconstruir a aparente unidade da razão, como indagar interiormente do próprio limite da análise wittgensteiniana. Retomando a caracterização da linguagem e do pensamento nos seus traços fundamentais, desde o "Tractatus" até às "Investigações Filosóficas", chama-se a atenção para os pontos de dificuldade, da indefinição e da cons-trutividade do modelo de Wittgenstein. A plena lição do "autómaton" da linguagem face a uma possível diferenciação dos signos e aprofundamento lógico, constitui uma parte desta reflexão que se complementa pela referência aos horizontes de resíduo do não-linguístico, ou até do indizível, numa dupla maneira de estabelecer os limites da linguagem. Enfim, e a título conclusivo, apontam-se, não apenas os contornos do que se entende como uma moral retórica da linguagem em Wittgenstein, mas para perspectivas originais de um reaprofundamento em termos etioló-gicos de diferenciação de escala da lógica e da linguagem, e de recuperação de uma intencionalidade psico-lógico-linguística superando aquela indiferen-ciação do dizer no automático da fala estatuída na "ordinary language". /// La présente étude constitue un essai critique qui réfléchie sur la question des limites du langage dans la philosophie de Wittgenstein. Dans une première partie la perspective de cette réflexion analise les procédés que Wittgenstein lui-même utilise dans sa méthode, et pour cela se sert d'un modèle de discours pluriel, lequel permet non seulement la déconstruction de l'apparente unité de la raison, mais aussi faire une enquête au dedans des limites de l'analyse wittgensteinienne.

Abstract: Este estudo dedica-se à teoria da verdade tal como se apresenta nas obras de Ricoeur entre 1947 e 1960. Procura-se sublinhar o vaivém entre uma compreensão ontológica da verdade, marcada antes de mais pelo pensamento de Karl Jaspers (1947), e uma compreensão fenomenológica da verdade centrada na teoria do juízo (1960). Contudo a análise da tensão entre a unidade do verdadeiro e a multiplicidade das filosofias permite elaborar o conceito de verdade como comunicação e de verdade como objecto de esperança. Procura-se então mostrar o fundamento desta esperança bem como a dimensão pela qual ela ultrapassa o universo da filsosofia. A conclusão sublinha que os desenvolvimentos ulteriores de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sobre a hermenêutica do símbolo, da metáfora e da narrativa ganham em serem relidos no horizonte das tensões do problema da verdade. /// Cette étude est consacrée à la théorie de la vérité telle qu'elle se présente dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur entre 1947 et 1960. On cherche à souligner le va-et-vient entre une compréhension ontologique de la vérité initielement influencée par la pensée de Karl Jaspers 1947, et une compréhension phénoménologique de la vérité centrée sur la théorie du jugement (1960). L'analyse de la tension entre l'unité du vrai et la multiplicité des philosophies débouche cependant sur le concept de vérité comme communication et comme object d'espérence. On cherche alors à montrer le fondement de cette espérance ainsi que la dimension par laquelle elle dépasse l'univers de la philosophie. La conclusion souligne que les développements ultérieurs de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sur l'herméneutique du symbole, de la métaphore et du récit ont tout à gagner à être replacés et relus à l'horizon des tensions du problème de la vérité. /// This study pays special attention to the theory of truth elaborated in Ricoeur's work from 1947 to 1960.

Abstract: Um filósofo com quem Paul Ricoeur manteve um interessante e fecundo relacionamento, durante mais de trinta anos, foi Gabriel Mareei, pensador de que se celebrou em 1989 o Centenário (7.121889 - 7.121989). Esta exposição procura evidenciar alguns aspectos filosóficos que Paul Ricoeur colhe na lição marceliana. Nesse sentido, a obra que serviu de fio condutor a esta reflexão foi publicada com o título "Entretiens Paul Ricoeur-Gabriel Marcel, que se constituiu como um diálogo discípulo-mestre, e isto a partir de algumas problemáticas que numa espécie de marceliano regard en arrière, surgem como correspondendo aos nós da filosofia de Gabriel Marcel. /// Un philosophe avec lequel Paul Ricoeur a maintenu durant plus de trente ans des rapports intéressants aussi bien que féconds est Gabriel Marcel, penseur dont on vient de célébrer en 1989 le Centenaire (7.121889–7.121989). Le présent exposé se fait dans le but de mettre en évidence certains aspects philosophiques que Paul Ricoeur emprunte de la leçon marcélienne. L'ouvrage servant de fil conducteur pour ces réflexions, qui a été publié sous le titre Entretiens Paul Ricoeur-Gabriel Marcel, assume la forme d'un dialogue disciple-maître, en partant de certaines problématiques qui, par une espèce de marcélien regard en arrière, correspondent à vrai dire aux noeuds de la philosophie de Gabriel Marcel. /// Gabriel Marcel is a philosopher with whom Paul Ricoeur and mantained one interesting relationship for more than thirty years.

Abstract: Vale a pena voltar a analisar a relação entre o mal e a religião em Kant. Mas este artigo aborda a problemática prévia a esta questão, isto é, a própria questão do mal tal como Kant a apresenta na primeira parte do livro de 1793, A religião nos limites da simples razão. Depois da introdução que elucida o espanto dos primeiros leitores deste livro, procura-se, na base da análise hermenêutica dos textos, verificar a articulação entre a disposição originária para o bem e a propensão para o mal. Encontra-se em seguida a aporia da relação entre o desejo e a realidade do mal: de onde provém o desejo do mal moral? Será preciso, no itinerário desta resposta, elucidar o conceito de natureza, bem como a relação com a interpretação kantiana do pecado original. A conclusão volta a introduzir a questão da liberdade na compreensão do mal, numa espécie de tensão pós-kantiana entre moral e metafísica. ///Il convient de réanalyser la relation entre le mal et la religion chez Kant. Le présent article aborde cependant une problématique préalable á celle-ci, á savoir la question meme du mal telle que Kant la présente dans la première partie du livre de 1793, La religion dans les limites de la simple raison. Après l'ntroduction qui rappelle 1'étonnement des premiers lecteurs de ce livre, on essaie, sur la base d'une analyse herméneutique des textes. de discerner l'articulation entre la disposition originaire pour le bien et la propension au mal. On rencontre ensuite l'aporie entre le désir et la rélité du mal: d'où vient le mal? Sur l'itinéraire de cette réponse il faudra éclaircir le concept de nature, ainsi que l'interprétation kantienne du péché originel. La conclusion réintroduit la question de la liberté dans la compréhension du mal, en une sorte de tension post-kantienne entre morale et metaphysique. /// The relation between evil and religion in the philosophy of Kant deserves e renewed analysis.

Abstract: Este artigo tem por tema a relação entre a Filosofia da História e a problemática epistemólogica da complexidade. A teoria do conhecimento histórico ou epistemologia da História nao pode ser vista de modo linear ou unívoco porque tem sofrido mutações nos seus quadros conceptuais compáraveis às revoluções cientificas concebidas pelo filosofo e historiador das ciências Thomas Kuhn, destacando-se quatro paradigmas (continuando a usar a terminologia deste autor) do conhecimento histórico: o paradigma "omnicompreensivo", que visa compreender o sentido global da História e tem como representante máximo Hegel, retomado no contexto actual por Francis Fukuyama com a sua tese sobre o tlm da Historia: o paradigma positivista guiado por uma ideia de objectividade do conhecimento histórico hoje considerada redutora: o relativismo emergente com o "fim das grandes narrativas de legitimação do saber" e a fragmentação do sentido no pensamento pós-modemo; e a "História aberta" ao misterio do tempo, problematizadora, que constrói o seu objecto na complexidade da relação interdisciplinar com outros saberes, limitada aos instrumentos conceptuais ou técnicos do historiador e excedendo qualquer sistema conceptual fechado mas mantendo uma inquietacao metodologica orientada pela busca interminável de sentido. É este último paradigma -epistemológico, hermenêutico e histórico - que é defendido neste estudo. /// This essay deals with the relation between the philosophy of history and the epistemological problem of complexity.

Issue: i40014488<br>
Date: 12 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Renaud François<br>
Abstract: Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics rests largely on the concept of the classical. According to Gadamer, the classical stands for the continuity and the truth claim of the tradition, as transmitted by the written word. The normative character of the classical is directed against the neutrality and relativism of historicism: understanding does not occur primarily through distancing or methodological reconstruction but through belongingness to, and participation in, the past. The article shows how, given the central importance of dialogue and otherness in Gadamer's theory, the philosopher does not seem to fully do justice to the critical intention of its own dialogical and philological dimensions. On the other hand, it shows also how Gadamer's hermeneutical practice, notably in his rehabilitation of Plato, stresses the learning from otherness more explicitly than does his own theory, thus correcting, as it were, the latter. The article aims, finally, at demonstrating how, by unduly emphasizing the continuity (and sameness) in the encounter between past and present, Gadamer's theory undermines the importance of reconstructing the otherness and specificity of the classical text. /// A hermenêutica filosófica de Gadamer, entendida como uma defesa das humanidades, assenta essencialmente sobre o conceito de clássico. Segundo Gadamer, o clássico representa a continuidade e a pretensão à verdade da tradição tal como nos é transmitida pela palavra escrita. O carácter normativo do clássico em Gadamer constitui assim uma resposta crítica à neutralidade e ao relativismo do historicismo: a compreensão não acontece primariamente graças a um processo de distanciação ou reconstrução metódica, mas sim pelo facto de, desde logo, reconhecermos que temos pertença activa no passado. O presente artigo demonstra como, dada a importância central do diálogo e da alteridade na teoria de Gadamer, ofilósofo acaba por não fazer inteiramente justiça à intenção crítica inerente à dimensão dialógi~<br>

Abstract: Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy is most well known for its phenomenology of interpretation in the Geisteswissenschaften or humanities. It moves Heidegger's ' As–structure ' of understanding through an appreciation of the primacy of questioning to the dialogical structure of interpretation as mediated by language. This phenomenology grounds a linguistic ontology, which rehabilitates metaphysics as a renewal of the tradition of a metaphysics of light, without transgressing the limits of phenomenological accessibility. The result is a metaphysics of finitude that is undogmatically open to the infinite. At the heart of this linguistic ontology is the speculative structure by which language-in-use is related to being in a way that overcomes all kinds of representationalism and of naive picture-thinking (including empiricism and idealism). Hans-Georg Gadamer's ontology is postmodern yet genuinely metaphysical. /// A filosofia hermenêutica de Hans-Georg Gadamer é particularmente conhecida pela sua fenomenologia da interpretação no âmbito das Ciências do Espírito (Geisteswissenschaften). Pela importancia que dá à primazia da interrogação, Gadamer transforma a estrutura heideggeriana do como da compreensão numa estrutura dialógica da interpretação mediada pela linguagem. Esta fenomenologia fundamenta uma ontologia linguística, a qual constitui uma rehabilitação da metafisica sob a forma de uma reactualização da tradição que é a metafisica da luz, mas sem contudo transgredir os limites impostos pela acessibilidade fenomenológica da questão. Daí resulta uma metafisica da finitude aberta ao infinito de forma não dogmática. No centro desta ontologia linguística está uma estrutura especulativa segundo a qual a linguagem-uso se relaciona com o ser de forma a que todo e qualquer tipo de representacionalismo ou pensamento-imagem (onde se incluem tanto o empirismo como o idealismo) seja superado. O artigo visa, pois, demonstrar até que ponto a ontologia de Hans-Georg Gada~<br>

Abstract: This article presents a variety of philosophical answers to the age old question: unde malum - where does evil come from? Starting with the metaphysical responses of Augustine, Hegel and Kant, it proceeds to examine some more recent approaches - Lyotard, Kristeva and Zizek - in terms of the 'postmodern sublime'. He concludes by proposing a 'hermeneutic' response to the problem, inspired by Paul Ricoeur, which seeks to address the question in terms of narrative understanding and practical action. /// O presente artigo apresenta uma série de respostas filosóficas à imemorial questão: unde malum - qual a origem do mal? Partindo das respostas metafísicas de Santo Agostinho, Hegel e Kant, o autor examina depois algumas das abordagens mais recentes ao problema - Lyotard, Kristeva e Zizek - em termos do 'sublime pós-moderno', O artigo conclui com uma proposta 'hermenêutica 'para o problema, proposta essa inspirada no pensamento de Paul Ricoeur e cujo objectivo é elucidar a questão do mal em termos de uma compreensão narrativa e de acção prática.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo procura mostrar os limites de uma abordagem epistemológica da Psicanálise, sem que essa conclusão implique um abandono das nossas pretensões de racionalidade. Uma abordagem que poderia ser fecunda e tornar inteligível o destino histórico da psicanálise, seria a da compreensão de sua articulação paradoxal com a cultura moderna. Com este objectivo propomos algumas indicações para uma interpretação filosofica da modernidade, numa perspectiva heideggeriana, e procuramos compreender o seu significado teórico -o do argumento metapsicológico -à luz da dialéctica da modernidade. /// The present article tries to show the limits of an epistemological approach to psychoanalysis, but in a way that such a conclusion may at the same time imply an abandonment of our pretensions to rationality. The author defends that a fruitful approach that could make intelligible the historical destiny of psychoanalysis would be one centered upon the understanding of its paradoxical articulation with modern culture. Aiming at this, the author makes suggestions for a philosophical interpretation of modernity in a heideggerian perspective. He also tries to understand the theoretical meaning of such interpretation, namely the metapsychological argument, in the light of the dialectics of modernity.<br>

Abstract: Por ocasião do cinquentenário da morte de Freud, ocorrida em 1989, multiplicaram-se as homenagens e as publicaçães que acentuaram não só os aspectos clínicos da sua obra científica, mas também o valor e a significação cultural da Psicanálise. O mesmo haveria de ocorrer uma década mais tarde por ocasião do centenário da publicação de A Interpretação dos Sonhos, obra inaugural da técnica psicanalítica e uma das principais marcas na história da psicologia contemporânea. Com opresente artigo, o autor pretende demonstrar até que ponto a Psicanálise é ainda hoje uma teoria e uma prática tão viva como conflitiva, mostrando, além disso, até que ponto ela assumiu, tal como Freud previra, um carácter de autêntica revolução científica e epistemológica, similar à copernicana ou a darwiniana nos seus respectivos momentos historicos. Neste sentido, para la de analisar diversas posturas culturais em relação à Psicanálise, as quais nos interrogam acerca da sua presumível universalidade, o artigo mostra também até que ponto a descoberta do Inconsciente constitui profundo abalo no estatuto do sujeito humano. /// At the time the fiftieth anniversary of Freud's death occurred, which happened in 1989, many celebrations and publications took place, many of which highlighting not only the clinical aspects of Freud's work, but also the cultural value and meaning of Psychoanalysis. Something similar occurred ten years later on the occasion of the centenary of the publication of the The Interpretation of Dreams, work of fundamental importance for the understanding of the psychoanalytic method and one of the main moments in the history of modern psychology With the present article, the author aims at demonstrating to what extent Psychoanalysis is still a theory and a practice as lively as it is conflictive, showing, among other things how it came to assume, as Freud himself had predicted, a character of an authentic scientific and epistemological revolution, in many ways similar to the Copern~<br>

Author(s): Kearney Richard<br>
Abstract: In this article, the author argues that the phenomenological revolution inaugurated by Husserl and Heidegger opens up new avenues for a radical rethinking of the God question. With Husserl's 'free variation of possibilities in imagination' and Heidegger's famous claim in Being and Time that 'for phenomenology possibility stands higher than actuality', the author discovers new resources for our understanding of both Being and God. In both cases, the article claims, we witness the surpassing of the traditional metaphysical priority of actuality over possibility. Then, in a second moment, the paper explores the notion of the 'God of possibility' from the perspective of three different hermeneutic circles: scriptural, testimonial and literary. The essay concludes with an analysis of the positive implications of the notion of the 'possible' (as posse and possest) for a new understanding of the God of eschatology. /// No presente artigo, o autor defende que a revolução fenomenológica inaugurada por E. Husserl e M. Heidegger abre novas possibilidades para um repensar radical da questão de Deus. A partir da 'livre variação de possibilidades na imaginação' de Husserl e afamosa pretensão de Heidegger em Ser e Tempo de que para a 'fenomenologia a possibilidade está acima da actualidade', o autor descobre novos recursos para a nossa compreensão quer do Ser quer de Deus. Tanto num caso como no outro, diz-nos o artigo, podemos testemunhar a superação da tradicional prioridade metafisica da actualidade sobre a possibilidade. Em seguida, num segundo momento, o artigo explora também a noção de um 'Deus da possibilidade' a partir da perspectiva de três círculos hermenêuticos diferentes: o escriturístico, o testemonial e o literário. 0 ensaio conclui com uma análise das implicações positivas da noção de 'possível' (como posse e possest) para uma nova compreensão do Deus da escatologia.<br>

Abstract: For over twenty years, Richard Kearney has insisted that theology must not follow traditional metaphysical itineraries along paths that offer perspectives on God as Being Itself, or as Pure Act, or as causa sui. Instead, it should chart avenues that lead through the poetics of imagination, past the synthesizing dynamics of narrative, and toward the destination of God as a God that privileges potentiality over actuality. In constant dialogue with deconstructive and postmodern theories, Kearney has developed an "onto-eschatological hermeneutics" of the "God Who May Be" that presents a post--metaphysical, perhaps even more biblical, interpretation of God as divine possibility. This paper investigates Kearney's "onto-eschatological" poetics of God as it relates to his imaginative theological method and to the Pauline notion of kenosis as the risk of divine love. It concludes by associating Kearney's theopoetics with Kierkegaard's idea of repetition as a cipher for understanding the kinetics of the God Who May be as an alternative to the traditional metaphysical structures of God as a static "I Am Who I Am." /// Desde há mais de vinte anos que Richard Kearney vem insistindo em que a teologia deveria deixar de seguir os itinerdrios metafísicos tradicionais, ou seja, deveria deixar para trás os caminhos metafísicos que oferecem perspectivas sobre Deus enquanto Ser-mesmo, Acto Puro, ou causa sui. Em vez disso, a teologia deveria antes seguir caminhos orientados por uma poética da imaginação, para além da dinâmica sintetizadora da narrativa e em direcção a uma noção de Deus que privilegia a potencialidade sobre a actualidade. Num diálogo constante com as teorias desconstructoras e pós-modernas, Richard Kearney desenvolveu uma "hermenêutica ôntico-escatológica" do "Deus que pode ser", hermenêutica essa que nos oferece uma interpretação pós-metafísica, talvez mesmo mais bíblica, de Deus como divina possibilidade.

Publisher: Higher Education Press and Springer<br>
Issue: i40014889<br>

Author(s): Lin Zhang<br>
Abstract: Judging Gadamer's theoretical stance is a complicated matter, and his ontological hermeneutics is usually regarded as a text-centered theory of understanding. Through an analysis of the phenomenological premises from which his theories take off, however, we can clearly see his reader-centric stance. On the basis of this stance some cease to seek for the original intention of the author or the original meaning of the text, which ineluctably leads to the ignorance of an understanding methodology. As far as people's intentional understanding is concerned, however, the important as well as essential task is still that of striving for a certain kind of understanding that is relatively correct, with universally effective methodology as its necessary prerequisite. What is more, herein lies the significance of the epistemology of hermeneutics. This article aims to re-insert a sense of methodology after hermeneutics went through a period of ontological reflection, and hence clarify that it is of necessity that hermeneutics resumes its text-centric methodological stance. /// 判定加达默尔的理论立场是一个复杂的问题。他的本体论诠释学一般被视为 一种文本中心论的理解理论，然而通过对他所从出发的现象学前提之分析，可以清 楚地看出他的读者中心论的立场.正是基于这一立场，放弃了对作者原意或文本原 义之诉求，必然导致对理解方法论的漠视。但是，就人们有意识的理解活动而言， 首要的以及根本的任务仍然是努力获得某种相对正确的理解，而普遍有效的方法论 就是其必要的前提，诠释学的认识论意义便在于此.在诠释学经历了本体论的反思 后，应重新注入一种方法论的意识，回到以文本为中心的方法论立场.<br>

Abstract: Although intellectuals have been a part of the cultural landscape, it is in post-conflict societies, such as those found in Kosovo and Bosnia, that there has arisen a need for an intellectual who is more than simply a social critic, an educator, a man of action, and a compassionate individual. Enter the hyperintellectual. As this essay will make clear, it is the hyperintellectual, who through a reciprocating critique and defense of both the nationalist enterprise and strong interventionism of the International Community, as well as being a man of action and compassionate and empathie insider, strives to create a climate of understanding and to enlarge the moral space so as to reduce the divisiveness between opposing parties. In this way the hyperintellectual becomes a catalyst for the creation of a democratic culture within the civil societies of Kosovo and Bosnia.<br>

Abstract: Although anthropologists have discredited use of the liberal and secular concept of "agency" for explaining Muslim women's behavior, their evidence comes from women who still appear rather agentive to Western readers, hence, muting the necessity and consequences of discovering and applying the women's own ethical and religious terms in their analysis. In Guinea's rural Fouta Djallon, women are not prone to mobilize and make self-interested decisions with immediately observable outcomes. Therefore, understanding them on their own terms requires greater attention to their religious frameworks, namely, to their use of visions of creation and afterlife to define themselves and strategize for redemption.<br>

Author(s): Sidorova Anna<br>
Abstract: In this paper, we use concepts from actor-network theory (ANT) to interpret the sequence of events that led to business process change (BPC) failure at a telecommunications company in the United States. Through our intensive examination of the BPC initiative, we find that a number of issues suggested by ANT, such as errors in problematization, parallel translation, betrayal, and irreversible inscription of interests, contributed significantly to the failure. We provide nine abstraction statements capturing the essence of our findings in a concrete form. The larger implication of our study is that, for sociotechnical phenomena such as BPC with significant political components, an ANT-informed understanding can enable practitioners to better anticipate and cope with emergent complexities.<br>

Author(s): Öncü Ahmet<br>
Abstract: Analysis of the Turkish state in the 20th century both draws upon and supports Gramsci's definition of the state as "dictatorship + hegemony." Both the form of the capitalist state and its activities rest upon the hegemony of the dominant class. The importance of society and class conflicts in understanding the capitalist state suggests a critical position vis-à-vis the state autonomy tradition. The history of the Turkish state provides support for the argument that the dominant class must have established hegemony in the state in the first place, since without this there is no guarantee of successful use of the coercive power of the state on behalf of the sectional interests of the dominant class.<br>

Abstract: The intention of the article is to demonstrate the dialectical relation of self-understanding and understanding of the Other within ethnological interpretation. Proceeding from the conflict between the estimation of the reality of the Chachilla-Indians (formerly called Cayapa) on the part of a protestant missionary and the ethnologist, the whole ethnological enterprise turns out not to aim at "structures," "actions," or other "objects" but at the multiple forms of understanding with which it is confronted and of which itself is a part. Because of this hermeneutical orientation ethnological knowledge necessarily remains open for corrections and reinterpretations.<br>

Abstract: The impact of modernity, the recognition of which was central to ethnographic testimony, has been challenged by self-referential cultural criticism. A growing awareness of cultural representations has been advocated within the frame of narrative ethnology. This shift towards understanding and interpretation is pointing not only to an ethnographic dialogue, as it has been suggested, but also to cultural relativism. Furthermore, as a result of conflicting interpretations, there has been a tendency to overemphasize the diversity of cultural identities. Instead of hallowing relativistic claims for "readability," more realistic attempts have to be made towards complex situations facing the intricacies of contemporean modern life.<br>

Abstract: Diffusionism is a long-standing theoretical issue in anthropology. The current research on globalization often shows astonishing similarities between the 19th century understanding of diffusion and the most recent interpretations regarding globally circulating cultural phenomena. These parallels indicate the impact of global influences on local cultures. Instead of adopting a macro perspective that promotes a world map outlook, the author proposes a closer examination of local action in the context of global influences in order to avoid the reemergence of the shortcomings that led to the termination of the 19th century approaches. The focus on the local perspective through study of cultural appropriation appears to be an optimal way to understand the working of globalization on local levels.<br>

Abstract: Les apports de Jean-Marie Floch au marketing sont nombreux. Cet article ne prétend nullement en rendre compte de façon exhaustive mais tâche plutôt de montrer combien les voies et pistes de recherche qu 'il a initiées ont été fructueuses pour l'ensemble de la communauté marketing et sont d'un recours très fréquent pour aborder les questions de signification. Comprendre le parcours generatif du sens, permettre l'analyse des récits de marque, inscrire dans le lieu de vente ou l'objet les attentes génériques des consommateurs, voici quelques unes des très précieuses idées développées par ce sémillant sémioticien. The contributions of Jean-Marie Floch to marketing are numerous. This paper does not pretend to cover exhaustively this domain but tries to show how the research avenues developed are fruitful for the entire marketing community and are frequently used in order to deal with questions that have to do with signification. Facilitating the understanding of the process of sense generation, allowing the analysis of brand stories, marketing through sales area designs or products the generic requirements of customers, those are some of the precious ideas developed by Floch.<br>

Abstract: Cet article propose d'utiliser le concept d'utopie rationnelle pour rendre compte des pratiques managérìales et tout particulièrement de la production de réformes répétées dans les organisations. Dans cette perspective, après avoir décrit une décennie de transformations au sein d'une organisation publique, certaines caractéristiques de la « culture manageriale » sont dégagées de sa pratique réformatrice. Dans un second temps, le concept d'utopie rationnelle est construit à partir de textes canoniques et des travaux d' « utopologues ». Dans un troisième temps, utopie rationnelle et culture manageriale sont comparées, afin de préciser l'apport cognitif de cet outil à la compréhension du fonctionnement des organisations. This article proposes to use the concept of utopia to account for the managerial practices and especially to explain the production of repeated organizational transformations. From this point of view, the case of a decade of ceaseless transformations into a public organization is first described. Some of the features of the « managerial culture » are then inferred from this empirical statement. In the second place, the concept of rational utopia is constructed, from canonical texts and works of « utopologists ». Finally, rational Utopia and managerial culture are compared, in order to specify the main cognitive contributions of this tool to the understanding of organizational functioning.<br>

Issue: i40030281<br>
Date: 6 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Gosselin Gabriel<br>
Abstract: Expliciter les fondements d'une éthique des sciences sociales engage hors d'une sociologie de l'éthique. C'est une recherche peu pratiquée dans ces disciplines qui conduit nécessairement à des affirmations en première personne, et entraîne des présuppositions épislémologiques. Trois postulats sont ici dégagés : 1 / Reconnaître en tout autre un sujet, c'est admettre que le sujet est seul porteur de sens ; 2 / L'affirmation d'une commune humanité introduit une universalité en valeur et une relativité épistémologique, dans une démarche interprétative et une éthique des limites ; 3 / Dire que ce n'est pas l'ordre qui nous constitue, mais nous qui le constituons, c'est dire le risque éthique de nous concevoir comme les éléments d'un Tout, et c'est supposer un individualisme d'ordre épistemologique. Accurately defining the basis of an ethic of social sciences requires an approach which is outside the sociology of ethics. The little amount of research which has been conducted in these fields has necessarily led the author to present personal assertions and has also resulted in epistemological presuppositions. Three assumptions are presented here : 1 / To consider that any one else is a subject amounts in effect to admitting that only the subject carries a real meaning ; 2 / The assertion that mankind is a common whole is introducing both the concept of universality and an epistemological relativity, through an approach based on interpretation and an ethical understanding of limits ; 3 / To state that society does not legitimate ourselves, but that ourselves legitimate society amounts to drawing attention to the ethical risk of considering ourselves as lhe components of a whole, which is presupposing an individualism of an espistemological nature.<br>

Abstract: Cet article traite du rapport de l'engagement et de la connaissance sociologique, en prenant pour terrain la problématique des rapports sociaux de sexe et le féminisme. Plus exactement, c'est la question de l'utopie et de sa fonction heuristique et cognitive éventuelle pour la recherche qui fait l'objet de l'étude. Après avoir rappelé et présenté certains des travaux les plus importants sur la question, il est procédé à une tentative d'élucidation des vertus cognitives de l'utopie féministe matérialiste pour les recherches sur le genre, la différence des sexes et la domination masculine. La conclusion revient sur les implications épistémologiques et méthodologiques de cette étude. This article is devoted to the study of the relationship between engagement and soaological knowledge, in the field of research relevant to gender and feminism. More exactly, the question concerns the heuristic and cognitive functions of utopia. Firstly, the author introduces some of the most significant works on the subject. Then, he tries to clarify the cognitive virtues of the feminist utopia for a better understanding of gender, sex difference and male domination. The conclusion reconsiders the epistemological and methodological implications of the study.<br>

Author(s): Gonthier Frédéric<br>
Abstract: La notion wébérienne de « compréhension » ne se réduit pas à la continuité cognitive que réclament aujourd'hui les « sociologies compréhensives » entre connaissance ordinaire et connaissance scientifique. Elle s'élucide au contraire dans les notions qui appartiennent à son extension logique : le sens subjectivement visé, Vinterprétation rationnelle et l'explication causale. On analysera ici ces trois notions coextensives, de même que les différentes formes de circularité qu'elles entretiennent dans la sociologie wébérienne. Weber's notion of « understanding » cannot, as claimed by comprehensive sociologists, be understood simply as cognitive continuity between ordinary knowledge and scientific knowledge. Rather, it must be logically extended, taking into account subjective meaning, rational interpretation and causal explanation. The article analyzes these three coextensive notions, as well as the different forms of circularity they create in Weber's sociology.<br>

Author(s): Triefenbach Kenneth S.<br>
Abstract: The rationalist fantasy of the Enlightenment is the myth of the nonviolent origins of virtue, typically represented through the image of rational birth. This myth falters when Odoardo Galotti, invoking the second birth of reason, kills his daughter. This article examines Lessing's Die Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts-essentially a treatise on the phylogeny/ontogeny distinction-in terms of a recuperative rationalist gesture that continues to inform Freud's oedipal theory as well as Claude Lévy-Strauss's understanding of the "cerebral savage." These theories are not treated as methodological frameworks for reading Lessing but rather as evidence of the tanacity of Enlightenment desires, which are already problematized by texts like Emilia Galotti.<br>

Abstract: The history of literary studies is especially important today as Germanistik takes account of its institutionalization in the university and redefines its disciplinary boundaries. By analyzing the two best-known reform universities, Berlin in 1809/10 and Constance in 1966/67, I show their strikingly similar commitments to notions of scholarship/research, learning, and pedagogy. That these common concerns are based on the influence of hermeneutics is not surprising; the philosophy of Bildung and Wissenschaft central to educational theory for Humboldt in Berlin, as well as for Jauß's and Iser's Rezeptionsästhetik in Constance, is metacritical and encourages reflection on understanding and interpretation.<br>

Abstract: The critical discourse on U.S. military detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib prison has been dominated by Weberian-style arguments (a bureaucracy gone wrong, insufficient or badly applied administrative rules, or individuals acting as cogs in a machine). We argue that Michel Foucault's "security apparatus" provides a more insightful model for understanding the Abu Ghraib phenomenon. According to this model, the prison becomes a nodal point in an information-gathering nexus confronting unforeseen, emergent, and unclear events, a place where power is less disciplinary than improvisational, exercised through practical judgments about uncertain situations. The performance of such power at Abu Ghraib included the use of photography and acts that, we claim, resemble M. M. Bahktin's negative carnivalesque.<br>

Abstract: What emerges as the overarching theme in the extensive work of the Dutch philosopher Cornelis Verhoeven (1928-2001) is our relationship to reality. Being appealed to by thousands of things in our existence makes us realize that we cannot avoid reality. The most meaningful forms of reality are symbols, which lead us, through radical astonishment and contemplation to the metaphysical insight that something exists rather than nothing. This renders Verhoeven sceptical as the weakness of our ability to know and understand hampers our vision of hard reality, and also ironical because so many forms of speaking and writing display a reality which is being taken for granted. Thinking symbolically, metaphysical reflection and scepsis towards thoughdess assumptions are the instruments of a contemplation which, in Verhoeven's work, leave room for the lyrical prevalence of reality. In his later writings he gradually and more insistently draws attention to the theme of truth, while at the same time not denying our epistemological incapacity towards understanding and explaining reality.<br>

Abstract: After the 'death of God', it would be a mistake to continue to think of eros in terms of a longing for possession ofthat which one is lacking, especially in matters of religion. Alongside Plato's Diotima, Kierkegaard, Levinas and even Heidegger, an alternative view of eros is proposed in which eros is gradually letting go of its possessive cravings in order to open itself for the other. In this way, eros is bent in the directionof the unselfish service of the other. The question is then asked which kind of understanding of being is implied by this redirection of eros. The answer is taken from a thinking of the meaning of being in terms of self-givenness and self-outpooring in beings, for beings to be 'there'. Our being at the service of the other can therefore be seen as a following of the call of being in us to become adequate to the meaning of being itself.<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutical philosophy as developed by Heidegger and Gadamer is not compatible with the classical phenomenological programme elaborated by Husserl. The hermeneutical stress on historicity as a necessary condition for understanding is unfamiliar to Husserl's strictly theoretical approach. However, this does not mean that a hermeneutical philosophy as such cannot be conceived in a phenomenological sense. Whether or not hermeneutical philosophy is phenomenological depends on the paradigm chosen for hermeneutical explanation. A hermeneutics referring to the interpretation of texts may elucidate constitutional elements of phenomenology, e.g. phenomenological reduction and reflection. In this way it even can initiate a modification of phenomenology which, instead of being caught up in its subjective foundation, now appears as elucidating the openness of the correlation between intentional attitudes and their 'objects'. For this correlation the interpretation is a paradigm, whereas the openness of the correlation can be explained in respect of freedom, language, and time.<br>

Abstract: The short novel, Will-o'-the-Wisp ('Het dwaallicht') by the Antwerpian (Belgian) author Willem Elsschot, narrates how one night Laarmans, a somewhat tired middle-aged husband and father, accompanies three Afghan seamen on a search for a woman, Maria Van Dam. The search leads them through the harbouring city, and ultimately fails. The work is enigmatic and invites the reader to engage with it creatively, adventurously and not without commitment. The reader discovers in this way not only what it means to interpret, but also that by questioning one's own contribution in the understanding of being, interpretation serves as a challenge to clarify one's existence. The enigma of Will-o'-the-Wisp is never solved, but the search for understanding what happened during that nightly search provides a model for every practical methodology of hermeneutics, and can therefore be considered a parable about the nature of interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Le thème de la communication exprime le conflit entre deux expériences fondamentales de la condition humaine : comprendre le monde et se soucier d'autrui. Le conflit apparaît d'abord sur le plan de la société. On peut retrouver ce conflit au niveau de l'existence sous forme d'une contradiction entre l'intérêt pour le langage et l'intérêt pour l'Autre, ou entre l'herméneutique et l'éthique. Si cette contradiction nest pas insurmontable, comme i'essaye de le montrer, même la contradiction sur le plan social pourrait être résolue. There exists a conflict between two fundamental experiences of the human condition : that of understanding the world and taking heed of the Other. In the first place the conflict manifests istelf on the social level. The conflict is also to be found on the existential level in the form of a contradiction between hermeneutics and ethics. However, if this contradiction is not insurmountable, as this paper attempts to show, it should oho be possible to resolve the contradiction on the social level.<br>

Abstract: Le rapport entre « conscience » et « identité » forme l'un des deux versants de la conception lockienne du sujet (l'autre étant constitué par la « propriété de soi-même »). La théorie lockienne repose sur la distinction du « mental » et du « verbal », et l'isolement du premier comme élément de la vérité. Elle suppose une reformulation du principe d'identité sous la forme d'une double négation inhérente à l'esprit (Mind) : il est impossible que l'homme ne sache pas qu'il pense, ou pense sans penser. Enfin elle caractérise comme « intériorité » la différentielle de perception et de réflexion qui opère tout au long de l'expérience. Dès lors le temps intérieur peut être intellectuellement et moralement ressaisi dans l'unité de la « conscience de soi ». Consciousness and Personal Identity form together one half of Locke's theory of the Subject (the other half being « self-ownership »). First of all, « mental » and « verbal » propositions (viz. truths) must be clearly distinguished. The principle of identity has to be reformulated in logico-psychological terms, as a double negation: it is impossible for the Mind to think, without knowing that it thinks. Finally the difference of perception and reflexion, which operates throughout « experience », is called an « internal sense » or interiority. As a consequence, Locke was able to call « self-consciousness » the typical unity of morality and understanding which forms the internal « duration » of the Mind.<br>

Article Title: Le principe d'équité comme « âme de l'herméneutique » (Georg Friedrich Meier)<br>

Abstract: Longtemps méconnue, l'herméneutique universelle des Lumières connaît actuellement un regain considérable d'intérêt. Après une caractérisation générale du profil de cette herméneutique, l'étude se focalise sur le Précis d'herméneutique de G.F. Meier, en prenant pour guide la thèse que le principe d'équité herméneutique forme l'âme de toute herméneutique qui se veut philosophique. Même s'il paraît difficile de faire encore de ce principe la clé de voûte épistémologique de l'herméneutique, les thèses de Meier relatives à ce principe conservent toute leur actualité, notamment dans les débats anglo-saxons récents relatifs au « principle of charity », de même qu'elles montrent la voie à une éthique de l'interprétation. The triumph of the romantic paradigm of hermeneutics as a general theory of understanding has partially hidden the former general hermeneutics of the Enligthment. In the current discussion about radical interpretation, we have good reasons to rediscover this older model. G.F. Meier's idea of a general hermeneutics including natural as well as artificial signs is under this respect of a special interest. The article focusses on Meier's statement that the principle of hermeneutic equity is the soul of a philosophical hermeneutics. Although it is impossible to maintain this principle as the epistemological foundation of hermeneutics, it shows the way toward an ethics of interpretation, which shades a new light on the debates regarding the so-called « principle of charity ».<br>

Abstract: On essaie dans ces pages d'appliquer à la philosophie de Kant et de Dilthey certains concepts en vue d'une perspective critique de l'histoire. La distinction diltheyenne entre explication et compréhension est mise en rapport avec celle qu'opère Kant entre jugement déterminant et jugement réfléchissant. Puisque la majeure partie de la complexité historique ne peut trouver son explication dans des lois générales, on propose une compréhension réfléchissante du récit historique. Mettre en relation le jugement réfléchissant et la compréhension revient à souligner la dimension normative de l'interprétation historique. La perspective anthropologique de Kant fait également place aux jugements préréflexifs, préliminaires sur l'histoire, tandis que l'approche diltheyenne par les Geisteswissenschaften ramène à une conscience reflexive ou autoréférée qui replace l'individu en son temps et en son lieu. D'autres aspects peuvent encore conduire à notre rapport critique à l'histoire : le modèle kantien d'une orientation réfléchissante de la communauté humaine, les limites qu'ilpose à l'interprétation authentique, la conception heideggerienne de l'authenticité historique, l'analyse diltheyenne des systèmes d'influence réciproque comme cadre de l'idée d'une imputation causale singulière chez Paul Ricœur. This essay is an attempt at applying certain concepts to the philosophy of Kant and Dilthey, so as to develop a critical perspective on history. Dilthey's explanation-understanding distinction is related to Kant's distinction between determinant and reflective judgment. Since much of the complexity of history cannot be determinantly explained by general laws, a reflective understanding of the meaning of historical narrative is suggested. To relate judgment and understanding is to highlight the evaluative dimension of historical interpretation. Kant's anthropological perpective also makes room for pre-reflective, preliminary judgments about history, whereas Dilthey's human science app~<br>

Abstract: En confrontant ses romans et ses livres ultérieurs, souvent constitués de recueils de notes, l'auteur montre que s'élabore chez Julien Gracq une véritable pensée de l'histoire. Il examine tout d'abord le goût de Gracq pour l'histoire et la place de son expérience historique dans son écriture, avant de constater, à la manière de Vincent Descombes avec Marcel Proust, que c'est peut-être dans son écriture romanesque plutôt que dans ses réflexions que se révèle la profondeur d'une réflexion sur l'histoire. À travers l'examen des figures de la temporalité et de son écriture du changement, il tente de mettre en évidence la manière dont les fictions de Gracq mettent en scène l'attente et l'événement, sur le mode paradoxal de la remémoration. Ce qui va arriver est toujours déjà connu: l'écriture est réflexion a posteriori, faisant de l'œuvre le laboratoire dans lequel l'auteur essaie de retrouver l'effet produit par la détermination de l'histoire sur les individus et les sociétés. En mettant en perspective les romans de Gracq par les débats des historiens de son époque sur l'événement, ainsi que par les réflexions sociologiques ou philosophiques sur le temps et sa perception, l'auteur essaie enfin de comprendre comment ses livres peuvent être considérés comme une contribution à la conception de l'histoire et de l'historicité. Novelist Julien Gracq constructed throughout his work an elaborate reflection on History, as confronting his fiction with his later writing shows. This article first examines Gracq's taste for History, and the place of historical experience in his writing. As Vincent Descombes suggested for Proust, it is in his novels, more than his theoretical musings, that Gracq exhibited the depth of his thinking: his use of figures of temporality and his writing of change underpinned, in his fiction, his staging of wait/expectancy, and events, paradoxically presented through recollection. What will happen is always already known: through writing, Gracq attempted to~<br>

Article Title: A 'Mediterranean New Left'? Comparing and Contrasting the French PSU and the Italian PSIUP<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40041857<br>
Date: 11 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): GORDON DANIEL A.<br>
Abstract: This article argues that Gerd-Rainer Horn's model of a 'Mediterranean New Left' encompassing both the French Parti socialiste unifié (PSU, 1960-1990) and the Italian Partito socialista italiano di unità proletaria (PSIUP, 1964-1972) needs to be significantly revised. It agrees that, half a century on from the events which gave rise to their foundation, this much misunderstood part of the political spectrum, midway between social democracy and the far left, is worthy of rescue from the 'enormous condescension of posterity', but questions how similar the two parties actually were. Major differences emerge, especially in the nature of each party's relationship with communism, with the philosovietism of the PSIUP contrasting with the PSU's evolution towards an anti-Leninist decentralist socialism of self-management. Yet, at the same time, important new evidence is uncovered about the concrete political and personal links that developed between leading intellectuals of the PSIUP and PSU, an example being the friendship of the Italian parliamentarian and theorist Lelio Basso with the journalist Gilles Martinet, later French ambassador to Italy. Other transnational links, both across the Mediterranean and to eastern Europe, are explored. Furthermore, the location of the roots of both parties in the 1940s generation of anti-fascist resistance calls into question prevailing assumptions equating the New Left with the youth of the 1960s, with wider implications for our understanding of the development of the European left across the twentieth century. Cet article affirme que le modèle de Gerd-Rainer Horn d'une ‘Nouvelle gauche méditerranéenne’, englobant à la fois le Parti socialiste unifié français (PSU, 1960-1990) et le Partito Socialista Italiano di Unità Proletaria italien (PSIUP, 1964—1972), doit être révisée de manière significative. Il montre que, un demi-siècle après les événements qui avaient donné lieu à leur fondation, cette partie souvent mal comprise du spectre po~<br>

Author(s): Bédarida François<br>
Abstract: Depuis un demi-siècle d'importantes mutations sont intervenues dans l'exercice du métier d'historien, dues notamment à la pression d'une demande sociale forte, à une médiatisation galopante dans la communication du savoir, à la nécessité de procéder à l'historisation d'une mémoire déferlante. Mais deux pièges épistémologiques guettent : d'un côté, le retour d'une forme de positivisme appauvrissant et simplificateur ; de l'autre, l'abolition, sous l'influence des thèses postmodernistes, de la ligne de partage entre histoire et fiction. Si l'on veut fonder solidement et rationnellement la responsabilité, scientifique, sociale et morale, de l'historien, sans retomber dans une approche moralisante ni verser dans une neutralité abstraite et sans vie, il convient, d'abord, de rappeler en permanence que la première mission de l'historien est une mission de vérité, en second lieu de marquer avec force qu'il existe un lien congénital entre histoire et valeurs. The transformations in the practice of the historian's craft, which are a definite feature of our times, proceed, among other causes, from the pressure of social demand, from the new role taken by the medias in the communications of knowledge, from the need of historicizing critically memory. Today two pitfalls are threatening : on the one hand, a return to a positivist brand, devoid of understanding and meaning ; on the other hand, under the impact of postmodernist theories, the deletion of the dividing line between history and fiction. In order to provide a sound and rationally established basis to the idea of a scientific, social and moral responsibility of the historian, without falling back either into a moralizing approach or an abstract and lifeless neutrality, two conditions are required : first, to recall ceaselessly that in history truth is and remains the first goal ; secondly to stress that a congenital connection unites history with values.<br>

Author(s): Vieillard-Baron Jean-Louis<br>
Abstract: Windelband, réputé comme chef de l'école néokantienne de Bade, s'oppose comme Bergson au relativisme et au positivisme. Pour lui, comprendre Kant, c'est le dépasser, et ce, dans la direction de Hegel ; lire Bergson, c'est retrouver le sens de l'événement dans une métaphysique de l'irrépétable, qui, en montrant l'insuffisance du criticisme, ouvre la porte aux sciences historiques. Cela est l'interprétation positive de Bergson. Mais la critique est qu'il faut séparer totalement la psychologie de la philosophie, contrairement à la tradition philosophique française, encore observée par Bergson. Mais le volontarisme bergsonien apparaît comme représentatif de l'esprit de la philosophie du tournant du XIXe au XXe siècle. Mieux encore, avec Bergson, la philosophie retrouve l'ambition (hégélienne) d'être une vision globale du monde. Windelband, well-known for being the leader of the Neo-Kantian School of Bade, together with Bergson, is opposed to both relativism and positivism. According to him, understanding Kant means going further than the latter and, more, in Hegel's direction. Reading Bergson means finding again the meaning of event within metaphysics of what may not be repeated which, by showing the insufficiency of criticism, opens a new way towards historical sciences. Such is the positivie interpretation of Bergson. But the criticism is such as one should imperatively separate psychology from philosophy, contrary to the French philosophical tradition, still observed by Bergson. But Bergsonian voluntarism appears as some kind of representative of the spirit of philosophy at the turn of the 19th-20th century. Better further, with Bergson philosophy recaptures its (Hegelian) ambition to become a global vision of the world.<br>

Date: 3 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Soual Philippe<br>
Abstract: Hegel, refusant le déisme et son Dieu d'entendement et repensant la theologia crucis luthérienne, considère l'événement de la mort de Jésus-Christ sur la croix comme la manifestation dans l'histoire mondiale de l'amour divin trinitaire. La vie éternelle de Dieu est celle de l'amour des trois personnes divines, comme don, dessaisissement de soi et commune extase. Or la Croix révèle cet amour par la kénose du Fils, comprise comme don et mort de la mort. Par là Hegel s'efforce de penser non pas la seule mort de Dieu, mais bien la vie infinie de Dieu qui est conquête de sa vérité dans l'épreuve de l'absolu déchirement, de l'abîme de la croix. Cette vie est, par la croix, gloire de l'amour trinitaire dans le règne de l'Esprit. Hegel, refusing deism and its God of understanding, and pondering anew over the Lutheran theologia crucis, believes that Jésus Christ's death on the Cross is the manifestation of the Trinity's divine love within the history ofthe world. God's eternal life is that ofthe three divine persons embodying gift, the unravelling of one's self and common ecstasy. Now the Cross reveals such a love through the kenosis ofthe Son understood both as gift and death of death. Hence, Hegel strives at thinking not only God's death but, rather, the infinité life of God which is a conquest of its own truth through the trial of the absolute wrench of the abyss of the Cross. Such a life becomes, through the expérience of the Cross, the glory of the love of the Trinity within the realm ofthe Spirit.<br>

Author(s): Zeitlin M.<br>
Abstract: The issue of foundationalism and the growing irrelvance of sociological meta-theorizing to the understanding of contemporary society is considered from the perspective of postmodernism. Foundationalism is treated as a form of ideology. Changes in the analysis of ideology are discussed briefly and the postmodern approach to the critique of grand narratives, or logocentrism, is introduced. Two meta-narratives, neofunctionalism and conflict theory, are criticized as illustrative examples of logocentrism. The postmodern critique is then applied to the issue of foundationalism as recently articulated in the "Seidman controversy," which is exposed as containing hidden foundationalist implications of its own. The critique of foundationalism raises three issues that are discussed: the possibility of a deontological social theory, narrative as social inquiry, and the social role of academics as intellectuals.<br>

Abstract: Recently, many articles on intellectuals have appeared in the Polish press. The critique is directed at those scholars, writers and artists who participate in public life and believe that their views, appeals and warnings can influence the course of history. The critics argue that intellectuals did not display independent thinking in the time of communism and have had little to say since its fall. They argue that intellectuals are needed only in the role of professionals in their respective fields of competence. The author of the article below does not share these arguments. On the contrary, he is convinced that the current East Central European transformation demands a broad debate on ims and values. This task is inconceivable without the participation of intellectuals who are accustomed to understanding the world in a perspective much wider than the vision of their specific professional skills would allow.<br>

Author(s): BOKSZAŃSKI ZBIGNIEW<br>
Abstract: The article begins with an analysis of the concept of identity and a description of two theoretical traditions which lie at the source of this concept and which determine the operationalisations of the identity concept within the context of social change (G.H. Mead and E. Erikson). The author then goes on to discuss the problems which evolve from the many applications of the concept of identity to analysis of collectives. The concept of collective identity is outlined and four basic ways of understanding this concept in contemporary sociology are discussed. The author refers in his presentation to the works of F. Barth, R. Turner, A. Touraine, S. N. Eisenstadt, E. Gellner, and A. Kłoskowska. The author concludes his article with several comments focusing on the relationships between social change and collective identity and he refers to those approaches which either stress the relative independence of identity formulae and social structure or even view the evolving patterns of identity as a factor contributing to social change.<br>

Abstract: Multiculturalism is a term spreading in the West during the 1960s to indicate respect, tolerance and defence of cultural minorities. The idea of multiculturalism has become a collective imaginary ("all different, all equals"). It has generated a political ideology supporting an inclusive citizenship towards "different" cultures. After being adopted as official policy in many Countries, multiculturalism has generated more negative than positive effects (fragmenting the society, separating the minorities and fostering cultural relativism). As a political doctrine, it seems harder and harder to be put into practice. At its place, today we talk of interculturality. But this expression too seems quite vague and uncertain. This essay discusses on the possible alternatives to multiculturalism, asking itself whether the way of interculturality can be a solution or not. The Author's thesis is that the theory of interculturality has the advantage to stress the inter, namely what lies in between different cultures. But it does not possess yet the conceptual and effective means to understand and handle the problems of the public sphere, when the different cultures express cultural values radically conflictual between them. The troubles of interculturality result from two lacks: an insufficient reflexivity inside the single cultures, and the lack of a relational interface between the different cultures (between the carrier subjects). Modern western Reason created a societal structure (lib-lab) promoting neither the first nor the second one. In fact, it neutralizes them, because it faces the dilemmas of values inside the cultural diversities through criteria of ethical indifference. Such criteria set reflexivity to zero, preventing individuals to understand the deepest reasons of the vital experience of the others. Reason is emptied of its meaning and of its understanding capability. To go over the failures of multiculturalism and the fragilities of interculturality, a lay approa~<br>

Abstract: The title of the essay refers to the famous statement in Foucaults introduction to his History of Madness where he writes that "we have to do justice to Freud". The problem, however, is that Foucault's philosophy does not seem to do justice to Freud. Foucault's use of Freud is ambiguous: sometimes he uses him for purely instrumental purposes (when reconstructing the history of madness and sexuality), but sometimes—for anthropological purposes signaling Freud's role in redefining our common humanity and particularly our relation to language, life and work. The author confronts Foucault's ambiguous reading of Freud with the equally ambiguous reading of Foucault by Derrida. Derrida discusses Foucault twice. Once in the essay Cogito and The History of Madness in which Derrida takes on Foucault's understanding of Descartes and his role in the exclusion of madness from the realm of reason. The second time—in his essay To Do Justice to Freud. Here Derrida disagrees with Foucault whether Freud managed to reestablish the body's communication with reason which Descartes destroyed.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I uncover the routine, ongoing practices that sustain institutional multiplicity. Drawing on a comparative study of the two high-tech conferences held in Israel in 2002,1 examine how diverse institutions are discursively handled in field-configuring events. Institutional multiplicity was expressed at this site through two identity discourses, one that situated the industry within a national context and another that oriented it toward the global markets. In addition, the conferences were constructed around different best-practice discourses that focused on guidelines for either investment or management. These four discourses reflected and further affected power relations between the field's actors, and they were differentially distributed across separate social spaces between the conferences and within them. The contribution of this study to our understanding of institutional multiplicity lies in demonstrating how it is maintained in practice, politically negotiated between actors, and refracted across separate social spaces.<br>

Author(s): Bostic Heidi<br>
Abstract: Françoise de Graffigny's mid-eighteenth-century play Phaza features a main character who is unknowingly crossed dressed as male. The text provides a rich starting point for exploring questions of gender identity and performance. This article situates Phaza within the fairy-tale tradition in which women authors played a major role. Its analysis draws upon philosophies of narrative identity and theories of gender to show that identity comprises both permanence and performance. Reading Graffigny can make an important difference in our understanding of gender, authorship, and relations between the sexes in Enlightenment France. Phaza's masquerade sheds light on the ways in which women authors of the era approached and assumed various gender identities. Eighteenth-century texts like Phaza reveal a lineage of ideas that continue to influence feminist thought today and will do so in the future.<br>

Issue: i40063720<br>
Date: 2 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Jameson Fredric<br>
Abstract: This review essay attempts to understand the book under review against the background of Jameson's previous writings. Failing to do so would invite misunderstanding since there are few contemporary theorists whose writing forms so much of a unity. Jameson's book can be divided into three parts. The first and most important part deals with dialectics, the second with politics, and the third with philosophy of history. In the first part Jameson argues that dialectics best captures our relationship to the sociocultural and historical world we are living in. The second part makes clear that Jameson is not prepared to water down his own Marxist politics in order to spare the liberal sensibilities of his political opponents. In the third part Jameson develops his own philosophy of history, mainly in a dialogue with Ricoeur. Dialectics is his main weapon in his discussion with Ricoeur, and it becomes clear that the Spinozism of dialectics allows for a better understanding of history and of historical writing than does Ricoeur's phenomenological approach. The book is an impressive testimony to the powers of dialectical thought and to its indispensability for a proper grasp of historical writing.<br>

Abstract: A fierce opponent of the historicist approach to literature that dominated French academe during his lifetime, the essayist and poet Charles Péguy (1873–1914) would theorize an alternative literary method that through the act of faithful and participatory reading could transcend the limitations of historicism. Outlined in his dialogue with History, Clio, Péguy's vision of the literary act is that of an intersubjective operation of mutual understanding between reader and author, in which the living relevance of literary works extends beyond their narrow historical origins; a conception that prefigures the formalist and hermeneutic literary approaches that will arise decades later.<br>

Issue: i387940<br>

Author(s): WorsleyAbstract: Mi'kmaq Indians' descriptions of journeys between worlds, as we find them in tales collected from the early seventeenth century to the early twentieth, are far too complex to fit into Mircea Eliade's model of shamanism or romantic images of Indians as being "at one with nature." The tales reveal six parallel worlds in which all types of beings belong to families, have wigwams, and search for food. The parallelism between worlds has no significance for beings living their ordinary lives, but it is of the utmost importance for understanding how differing types of beings in the stories (people, animals, supernaturals) achieve interworld journeys. The notions of cosmological deixis and perspectivism are used to explore the narratives and shed light on Mi'kmaq cosmology.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40069706<br>
Date: 12 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Fernández Germán Darío<br>
Abstract: I propose a few epistemological and methodological reflexions to account for intercultural daily communication. These reflexions emerged during a sociological research in Mendoza, Argentina, with Huarpes Indigenous students at the University of Cuyo. I observed that Indigenous people became quasi "ethnographers" of diverse environments. To make intelligible their classmates' behavior, and to account for their own behavior, Huarpes follow, in diverse environments and interactions, public rules of meaning. The objective of this paper is twofold: (a) to stress the methodological scope of ordinary communication and ordinary reasoning in order to study understanding between people from different groups and categories, and (b) to contest a kind of "pessimist" standpoint in social sciences and philosophy according to which the use of ordinary language reduces possibilities for understanding. Interviews, participant observation in natural situations, and a review of literature about language and understanding are the basis of this paper.<br>

Abstract: Cet article propose une réflexion sur la place de la diachronie et de la synchronie dans la recherche sociale, en partant de l'une des contradictions indépassables pour toute appréhension du temps. Celui-ci peut être pensé sous l'angle de la concomitance (dont chacun a fait l'expérience et qui revient à penser le temps comme une «succession de présents différents») ou sous l'angle des processus (c'est-à-dire de la modification permanente des conditions de l'expérience en fonction d'une differentiation entre passé, présent et futur). Nous nous interrogerons sur ce que signifie travailler dans la diachronie ou dans la synchronie, en soulignant notamment la difficulté à distinguer clairement les deux approches: de nombreuses recherches habituellement pensées comme diachroniques ne le sont peut-être pas et, réciproquement, des approches pensées comme synchroniques s'articulent presque nécessairement avec une pensée des processus. This article proposes a reflection on the place of the synchrony-diachrony distinction in social research. The understanding of time is structured by a recurring contradiction: time can be thought of in terms of "concomitant experiences" (time appears in that perspective as a "succession of different presents") or in terms of "processes" (insisting on the permanent modifications of social life on the basis of a differentiation between past, present and future). I will try to present as clearly as possible diachronic and synchronie approaches, before stressing the difficulty to separate them: some researches usually thought of as diachronic might include other dimensions, while conversely, investigations presented as synchronie almost necessarily articulate processual perspectives.<br>

Author(s): Waistell Jeff<br>
Abstract: This study investigates how business leaders dynamically narrate their aspirational ethical leadership identities. In doing so, it furthers understanding of ethical leadership as a process situated in time and place. The analysis focuses on the discursive strategies used to narrate identity and ethics by ethnic Chinese business leaders in Indonesia after their conversion to Pentecostal-charismatic Christianity. By exploring the use of metaphor, our study shows how these business leaders discursively deconstruct their 'old' identities and construct their 'new' aspirational identities as ethical leaders. This leads to the following contributions. First, we show that ethical leadership is constructed in identity talk as the business leaders actively narrate aspirational identities. Second, the identity narratives of the business leaders suggest that ethical leadership is a context-bound and situated claim vis-à-vis unethical practice. Third, we propose a conceptual template, identifying processes of realisation and inspiration followed by significant shifts in understanding, for the study of aspirational ethical leadership.<br>

Abstract: Dans un contexte d'utilisation croissante des comparaisons internationales par les instances politiques à des fins de pilotage des systèmes éducatifs, par le biais notamment de rétablissement de normes de compétences et donc d'évaluation en vue de l'introduction de réformes, cette contribution entend d'abord réitérer la nécessaire distinction, opérée par Max Weber dès 1922, entre l'entreprise scientifique et l'action politique, mais aussi et surtout rappeler le principe de séparation et de médiation dont relève la démarche comparative en éducation. Les concepts qui composent une langue, circulent et s'imposent dans un monde social renvoient à une histoire, à des usages dynamiques, et sont culturellement enracinés. Négliger cet ancrage social et culturel des mots expose à la construction de la comparabilité sur de seules équivalences fonctionnelles; bien que les pressions en ce sens soient fortes, c'est probablement le moyen le plus sûr de comparer l'incomparable (Marcel Détienne). La rationalité purement instrumentale qui favorise la diffusion de tels cadres ou schémas interprétatifs paraît en effet indifférente aux questions du sens et de la culture, outre qu'elle est irrationnelle sur le plan axiologique, si l'on suit Weber. L'étrangeté, si ce n'est l'altérité, tend à s'y effacer. On se demandera donc quels enjeux impose désormais au comparatiste l'illusion de la spontanéité de la traduction réduite à une équivalence fonctionnelle. Dans la responsabilité de médiation qui incombe au chercheur, c'est à un travail de clarification et d'intercompréhension (inspiré de Taylor) qu'invite la recherche, substituant à la standardisation des mots l'éclairage critique des variations semiotiques que génère leur usage. Governments are making increasing use of international comparisons as a tool to run and reform education systems, through the establishment of competency norms and assessment standards. In light of this trend, this paper wishes not only to reiterate the crucial d~<br>

Article Title: The Detraditionalization of Intimacy Reconsidered<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i388289<br>
Date: 9 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Wilson Neil<br>
Abstract: This essay challenges those strains of contemporary social theory that regard romantic/sexual intimacy as a premier site of detraditionalization in the late modern era. Striking changes have occurred in intimacy and family life over the last half-century, but the notion of detraditionalization as currently formulated does not capture them very well. With the goal of achieving a more refined understanding, the article proposes a distinction between "regulative" and "meaning-constitutive" traditions. The former involve threats of exclusion from various moral communities; the latter involve linguistic and cultural frameworks within which sense is made of the world. Focusing on the U.S. case and marshaling various kinds of empirical evidence, the article argues that while the regulative tradition of what it terms lifelong, internally stratified marriage has declined in strength in recent years, the image of the form of couplehood inscribed in this regulative tradition continues to function as a hegemonic ideal in many American intimate relationships. Intimacy in the United States also remains beholden to the tradition of romantic love. That these meaning-constitutive traditions continue to play a central role in structuring contemporary intimacy suggests that detraditionalization involves the relative decline only of certain regulative traditions, a point that calls into question some of the normative assessments that often accompany the detraditionalization thesis.<br>

Article Title: Between Polis and Empire: Aristotle's Politics<br>

Author(s): DIETZ MARY G.<br>
Abstract: A ristotle lived during a period of unprecedented imperial expansionism initiated by the kings of Macedon, but most contemporary political theorists confine his political theorizing to the classical Greek city-state. For many, Aristotle's thought exhibits a parochial Hellenocentric "binary logic" that privileges Greeks over non-Greeks and betrays a xenophobic suspicion of aliens and foreigners. In response to these standard "polis-centric" views, I conjure a different perceptual field—"between polis and empire"—within which to interpret Aristotle's Politics. Both theorist and text appear deeply attentive to making present immediate things "coming to be and passing away" in the Hellenic world. Moreover, "between polis and empire," we can see the Politics actually disturbing various hegemonic Greek binary oppositions (Greek/barbarian; citizen/alien; center/periphery), not reinforcing them. Understanding Politics within the context of the transience of the polis invites a new way of reading Aristotle while at the same time providing new possibilities for theorizing problems of postnational citizenship, transnational politics, and empire.<br>

Abstract: This article is a contribution to an international and interdisciplinary history of text linguistics. It focuses on the works of three authors who have influenced text linguistics in various ways : Bühler, through his theory of four modes of language, his organon model, his theory of anaphora and deixis and his theory of language understanding influenced by Gestalt psychology ; Bartlett, through his theory of schemata or mental models that structure the understanding and memorisation of stories, a theory that had a direct influence on all later models of text comprehension based on schemata, frames, scripts and plans ; and finally Benveniste, through his theory of pronouns and indexicals and his discussion of two broad types of enunciation or genres of text : the story and the discourse.<br>

Abstract: John Blacking's suggestion that some music transcends its social function by creating worlds of virtual time opens the way to a deeper understanding of the ontology of music. For Blacking, "music that is for being" enhances human consciousness by heightening temporal experiences. Music's power to affect our consciousness of time stands at the heart of an ontology of music. By examining music s relation to limit experiences such as trance and ecstasy, in which time itself appears to be transcended, I intend to argue that music's mode of being is the ground of its social, cultural, and even spiritual efficacy.<br>

Author(s): Ho Meilu<br>
Abstract: Singing songs in service (kirtan seva) constitutes the primary expression of devotion in the Pushti Marg (Path of Grace) tradition of India. This liturgical practice is singular amongst South Asian, Hindu traditions in its extensive use of rag set to classical poetry. I consider the meaning of this sung liturgy using the ideas of hermeneutic philosophy that concern understanding. I suggest that performing song in service is similar to the act of understanding a work, one in which a self is disclosed in the mode of play. Critically, such continual self-unveilings over a lifetime of service to Krishna afford the practitioner the possibility of the lived liberation promised by founder, Vallabhacharya.<br>

Author(s): Simonett Helena<br>
Abstract: Although today much of the Mayo-Yoreme sacred myths and their inherent symbolism is rather esoteric knowledge, known to a few only, the community's performance of the responso (ritual of honoring the dead) is important for the re-establishment of relationships between humans and the supernatural beings and between living persons and the ancestors. The communal experience of the responso and the sense of beingenjoined are characteristic of the spiritual experience and fundamental to the musical experience as well Since life/death of any individual is an experience tied to other individuals, I argue that a philosophical inquiry of selfhood—of both the individual and the community—may help us reason about and make possible an understanding of the responso.<br>

Abstract: French anglicists have not shown much interest in literary biography, or biographies of writers by writers.

Abstract: The principle of hermeneutical interpretation (i.e., the art and discipline of analyzing the symbols of sacred texts) is explained and applied to the analytical group situation. It is maintained that the approach employed by this methodology provides a viable manner for understanding patients' unconscious communications. In particular, the relationship between metaphorical communication and the here-and-now therapeutic experience is discussed. It is argued that the unconscious manifests itself as a set o f metaphorical expressions. The paper presents two clinical vignettes illustrating how this hermeneutical methodology can aid the therapist to "read" the unconscious meanings of such metaphors.<br>

Abstract: In the quest for a more sustainable environment, there appears to be a need to confront issues of tradition vs. modernity and culture vs. technology in a world where boundaries once dividing these issues are collapsing, and differences once separating them are disappearing. This study demonstrates, through examination of a series of built examples, the successful integration of tradition and modernity as they are reflected in Muslim cultures. In practice, the notion of culture and technology is addressed through the built context, ultimately establishing the identity of a society through its architecture. This paper argues for the preservation of a culture through understanding the level of symbolism established in its built environment: the higher the level of symbolism, the further detached an artifact becomes from its place of origin. This research focuses on possible scenarios involving the conscious application of past and present typologies of form and technology in search of a recognizable cultural identity.<br>

Publisher: Berghahn Journals<br>
Issue: i40084882<br>
Date: 4 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Mitchell Joshua<br>
Abstract: Because Hobbes is understood to be a proto-liberal thinker, a great deal hinges on how we understand his writings. Does he contribute to the development of a purely secular political self-understanding, as many liberals today claim? And, by extension, does that mean that liberal thought today best stands on a purely secular foundation? What, then, should we make of the extensive theological speculation throughout his Leviathan! Here, I argue that to reconcile the seemingly purely secular claims in Leviathan with the obviously religious claims found there we must move beyond reading him in terms of what I here call 'the fable of liberalism', and comprehend Leviathan as a whole in terms of Reformation era debates between Protestants and Roman Catholics about the limits and purview of reason. Understood in that way we see his claims about 'reason' in a new and important light. Rather than being an inevitable development that comes to supercede honour and glory, as the fable of liberalism suggests, 'reason' is seen to have an historically contingent character, whose parameters are established by wagers about the meaning of religious experience.<br>

Abstract: No encadeamento de oito temas analisam-se tensões e aporias (no sentido mais platónico que aristotélico) inerentes à compreensão filosófica da obra de arte. (1) Quem compreende melhor a essência da arte, o filósofo ou o artista? Noutros termos, qual o papel da razão na compreensão da arte? (2) A arte permanece na procura do belo ou rege-se hoje apenas pela busca de expressão do artista? (3) Mas então será o artista um ser de exceção? (4) Por sua vez, esta questão leva à distinção entre a forma e o conteúdo da obra de arte. (5) O "conteúdo" da obra remete para o problema da "finalidade" da obra. (6) Na linha da finalidade surge a função central da arte, isto é, a fruição pela "trans-figuração" do mundo. Na esteira desta função abrem-se tres problemas, brevemente evocados: (7) a dimensão social e política da arte; (8) os êxitos facéis e os fracassos da arte, assim como (9) o eventual esgotamento da arte na atitude estética. In lacing together eight themes, the article analyzes tensions and aporias (more in the Platonic sense than the Aristotelian) inherent in the philosophical understanding of a work of art. (1) Who best understands the essence of art, the philosopher or the artist? Otherwise said, what is the role of reason in the understanding of art? (2) Does art reside in the search of the beautiful, or does it orient itself today by the artists expression? (3) What makes an artist an exceptional human being? (4) This leads us to the distinction between form and content in a work of art. (5) The "content" of a work refers to its finality. (6) In the line of finality, the central function of art appears, i.e., the fruition through the "trans-figuration" of the world. In the wake of this function, three problems are briefly presented: (7) the social and political dimension of art; (8) the easy successes and failures of art, as well as (9) the eventual emptying of art in aesthetic attitude.<br>

Abstract: Cette étude s'interroge sur la question du mal dans la philosophie de Paul Ricœur. En prenant pour objet le développement de sa réflexion sur cette question depuis le début de son œuvre philosophique jusqu'à sa dernière période, l'auteur tente de comprendre la manière dont Ricœur rend compte de ce phénomène en examinant trois axes majeurs dans la confrontation au mal : la compréhension pratique du mal (phronesis-mimesis-praxis), l'élaboration d'une réponse au problème (catharsis-Durcharbeitung), le pardon. This study examines the question of evil in the philosophy of Paul Ricœur. In interpreting the development of his reflection on this question from the beginning of his philosophical production until his final period, the author attempts to comprehend the way in which Ricœur accounts for this phenomenon in analyzing three major ways of approach to evil: a) practical understanding (phronesis-mimesis-praxis), b) working-through (catharsis-Durcharbeitung), and c) pardon.<br>

Abstract: The article develops an understanding of public deliberations during a peace process, focusing on the interaction between the elite level negotiations and the "public peace process." It does so by examining the dialogical mechanisms that are set to work in the public sphere once the elite consider the possibility of identifying the former enemies as allies or friends. These dialogical mechanisms, the author argues, add up to a shift in the manner the public interprets the discourse that regulates its relationship with the elite toward what the author calls, following Paul Ricoeur, 'hermeneutics of suspicion.' Thus, the peace process generates a need for the public to re-examine the terms of understanding that defined its relationship with the former enemy. However this same process might also lead the public to re-examine the terms by which it understands its relationship with the elite.<br>

Abstract: Improvements in treatments for childhood cancers have led to an "epidemic" of survival. Yet we have limited understanding about the overall ramifications of survival and quality of extended life for this growing population of young people. In this paper I consider lived experiences of longterm survival following cancer in childhood from a social science perspective. I explore young people's negotiations of narrative identity and associated processes of coming to terms with their own subjective position as young adult survivors. Discussion is based on qualitative data collected from 57 young adults in 2000. I focus on three concepts that help to discern ways in which cancer becomes enmeshed in personal identity — the Delta factor, narrative dissonance and narrative repair.<br>

Abstract: Ensaio expositivo e interpretativo das perguntas sobre a natureza humana e das respostas que o pensamento moderno, em Merlin Donald e outros, vai dando. A perspetiva fisicalista, neurobiológica, é analisada a partir de Joseph LeDoux, e outros, comentando as suas teses principáis. É dada ênfase particular à evolução das capacidades da mente humana na transiçao da cultura mimética para a cultura oral, a criaçao mítica e o advento da escrita e das outras formas de cultura exterior simbólica. Na crítica ao monismo fisicalista é discutido o que se pode entender por qualia e de que modo este entendimento justifica a aceitação de um "hiato explicativo" como o pensam Urbano Sidoncha e outros autores. É abordada a relaçao entre Pensamento e Linguagem a partir de Lev Vygotsky. Considerando a ética como um qualia procura-se fixar, empíricamente, a diferença entre ética e eticidade como contraponto à diferença entre autoconsciência e consciência cognitiva. Como proposta final é apresentada uma pergunta radical e oferecida urna temeraria resposta sobre o possível conhecimento total da natureza humana. Expository and interpretive essay of the questions on human nature and the responses that modern thought, in Merlin Donald et al., has been producing. The physicalist, neurobiological perspective is analysed as from Joseph LeDoux et al., by commenting on his main theses. Particular emphasis is given to the evolution of the human mind's capacities in the transition from the mimetic culture to the oral culture, the mythical creation and the advent of writing and the other forms of external symbolic culture. In the critique of the physicalist monism, one discusses what can be understood by qualia and how this understanding justifies the acceptance of an 'explanatory hiatus' such as Urbano Sidoncha and other authors think. The relationship between Thought and Language, as from Lev Vygotsky, is addressed. Considering ethics as a qualia, one tries to establish, in an empirical way, the d~<br>

Issue: i40092321<br>
Date: 6 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Zollmann Mary Ann<br>
Abstract: This article explores the thesis that educators are called to define and describe truth morefoundationally than we have ever done before if tve are to facilitate existence that is right, just, correct on both a personal and communal level. This thesis is sourced in ever-deepening attentiveness to, appreciation for, and affirmation of this statement of Adrian van Kaam: "The work of reformation starts in the heart by means of the human spirit; it is the reclamation of the soul, via the spirit, of its innermost form direction. " Suggesting that education which would be truly correctional must, therefore, reach into the very heart of being, the author describes the current paradigm shift from the Newtonian model of what it means to be human with its positivistic approaches to learning to a more Einsteinian or fullfield understanding of human being and its requirement of more formative learning processes. In consonance with the truth of being as full-field, formative correctional education is reflective and experiential, dialogical, narrative in form, and globally inclusive. In her discussion of each of these methodologies, the author illustrates how each one draws us deeper into the truth of who we are and inspires us to be the unique presence that we are in the world. Through such methods and processes, individuals are formed, reformed, and transformed not only in self-appreciation and openness to their own possibilities, but in appreciation for the meaning and value of their existence with others in the world.<br>

Abstract: The three novels in English that won in the Centennial Literary Contest are very different in their approaches to imagining the nation. And yet, in some of the most important aspects of constructing a narrative of the nation, they stand in very much the same position in relation to its colonial experience. The importance of narratives in understanding current attitudes about the Philippine experience makes it imperative that these three valorized novels are studied closely and as a set. This paper argues that these novels fail to liberate for they adopt a cavalier attitude toward history and fall prey to the cultural logic of late capitalism<br>

Abstract: The article is intended to indicate how the study of written and cultural texts may be used to approach the problem of identifying the system of thought characteristic of particular groups. Certain premises of what may be called an “interpretative paradigm” have been selected to create a theoretical starting-point, and in this context the most suggestive appear to be the concept of culture developed by symbolic anthropology, the cultural-semiotic concept of text and the multi-dimensional hermeneutic approach to textual intepretation. The author therefore seeks to bring together, in addition to the general features ofinterpetative ethnology, certain theoretical and methodological starting-points derived from the three approaches mentioned. One may approach the problem of understanding of a foreign testimony via “adequate interpretation”. Here, to understand means to adopt the cultural “language” of a message as one's own, and to interpret and so transfer the unknown into an accessible code, most often one's own code. The process of interpretation is understood as the discovery of the hidden content behind the apparent stirface, and in this activity the understanding of culturally remote testimony is axiomatically taken to bepossible and communicable. In a broader epistemological context we can see in adequate intepretation one of the means to the never-ending process of correction of our pre-judged knowledge. In a spirit of critical rationalism we could deflne such interpretation as the working hypothesis that may be falsified by further Scientific activity and then replaced by a better theory. Such conclusions on the methodological range of the interpretative approach indicate only one of the possible syntheses of various epistemological paradigms, for the theoretical use and application of which ethnology seems especially suited.<br>

Author(s): Clayton Cam<br>
Abstract: Sartre's theory of the imagination is important both as an alternative to the idea that the imagination consists of images contained somehow in the mind - the "illusion of immanence" — and as an early formulation of Sartre's conception of consciousness. In this paper I defend Sartre's theory of imaginative consciousness against some of its critics. I show how difficulties with his theory parallel a perennial problem in Sartre-interpretation, that of understanding how consciousness can negate its past and posit possibilities beyond the facticity of its situation. In this short essay I will not provide a detailed exposition of Sartre's theory of the imagination. Rather, I provide the basis of an interpretation of this theory that emphasizes the role that the past plays in imaginative consciousness.<br>

Abstract: This study is concerned with the method and results of an empirical research project called’ Regional Topics and the Understanding of Region: Research into Reception of Literature in Silesia and North Moravia’, which took place in May 1998. The starting point was an attempt to summarize the predominant approaches to regionalism, the particular nature of a region, and the predominant forms of Communication in regional Communication in the arts and in society in general. The chosen method of asking the questions and the results of the quantitative analysis have been received with a certain degree of scepticism, though a comparison with some of the signs and features discovered in similar research in 1982-4 is not without interest. The entire matter, however, has taken on a new form and cannot be looked at in isolation.<br>

Article Title: POWER, SUBJECTIVITY AND BRITISH INDUSTRIAL AND ORGANISATIONAL SOCIOLOGY: THE RELEVANCE OF THE WORK OF NORBERT ELIAS<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40108742<br>
Date: 5 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Newton Tim<br>
Abstract: This paper links the ideas of Norbert Elias to the conceptualisation of power and subjectivity that has developed in British industrial and organisational (I/O) sociology. It examines the relevance of power and subjectivity to British I/O sociology and reviews theoretical positions that have influenced this field. Elias's work is examined in some detail, exploring his approach to power, agency, the self, individualisation and discourse. His work is then applied to a re-examination of the perspectives on power and subjectivity contained within labour process, Foucauldian and actor network theory. The paper attempts to show how Elias's work re-frames our understanding of power and subjectivity through a stress on interdependencies and their asymmetry, the 'networked' nature of agency, and the interwoven form of human and socio-political development. It argues that Eliasian analysis maintains the critical concern with power asymmetries witnessed in labour process theory, yet avoids some of the difficulties in conceptualisation of power and subjectivity that are apparent in labour process, Foucauldian work and actor network theory. Elias's work also illustrates the need for a lengthier historical perspective than is typically observed in industrial and organisational sociology, and points to the value of studies which look beyond the context of the workplace. Finally, attention is paid to some of the limitations of Elias's work.<br>

Publisher: Routledge<br>
Issue: i394465<br>
Date: 10 1, 1973<br>
Author(s): White James<br>
Abstract: This article considers the consequences of new reading histories that have pursued the question of reading practices -- how people read texts, rather than just who readers were and what it was that they read. New theoretical considerations widen our appreciation of the difficulty in recovering the history of reading, but they must also confront the limitations and peculiarities of the evidence available. Using eighteenth-century England as a case study, the article reviews recent work -- much from diverse research not usually associated with reading history -- and assesses the potential for future study. Important questions about the relationship between literature, belief and action, about the nature of 'popular' and 'elite' culture, about the archaeology of political and social thought, and about the dissemination and control of ideas, cannot be determined without asking what reading meant. Such enquiry is particularly rewarding in writing the history of the transitional and diverse society of eighteenth-century England. It also reinforces concern that pursuit of new reading histories through an exploration of reading practice can marginalise the evaluation of change by concentrating on an examination of the singular and the synchronic. Only by the broadest research strategies, the article suggests, can new reading history most fully contribute to an understanding of eighteenth-century English social history.<br>

Author(s): Gavey Nicola<br>
Abstract: Academic interest in applications of rhetoric to social issues is undergoing a revival. This paper develops a rhetorical analysis of discourse generated by men who have been recently violent towards women. The texts have been drawn from transcribed interviews with 14 men who had recently begun or were about to attend stopping violence programmes. Each 90-minute interview prompted the men on their views towards women, violence and relationships. A range of rhetorical devices within the texts were identified and their effect was analysed. This paper focuses on five devices: reference ambiguity, axiom markers, metaphor, synecdoche and metonymy. The strategic effects of each device are discussed with close reference to sample passages from the transcripts. The paper explores how these rhetorical devices resource discourses of male dominance and entitlement to power, and how these in turn resource men in their violence towards women. Increased sensitivity to the nuanced effects of the rhetoric is seen to improve understanding of how men justify, camouflage and maintain positions of dominance within relationships with women.<br>

Author(s): Frunzâ Sandu<br>
Abstract: Primo Levi's If This Is a Man is a central work in understanding the way in which the subjective memory of a Holocaust survival receives a general meaning. This requires a context in which the duty to prevent the repetition of the tragic events endured by European Jews becomes a universal responsibility we must assume. This text examines the process of dehumanization and total degradation of a human being in the conditions of the death camp, and examines the antidote that Levi proposes for escaping the state of existential pathology. Particular emphasis is placed on the way in which Levi, who embraces secular humanist values, uses religious background and religious symbolic structures in order to provide additional understanding of the fact that in the absence of God, the world itself becomes void of humanity.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113403<br>
Date: 4 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Ronen Ruth<br>
Abstract: Temporal concepts such as "order," "chronology," "narrative present," and "exposition" are extensively used in narrative theory. Accepted notions of time can contribute to our understanding of these concepts and can allow us to question their "temporal" meaning in the context of fictional narrative. Fictional time may be thought of as a system of relations unique to the fictional world after real time. Theories of narrative tend to adopt an essentialist interpretation of temporal concepts and to ignore the ontological divergence between time in fiction and time in reality. As a result, concepts such as "exposition" or "present" appear which appear to carry a direct "temporal" meaning, actually function in a way that indicates the nature of time in fiction. In fiction, temporal divisions and time segmentations do not just construct a temporal structure; they also mark degrees of factuality in the fictional world.<br>

Author(s): Ryan Marie-Laure<br>
Abstract: Narratology has explored in depth the modes of narration, but it has left largely untouched the question of the modes of narrativity. This term designates the various ways in which narrative structures are realized in texts. To call a novel or short story narrative is an entirely different matter from that of applying the same term to a lyric poem or a drama. The study of the modes of narrativity attempts to answer the question: what does it mean to say "this text is narrative"? As a cognitive category necessary to the proper understanding of a work, the narrative structure of a text may be compared to the identifiable shape of an object in a visual artwork. Thus, various modes of narrative may be compared to a type of picture or visual phenomenon.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113430<br>
Date: 10 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Fludernik Monika<br>
Abstract: The narratological category "person" needs to be replaced by a different conceptual framework. The traditional distinctions between narrative levels and between story and discourse are inadequate to an explanation of much postmodernist writing. Classic narratological categories correlate with a realist understanding of story and with a realist conceptualization of story telling with some postmodernist techniques of writing, such as second-person fiction, refusing to play by such conceptualizations. Gabriel Josipovici's Contre-jour is an instance of a radical deconstruction of realist parameters. Realist recuperations or naturalizations of intractable writing have to be evaluated as readings against the anti-mimetic grain of such texts, and the possibility of such narrative recuperation does not provide evidence for the reinstatement of traditional narratological distinctions. The failing of current narratology to account for second-person narrative is due to the inapplicability of traditional narratological categories, a break-down that is motivated by the ideological commitments of much postmodernist, and especially second-person, fiction since these deliberately question realistic frames of cognition and story understanding.<br>

Author(s): BARTLETT Steven<br>
Abstract: An attempt is made to suggest an alternative approach to certain of the problems central to transcendental philosophy. In particular, it seems that the present understanding of pre-reflective awareness, of reflection, and of their interrelation can acquire a greater degree of rigour and clarity. To this end, attention is paid to preconditions of reference that are entailed by the phenomenological distinction between implicit experience and explicit reflection. L'auteur propose un accès alternatif à certains problèmes centraux de la philosophie transcendentale. En particulier, il paraît que la compréhension des idées de conscience préréflexive, de réflexion, et de Jeurs relations mutuelles, peut être précisée et élucidée. A cet effet, l'attention est attirée sur les préconditions de référence qui sont impliquées par la distinction phénoménologique entre l'expérience implicite et la réflexion explicite. Der Autor versucht, eine alternative Untersuchungsmethode zu bestimmten Hauptproblemen der transzendentalen Philosophie darzustellen. Insbesondere könnte das gegenwärtige Verständnis der vorreflexiven Bewusstheit, der Reflexion, und ihres Zusammenhangs strenger aufgeklärt werden. Zu diesem Zweck wird Aufmerksamkeit auf die Beziehungsvorbedingungen gerichtet, die in der phänomenologischen Unterscheidung zwischen impliziter Erfahrung und expliziter Reflexion miteinbegriffen sind.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell-Wiley Publishing<br>
Issue: i40115202<br>
Date: 1 1, 1983<br>
Author(s): Maloney J. Christopher<br>
Abstract: Metaphors are expressions in artificial, contrived, alien languages, and we understand metaphors by constructing translation schemes linking our natural, literal languages to these theoretically contrived metaphorical languages. The relation between a literal natural language and a metaphorical contrived language is like the relationship between a natively known language and a system of subsequently acquired languages etymologically emerging from that basic natural language. This model for understanding metaphorically contrived language is kin to the familiar model explaining how speakers of a language such as Latin may come to decipher a language like Spanish through projecting to Spanish what they know of Latin without the aid of a translation manual. A metaphor is, thus, seen as a sentence in a nonnatural language, itself derived from and at least partially translatable with the natural, literal language of the metaphor's author or audience. Les métaphores sont des expressions relevant de langues artificielles, construites, étrangères et nous les comprenons en construisant des schémas de traduction reliant notre langue naturelle littérale à ces langues métaphoriques théoriquement construites. La relation entre une langue naturelle littérale et une langue métaphorique construite est analogue à la relation entre une langue acquise primitivement et un système de langues apprises ensuite et qui dérivent étymologiquement de cette langue de base. Ce modèle, qui permet de comprendre un langage métaphorique construit, est apparenté au modèle familier expliquant comment les gens qui possèdent une langue telle que le latin arrivent à déchiffrer une langue telle que l'espagnol en projetant sur l'espagnol ce qu'ils savent du latin sans recourir à un dictionnaire. Une métaphore est donc considérée comme une phrase d'une langue non naturelle, dérivée elle-même de et au moins en partie traductible dans la langue naturelle littérale de l'auteur de la métaphore ou de ses lecteurs~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell-Wiley Publishing<br>
Issue: i40115286<br>
Date: 1 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Christoff Daniel<br>
Abstract: La signe comme expression (Husserl) consiste selon F. de Saussure dans le rapport immotivé signifíant-signifíé, sa valeur signifiante étant déterminée par la place du signifiant dans le système réel de la langue tandis que le signifié-concept (de Saussure) est noème, irréel (Husserl). Inerte tant qu'aucun acte d'expression ou de compréhension ne l'anime (ré-anime), il porte, exprime et induit l'intentionnalité de ces actes; il est conscience hors de soi, intentionnalité sans sujet, visée du signifié différenciée par son signifiant (objet d'une science de faits, la linguistique). Aussi les problèmes du «sujet», de l' «origine», de la «suffisance» du signe adéquat, de l'«insuffisance» du signe qui, en son ouverture, exprime au-delà de lui-même, exigent-ils l'élucidation du champ de signification, notamment des figures métonymiques ou métaphoriques qui y apparaissent. According to F. de Saussure a sign or an expression (Husserl) is constituted by the unmotivated relation between the signifier and the signified, the value of the signifier is determined by the position it occupies in the real system of language, while the signified concept (de Saussure) is a noema, i.e. unreal (Husserl). Inactive, as long as there is no act of expression or understanding to (re) activate it, the concept carries the intentionality of these acts, conveys it and leads us to it. It constitutes a consciousness outside of the self, an intentionality without a subject, a target of the signified, as differentiated by the signifier (the object of a science, the linguistics). In this sense the solution to the problems concerning the «subject», the «origin», the «sufficiency» of an adequate sign, the «insufficiency» of a sign, when it signifies things other than itself, requires the clarification of the idea of a field of meaning, especially the meaning of occurring metonymies and metaphors. Das Zeichen als Ausdruck (Husserl) besteht nach F. de Saussure in der unmotivierten Beziehung Bezeichnendes-~<br>

Abstract: Durant sa longue et féconde carrière, Austin Farrer, à partir d'une défense volontariste et néo-scolastique de la théologie rationnelle, est allé vers un modèle « post-moderne » de la foi à laquelle Dieu se dévoile dans l'herméneutique des images. A partir de là il a construit, avec l'aide de Gadamer, une théologie narrative non-structuraliste en laquelle nous avançons ensemble grâce à une dialectique de ces images. La route est dégagée par le Bien, non pas par la différence ontologique de Heidegger. Ma compréhension de sa dialectique doit beaucoup à Emmanuel Lévinas. During his long and productive career Austin Farrer moved from a voluntaristic and neo-scholastic defence of rational theology to a « post-modern » dialogical model of faith to which God discloses Himself in the hermeneutic of images. With Gadamer's help he constructs from this a non-structuralist narrative theology in which we are underway together through a dialectic of these images. The way is cleared by the Good, not by Heidegger's ontological difference. My understanding of this dialectic owes a considerable debt to Emmanuel Lévinas.<br>

Abstract: L'article dessine une ellipse à deux foyers que toute tentative dépenser la religion avec les moyens de la philosophie devra parcourir. Le premier pôle est occupé par le concept de « religion », le second par la pluralité irréductible des religions historiques. Selon qu'on se place dans l'optique de la « religion naturelle », ou dans celle de la « philosophie de la religion », cette ellipse revêtira une allure différente. Publiés il y a deux siècles, les Discours sur la religion de Friedrich Schleiermacher sont une des premières tentatives d'aborder cette ellipse dans l'optique d'une philosophie de la religion. L'originalité de cette approche prend encore plus de relief si on la compare avec la tentative kantienne de déployer les représentations, les croyances et les institutions religieuses sous l'égide de la question : « Que m'est-il permis d'espérer ? ». Autant les thèses que Schleiermacher défend dans le deuxième et le cinquième Discours gardent une grande actualité, autant son analyse du judaïsme atteste la difficulté de conjuguer un éloge de la pluralité avec une pensée de l'altérité. The article sketches a bifocal model which any attempt to give a philosophical meaning to the difference of religions must keep in mind. The first focus expresses the necessity of a concept of religion as such, the second deals with the irreducible difference and plurality of positive religions. This tension has a different shape if it is analysed through the pattern of « natural religion » or the pattern of philosophy of religion. Two centuries ago, Friedrich Schleiermacher's Reden über die Religion give us an excellent example of the second approach. Its originality can be higlightened, if we compare Schleiermacher's thesis in the second and the fith discourse, with Kant's attempt to develop a philosophical understanding of religious representations, beliefs and institutions in the light of the question : « What may hope ? ». Even if Schleiermacher's « breviary of romantic reli~<br>

Abstract: Avec l'avènement récent des neurosciences cognitives, le problème corps-esprit passait du registre traditionnel de la réflexion philosophique au domaine factuel de l'investigation scientifique. Une possible réduction de la pensée à ses infrastructures cérébrales rencontre cependant des ècueils d'ordre épistémologique considérables. C'est dans l'aval de ces problèmes impliquant le nouveau dialogue des neurosciences avec les réalités cliniques que s'inscrit l'étude présentée. Dans ce contexte de discussion sont abordés les fondements théoriques des neurosciences contemporaines comme la mise en perspective des recherches sur le cerveau dans le discours actuel des sciences humaines. Tout en considérant l'importance heuristique des recherches conduites sur les instances neurocognitives et sur la matérialité tissulaire des intégrations psychophysiologiques, les travaux présentés tendent à montrer que les relations fonctionnelles tissées entre le cerveau et la pensée ne sauraient se déchiffrer sur la base théorique des seules herméneutiques réductives. Si le tissu nerveux implique dans ses vecteurs de causalité la manifestation potentielle de comportements adaptatifs progressivement plus complexes, le tissu cérébral n'implique pas directement dans ses virtualités fonctionnelles la manifestation de l'esprit. A cet égard, les travaux abordés soulignent au niveau de la réflexion critique comme sur le plan de l'analyse factuelle que l'émergence de la pensée n'enracine pas sa nécessité dans la complexité des connexions neuronales. Arguments et propos qui tendent à réviser les nouveaux paradigmes neurophilosophiques de la vie mentale intéressant le substantialisme de la conscience et la dimension logistique de l'esprit.

Abstract: Dans la seconde moitié du XXe siècle, les principaux aspects de la définition et de la compréhension « aristotélicienne » de la métaphore ont été mis en question: théorie de la substitution, teleologie de l'univocité, subordination de la métaphore à la connaissance, et jusqu'à la centralité même conférée à la métaphore aux dépens d'autres figures (métonymie, synecdoque, catachrèse. .. ). Dans cet article, nous tentons de résumer et de discuter les points essentiels de cette contestation multiforme, en nous attachant particulièrement à la déconstruction derridienne de la métaphore « dans le texte philosophique » et à la synthèse, par Ricoeur, de la « nouvelle » théorie de la métaphore. In the second half of the twentieth century, the main aspects of the « aristotelian » definition and understanding of metaphor have been questioned : substitution-theory, teleology of univocity, subordination of metaphor to knowledge, and the very centrality attributed to metaphor at the expense of other tropes (metonymy, synecdoque, catachresis...). In this paper, we try to summarize and discuss various aspects of this dispute, paying special attention to Derrida's deconstruction of metaphor « in the philosophical text » and to Ricoeur's synthesis of the « new » theory of metaphor.<br>

Abstract: L'ontologie heideggérienne de l'être-pour-la-mort a souvent servi de référence négative à Paul Ricoeur. Il lui a très tôt opposé trois thèses qu'il n'aurait peut-être pas formulées s'il n'avait pas croisé la philosophie de Jaspers: a) « La naissance signifie plus que la mort » ; b) « la rencontre décisive avec la mort est la mort de l'être aimé » ; c) « la mortalité elle-même doit être pensée sub specie vitae et non sub specie mortis ». La première thèse conditionne les deux suivantes. Elle introduit une phénoménologie de l' « être-envie » qui en appelle de la vie reçue à la vie transmise. On objectera peut-être que la phénoménologie de l'être-en-vie suppose l'ontologie de l'être-pour-la-mort. Mais, même si c'était le cas, elle n'en transformerait pas moins profondément la signification. La compréhension de l'existence est affectée elle-même par les phénomènes de la vie reçue et transmise. C'est ce que veut dire cette expression: « exister vivant ». L'angoisse de la fin n'annule pas la joie des commencements. Peut-être même reçoit-elle de celle-ci son sens. Paul Ricoeur has often referred to Heidegger's ontology of being-towards-death to oppose it. He early set against it three thesis that he might have formulated differently had he not studied Jasper's philosophy : a) « birth means more than death » ; b) « the decisive encounter with death is the death of the loved one » ; c) « mortality itself must be thought sub specie vitae, not sub specie mortis ». From the first thesis, can be inferred the two others. It brings in a phenomenology of being-alive. One may raise the objection that the phenomenology of being-alive presupposes the ontology of being-towards-death. But even so it would be necessarily transform its meaning. The understanding of existence is itself affected by the phenomena of life as given and received. Such is the meaning of the phrase: « existing alive ». The distress of the end never cancels the joy of the beginnings. It may even get its sense from~<br>

Abstract: Selon la philosophie moderne la pensée est une production de la subjectivité, la volonté est une auto-détermination et le temps est une auto-affection. Kierkegaard offre une autre compréhension de la vie volontaire en envisageant une volonté brisée par le prochain, par le temps et par Dieu. La patience n'est pas pour Kierkegaard un accident de notre caractère, mais la condition pour devenir une personne. Cela suppose de laisser de côté toute compréhension purement psychologique de la patience. La vraie persévérance s'oppose totalement à l'obsession de se blinder par rapport au monde. Entre l'endurance stoïcienne et la patience chrétienne comme patience dans l'espérance il n'y a pas d'essence commune. Kierkegaard montre que la patience de l'amour est une passivité qui est la voie du salut. For modem philosophy meaning is a product of subjectivity, will is a self-determination, and time is a self-affection. Kierkegaard gives us another meaning for a voluntary life by considering desire that is broken by the will of another man, time and God. Patience is not for Kierkegaard an accident of character but is the condition to becoming a person. It is necessary to ignore a purely psychological understanding of patience. True perseverance is radically opposed to an obsessive existence blinded to the world. Between the stoic conception of endurance and Christian patience there is no common essence. For Kierkegaard, the patience of love is a form of passivity that can save Mankind.<br>

Abstract: On a souvent voulu voir dans l'herméneutique pré-heideggérienne une méthodologie des sciences humaines. Si l'idée remonte bien à la fin du xixe siècle, cette méthodologie herméneutique des sciences humaines n'a vraiment été élaborée de façon systématique qu'après Heidegger et en réaction à sa conception ontologique de l'interprétation, par le juriste italien Emilio Beiti (1890-1968). Sa pensée étant peu connue en France on présentera, à l'occasion de son centenaire, les idées directrices, mais aussi les limites, de sa théorie herméneutique. La symétrie des herméneutiques de Betti et de Gadamer sera soulignée : tandis que le juriste Betti trouve son paradigme de la compréhension dans l'activité contemplative du philologue, Gadamer, dont la formation est philologique, s'inspire du modèle juridique pour développer son herméneutique universelle de l'application. Preheideggerian hermeneutics has often being seen as an attempt to develop a methodology of the human sciences. If this project goes back to the later xixth century, this hermeneutic methodology of the human sciences was carried through for the first time after Heidegger, and against his ontological conception of interpretation, in the work of the Italian jurist Emilio Betti (1890-1968). This paper will present, on the occasion of his centenary, the main tenets as well as the limits of his hermeneutic theory. The symetry of Betti's and Gadamer's hermeneutics will be stressed : whereas the jurist Betti finds his paradigm of understanding in the contemplative activity of the philologist, Gadamer, whose formation was mainly philological, takes his inspiration from the juridical model in order to put forward his universal hermeneutics of application.<br>

Abstract: By exploring different aspects of an 'ethical' reading of a New Testament document, this paper is concerned with the challenge of an integrated, relevant approach towards understanding the letter to the Ephesians—an approach which would account for its nature as ancient canonised text, as well as the needs of contemporary readers. By way of illustration, the identity and roles of different groups of people referred to in the text are re-examined in terms of the rhetorical function of the letter as a whole.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the content given to the term rhetoric and some of the history of its changes. It begins with the sophistic emphasis on persuasion as a means of coming to terms with the phenomenal world around us, through to a modern conception of rhetoric as a deconstructive and critical tool in analysing the power-play of meaning that constitutes texts. This paper tries to reflect on some of these changes, arguing that understanding the term implies that one must also examine the surplus of meaning that informs it. While the word rhetoric is highly ambiguous, this paper tries to demonstrate that such ambiguity need not be viewed as a trial and a hindrance in the search for a correct definition as a precursor for effective discussion on the subject. Instead it argues that an investigation into rhetoric's surplus of meaning is perhaps what constitutes effective discussion in the first place, and that further, such surplus of meaning is one that can be characterised as far more unified than commonly assumed which enables one do more with the term rhetoric than previously thought of, or allowed.

Abstract: This contribution is an attempt to continue a dialogue on the issue of reference in biblical text which has its origin in an interchange with Willem Vorster and which is partly documented in the publication Text and reality. In the first section, the continuing relevance of reference is illustrated by a discussion of a number of contemporary Afrikaans historical novels, where the relationship between (historical) narrative and (historical) 'reality' is treated in a very innovative way. In a second section the dynamic nature of reference is discussed in the light of three aspects developed by Ricoeur, namely reference as self-transcendence, as redescription and as an integrative process. In a final section, the inevitable return to reality is explained. It is argued that a better understanding of the function of reference in all its facets holds the key to unlock the transformative potential of these texts in contemporary situations.<br>

Abstract: A flood of research literature on 1 Corinthians over the last fifteen years suggests an understanding of this epistle and of the ethos of the church in Corinth that resonates closely with issues in our culture today. The ethos of "secular" Corinth still heavily influenced the church in Corinth. It encouraged attitudes that today we associate with consumerism, postmodernism, and social construction, together with an overpreoccupation with autonomy, success, audience-pleasing rhetoric, and a "local" theology. The church sought to choose its own leaders, its own ethics, its own socio-political value-system, and its own criteria of spirituality. However, Paul sets forth a formative understanding of the cross; an understanding of the Church as one, holy, catholic, and apostolic; a Christomorphic re-definition of "spiritual" and of the Holy Spirit; love and respect for "the other"; and the gift-character of grace and resurrection. How does this relate to hermeneutical distance and appropriation?<br>

Abstract: After demonstrating that scripture's truth has always to be negotiated in terms of changing contexts, and after demonstrating that this is precisely what the church has already done with regard to remarriage, this essay argues that the church's teaching on marriage as an event is an increasingly irrelevant Victorian construct, not the originary will of God; and is maintained only by disregard – disregard of the hermeneutical nature of scripture's teachings on marriage, disregard of the process–understanding of marriage which has always dominated Africa and which is increasingly dominating global culture as a whole, and disregard of the church's teachings, even by active and committed members of the church. The essay argues that the hermeneutical nature of the Bible's teaching on this subject, as well as the church's own approach to remarriage, gives the church the responsibility to frame a Christian process-understanding of marriage which will better enable people to build stable, lifelong unions.<br>

Abstract: In a first section, the renewed interest in historical consciousness among social scientists and historians is discussed, which resulted in a clearer understanding of how historical memory functions and of the diverse ways in which historians use references to the past. Against this background, Paul's use of history in the letter to the Galatians is analysed in a second section. The apostle is not interested in recording the past, but develops, in the light of his own experiences in preaching the gospel among gentiles, an alternative perspective on Israel's past. By taking the figure of Abraham as his point of departure, he argues for a more inclusive understanding of Israel's history, which enables him to provide a theological justification for the equal status of gentile believers in the community of faith.<br>

Abstract: After a brief survey of recent research on the Scriptures in the Book of Revelation in general, this study turns to Revelation 21:1-22: 9 before addressing some disputed issues in Revelation's use of the Scriptures. Is John interpreting Scripture or does he use Scripture merely as a quarry for his own statements? While the modern understanding of interpretation finds it difficult to find common elements with ancient approaches to interpretation, post-modernity offers a better chance to appreciate John's way of dealing with the Scriptures. John's approach must be understood by situating it among the various Jewish approaches to the Scriptures. It can best be characterised as that of 'rewritten scripture' and is close to midrash and targum.<br>

Abstract: Inquiry in the social sciences is based on theoretical assumptions that are not always clearly articulated in research reports. This article surveys some of the theoretical positions that underlie various qualitative research methods and discusses some of the methodological issues raised by those positions. The four themes that serve as anchor points for the discussion are contextualization, an approach to social-scientific observation that takes into account the environment in which the observational event takes place; understanding, an approach to the problem of knowledge and explanation that addresses the range of what can be learned from observation; pluralism, the proposition that not only social settings but the methods for explaining them resist reduction to a single model; and expression, the problem of conveying the results of research.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i396847<br>
Date: 10 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): MellonAbstract: This article considers some methodological issues that arise when empirical inquiry is conducted within the framework of qualitative assumptions about the nature of reality and how we as humans can know it. These assumptions posit an empirical reality that is complex, intertwined, best understood as a contextual whole, and inseparable from the individuals-including the researchers--who know that reality. Four primary issues are considered in this article: the researcher as interpreter; the emergent nature of qualitative research; understanding the experience of others; and trustworthiness in qualitative research. Further, the article discusses methodological practices that have arisen in the context of qualitative assumptions and issues. The practices described are drawn from diverse qualitative research traditions, including participant observation, naturalistic inquiry, grounded theory, hermeneutic approaches to the interpretation of texts (and actions as texts), qualitative evaluation, and a body of methodological literature that calls itself generically "qualitative research." The goals of the article are threefold: (1) to present the internal rationale of qualitative research as issues and practices that arise within the context of assumptions about reality and what we can know about it; (2) to encourage researchers to examine the relevance of qualitative assumptions, issues, and practices to their own research problems; and (3) to point readers toward more detailed discussions of qualitative research.<br>

Author(s): Molyneux John M.<br>
Abstract: For most of its modern history library and information science has been governed by the mode of thinking best characterized as positivism. This epistemology, shared with most of the social sciences for some time, features the quest for universal laws and the reduction of all phenomena, including behavioral, cognitive, and so on, to the physical, among other elements. This means to knowledge is unworkable for this field; a proposed replacement for it is hermeneutical phenomenology. This article outlines the elements of a revised epistemological approach that seeks an understanding of the essences of things (such as the library) and that takes into account, among other things, the intentional stances of the human actors within the realm of library and information science. Such a re-formed epistemology allows for a different set of questions asked and a different approach to answering them.<br>

Abstract: Les deux courants de pensée politique arabe au Proche-Orient les plus marquants depuis la guerre des Six jours sont, d'une part, les théories palestiniennes de la révolution arabe, et, d'autre part, l'islamisation du socialisme arabe hérité de Nasser. Les textes fondamentaux du FPLP et du FDPLP, mais aussi les études, plus modérées, d'intellectuels proches du Fath et de l'OLP redonnent vie à des sensibilités politiques proche-orientales caractéristiques. En effet, la « révolution palestinienne » est vue expressément à la fois comme locale, provinciale, d'une part, et, d'autre part, comme nationale-arabe, et non comme étatique. Quant au socialisme arabe en quête d'islamisation, il bénéficie de la pensée sociale et politique des Frères musulmans. Socialisme arabe et socialisme islamique se rejoignent, avec en priorité un projet économique d'une urgence évidente. L'intégrisme et le fanatisme politiques des Frères se sont estompés. Cette remontée raisonnable de l'authenticité islamique offre peut-être la chance d'une ferveur mobilisatrice des masses arabes. Ces deux évolutions, chacune à sa façon, contestent la pensée politique héritée de l'Occident. Quelques penseurs arabes ont profité de la catastrophe de juin 1967 pour analyser les structures profondes des sociétés arabes actuelles : communautarisme, mentalité « poétique », et surtout expérience originale de l'appartenance nationale. Réflexions sociologiques assez indépendantes des pressions idéologiques pour aider à saisir un phénomène comme le « nationalisme arabe », par exemple. Since the Six-Day War, the two most prominent lines of Arab political thought in the Near East have been, on the one hand, the Palestinian theories of the Arab revolution and, on the other, the Islamisation of the Arab socialism inherited from Nasser. The basic texts put out by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Popular and Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PDFLP), and also the more moderate st~<br>

Abstract: O plural e conflituoso entendimento da legitimação da pena no Direito, tem origem nas diversas intencionalidades que lhe conferem sentido. Neste artigo são analisadas as intencionalidades mais relevantes, destacando os seus modelos justificativos: retribuição, reparação, prevenção, expiação, reabilitação e restauração (precedidas pela vingança, extrajudiríca). Para melhor análise destes são também consideradas a variável da temporalidade (passado, presente, futuro) e a variável dos sujeitos, que protagonizam a dinâmica do castigo (infractor, víctima, Estado, sociedade). Depois, num momento comparativo, destacam-se criticamente as confluencias e as oposições. Assim será possível concluir que a intencionalidade restauradora e a sua firme relativização do castigo é aquela que melhor consegue articular as variáveis de sentido-com os seus valores-, a temporalidade e os sujeitos, pelo que se mostra ser a referência mais positiva para a legitimização. Contudo, dada a sua precaridade, devido ao seu surgimento recente, impõe-se reforçá-la reflexivamente e prácticamente. The plural and conflictual understanding of the legitimacy of penalty in law stems from diverse intentionalities that constitute their respective meanings. This article analyzes the most relevant intentionalities. It seeks to highlight the models that justifies them: retribution, reparation, prevention, atonement, rehabilitation and restoration (preceded by vengeance, extrajudirical). To better analyze these models, the variable of temporality (past, present, future) and the variable of the subjects are also considered in view of the fact that they operate in the dynamics of punishment (offender, victim, State, society). Then, establishing comparisons, the confluences and oppositions are critically highlighted. In order to conclude that the restorative intentionality and its strong relativization of punishment is the one who can best articulate the variables of meaning -with their values, involving temporalit~<br>

Abstract: In Arendt's interrogations of political modernity, the concepts of history and politics have an ambiguous relation. On the one hand, she insisted that the performative character of politics as action was bound to its narrative aspect as remembrance. She was also a fervent proponent of integrating the historical sense into political understanding. On the other hand, Arendt characterized the modern historical sensibility from the point of view of politics as a "ghastly absurdity," and asserted that the political thought of our times needed to free itself both "from history" and "from thinking in historical terms." This paper explores the different meanings that Arendt granted to "history" as a (anti) political force and to historical sensibility as the basis for political understanding. It argues that not only were Arendt's rejection of the modern concept of history and its politics of history central for her critique, but that it was one of the key concerns that shaped the articulation of her own theory of action. The paper also examines the problem against the background of the intellectual tradition of Arendt's youth and in particular its uncompromising antihistoricism.<br>

Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and t~<br>

Author(s): Mills Mary<br>
Abstract: This paper explores the profiles of the women characters Sarah and Hagar as models of human identity. The two characters can only be explored through reading the over-arching narrative of the story of Abraham. Their profiles and narrated personalities have to be extracted from that narrative, but there is a two-sided nature of this necessity. If Sarah and Hagar cannot be separated from the biblical narrator's engagement with father Abraham, neither can Abraham function as father of the nations except through his interaction with these two women. The reader is thus led towards an understanding of how the stories of Genesis 12-24 deal with the issue of parenthood. The body of the paper consists in a close reading of the biblical material following a method of reading which is rooted in the use of imagination as an exegetical tool - a style adopted by Paul in his allegorical approach to Sarah and Hagar in Galatians 4. This approach opens into narrative criticism with a focus on characterisation and on the interactions of Sarah, Hagar and Abraham, caught up in a Domestic Comedy. The women's characters are explored through the themes of parenthood as other, the other woman and woman as other. A final section explores some of the points of narrative ethics to be extracted from the close textual readings of the paper, with reference to the writings of Paul Ricoeur and Emmanuel Levinas. It is suggested that female as well as male characters may offer fruitful models for human identity.<br>

Abstract: Serge Lifar built his career during the 1930s, a decade crucial to understanding his 'années noires'-or 'black years', as the French historian Henry Rousso called the period of the German occupation of Paris (1940—1944). Lifar's powerful and respected position at the Paris Opéra, the social connections he had built and maintained and the psychological impact of exile: all these elements help clarify Lifar's accommodating attitude towards the German occupants of his adopted city. During the 1930s Lifar came to be accepted in French intellectual society as the 'heir' of Serge Diaghilev. Through his publications he made a powerful contribution to the process by which Diaghilev's Ballets Russes assumed its paramount position in the development of modern ballet, a process set in motion by the impresario himself. Lifar played this role chiefly in France. In the English-speaking world, where relatively few of his books appeared in translation, other writers served to canonise the Diaghilev endeavour, albeit for somewhat different ends. A list of Lifar's publications in Russian and other languages (French above all) displays the growing influence of his actions and authority, the power of his connections (inherited primarily from Diaghilev), and his relentless will to overcome the problems of emigration as he secured not only success as a dancer and choreograph but also a public reputation as an intellectual. The recent discovery of new evidence has led to the identification of the respected Pushkin authority Modeste Hofmann as the writer whose unacknowledged work enabled Lifar to establish himself as an historian. This evidence, provided by Hofmann's grandsons André and Vladimir Hofmann, raises serious questions about the authority of Lifar's books. An interplay of subjective relationships is woven into the texture of these narratives in which survival and ambition, a paternal attitude and filial respect, exist in constant tension. Neither the making of these books nor the~<br>

Abstract: Sob o pano de fundo da fenomenologia de Husserl acerca da ciência como conhecimento, os autores propōem uma análise da filosofia da percepção de Merleau-Ponty, em termos do que agora é referido como "estados da experimentação e da prática científica". Para este fim, é conceptualizada a pós-fenomenologia corno uma nova abordagem filosófica à tecnologia, examinando criticamente a análise da percepçāo de Merleau-Ponty. Posteriormente é apresentada uma concepçāo baseada no estudo das práticas em química, que exemplifica a crítica dos autores à necessidade, na teoria da percepção de Merleau-Ponty, da consideração dos mediadores tecnocientíficos. Como conclusão, tendo em conta as práticas tecnológicas e científicas, os autores defendem a utilidade do conceito de percepção na compreensão da geraçāo do conhecimento nas ciências experimentais e na tecnologia. Against the background of Husserl's phenomenology about science as knowledge, we propose an analysis of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of perception in terms of what now is referred to as "studies of experimentation and scientific practices". To this end, we conceptualize post-phenomenology as a new philosophical approach to technology, and critically examine Merleau-Ponty's analysis of perception. We then present a conception based upon the study of practices in chemistry that substantiates our critique of the lack of consideration for technoscientific mediators in Merleau-Ponty's theory of perception. In conclusion, taking account of technological and scientific practices, we argue for the concept's usefulness in understanding knowledge generation in experimental sciences and technology.<br>

Author(s): Biggs Iain<br>
Abstract: This article has two concerns. The first is with how rural lifeworlds are understood and conceptualized from outside, usually in terms of normative assumptions predicated on notions of unity, consistency, and totality. The second is with how better to articulate the richness and complexity of such lifeworlds. These concerns are set out in terms of an understanding of the relationship between lifeworlds and a spectrum of experience located between twin poles: position and place. It then refers to a number of creative projects in Ireland seen as indicative of a new way of acknowledging and articulating the richness and complexity of rural lifeworlds. Le présent article a un double objet : d'une part, il traite des différentes compréhensions et conceptualisations des mondes de la vie (Lebenswelt) ruraux tels que vus de l'extérieur, principalement en terme des hypothèses normatives reposant sur des idées d'unité, de constance, et de totalité. Dans un deuxième temps, il tente de mieux déterminer et exprimer la complexité et la richesse de ces mondes de vie. Ces préoccupations sont énoncées dans l'optique de la compréhension des relations entre ces mondes de vie et d'une matrice expérientielle située entre deux pôles : positionnement et emplacement. Suit un survol de différents projets créateurs provenant de part et d'autre de l'Irlande qui font état de ces nouvelles façons de reconnaître et d'exprimer la richesse et la complexité des mondes de vie ruraux.<br>

Abstract: Theories of recognition provide an understanding of selfhood as based on narrative identity. In striking up and maintaining a relationship with the Other through telling my story, I am acknowledged as a conversation partner and as a self, endowed with a personal history and biographical experience. The driving force of this process is the hope or struggle for recognition, for being seen and acknowledged by the Other. This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of recognition to read fictional first-person narration as a scenario of encounter between narrator and addressee. It draws from narrative psychology, autobiography theory, and narratological concepts of reader positioning to consider how readers encounter a fictional narrator. The relevance of such a reception-based model is illustrated by revisiting two classics of twentieth-century American literature featuring narrators who raise their voices from the margins: J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. By reading these novels as narratives of recognition, I argue that the rise to iconic status of the narrators, Holden Caulfield and the Invisible Man, can be related to the intense scenario of address that calls readers to recognize these fictional tellers.<br>

Abstract: This paper is an attempt to explore the continuing relevance of Nietzsche's genealogical analysis of Western rationality to the sociology of knowledge. While Nietzsche is often neglected in classical sociological theory textbooks, this paper argues that Nietzsche has a very significant contribution to sociological theory especially in the field of knowledge production. Recent sociologists are now acknowledging this tradition. Hence this paper discusses how the basic tenets of Nietzsche's critique of Western metaphysics and positivism can be harnessed to create a powerful critique of contemporary sociological understanding of knowledge construction and its legitimation in society. Some of these themes are discussed at the end of the paper especially in relation to Philippine sociology.<br>

Abstract: Thousands of child Holocaust survivors arrived in Montreal, Quebec, between 1947 and 1952, looking to remake their lives, rebuild their families, and recreate their communities. Integration was not seamless. As survivors struggled to carve spaces for themselves within the established Canadian Jewish community, their difficult wartime stories were neither easily received nor understood. When remembering this period, survivors tend to speak about employment, education, dating, integration into both the pre-war Jewish community and the larger society, and, perhaps most importantly, the creation of their own social worlds within existing and new frameworks. Forged in a transitional and tumultuous period in Quebec's history, these social worlds, as this article demonstrates, are an important example of survivor agency. Although survivors recall the ways in which Canadian Jews helped them adjust to their new setting, by organizing a number of programs and clubs within various spaces—Jeanne Mance House, the Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association, and the Jewish Public Library—they also speak about how they forged their own paths upon arriving in this postwar city. For instance, survivors created the New World Club, an informal and grassroots social organization where they could prioritize their own needs and begin to be understood as people, and not just survivors. Establishing the interconnections between these formal and informal social worlds, and specifically, how survivors navigated them, is central to understanding the process through which they were able to move beyond their traumatic pasts and start over. Nightmares and parties are parts of the same story, and here the focus is on the memories of young survivors who prioritized their social worlds. Des milliers d'enfants survivants de l'Holocauste sont arrivés à Montréal, au Québec, entre 1947 et 1952, cherchant à refaire leurs vies, reconstruire leurs familles et recréer leurs communautés.

Abstract: According to German criminal law, a person who violates a criminal law rule will be excused under the conditions of § 35 German Criminal Code (necessity as an excuse). What are the reasons for not holding an offender responsible in these cases although he may have even caused the death of his victim? In section II of this essay, the usual answers to this question are analysed. The result is that none of them is utterly convincing. They all have in common that they underestimate the importance of the victim's interest in his personal freedom. In section III, the author puts forward his own interpretation of § 35 German Criminal Code. This interpretation is based on the distinction between two meanings of legal freedom. In the first place the members of a legal community are obliged to respect the „negative freedom“ of each other. On the basis of this understanding of „freedom“ the defence of necessity appears as an alien element within the system of criminal law. However, the status of the members of a legal community is not confined to their „negative freedom.“ To some extent, the criminal law also recognizes their „positive freedom“: the interest of each individual to preserve his personal integrity. The defence of necessity in § 35 German Criminal Code can be interpreted as acknowledging the offender's „positive freedom.“ In the final section of this essay (section IV) this model of explanation is applied to a range of detailed problems raised by § 35 German Criminal Code.<br>

Author(s): Johnston Erin F.<br>
Abstract: This article is concerned with identifying, comparing, and accounting for the principal rhetorical conventions within Pagan practitioners' narratives of conversion. Applying key insights from studies on narrative identity and drawing on 15 months offieldwork and 25 in-depth interviews with Pagan practitioners, I first outline formal similarities in the content of participants' narratives, arguing that these narrative conventions together constitute an ideal typical conversion narrative: what I call the rhetoric of continuity. This narrative form depicts the process of conversion as a rediscovery or uncovering of a temporally continuous and essentialized Pagan self I suggest that while all conversions involve both change and continuity, adherents of different faith traditions vary in the degree to which they stress self-transformation and/or self-continuity. I then argue that the rhetoric of continuity reflects and reinforces practitioners': (1) perspective on the locus and nature of the authentic self; (2) claims to legitimacy and social acceptance: and (3) understanding of the nature of religious truth.<br>

Author(s): Goldberg Chad Alan<br>
Abstract: Pierre Bourdieu developed a theory of democratic politics that is at least as indebted to civic republicanism as to Marxism. He was familiar with the civic republican tradition, and it increasingly influenced both his political interventions and sociological work, especially late in his career. Bourdieu drew above all on Niccolò Machiavelli's version of republicanism, though the French republican tradition also influenced him via Durkheimian social theory. Three elements of Bourdieu's work in particular—his concept of field autonomy, his view of interests and universalism, and his understanding of how solidarity is generated and sustained—may be understood, at least in part, as sociological reformulations of republican ideas. By drawing attention to these republican influences, the article aims to show that the conceptual resources which some critics, including Jeffrey C. Alexander, consider indispensable to an adequate theory of democracy are not entirely absent in Bourdieu's work. On the basis of this reassessment, the article concludes that Bourdieu and Alexander are not as opposed in their thinking about democratic politics as it might first appear.<br>

Abstract: Psychology has uncritically adopted the individual person as its object of study without examining the concept and role of personhood within contemporary society and Western culture more generally. We examine three perspectives that challenge this familiar and unexamined object of our disciplinary inquiry: (1 ) Critical Theory's concept of the bourgeois individual as psychology's subject of ideology; (2) Poststructuralism's challenge to the concept of personhood as an integrated and self-present center of consciousness and action; (3) System Theory's alternative epistemology in which relations rather than entities have primacy. Each perspective introduces a concept of personhood that significantly differs from our present understanding of psychology's subject and that lays the foundation for a new subject of psychological inquiry: a multicentered, multidimensional subject.<br>

Author(s): Farber Seth<br>
Abstract: Drawing upon recent developments in epistemology, this work attempts to advance the argument against the use of the medical model in psychology and psychotherapy. This model constitutes a culturally hegemonic interpretation that is epistemologically inadequate and that is an obstacle to the process of psychological change, both outside and within the context of the therapeutic relationship. Phenomena currently interpreted as "psychiatric disorders" can more adequately and constructively be made sense of with the use of categories derived from the cultural understanding of the processes of growth and education. It is proposed that widespread problems of life are not symptoms of an epidemic of mental illness but signs that humanity is involved in a process of evolution.<br>

Abstract: Neste ensaio, entrelaço fios de vidas das mulheres negras que estáo atadas óï fio da minha vida. Com os fios soltos das canções de Zezé Motta e dos escritos da filósofa Hannah Arendt, teço este texto-existência. Na leitura dos ensaios e poemas de Marlene Nourbese Philip, escritora afro-caribenha, me inspiro não só para resistir às amarras culturais hegemônicas, mas também para transcendê-las, criando possibilidades de escrita que vincule a dinâmica da fala com a dinámica da ocóo, compondo um texto que se movimenta ora como dança, através do espaço, ora como urna canção, ritmada pelo tempo, pois criar e dançar uma coreografia é uma forma de fazer historia. Como investiga Selma Treviños, trata-se de urna ferramenta para animar o passado ou uma "escrita" acerca de algo que já foi feito, se concordamos que cada corpo carrega sua pròpria história e individualidade, memòria, sentimentos e emoções. Na busca do entendimento desta minha breve existência, danço, escrevo, teço palavras com fios desfiados da flor do útero das minhas ancestrais. Vasculho minhas lembranças e, na memória corporal, decifro a dor, encontró a raiz da violência, observo o medo, destilo a alegría, enfeito a doçura, mergulho na paz e conheço a liberdade. In that essay I interweave threads of the black women's lives that are tied to the thread of my life. With the free threads of Zezé Motta's songs and of philosopher Hannah Arendfs writings, I weave this text-existence. In the reading of the essay and poems of Marlene NourbeSe Philip, writer Afro-Caribbean, I am inspired not only to resist the hegemonic cultural ties, but also transcend them, creating possibilities of writing that links the dynamics of the speech with the dynamics of the action, to compose a text that is moved some times as a dance through the space, other times as a song, with its rhythm determinedby time, because creating and dancing a choreography is a form of making history. As investigates Selma Treviños it is a tool to encourage th~<br>

Author(s): Martin Catherine Gimelli<br>
Abstract: The Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation considerably deepened the moral and philosophical understanding of the concept of evil. Building on the early Christian Fathers and especially on Augustine's seminal analyses of the causes and effects of the human fall, post-Reformation thinkers at once adopted and modified his refutation of Manichean evil with ideas imported from John Calvin, Jacobus Arminius, and later, from "natural" or rational religion. Given the current resistance to standard theological explanations of evil, this article centers on the rational approaches associated first with Richard Hooker and then with his most radical disciple, Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury. Tracing the development of rational ideas of evil, the article examines these ideas' exploration in literature by William Shakespeare and John Milton in the characters of Macbeth and Satan.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo procura abordar os papéis de sacerdote, chefe e xamã - todos presentes no ngillatun, ritual de fertilidade mapuche - da perspectiva de seus modos diferenciais de travar relações por meio da linguagem. A linguagem, conforme entendida pelos Mapuche do meio rural chileno, não emerge exclusivamente das intenções de falantes individuais, mas igualmente da força (newen) constitutiva da totalidade do ser. Sacerdotes, chefes e xamãs recorrem à fala para alinhar-se a essa força, que por meio deles se atualiza. Uma tal observação lança nova luz sobre o entendimento de Clastres quanto à relação entre chefia e linguagem. Se, acompanhando os Mapuche, enfatizamos as qualidades indexicais da linguagem, em detrimento das simbólicas, vemos que se torna um tanto problemático analisar a linguagem dos chefes em conformidade com um modelo de “troca”, como faz Clastres. This paper seeks to approach the roles of priest, chief, and shaman — all present in the Mapuche ngilUtun fertility ritual -from the perspective of their differential modes of relating through language. Language, as understood by rural Mapuche, emerges not solely from the intentions of individual speakers, but equally from the force -newen -constitutive of all being. Priests, chiefs, and shamans all seek to align themselves through speech to this force which instantiates itself through them. Such an observation casts new light on Clastres' understanding of the relationship between chiefs and language. If we follow Mapuche in emphasizing the indexical rather than symbolic qualities of language, we see that Clastres'analysis of chiefly language as susceptible to a model of "exchange" becomes somewhat problematic.<br>

Abstract: Focusing on the difference between traditional hermeneutics and more scientifically oriented approaches to literature, this essay argues that our understanding of currently debated issues—such as whether a canon should and/or can be abolished—is significantly increased if one formulates nomological theories that can be empirically tested. To stimulate further research of this kind, two "laws" of literary history are proposed.<br>

Abstract: Une réflexion générale sur les concepts linguistiques de diachronie et de synchronie pourrait permettre de porter un nouvel éclairage sur l'herméneutique des textes bibliques. La première partie de cet article décrit donc la genèse et l'évolution de la fameuse dichotomie saussurienne, et son incidence dans l'interprétation des textes. Dans une deuxième étape, les deux catégories de Saussure sont confrontées à d'autres perspectives qui permettent de dépasser la tension entre synchronie et diachronie textuelles, notamment l'approche de Guillaume (endochronie), celle de l'herméneutique antique (métachronie) et celle de la pragmatique (autochronie). Cette comparaison débouche sur une réévaluation de la perspective saussurienne en vue de l'étude du signifié, et notamment de celui des textes bibliques. A consideration of the linguistic concepts of diachrony and synchrony could lead to a greater understanding of Biblical hermeneutics. The first part of this article discusses the origin and the evolution of the well known Saussurian dichotomy, as well as its influence on textual interpretation. In the second part the two Saussurian perspectives are compared with other categories allowing us to go beyond synchronie and diachronie textual opposition: those applied by Guillaume (endochrony), by the first to comment on literary texts (metachrony) and by a pragmatic approach (autochrony). Such a comparison permits us to make a new appraisal of the two Saussurian perspectives in order to achieve a better analysis of the signified, especially with respect to Biblical texts.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40172080<br>
Date: 9 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Araral Eduardo<br>
Abstract: The first-generation literature on policy design has made considerable contributions over the last 30 years to our understanding of the process, politics and implications of policy design and instrument choice. This literature, however, has generally treated institutions as a black box and has not developed a coherent set of frameworks, theories and models of how institutions matter to policy design. In this paper, I unpack the black box of institutions using transaction cost and mechanism design to show how regulations can be better designed in developing countries when institutions are weak, unaccountable, corrupted or not credible. Under these conditions, I show that efficient regulatory design has to minimize transaction costs, particularly agency problems, by having incentive compatible (self-enforcing) mechanisms. I conclude with a second-generation research agenda on regulatory design with implications for environmental, food and drug safety, healthcare and financial regulation in developing countries.<br>

Publisher: Society for Applied Anthropology<br>
Issue: i40172767<br>
Date: 4 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): BAHR HOWARD M.<br>
Abstract: Disciplinary specialties and boundaries may impede as well as facilitate understanding. Standard scholarly orientations to the study of Navajos and other ethnic populations manifest many biases of ethnocentrism and a general tendency to stereotype. Specific observer-related tendencies to distort are noted, among them tendencies to understate social dynamics and the degree to which Navajos are functioning parts of wider social systems. The literature on Navajos is a product of changing tools in the hands of changing observers applied to changing communities in the context of ongoing change in the wider societies of both observer and observed. It is argued that "multiplying glimpses," or increasing the number and types of observers and the variety of disciplines and paradigms represented, may reduce observer and position biases that distort existing views of Navajo society. An overview of the massive literature on the Navajo leads to the identification of 21 distinct genres. These genres and other Navajo texts may profitably be viewed in the perspective of textual analysis, broadly defined. Issues of meaning and interpretation are considered, including the reality-language-text nexus, construction of texts, text-context patterns, and the interaction of text, situation, and analyst in interpretation. Appropriate use of existing texts is socially responsible "green research" and should not be professionally stigmatized. It substitutes resource-efficient recycling of discarded and underanalyzed texts for the old expensive, obtrusive colonial patterns of work.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines key implications of praxis theory for applied anthropology. I am concerned with applied anthropology as a communicative and collaborative process and with a critical understanding of the anthropologist's role as consultant, practitioner, and analyst in processes of planned change. The use of praxis as a central analytic leitmotif places "practical" activity, informed by theory, at the center of applied research. The analysis is illustrated through a description of a multi-disciplinary, community-based health research and planning project in seven native communities in Ontario. I examine how practical knowledge and action constrains and transforms academic models of community based development.<br>

Abstract: This paper analyzes the kind of historical understanding presupposed in the writing of classical Chinese Ch'an Buddhist "transmission" narratives and places this historical understanding into comparative juxtaposition with modern Western historiographic practice. It finds that fundamental to Chinese Ch'an historical awareness are genealogical metaphors structuring historical time and meaning in terms of generations of family relations and the practices of inheritance. These metaphors link the Ch'an historian to the texts of historical study in ways that contrast with the posture of modern historians. The essay outlines four basic differences between the self-understanding presupposed in Ch'an Buddhist historical writing and that assumed in modern historical research and concludes by suggesting how contemporary historical thinking might benefit from reflecting on these differences.<br>

Publisher: SAGE<br>

Abstract: Drawing on the theoretical insights of Paul Ricoeur this paper investigates the geographies of public remembrance in a post-conflict society. In Northern Ireland, where political divisions have found expression through acts of extreme violence over the past 30 years, questions of memory and an amnesty for forgetting have particular resonance both at the individual and societal level, and render Ricoeur's framework particularly prescient. Since the signing of the Belfast Agreement in 1998, initiating the Peace Process through consociational structures, discovering a nomenclature and set of practices which would aid in the rapprochement of a deeply divided society has presented a complex array of issues. In this paper I examine the various practices of public remembrance of the 1998 bombing of Omagh as a means of understanding how memory-spaces evolve in a post-conflict context. In Omagh there were a variety of commemorative practices instituted and each, in turn, adopted a different contour towards achieving reconciliation with the violence and grief of the bombing. In particular the Garden of Light project is analysed as a collective monument which, with light as its metaphysical centre, invited the populace to reflect backward on the pain of the bombing while at the same time enabling the society to look forward toward a peaceful future where a politics of hope might eclipse a politics of despair.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I set out a phenomenology of social transformation, based on an analysis of the distinctively religious form of communication which underlies the trans-generational and trans-cultural transmission of world traditions, taking Confucianism and Christianity as their representatives. A phenomenological analysis of their communicative structure allows the possibility of a better understanding of what can be learnt from them in the context of contemporary debates in both China and the West on the relations between religion, ethics and politics. This analysis suggests that the ethical consistency of belief and act, which is the necessary condition for the engendering of long-term solidarity in religious community, has significant implications for ethics in politics, and especially for the legitimacy of representational leadership as a focal point for change in society. The paper concludes that the historical experience of world religions can offer new insights into the nature of political leadership and representation in today's globalised world and that the appropriate locus for this inquiry is the present negotiation and re-negotiation of relations between China and the West.<br>

Abstract: The Jesuit Refugee Service contributes in a creative way to the mission of «faith doing justice». Its starting point is the experience of and with the refugees it is called to serve. This article, therefore, has a distinct narrative character. JRS' practice sheds light on some important aspects of justice, which can also be found in solid presentations of Catholic Social Teaching. This contribution highlights how faith, mission (accompaniment, service and advocacy) and institutional capacity are key features of a solid understanding of justice. Il Servizio dei gesuiti per i rifugiati (JRS) contribuisce in modo creativo alla missione della «fede che opera la giustizia». Il suo punto di partenza è l'esperienza dei e con i rifugiati che si è chiamati a serviré. Questo articolo, tuttavia, presenta una diversa peculiarità di discorso. L'esperienza del JRS illumina alcuni aspetti importanti della giustizia che possono anche essere ritrovati in importanti trattazioni della dottrina sociale della Chiesa. Questo contributo chiarisce come la fede, la missione (accogiienza, servizio e tutela) e la capacità di muoversi a livello istituzionale siano chiavi imprescindibili per una comprensione profonda della giustizia.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur examine la thèse du théologien Bernard Hort, « Contingence et intériorité », consacrée à l'œuvre philosophique de Pierre Thévenaz. Après avoir reconnu la légitimité d'une interprétation théologique de la philosophie thévenazienne, D. Müller s'interroge sur l'hypothèse des deux Thévenaz, sur le durcissement hénologique imputé au deuxième Thévenaz et sur la compréhension du protestantisme que B. Hort lui oppose. The article examines the thesis of Bernard Hort, "Contingency and inferiority"', given over to the philosophy of P. Thévenaz. While recognizing the legitimacy of a theological interpretation of Thévenaz, Müller questions the hypothesis of the two Thévenaz', the henological hardening attributed to the second Thévenaz and the understanding of Protestantism with which Hort opposes Thévenaz.<br>

Abstract: Ouvrage de référence imposant et important, l'Encyclopédie du protestantisme offre des outils d'analyse et de connaissance de la tradition protestante. Venant à la suite de nombreuses autres lectures critiques, la présente étude aborde le projet dans son ensemble avant de parcourir les petites rubriques puis les grands dossiers. A chaque niveau sont alliés la présentation et le regard critique. L'étude se termine par la question centrale de l'ouvrage, celle de l'identité protestante. An imposing and important reference book, the Enyclopédie du protestantisme offers tools for analysing and understanding the protestant tradition. Coming after numerous other critical studies, it begins with an overall view before presenting smaller headings followed by the greater issues. At every level exposition is aligned with criticism. The study ends with the central question of the book, that of Protestant identity.<br>

Abstract: Contrairement à certains préjugés laïcistes radicaux, la question de Dieu est au cœur de l'éthique. Or les débats actuels de la bioéthique ne permettent pas toujours d'identifier clairement la pertinence de cette question. Afin de parvenir à une reformulation crédible de la contribution de l'éthique théologique à la discussion publique, il importe d'interroger les différentes manières de comprendre la relation entre les catégories d'immanence et de transcendance. En dialogue critique avec H. Tristram Engelhardt, l'auteur balise les conditions fondamentales d'accès à une interprétation de Dieu comme mystère du monde et de l'existence et donc aussi comme horizon indépassable de toute éthique. Contrary to certain radical lay prejudices, the question of God is at the heart of ethics. Yet current debates on bioethics do not always help to clearly identify the pertinence of the question. To reformulate the contribution of theological ethics to public discussion in a credible way, we must examine the different ways of understanding the relationship between immanence and transcendance. In critical dialogue with H. Tristram Engelhardt, the author marks out the basic conditions to access an interpretation of God as mystery of the world and of existance, thus also as the impassable horizon of all ethics.<br>

Abstract: Comment déjouer les préjugés et l'ignorance liés, hier comme aujourd'hui, au christianisme ? Pour répondre à cette question, des extraits de la Lettre à Diognète sont présentés ci-dessous. Les antithèses et les paradoxes de ce texte rédigé à Alexandrie vers 190 après Jésus-Christ tissent la trame de cet écrit apologétique. Ils fournissent des repères utiles pour comprendre la condition chrétienne. Cette lettre donne également des indications précieuses pour penser et déchiffrer les rapports que les chrétiens sont appelés à instaurer avec la société dans laquelle ils vivent. How to avoid the prejudice and ignorance linked, today as yesterday, to Christianity? As an answer, extracts of the Letter to Diognetus are given here. Antitheses and paradoxes are the warp and the woof of this apologetic text written in Alexandria about 190 a.d. They provide useful criteria for understanding the Christian condition. This letter also gives precious indications for considering and deciphering the relationships Christians are called to establish with the societies in which they live.<br>

Abstract: Lorsqu'il expose son éthique minimale, Ruwen Ogien se démarque explicitement de toute théorie de l'agent, et particulièrement de l'authenticité. Dans cet article, j'examine une des théories de l'authenticité, celle de Sartre. Je décris ensuite ma compréhension de l'éthique d'Ogien. Je conclus que, loin de s'opposer, ces deux théories présentent des points de contact, notamment l'importance de reconnaître la dimension personnelle de la responsabilité. Ruwen Ogien keeps his minimalist ethics explicitly aloof from any theory of the agent, in particular from authenticity. In this paper, I examine one of the theories of authenticity, namely that of Jean-Paul Sartre. I then describe my understanding of Ogien's ethics. I conclude that, far from being opposite, both theories meet, especially on the importance of recognizing the personal extension of responsibility.<br>

Abstract: Les mathématiques, auxquelles on peut joindre la logique, et depuis 1960 une large part de l'informatique théorique, fournissent un témoignage sur une part essentielle du fonctionnement de l'esprit humain. Loin de fournir seulement des outils extérieurs, elles se sont faites mode de pensée nécessaire pour appréhender la réalité physique. Elles nous ont appris que ce que nous nommons raison, démarche rationnelle, est en réalité laborieusement construit. Un bref survol de l'histoire des mathématiques, anciennes, puis surtout depuis le XIXe s., montre en quel sens le concept ancien de « vérité scientifique » s'en trouve désormais modifié. Mathematics, to which one may add logic and, since 1960, a large section of theoretical computer technique, all furnish evidence concerning an essential part of the working of the human mind. Far from providing only external tools, they have evolved as a necessary mode of thought for the understanding of physical reality. They have taught us that what we call reason, or rational deduction, is in fact something we have ourselves laboriously constructed. A brief survey of the history of mathematics, ancient and modern but especially from and after the 19th century, shows ways in which the old concept of a 'scientific truth' must henceforth be modified.<br>

Abstract: Relecture de l'inédit de Jean Nahert: « La conscience peut-elle se comprendre? » dans l'optique de la philosophie herméneutique contemporaine. Dès 1934, la philosophie de Nahert opère une percée en direction du concept herméneutique d'autocompréhension, même si sa formulation originale du problème exige de quiconque défend le concept de « raison herméneutique » un très sévère « examen de conscience ». C'est ce que montre une analyse de la formule « l'inquiétude du se comprendre » dont on rencontre de nombreuses occurrences dans le texte. Même si le terme « désir de Dieu » n'apparaît pas dans ce texte de 1934, on peut y discerner l'annonce de la thèse que « ce sont les conditions de possibilité de la conscience de soi qui fondent le désir de Dieu ». Rereading Jean Nabert's unpublished « Can Conscience Understand Itself » through the eyes of contemporary hermeneutical philosophy. As early as 1934, Nabert's philosophy makes a breakthrough in the direction of the hermeneutical concept of autocomprehension even if, in its original formulation, it demands a very severe « examination of conscience » of whomever defends the concept of « hermeneutical reason ». This is shown by an analysis of the expression « the unrest of understanding oneself » repeated several times in the text And even if the expression « desire for God » does not appear in this 1934 text, one can discern there the beginnings of the thesis that « it is the conditions of the possibility of conscience of self that found the desire for God ».<br>

Abstract: La conception de la contemplation et de la vie contemplative connaît une évolution intéressante dans un ordre contemplatif par excellence, celui des Chartreux entre ses débuts et la fin du XIIIe siècle. Cet article tente d'explorer ce tournant à partir de l'analyse de trois auteurs: Guigues II, Hugues de Balma, Guigues du Pont. Héritier de la tradition monastique de la lectio divina, le premier met en place l'échelle des moines montant de la lecture à la méditation, à la prière et à la contemplation. Mais le second en scie les barreaux : concevant une théologie mystique, union affective à Dieu sans connaissance antécédente ou concomitante, il conduit au paradoxe d'une vie contemplative sans contemplation. Les distinctions subtiles du dernier rendent à la théologie mystique une contemplation anagogique et font place à ses côtés à une contemplation spéculative des philosophes, des théologiens, des mystiques. The understanding of contemplation and the contemplative life sees an interesting evolution in an order contemplative par excellence, the Carthusians, between its beginnings and the end of the XIIIth century. On the basis of the analyses of three authors, Guigues II, Hugh of Balma, and Guigues Du Pont, this article endeavors to explore this turn. Heir to the monastic tradition of lectio divina, the first sets in place the ladder for monks ascending from reading to meditation, from prayer to contemplation. Yet the second saws apart the rungs. Conceiving of a mystical theology, an affective union with God without preceding or concomitant knowledge, he shows the way to the paradox of a contemplative life without contemplation. The subtle distinctions of the last bestow upon mystical theology an anagogic contemplation and clear the away around it for a speculative contemplation of the philosophers, theologians and mystics.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur se propose de vérifier l'affirmation de Lavelle selon laquelle l'ouvrage de 1937, De l'Acte, se serait progressivement développé comme une synthèse complète de sa philosophie. Or il existe, à l'état dactylographié, une version antérieure de ce livre, qui permet de comprendre combien l'aisance presque trop grande des analyses de 1937 cache en fait une élaboration lente et un effort continu. La version inédite insiste sur l'intemporalité transcendantale de l'acte, et sur l'impersonnalité de l'acte fondateur de toutes les existences personnelles. Ces thèses seront abandonnées en 1937. On analyse ensuite l'article « Être et Acte » et la conférence de la société française de philosophie sur « Acte créateur et acte réflexif », où est discutée la position de Jean Nabert. Les thèses de De l'Acte montrent une progression de l'identité de l'être et de l'acte (dans l'acte d'être) jusqu'à l'acte en sa forme la plus haute, l'acte d'amour. Situer cette œuvre capitale implique qu'on ait bien compris l'interprétation du sensible comme de la donnée matérielle qui doit être spiritualisée. L'expérience extérieure du sensible s'oppose à l'expérience intérieure de l'esprit. Et l'acte est l'œuvre de l'être spirituel. L'ontologie dynamique de Lavelle est une affirmation de la liberté humaine comme participation à l'acte créateur divin. Divin ou humain, l'être est subjectif parce que libre. Ainsi Lavelle s'inscrit dans la tradition platonicienne moderne, celle d'Avicenne d'abord, celle de Hegel ensuite. The author proposes to verify Lavelle's assertion that the 1937 work, De l'Acte, would be progressively developed as a complete synthesis of his philosophy. Now there exists in typewritten state an earlier version of this book, which allows us to see the extent to which the almost excessive facility of analyses of 1937 in fact conceals a slow development and a continuous effort. The unedited version insists upon the transcendental atemporality of act, and upon the impersonality of ~<br>

Abstract: La réception de Kierkegaard en France marque les années 1930-1960. Contemporaine de l'introduction de Heidegger, Jaspers et Barth et de l'approfondissement de la connaissance de Hegel, elle concourt à l'éclosion des philosophies de l'existence en France. Nous l'étudions en fonction de la notion de transferts culturels. Dans les années trente, elle repose sur un milieu étroit. Kierkegaard incarne une figure de modernité philosophique et religieuse. En le commentant, Jean Wahl et Léon Chestov constituent une grammaire de l'existence. Après guerre, l'existentialisme triomphe sous les auspices de Sartre et Merleau-Ponty et Kierkegaard est consacré « père de l'existentialisme ». Les penseurs chrétiens en font le rempart de l'athéisme; les autres le laïcisent : l'angoisse l'emporte sur le « devant Dieu ». The reception of Kierkegaard in France marks the years 1930-1960. Contemporary with the introduction of Heidegger, Jaspers and Barth and with the deepening of the understanding of Hegel, it conspires with the blossoming of philosophies of existence in France. This paper studies it in connection with the notion of cultural exchanges. During the thirties, it remains confined to a narrow circle. Kierkegaard embodies philosophical and religious modernity. Commenting upon it, Jean Wahl and Leon Chestov construct a grammar of existence. After the war, existentialism triumphs under the auspices of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, and Kierkegaard is acclaimed as the « father of Existentialism ». Christian thinkers make of him the rampart of atheism; others secularize him. Anxiety prevails against the « before God ».<br>

Abstract: Cet article passe en revue les ouvrages suivants du neurobiologiste Jean-Pierre Changeux : L'homme neuronal, 1983, Raison et plaisir, 1982, Ce qui nous fait penser (un dialogue avec Paul Ricœur), 1998, L'homme de vérité, 2002. L'auteur y montre les changements dans les thèses de Changeux en les accompagnant de ses commentaires philosophiques et théologiques aussi bien critiques que constructifs. L'homme, ses origines et sa structure, le cerveau humain, la conscience de soi, la matière et sa complexité évolutive, la sensibilité artistique, la morale, la religion, la question d'une lecture intégrale de Darwin et de Spinoza, la signification du discours sur « l'homme de vérité » sont les principaux sujets traités. Le but de l'article est un dialogue interdisciplinaire entre neurosciences et théologie sur la compréhension de l'être humain. This article passes in revue the following works of the neurobiologist J.-P. Changeux : L'homme neuronal, 1983, Raison et plaisir, 1982, Ce qui nous fait penser (a dialogue with Paul Ricœur), 1998, and L'homme de vérité, 2002. The author shows the changes in Changeux's theses, accompanying them with his philosophical and theological commentaries, critical as well as constructive. Man, his origins and structure, the human brain, self consciousness, matter and its progressive complexity, artistic sensibility, morality, religion, the question of an integral reading of Darwin and Spinoza, and the significance of discourse upon « L'homme de vérité » are the principal subjects treated. The goal of the article is an interdisciplinary dialogue between the neurosciences and theology about the understanding of the human being.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i405481<br>
Date: 12 1, 1944<br>
Author(s): Joad Jonathan<br>
Abstract: Recognizing the contingent entanglement between historiography's social and political roles and the conception of the discipline as purely factual, this essay provides a detailed analysis of "revision" and its connection to "revisionism." This analysis uses a philosophical approach that begins with the commonplaces of our understanding as expressed in dictionaries, which are compared and contrasted to display relevant confusions. The essay then turns to examining the questions posed by History and Theory's Call for Papers announcing its Theme Issue on Revision in History, and, where philosophically relevant, answers them. The issue of paradigm change proved to be quite significant and required particular attention. A "paradigm" is analyzed in terms of Quine's "web of belief," and that web is itself explained as an ongoing process of revision, in analogy with Rawls's concept of pure procedural justice. Adopting this approach helps clarify the entanglement between politics and historiographical revision.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219705<br>
Date: 1 1, 1972<br>
Author(s): Sittler Roy<br>
Abstract: Starting with Raglan's suggestion that Falstaff may be a "holy fool" and with Auden's belief that he is a comic symbol of charity, this essay explores the medieval tradition of wise fool, and especially Falstaff's always canny use of biblical allusion. His various jests, if read in relation to the political action of the main plot, reveal him as characterizing England's time of day and parodying the unchristian behavior of Hotspur, Henry, and Hal. By the time he dies mumbling Psalm xxiii to an uncomprehending Nell Quickly, there have accumulated many hints that he is, in fact, a candle to his age, a professional Fool with the heart of a faithful Lazarus, and destined to join Mowbray in Abraham's bosom. The merriment for which readers have found him lovable amid his masquerades of vice has its mysterious basis in his covertly Christian understanding of England's neo-Roman Caesars.<br>

Abstract: The frames that Lewis Carroll provided for the two Alice books have largely been ignored, when not simply dismissed, in recent Carroll criticism. Their conventional form and diction may account for this negative response, but examination of their provenance, their function within the structure of the two books, and the artistry evident in the individual frame components indicate how and why the frames are important to our understanding of Carroll's vision and purpose. The frame poems are designed to lead the reader into and away from the central dream tales through a process of lyric transformation and estrangement.<br>

Article Title: Narrating the past: History and the Novel of Memory in Postwar Spain<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219800<br>
Date: 1 1, 1963<br>
Author(s): Williams David K.<br>
Abstract: Historiography in Francoist Spain (1939-75) sought to affirm the morally and historically correct role of the regime within the flow of Spanish history. As an important vehicle of dissidence, the novel of memory stands in sharp contrast to Francoist history: it explores the past largely eschewed or appropriated by the regime and contests the so-called truths that Franco shaped through the discourse of myth. This essay examines the role of subjective memory as a challenge to historiography and discloses the narrative strategies novelists used to counter the government's myths. Unlike Francoist historiography, the novel of memory lays out history as a series of disruptions and undermines the referential illusion of truth and wholeness in our understanding of the past.<br>

Abstract: This paper challenges the common assumption that the attention which modern literary theory pays to the textual aspects of literature is achieved at the expense of humanistic and moral concerns. It starts by outlining how modern literary theory differs epistemologically from the traditional critical approaches to literature. Traditional critical theory was developed in the defense of poetry against Plato's accusations, real or imagined, and this informed both its critical practice and its concept of man. It established its epistemology on an aesthetic, moral, social, philosophical or scientific basis in a manner that encumbered literature with the concepts of man inherent in them. In contrast, modern literary theory started from a different premise: instead of seeking to justify literature and its moral relevance, it strove to identify its literariness and the dynamics of its structure by using the disciplines of semiotics and linguistics. It posited the text as an autonomous entity and a complete structure aware of its existence in a society of texts with which it conducts a profoundly intertextual dialogue. As an autonomous structure, the literary work is independent of other social or philosophical constructs and thus capable of conducting a meaningful dialogue with them. The paper elaborates the various conceptual frameworks of Russian formalism, intertextuality, structuralism and deconstruction in order to examine their implicit assumptions about man. It shows how the autonomous and dialogical nature of the literary work in its Bakhtinian sense are relevant to the concept of man inherent in modern literary theory. In its elaboration of this concept, the paper shows how it was developed in conflict with the hierarchical nature of traditional, ethical and philosophical values. It illustrates also the relevance of autonomy, self-regulation, free-play and fair representation inherent in many concepts of modern literary theory to the question of human rights. The qu~<br>

Issue: i224978<br>
Date: 12 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Adorno Robert<br>
Abstract: This paper is an advocacy for the employment of psychoanalytical concepts within sociological theorizing about the individual. Through an exposition of Freud's views on the development of intra-psychic structure and a critique of Parson's reduction of psychoanalysis to a branch of learning theory, I attempt to show that the sociological approach to the individual is implicitly behavioural and imprisoned in a series of assumptions which, among other things, treats subjectivity as epiphenomenal and identity as an unmediated reflection of some external reality. In contrast, psychoanalysis presents to us a picture of the individual as flawed and ambivalent in his relation to society, formed by but at odds with the demands of culture. In particular, the psychoanalytic concept of identification reveals that the acquisition of identity is a hard-won achievement marked by the renunciation of lost and forbidden objects. I argue, following Freud and Lacan, that the ego, far from being an agency of reason, somehow directly 'plugged into' reality, constitutes itself in the fantasied image of another and that the quality of this identification crucially affects the way the world is experienced and believed by the individual. This argument is elaborated through a discussion of Peter Berger's remarks on the social causes of identity crisis which, when set against the work of object-relations theorists on those suffering from disturbances of identity such as, for example, schizoid personalities, are shown to be both superficial and misleading. I conclude the paper by arguing that while psychoanalysis can enhance our understanding of the way in which the individual is formed by and through culture it also cautions us against making simple generalizations about the impact of culture upon the person, showing that the individual never submits himself unequivocally to its demands and interdicts.<br>

Publisher: American Oriental Society<br>
Issue: i225333<br>
Date: 12 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Feenberg Sheldon<br>
Abstract: The long-held view concerning the absence of a historical understanding in traditional India merits reconsideration on the basis of recent scholarship on the notion of history as such, the rhetorical foundations of historiography, the nature of narrativity, the character of historiography in classical antiquity, and the actual historical documents that are available from premodern India. Yet the absence of a historical-referential dimension of Sanskrit discourse remains a serious problem, one that Mīmāṃsā views on the referential sphere of the Veda may help us to understand. Mīmāṃsā makes the authority of the Veda dependent on its timelessness, and thus must empty the Veda of its historical referentiality. Since learned discourse (śāstra) in general is subject to a process of "vedicization," it adopts the Veda's putative ahistoricality; and the same set of concerns comes to inform the understanding of the genre itihāsa ("history") and the interpretation of itihāsa texts. History, consequently, seems not so much to be unknown in Sanskritic India as to be denied.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i201469<br>
Date: 9 1, 1965<br>
Author(s): Winnicott Allen<br>
Abstract: Psychoanalytic anthropologists assume that folktales often reflect unconscious beliefs and attitudes of listeners, who can tolerate anxiety-provoking images and messages (perhaps wish fulfillments) because these have been projected at a safe distance into the characters in the story. Here I argue that our theory for how such a process occurs is inadequate in terms of contemporary psychoanalytic theory. We need to reexamine a number of questions for which we may have assumed we already have answers, including the nature of repression and how it is accomplished; who or what "hears" an unconscious idea that has been collectively repressed when it is expressed in a folktale; and whether Freud's structural model of id-ego-super-ego can provide an adequate theoretical framework for understanding how unconscious ideas find their way into "expressive culture." I examine these questions in light of a folktale collected among Brazilian peasants. I conclude by questioning the central importance of the ego in repression, and propose a concept of a whole, or supraordinate, self to describe the actual agency in charge of repression.<br>

Abstract: This article draws attention to the ways in which Western psychiatric models of psychopathology applied to the so-called "Cargo cults" of Melanesia have served to endorse colonial and cultural discourses of power. It argues that while the ethnographic evidence indicates the positive and creative potential of such movements, Western assumptions concerning irrationality and the unconscious mind obscure this potential. The concept of autonomous imagination is proposed as a way of understanding these movements without pathologizing them.<br>

Date: 11 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Thompson Paul<br>
Abstract: In any field of experience anthropologists are confronted by spates of signs, many of which they fail to perceive. By way of an analysis of the mundane activities associated with riding a Songhay bush taxi in the Republic of Niger, this article probes the reflexive process through which anthropologist and ethnographic other learn to interpret the signs that comprise the discourse of social action. Having been confronted repeatedly with the signs of the other's universe, anthropologists may not only gain a new awareness of the sociocultural systems they seek to uncover but may also realize the limitations of their knowledge. Through what Dilthey called the hermeneutic, anthropologists will be more able to proceed profoundly and accurately toward an understanding of those signs that give substance and order to the complexities of social universes.

Date: 2 1, 1977<br>
Author(s): el Zein Michael<br>
Abstract: The relationships among texts, readers, and moral community are explored in order to understand the dissonance and interplay of personal and textual authority in local Islamic practice (Sunni, Shaf'i branch) among Malagasy-speaking villagers of Mayotte (Comoro Islands, East Africa). A political economy of knowledge approach is linked to an analysis of recitation as a ritual activity in which illocutionary force exceeds referential meaning. The discussion has relevance for the understanding of the relationship between religious knowledge, power, and action in Islamic societies as well as of the interface between the oral and the written more generally.

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>

Date: 2 1, 1969<br>
Author(s): Wolf Ino<br>
Abstract: Lévi-Strauss claims that the unconscious activity of mind is more important than the conscious one for understanding social phenomena and that the unconscious consists of an aggregate of forms, which are imposed on psychological and physical content. The real inspiration of Lévi-Strauss' notion is the Kantian notion of mental constraints and the postulate of isomorphism of mental and physical laws. The methodological usefulness of the unconscious as a principle of intelligibility is placed in evidence.<br>

Abstract: Many anthropologists argue that human affairs are subjective and therefore outside the realm of empirical science. While this position is based on important observations about the process of understanding human affairs, the arguments employed do not imply that the application of empirical science to the explanation of human affairs is either impossible or inappropriate, as some critics maintain.<br>

Author(s): Wood Stephen D.<br>
Abstract: Abundant and complex, Maya hieroglyphic texts serve as a crucial resource for understanding pre-Columbian narrative. This essay documents and discusses the discursive structure of Maya texts. New evidence on glyphic aspect and deixis show the presence of a "shifting now" or "alternating historical incompletive" in Classic narratives. There were two possible motivations for this pattern: to sequence events and establish textual boundaries between incompletive events and, more speculatively, to provide performance cues from hieroglyphic inscriptions.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i227576<br>
Date: 6 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Williams Anne M.<br>
Abstract: Recent narrative analysis in medical anthropology provides keys to both the personal meaning of illness and the historical, cultural, and institutional shaping of that experience. Yet Western psychiatric thinking and practice continue to view schizophrenic discourse as closed to interpretation. Caught in this "closed text," the self would seem obliterated. But using narratives of schizophrenia and homelessness, this essay proposes a different understanding of schizophrenic alterity. The openness of the text-as-experience is re-created collectively, from outside the subject's narration: the subject's "self" is construction through the added perspectives of his or her interlocutors in the role of storymakers.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i234478<br>
Date: 4 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Charlton Berthold<br>
Abstract: The poetic trope and aesthetic category of "distance" is central to Novalis's and Jean Paul Richter's definition of the Romantic, as embodied in dying sound and distant music. In the "young poetic future" proposed by the composer and critic Robert Schumann in the 1830s, romantic distance figures prominently, exemplified by the relationship between the endings of Jean Paul's Flegeljahre and Schumann's Papillons, Op. 2. Distance also provides the key for a new understanding of the relationship between analysis and poetic criticism in Schumann's review of Schubert's Great C-Major Symphony; between texted and untexted music in his Piano Sonata, Op. 11; between music and landscape in Davidsbündlertänze, Op. 6; and between the composer and his distant beloved in the Fantasie, Op. 17 and the Novelletten, Op. 21. The article presents new evidence of Schumann's reference to Beethoven's An die ferne Geliebte and Clara Wieck's Romance variée, Op. 3 in the Fantasie, and to Clara's Valses romantiques, Op. 4 in Davidsbündlertänze.<br>

Abstract: The aim of the article is to present some aspects of Paul Ricœur’s thought, especially his reflection on the servile will. Firstly I present Ricœur’s philosophy of will (in the context of phenomenology of the voluntary and involuntary) and the concept of fallibility. Then I demonstrate the main aspects of Ricœurian rethinking and enlarging of Husserl’s phenomenology what leads to hermeneutic formula: the symbol gives rise to thought. Eventually, I argue that Ricœur’s hermeneutic phenomenology creates a specified anthropological view and understanding of the human condition. This understanding will later become a part of the ‘hermeneutics of the self.’<br>

Abstract: Does hermeneutics provide a useful framework for the study and practice of public administration? Danny L. Balfour and William Mesaros argue that a shift toward the hermeneutic perspective can move public administration towards the cutting edge of social research and practice while promoting the values of mutuality, understanding, and improved communication. Hermeneutics can help the field move away from methodological debates and toward more practical, cooperative research and an enhanced focus on the substantive issues that define and energize public policy and administration.<br>

Abstract: Concern for human vulnerability seems to be at the heart of bioethical inquiry, but the concept of vulnerability is under-theorized in the bioethical literature. The aim of this article is to show why bioethics needs an adequately theorized and nuanced conception of vulnerability. We first review approaches to vulnerability in research ethics and public health ethics, and show that the bioethical literature associates vulnerability with risk of harm and exploitation, and limited capacity for autonomy. We identify some of the challenges emerging from this literature: in particular, how to reconcile universal human vulnerability with a context-sensitive analysis of specific kinds and sources of vulnerability; and how to reconcile obligations to protect vulnerable persons with obligations to respect autonomy. We then briefly survey some of the theoretical resources available within the philosophical literature to address these challenges, and to assist in understanding the conceptual connections between vulnerability and related concepts such as harm, exploitation, needs, and autonomy. We also sketch out a taxonomy of sources and kinds of vulnerability. Finally, we consider the implications for policy evaluation of making vulnerability an explicit and central focus of bioethics. Our investigation is in the form of a broad survey motivating a research agenda rather than a detailed analysis.<br>

Abstract: This article explores poetic practices of copying and recycling that follow a “cannibalistic” logic. Taking a cue from theories of literary relationality elaborated by Edward Said, Haroldo De Campos, Oswald De Andrade, Édouard Glissant, Jorge Luis Borges, and Marcus Boon, I examine innovations in the work of poets such as Mónica de la Torre, Timothy Donnelly, Terrance Hayes, Mark McMorris, Haryette Mullen, M. NourbeSe Philip, and Wendy Walker. While it is unusual to read North American poetry in connection with postcolonial and Latin American literary theory, my article's method enacts the same kind of poetic circuit that I am interested in exploring. Seeking to build on recent comparative approaches to twentieth-century poetry I argue that tracing dialogues and conceptual affinities across linguistic and regional boundaries is crucial for understanding the development of experimental poetics in the American Hemisphere.<br>

Abstract: Running through Apter's sometimes stark critique of an “entrepreneurial, bulimic” World Literature (3) is a parallel critique of the field of translation studies, both fields having become “too pluralistic, too ecumenical” while still remaining rooted in Eurocentric approaches and “unable to rework literary history through planetary cartographies” (8). World Literature and translation studies too readily take translation “to be a good thing
      en soi—under the assumption that it is a critical praxis enabling communication across languages, cultures, time periods, and disciplines” (8). Both fields, in Apter's view, have largely been blind to the recurrent realities of translation failure and the challenges of untranslatability, and so their practitioners have generally (even “inevitably”) fallen short of their cosmopolitan project of fostering international communication and understanding (7–8).<br>

Abstract: My discussion of Jabbeh Wesley's poetics is based on poems that, in my view, best demonstrate what I have already identified as the ethical thrust of her writing. Jabbeh Wesley writes in the tradition of Aristotle's understanding of tragedy discussed above. In her faithful rendition of the observed world, she imitates people's action in pleasurable language with the ultimate goal of affecting the reader. Avoiding flashy, contrived strategies, her poems operate within what Donald Revell calls the poetry of attention. They trust “the opened eye to see” (13). For Revell the “poetry of attention proceeds not by acquisition but, rather, by plain accumulation. It doesn't add up; it goes. I see the light, but seeing doesn't make it mine” (18).<br>

Abstract: There are hints here for understanding Africa though the various oceans and waters that surround Africa, but the vastness of African space overwhelms the possibility of a continuous
         longue durée. Furthermore, what of the Sahara and the great interior of Africa? Still, I think that the introduction of thelongue duréeas a historical structure might yet be useful for coming to an alternate understanding and meaning of Africa. Perhaps this angle of vision will allow scholars to understand better the internal rhythms and meaning of time in Africa and in other cultures outside of Europe. Such matters were not considered to be important dimensions of a world history. As a matter of fact, the very notion of a “world history” was coincidental with European hegemony.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Questions like this have shaped much of my own work. Being surrounded by so many enthusiastic but incompatibly articulate spokespersons for neglected lifeworld concerns, I concluded that criticism of tradition is most powerful when offered by those who are already in the midst of trying to be better phenomenologists—not, of course, in the sense that they are trying to be better members of a philosophical school but in the sense that they are motivated by the urge to find better ways to articulate something that tradition distorts or neglects. Why
      shouldaccounts of what matters most in life first be measured against the standards of “clear and distinct” propositional speech? Does anyone reallylive though life, thinking of it as a process going on inside our bodies? Do we reallyexperiencefreedom as an unconceptualizable combination of limitlessness and limit? And why throw the metaphorical wet blanket of a rigorously trained consciousness and its “correlates” over thepretheoretical practices of everyday life? Negative genuflections to philosophy's traditional priorities, privileging the subjective instead of the objective, inner instead of outer, lived body instead of house-for-the-mind—all of these inversions ultimately foster the continuing and undeserved hegemony of a traditionally objectivist understanding of what is Really Real. Kockelmans once told me that Merleau-Ponty eventually decidedPhenomenology of Perception“was not yet a philosophical book.” To be sure, its content and much of its treatment of that content is phenomenological, but its structure is still Cartesian. To start with specificallybodilyperception, however generously reconceived, still implies that other dimensions of presence to the world—linguistic, social, cultural, political, historical—can be added on at a later time, perhaps along with discussions of abstractly identified and timeless “topics” like freedom, the self, and so on.<br>

Abstract: Our keynote speakers for the 2013 meeting were Rudolf Bernet and Catherine Malabou, and we lead off this volume with their articles. Bernet's article, “The Limits of Conceptual Thinking,” is a fascinating reflection that draws on a diverse range of thinkers from Spinoza and Kant to Husserl and Heidegger to Deleuze. The centerpiece of the article stages an illuminating conversation between Heidegger and Deleuze on the nature and limits of conceptual thinking. Bernet draws out some surprising similarities in Heidegger's and Deleuze's critiques of modern, representational thinking, which turn on its objectivism, its subjectivism, and its logicism. Bernet also draws some parallels between Deleuze and Guattari's notion of philosophy as the creation of concepts and Heidegger's late work on the task of philosophical thinking. Despite his trenchant critique of modern, representational forms of conceptual thinking, Deleuze does not turn away from conceptual thinking altogether but reinterprets it as a fundamentally creative process driven by the need to respond to certain problems. Heidegger, by contrast, tends toward a more totalizing critique of conceptual thinking, though his account of the way of thinking bears some affinities to Deleuze's understanding of philosophy as the creation of concepts. Bernet argues that what ultimately explains this difference is Heidegger's and Deleuze's very different readings of early modern philosophy, specifically, Heidegger's lack of appreciation for Spinoza's anti-Cartesian understanding of concepts.<br>

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutics, moreover, challenges the central role that Husserl ascribes to intuition, especially in his early works. The call to return to the things themselves is heeded by a return to what is given in intuition. But, as Ricoeur puts it, “the Husserlian demand for the return to intuition is countered by the necessity for all understanding to be mediated by an interpretation.”
         
               In support of this claim, Ricoeur draws inspiration from Heidegger's conception of the as-structure of being, which maintains that being is always revealed in a partial manner, as this or as that.13
            
               This as-structure suggests that nothing is ever directly or fully given, and for this reason, what is given always calls for a process of interpretation enabling it to be seen as this or that. If it is the case that all givenness is perspectival and partial, Ricoeur contends that phenomenology “cannot constitute itself without a14
            hermeneutical presupposition. The hermeneutical condition of phenomenology is linked to the role ofAuslegungin the fulfillment of its philosophical project.”

Journal Title: Philosophy & Rhetoric<br>
Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: This framework also enhances our ability to answer two other questions. First, how is it that human action both imitates the past and mobilizes it as a resource for innovation? I follow Ricoeur and others in working to open what has often been thought of as a closed hermeneutic circle. Although they labored to unpack it, thinkers as formidable as Martin Heidegger and later Hans-Georg Gadamer nevertheless expressed concern that this circle was in fact the philosophical equivalent of a death spiral (Gadamer
         1998, 190–92, 265–66, 293–94; Heidegger1996, 142–43). Ricoeur hopefully proposed that the hermeneutic circle be considered “not a vicious but a healthy circle” (1984, 1:3). Ricoeur perceived the many latent possibilities in humanity's abilities to create and deploy news stories about an old past. But his work needs to be infused with a rhetorical sensibility in order to make this a convincing view. I believe that rhetorical scholars would be well served by returning to Ricoeur to explore how the rhetorical interest in judgment and action might contribute to our understanding of this “healthy” spiral.<br>

Abstract: Other contributors set out to explore the playwright's more expansive visions of health and the interconnection of corporeal and spiritual wellness. “I also expect a doctor to be an evolutionist,” Shaw wrote in
      Doctors' Delusions, and referred anyone for whom his views on medical practitioners were unclear to “read the preface to [his]Back to Methuselahuntil itisclear.”
            Taking such a cue in a slightly different direction with “An Imperfect Butlerite: Aging and Embodiment in28
         Back to Methuselah,” Glenn Clifton provides an overview of the playwright's understanding of the body within the larger context of evolution, set against the backdrop of Samuel Butler's and Henri Bergson's notions on both topics. Doing so enables him to track the body's vexed abjection through the entire cycle, arguing that Shaw's asomatous fantasizing is both apprehensive about mortality and ethically humane.<br>

Date: June 4, 2004<br>
Author(s): Stefanescu Maria<br>
Abstract: In this article, I attempt to bring together the post-structuralist, Levinas-oriented and the rhetorical-and-narratological branches of the contemporary ethical reflection on fiction and explore their respective understanding of the notion of an “implied author.” I argue that Booth's concept and its subsequent redefinitions remain fraught with ‘technical’ difficulties and prove indefensible. After reviewing discussions of the “implied author,” I compare two readings of Yann Martel's
         Life of Pito explore the relevance of the notion for the cases when one wishes to arbitrate between contrasting interpretations of the same text. I then argue that neither the rhetorical and narratological nor the Levinas-oriented ethical criticism has succeeded in rendering Booth's concept a precise and effective tool for literary interpretation. I conclude my analysis by considering the possibility that an alternative understanding of intentionality will enable practitioners of both lines of inquiry to pursue their research without needing to resort to the concept of an implied author.<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: The reevaluation and inclusion of related disciplines is essential to the growth of understanding in an interdisciplinary field such as utopian studies. Rhetorical theory fulfills the need for a functional definition of utopia in the liberal-humanist tradition. Utopists can freely borrow the terminologies of classical and contemporary rhetorical theories in ways that will make clear the rhetorical function of utopia. This cross-pollination of fields could also help to facilitate new dimensions of utopian studies: For example, twentieth-century rhetorical humanists such as Burke suggest that utopianism is a function of discourse itself. This focus on the nature of human communication and mediation is worth expanding in utopian studies.<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Joyce's distance from the Utopian stereotype seems irrefutable: Utopian placelessness is the very opposite of Joyce's insistence upon place. Joyce's dream space is Dublin, the reality of his Irish homeland, the country he said he never really left.
         News from Nowheretherefore becomes “news from Naul”
               —the Utopian nowhere is replaced by a real place. (Naul is a village not far from Dublin.) Finn Fordham proposes that76
            Finnegans Wake's language is “utopian because it is an ideal language from no place”
               —yet this language is surely as much of every place as it is of no place. It is a language that is as rooted as it is universal, even if it is rooted in Ireland's (or the Irish people's) nomadic universalism. It is, as such, a much more material language than those invented languages it appears to mock—the Esperanto of “funktas” and “fartas”77
            
               —or, for that matter, the invented language of Volapük, revisited by Joyce as “vollapluck.”78
            
               Esperanto and Volapük were both invented toward the end of the nineteenth century—the former as a language to promote international peace and understanding, the latter in response to a divine revelation. Both are missionary projects and are therefore stereotypically Utopian in that they are more focused upon their teleology than upon their historical origins; by contrast, the language of79
            Finnegans Wakeis focused upon its history, insofar as its project is to project that provenance into its dream of futurity. If Utopia is founded within the invented or imaginary, then—(as Ferns has suggested) like Wells'sModern Utopia—it cannot connect with a reality with which its alterity shares no common provenance; if, on the other hand, it is grounded in material history and elaborates that materiality into its imaginary (along with all of the pluralities and paradoxes of that reality), then, likeFinnegans Wake, it may strive to tr~<br>

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: But the emphasis on failure as a product of design, or as a consequence of somehow having arrived at the wrong style, arguably forecloses on utopian possibility in architecture. As K. G. Bristol observes, adoption of the demolition of Pruitt-Igoe as representative of the failings of modern architecture, and as a marker of its demise, has at its core “the idea that architectural design was responsible for the demise of Pruitt-Igoe.”
         
               Hiding in this insight is a contribution to sharpening an understanding of just how Utopia might be alternatively construed in architecture, shedding light on how any understanding of Utopia that begins and ends with form (with design), with representation or spatial closure alone, really must be abandoned before Utopia can make a meaningful contribution to imagining architecture and the city in all their depth. As noted earlier, Harvey has conceptualized a first step in this direction in his development of “dialectical utopianism,” which turns on the necessity for “spatial closure” to be adjoined with the equal necessity of “social process” in the proposition of any Utopia that might take a concrete form.23<br>
